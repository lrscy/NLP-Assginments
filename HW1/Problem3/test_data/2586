The nationals of Montenegro also deserve greater democracy, greater respect, greater diversity and greater legal certainty.
The main challenges to this young country are associated with the fight against organised crime and corruption, where more must and can be done.
I would ask the competent authorities to be more proactive in the fight against corruption, organised crime and the trafficking of people, arms and drugs.
In that context I welcome the firm legislative framework.
However, I would stress that the implementation of legislation in practice is a process which also requires adequate administrative and political resources.
I am still very concerned about the lack of transparency and political culture both in political and economic structures. This is preventing Montenegro from developing a democratic society and a free market.
Montenegro must do more in terms of freedom, plurality and professionalism of the media.
It must carry out the adopted reforms in full and ensure the independence of Montenegro's radio and television.
I regret the fact that there have still been no results in the investigation into the case of murdered journalist DuÅ¡ko JovanoviÄ who at the time was publishing a series of articles on organised crime in Montenegro.
Journalists and civil society play an important role in the development of democracy, in particular where they draw attention to sensitive social problems.
I would therefore ask the government to be more active in resolving these problems and to involve and consult civil society and provide them with better conditions in which to operate.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I express my warm thanks to Mr Vernola for his report and for the cooperative way in which it was dealt with in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
It is with even more gratitude, however, that I congratulate our Montenegrin counterparts and the Commission, who have once again demonstrated that a European perspective fuels the development of democracy, the rule of law and stability.
In actual fact, however, I feel that the process is advancing too slowly.
For this reason I appeal to both parties, starting with ourselves, the European institutions, to remember that Montenegro, and indeed the entire Western Balkans, is part of Europe.
It is in our own interests that lasting peace and democracy should prevail there.
We should deepen our commitment to the whole region.
Our proposal for a specific agenda for a close economic and environmental partnership with the Western Balkans should be adopted.
Let us do away with visa requirements as soon as possible.
I ask Montenegro to ensure that progress reports no longer tell, as they have told for years, of inadequate efforts to fight corruption, of organised crime and of public institutions with insufficient capacities.
It must step up its efforts to put European values into practice.
These include an atmosphere of openness in which the activity of civil society can truly flourish and in which unrestricted freedom of the media is a matter or course.
Lastly, it must take on a more prominent role as a constructive player throughout the region as well as in efforts to resolve the issue of Kosovo's status.
Perhaps it can also rethink some of the steps that have led to dependence on countries outside Europe in certain areas.
Such steps include both the signing of the bilateral immunity agreement with the United States and legislation permitting unhealthy speculation in land and property, which undermines efforts to protect the environment and prevents truly sustainable development of Montenegro's stunningly beautiful coastal region.
The recent adoption of land-use planning objectives is an important step.
Once again, then, I offer my congratulations and my encouragement for further progress on the way to membership of the European Union.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in 1918 independent Montenegro took a voluntary decision to unite with the neighbouring states of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia.
After the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Montenegrin electorate decided democratically in 2006 that they did not wish Montenegro to remain united with Serbia.
Montenegro thus became Europe's 49th independent state, a state in which most of the population are Slavs except in the regions bordering Albania and Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians predominate.
In terms of everyday politics, it is important that Montenegro should not become a haven for foreigners who want to pay less tax and launder ill-gotten gains.
Montenegro must find solutions to the problem of environmental pollution and to the plight of long-term refugees from Serbia and Kosovo.
The railways must be made serviceable again, and smuggling must be combated.
My group is pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has adopted our amendments on refugees' living and working conditions.
People who are not currently nationals of any country must not remain stateless for ever, and Montenegro must follow the relevant guideline laid down by the Council of Europe.
Our proposal on the resumption of rail services to NikÅ¡iÄ on the Bosnian border and to ShkodÃ«r in Albania has also been adopted.
Urgent measures must be taken to put an end to the neglect of the North-South rail link and to redress the imbalance caused by the decision to rely entirely on cars, buses and lorries.
We also welcome the fact that the rapporteur has not repeated the call he made in his previous report on Montenegro for the country's rapid accession to NATO.
Accession to NATO must not be imposed as a condition of future access to membership of the EU.
It is also a good thing that this report does not repeat the demand that Montenegro pursue the sort of neo-liberal economic policy which would go even further than we already have within the European Union.
Montenegro has the opportunity to become a Member State of the EU.
That is important, not only for Montenegro but also for the other states of the former Yugoslavia which likewise aspire to accession.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the rapporteur Mr Vernola rightly makes the point that Montenegro's future lies in the European Union.
But the road to European integration is not a rose-strewn path.
There is cause for alarm at the way in which the fledgling Balkan state is developing.
Montenegro may in theory be splendidly 'green' and developing ideally, but Podgorica has to sustain this over the longer term.
And current practices seem to be stubbornly entrenched.
One danger, for example, is the unstable boom in property prices on the Gold Coast around Kotor.
In addition, fast-expanding and sometimes illegal construction is placing undue strain on the country's water and sewerage systems.
Mr Vernola mentions this, but not forcefully enough for so serious a problem.
The huge potential for growth of Montenegrin tourism has its dark side too.
Whilst the tiny state's Adriatic coast is experiencing a development boom, unemployment in the north is more than 20% and poverty is above the national average.
And the legacy of the war is still apparent.
Infrastructure is minimal and in some localities the population has to contend with water and electricity shortages.
Montenegrins are still not investing productively enough in a sound economic future.
With a view to development, with a view to joining Europe, Montenegro needs a properly thought-out strategy of growth for the whole of the country.
There must be no careless action regarding a new 'European Gold Coast'.
(SL) I am pleased to support the consent given to the conclusion of a Stability and Association Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro which is one of the important, positive acts to have taken place in south-eastern Europe in recent months.
This Agreement is recognition of the work that Montenegro has done and at the same time a contractual obligation to continue work on the road to full membership in the spirit of Thessaloniki perspective.
The Agreement lays down clearly the key priorities in the political and economic fields and in other fields.
In that sense I welcome the agreement's clear relationship to development priorities in the field of tourism, environmental protection, transport and energy production.
All these priorities are closely interlinked and it is therefore also important that Montenegro carry out or bring about administrative reform through which it will be able to ensure rapid development and satisfaction of the conditions for acquiring candidate status.
I genuinely wish Montenegro success in this regard since implementation, which the speakers before me emphasised, depends on this.
I am convinced that under the Slovenian Presidency the European Union will note any progress by Montenegro in complying with its contractual obligations.
Progress by Montenegro is of course in the particular interest of south-eastern Europe and thus also of the European Union as a whole.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is much to admire about Montenegro.
The landscape is admirable, as is the way in which the separation from Serbia was conducted, both Montenegro and Serbia having acted very responsibly.
I must also express admiration for the country's policy on minorities, as a result of which minorities, by and large, tend to feel at home in Montenegro.
These and many other things certainly merit our admiration.
There are also dark sides, however, which cause me great concern and which other speakers have already mentioned.
One of these is the activity of foreign investors, particularly those from Russia.
I have nothing against Russian investment in Montenegro or any other country.
The Montenegrins must beware, however, of an imbalance that would make them dependent on a single country - and I would say the same thing about dependence on any country, not just Russia.
Some of these investments are already endangering Montenegro's natural beauty spots and its picturesque landscapes.
What continues to make me particularly sad is the prevalence of corruption, to which some Members have already referred.
We have many reports from media sources that can at least be trusted to try to report in a fairly balanced way.
The cases of massive corruption in connection with cigarette smuggling and other cases we have been reading about are things we thought had been consigned to history.
I ask the Commission to make these occurrences a priority.
If corruption were the sole criterion, we ought not to consent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement today or in the days to come.
We shall consent to it, however - and I include the Socialist Group here - because we want to help the country with its reform process.
Needless to say, however, we expect the Commission and the country itself to make every effort to eliminate corruption, which - and this is the sad thing - extends into political circles.
At least there have been widespread serious allegations of corruption on the part of politicians.
Like Mr Kacin, I wish to highlight the fact that the case of the murder of DuÅ¡ko JovanoviÄ has not yet been solved.
I wonder whether it is a mere coincidence that he and his colleagues had written a great deal about organised crime.
I hope that it is a coincidence and that there is no connection.
I certainly wish that the Montenegrin authorities would solve this case soon and would do far more to fight corruption in their own country.
(PL) Mr President, the recommendation on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and the Republic of Montenegro concerns a special situation.
For the first time we have to deal with a country that achieved independence through a referendum.
I was an observer at the first parliamentary election held in Montenegro after the referendum, as a representative of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Both the Council of Europe delegation and the OECD confirmed the democratic nature of the election.
I was fascinated by the degree of civic involvement in the observation of the election process.
Representatives of non-governmental organisations, returning officers, were present in all the electoral committees we visited.
The great commitment of the members of the electoral committees in ensuring that all procedures were complied with was clear to see.
It should also be noted that Montenegro has adopted the euro as legal tender.
Having regard to the progress made towards integration in the European Union, I support the recommendation on the conclusion of the Agreement.
It is my hope that the adaptation process will help Montenegro improve the living conditions of its inhabitants.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between the EU and the Balkans is a delicate issue partly because the biggest EU Member Sates, through their policy which amounted to a 'divide and conquer' approach, contributed significantly to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, which since the First World War had been a key stabilising factor in the area as a whole.
With the exception of Slovenia, all of these states are characterised by instability, ethnic tensions, migration issues, high levels of corruption and unemployment, a weak state and limited influence of elected parliaments.
Such an environment is a breeding ground for illegal trade and trafficking of weapons, people, drugs, alcohol and tobacco products.
In such an environment it is difficult to plan for transport, energy and economic development.
It is also difficult to protect the environment.
It should not come as a surprise to any of you that we view these phenomena, which are also prevalent in Montenegro, as pressing global issues facing the earth.
A resolution is only a weak substitute for what we should do to redeem ourselves from the guilt borne by several members for the current state of affairs in this area.
Is Parliament aware of this?
(EL) Mr President, our fellow Member Mr Vernola has given an excellent - vivid, I would say - picture of Montenegro, which is the most enchanting corner of the Balkans.
In Balkan legend, there have always been tales of this ancient kingdom, which has managed to live with five neighbouring countries.
So many neighbours!
It shares borders with Bosnia and Croatia and Serbia and Albania, and also with Kosovo, which will now perhaps be Montenegro's problem, because, from what we see in the newspapers and hear from fellow Members, Kosovo is about to declare its independence, unilaterally!
This could be a problem for Montenegro, which is now home to large numbers of Albanians.
In my view, the signature of the accession agreement, for the start of negotiations, is very positive, and will help towards the reform of public administration and judicial authority, but above all it will help to combat corruption, and I hope this same agreement will restrain whatever tendencies may emerge among the Albanian population.
(PL) Mr President, the political situation in the Balkans has been a subject of special interest to this Parliament for many years.
We are happy that, after a period of bloody conflicts, peace and cooperation between nations are now the norm in the daily life of the region.
Even the most sensitive issues, such as declarations of independence by new states, now take place, or can take place, in a manner and form complying with the highest international standards.
That is the real trend in the political development of the Balkans, a trend that creates the possibility to achieve the strategic goal of the majority of nations living in the region, namely closer cooperation with the European Union, up to and including full membership.
Montenegro is an excellent example of this trend.
After declaring independence, it maintained good relations with its nearest neighbours, including the Republic of Serbia, with which it had previously been joined in a federation.
It immediately began intensive negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which culminated in the signing of the Agreement on 15 October of this year.
In parallel, it concluded a free-trade agreement with the EU that will enter into force in January.
In the course of this short period of time, barely one and a half years, Montenegro has made appreciable progress.
The changes made in fiscal and taxation policy, and in establishing a market economy based on competition and the free movement of capital, must be seen as positive achievements.
There is still much to be done, especially in the fields of social policy and employment, energy and protection of the environment, and security and civil rights.
An effective fight against corruption and organised crime and full cooperation with the International Tribunal in the Hague are particularly important tasks facing the government of Montenegro.
Montenegro, however, is not alone in facing these problems.
Similar challenges face all Balkan countries applying for membership of the European Union.
Montenegro is one of the leaders in this process, and I would like here to express the hope that it will remain so.
The Union is prepared to welcome the Balkan countries into the community.
Whether and when that happens depends, above all, on the Balkan elite and the wisdom of Balkan politicians.
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro has made visible progress during its short existence.
The foundations have been laid for a new state and a new constitution has been adopted.
The country's economy is showing strong growth of 8% and inward investment has this year been in the order of EUR 700 million.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed and Montenegro has taken its first steps on its way to full membership of the EU.
If, however, its path to membership of the EU is to be as short and fast as possible, Podgorica should make some fundamental decisions.
It is necessary to reinforce the functioning of the rule of law and guarantee among other things an independent judiciary.
It is also necessary - with more conviction than in the past - to combat corruption and increase transparency in decision-making in political and economic structures with a view to guaranteeing the democratic and equitable functioning of the market economy.
Tourism has a fundamental significance for the economy of Montenegro.
Its sustainability must be guaranteed by adopting a unified legislative framework for the protection of the natural environment and the coastline.
Ladies and gentlemen, the accession process of Montenegro and its neighbours facilitates much greater development of regional cooperation.
I am convinced that regional cooperation in the context of CEFTA will also help to solve many political, economic and social issues in the area as a whole.
I would like to conclude my speech by inviting the Commission to help Montenegro and other Western Balkan states to develop regional cooperation, primarily in the areas of energy, transport and the environment.
(PL) Mr President, Mr Swoboda rightly referred a moment ago to the widespread corruption in Montenegro.
In support, I would like to quote figures given by Transparency International, which show that, on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 10 denotes the absence of corruption), Montenegro scores 3.3.
It is thus right at the forefront of countries where corruption is a major problem.
I would add that smuggling is also a dramatic problem for Montenegro.
In this respect the country really does have no borders.
Recently there was a proposal to prohibit smoking in public places, when at the same time, in the centre of the capital city, you can buy thousands of packets of contraband cigarettes.
In that regard Montenegro clearly has a long way to go on the road to the European Union.
On the other hand, the country must be encouraged to meet the Union's criteria as soon as possible.
I welcome the fact that, in regard to the judiciary, for example, or the functioning of the administration, there has been perceptible progress.
We have to appreciate what Montenegro has done in this field since the moment it rather unexpectedly declared its independence following a referendum.
I believe the European Union should give a clear signal that, once the relevant criteria have been met, the road to the Union will be shortened.
We have to hold out a real prospect of membership - obviously not in two, three or four years' time - but a real incentive to Montenegrin society for the increasing achievement of European standards.
(DE) Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world's most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era.
When Belgium was founded, Montenegro had already been independent for centuries and possessed the characteristics of a state.
I stress this because Montenegro is always wrongly dismissed as an example of a superfluous tiny land that suddenly found itself independent by a quirk of fate.
Let me say to Mr Markov that Montenegro was annexed by its Serbian ally after the First World War.
There was no question of voluntary union at that time.
A pro forma parliamentary vote was taken, but that was all.
There was a massive Montenegrin liberation movement, whose activities continued through the twenties and into the thirties.
Tito then restored Montenegro's independence within Yugoslavia, and under Tito's Yugoslav Constitution it had a right of secession.
When it tried to exercise that right, however, obstacles were placed in its way.
Today it is an independent country on the way to membership of the European Union.
We must support the democratic forces there.
As has already been said, its treatment of minorities is an example to many others in the region, which is why the minorities supported independence.
What it still needs, however, is a stronger system of independent education, such as that provided by the Franciscan school centre in Tuzi, near Podgorica.
Private education initiatives are needed to release the country from its rigidity.
I call on the government to keep moving vigorously along this path towards pluralism, not only in the economy but also in education and in the country's constitutional and democratic structures.
(Applause)
(PL) Mr President, there is no doubt that Montenegro is an example of positive development in the Balkans with regard to the structure of the state, the constitution, the rule of law, entry into the global market and the creation of a market economy.
Without a doubt, therefore, the European Parliament should support the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Montenegro.
At the same time, however, we must remember that Montenegro has a great deal to change and to do, especially with respect to the rule of law and the fight against corruption.
I would point out that in April 2007 Montenegro signed a bilateral agreement with the United States on exclusion from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
Unfortunately, that agreement is in contradiction with the common position and basic principles of the European Union.
The International Criminal Court is a very important institution from the viewpoint of EU policy.
The bilateral agreement therefore grated unpleasantly with the prospect of an agreement with the Union.
I do not say this in order to make the European Parliament ill disposed towards Montenegro.
On the contrary, I believe the European Commission and all the EU institutions should do a great deal at the present time to help that country prepare properly for closer relations with the European Union, especially in combating corruption, strengthening the rule of law, building a market economy and countering the black market.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the example of Montenegro shows how important a referendum can be.
I therefore understand why numerous posters calling for a referendum were held aloft in the House today, as the Treaty of Lisbon itself, of course, gives us the option of offering the European people such a referendum.
I believe it is important that the general public are involved in the consultation process and that they have the opportunity to express their wishes.
In Montenegro I believe there is also a need to improve the country's economic structures; as Mr Posselt has already indicated, the educational establishments and programmes of the European Union are particularly important in that respect.
In energy too, energy efficiency and renewables pose a huge challenge in Montenegro as well as offering unprecedented opportunities.
In the telecommunications sector too, it would be desirable for Montenegro to transpose the Roaming Directive into national law because that could, of course, contribute to better communication with our European countries at more reasonable prices.
It goes without saying that the environment is one of the key challenges, and the domain of waste management, sewage works and waste water poses a particular problem.
If we speak of magnificent unspoiled natural beauty, we have grounds for applying the latest standards there.
The European Union is offering environmental support frameworks, which should be put in place as soon as possible.
(LT) Many thanks to the rapporteur, who had the honour, in this report, of introducing a new and at the same time old European country.
After the 'velvet divorce' from Serbia, Montenegro has been given the opportunity to demonstrate the unlimited potential of a small, proud country.
On the other hand, Montenegro should lead in the development of regional cooperation, continuing to increase the rights of minorities and contributing to the conversion of the Balkan region from a barrel of gunpowder to a garden of nations.
Like the other countries whose names have only recently appeared on the map, Montenegro is facing a number of hazardous challenges: deep-rooted corruption, illegal business, the black economy, etc. It is unfortunate that some foreign investors, especially those from Russia, are attracted to this young country mainly because it offers easy ways of striking illegal financial deals.
The decision not to hand over the US workers to the International Criminal Court in exchange for military assistance undermines Montenegro's credibility as regards its willingness to cooperate peacefully with its neighbours, and even its dedication to European objectives.
Today, from the shadows of the past, Montenegro, like some of its neighbouring countries, is attracted to the prospect of becoming a member of the European Union.
The very perspective of becoming a Member State encourages the development of democracy, human rights and a better life for citizens.
The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement should put the wind of Europe in the sails of Montenegro's reforms.
The country can draw from the experience accumulated en route to achieving EU membership by their neighbour Slovenia and other countries that joined the EU in the new Millennium.
Montenegro's initiative of declaring itself an ecological republic is laudable; however, the path to achieving credible implementation could be a long one.
It is good, that the curtain of isolation surrounding visas for Montenegro and other Balkan countries has been ripped up.
The European Commission and the Council should not linger at the halfway stage, but continue to demolish this obstruction, together with financial and bureaucratic barriers, while maintaining a strong level of protection against criminals and lawbreakers.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Members for a very substantial and substantive debate and Mr Vernola for stimulating this debate.
Most Members rightly emphasised the absolute necessity of combating corruption and crime and ensuring that the rule of law is reinforced in Montenegro.
I could not agree more: the rule of law is fundamentally important for all sectors of society, underpinning the functioning of the whole society and the economy.
That is precisely why the Commission insists very much on judiciary reform early on in the pre-accession process in Montenegro, as well as in the other countries of the Western Balkans.
This is one of the most important political criteria of accession, which should be considered first and foremost.
Mr Vernola and many other Members also highlighted the importance of ecology and the environment.
The Commission is assisting this ancient kingdom to become the ecological republic in the garden of nations, as Mr Paleckis said, by strengthening the administrative capacity of Montenegro, which in turn makes the country better able to approximate its laws to ours, for instance in the field of waste management and water treatment.
However, this is also related to corruption and I want to quote from the progress report of the Commission.
'There have been no improvements in activities to curb political corruption. ...
Management of public assets raises serious concerns.
There is considerable room for corruption, especially in the cases of construction and land-use planning, privatisation, concessions and public procurement.'
This is a very serious issue and that is why Montenegro needs to address corruption as one of its first priorities.
Let me also inform the honourable Members that the Commission intends to adopt a communication early next year - probably in March - in which we will take stock of developments since Thessaloniki, and Salzburg last year, and give pointers towards the future.
One such issue will be visa liberalisation, mentioned by many of you, and rightly so.
The Commission will initiate dialogue on roadmaps towards visa-free travel, which should help the countries of the Western Balkans to make progress to meet the requirements so their citizens will no longer need visas to travel to the European Union.
But, I want to underline that this is not, as such, within the competences of the Commission but in the hands of the national governments of the European Union, and the ministries and ministers of the interior are the key players here.
Therefore let us join our forces and carry out effective lobbying of the ministers of the interior as well as of the countries concerned in the Western Balkans, because we have to be sure that all the security requirements, such as the issuing of documents and border controls, are in full order before we can move towards visa liberalisation.
Finally, I am very pleased to hear about the successful parliamentary cooperation which is taking place between the Parliament of Montenegro and the European Parliament.
I know this is very important - it is part of true political integration - and this is helping to develop institutions in Montenegro in a most welcome way.
I trust that we can work together towards reinforcing the democratic institutions and administrative capacity of Montenegro.
I am very glad that we see eye to eye on the future development of Montenegro on its road towards the European Union.
(Applause)
I have received one motion for a resolution to wind up the debate on the Commission statement.
That joint debate is closed.
The votes on the motion for a resolution and the Vernola report will be on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament I have great pleasure in expressing support for the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Montenegro.
I believe that cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Montenegro will be mutually beneficial in the future, especially through the gradual creation of a bilateral free-trade area.
I am also very pleased at the progress made by the Republic of Montenegro towards meeting the obligations imposed by the European Union.
I would, however, refer briefly to areas in which, as set out in the Commission's recommendations, Montenegro must continue its efforts if it wishes to draw closer to the European Union.
The most important task is to improve the rule of law by reforming public administration so as to strengthen institutions at all levels and effectively combat their politicisation.
I am aware of and appreciate the legislative efforts made by Montenegro in this area, but it is most important that they should gradually be given greater practical force.
The Montenegrin authorities must also achieve greater transparency in matters of budgetary control, management of public funds and tender procedures.
I believe that implementation by the Republic of Montenegro of all the European Commission's recommendations will make it possible to set the country swiftly on a direct path to accession.
1 December 2007: World AIDS Day (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on World AIDS Day, which was on 1 December 2007.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, once again we have the opportunity to discuss this serious health threat in the European Parliament.
It was only a few months ago that we had the opportunity to discuss the Community Action Plan regarding this health threat.
Our concern does not, of course, relate only to the European Community, but also to the whole world.
We are concerned with the rise of infections, with the number of people who are affected and living with HIV worldwide, and the number of 33 million people, for us, is too high.
Therefore, we want to take action within the European Union but also coordinate with all the other international players outside the EU to tackle this issue globally.
This also matches the new European Community health strategy, which includes a global role for the European Union in the area of health.
Areas we can concentrate on: first of all, to prevent infection - this is very important. At the same time, to make sure that testing is available, and treatment and care where needed.
To achieve all this, we need to raise awareness, and this is a very important factor; this is something where we are lagging behind - I will come back to that in a minute.
But also the social stigma.
This is one of our major concerns, and in a way this works as a vicious circle, because the social stigma prevents people from wanting to test themselves and learning whether they have been infected, and therefore, they could infect others.
They do not seek treatment and do not get tested, with all the negative effects.
This is more worrying among young people, and this is our main concern and target.
Our studies and polls show that, among young people, there really is a lack of knowledge - one could say there is ignorance when it comes to these health threats.
So it is important to show to them in a balanced way, in a way that presents information and on the one hand does not create panic but on the other hand does not lead to complacency, that it is a serious disease; there is no cure for it, but they can protect themselves - and they can be shown how to do that - and at the same time that they should not be afraid of fellow citizens who have the infection, who have the disease.
We have seen two extremes from the Eurobarometer.
Some young people think that there is nothing to worry about: you take some antibiotics and it goes away.
On the other hand, just by touching infected people or even sharing a glass with them or through a kiss one can catch the disease.
So we see two extreme views regarding this health threat, and neither deals effectively with our aim, which is to control the spread and further infections.
World AIDS Day is an important day and gives us an opportunity to discuss and raise awareness; but we should not limit ourselves to this one day, and that is why I am happy that, within the European Union at least, we will be discussing these issues continuously.
But when it comes to young people, we have to remind ourselves that we had very active, very effective, very aggressive campaigns in the 1980s which managed to reach the goal of raising awareness, but then we stopped and we forgot that a young generation, a new generation of young people became sexually active after the end of those campaigns.
In fact, some of them were born just before the end of those campaigns, and they did not benefit from those awareness-raising initiatives that were taking place then, and that is why we have the results I have just mentioned.
We know that, through simple messages, simple methods, role models, celebrities, opinion leaders, giving a good example and explaining the situation, we can achieve the awareness that we would like to achieve.
This year, our initiative was to propose to the health ministers of the European Union that we would all go simultaneously into schools and discuss these problems with young people on World AIDS day, to see what they know, tell them what we know, and have an exchange of views.
We had a positive response: more than half the Member State Ministers followed that approach.
We went into schools - I also went - and it was an eye-opener: the debates and discussions with young people, understanding, first of all, what they know or do not know about this disease, and also some practical problems.
They know, for example, that the use of condoms is the best protection, but at the same time, how can they get them?
They are too embarrassed or they are worried or they are shy.
So we see some practical effects that we never thought were problems, never thought we would have to face in Europe.
But they are still there.
Also, because we want to talk to young people in language that they understand, the Commission this year took the initiative of producing a new TV spot addressing the prevention of HIV transmission.
This was done through a competition among young people, and the best one chosen, the winning entry, was by a Polish student.
We produced that, and it was broadcast by several TV channels and was also used in the school visits.
This is an important strategy which we must follow: we have to talk to young people in the language they understand.
But, as I said earlier, the challenges arising from HIV and AIDS are present well beyond the European Union boundaries.
It is true that, worldwide, there has been some good progress in terms of access to HIV-related services, especially low-middle-income countries.
Now, about 95% of people infected with HIV live in those countries.
Thanks to an unprecedented increase in international funding in these countries, the number of people receiving treatment has considerably increased, from 100 000 in 2001 to 2.5 million people in 2007.
These are impressive figures; nevertheless, more than 70% of people in need of ARV treatment in these countries do not receive it or do not have access to it.
This shows that we still have a long way to go.
The European action is financed through a wide array of financial instruments both at national and global level, such as the global fund, for example.
There are also other financing mechanisms through public private partnerships.
Progress has been achieved through these joint efforts with the international community, but we still have a long way to go, and this requires strong cooperation among the European institutions.
As I said at the beginning, our principal goal is to bring the number of new HIV infections down and work towards the best possible solutions in terms of support, treatment and care for those who are already living with HIV/AIDS.
I therefore want to emphasis this once again: fighting the stigma - the social exclusion, the discrimination of the disease and people suffering from it or being affected by it - is very important and unless we do that we will never be able to control the situation.
To do that, we need to raise awareness campaigns and increase them.
This is why the motto of the European Commission in this action against AIDS is 'Remember me', because it is a forgotten disease at all levels, or at least it has become one.
We will now bring it back to the forefront; but it is not just for the citizens, to remind them of the existence of this disease, but also for the decision-makers, to make sure that they put it back at the top of the political agenda and take all the necessary actions.
In this respect I am counting - and I know I have it - on the support of the European Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, there is so much to be done.
Let me start with what the Commissioner really highlighted in his speech, which is the effect on children, because one of the campaigns that is running this year, of course, is Stop Aids in Children.
We know that every minute of every day a child is born with HIV; we know that 2.3 million children are living in our world with HIV; that only one in 10 who needs anti-retroviral treatment receives it; in the absence of treatment we know that an estimated one third of infants die in their first year and half die by their second birthday; we know that 15.2 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS; and we know that by 2010, that magical year, more than 20 million children will have been orphaned by AIDS.


That is the children's story, that is the challenge regarding children, but of course it is an adult story as well.
We know the numbers that we have in our various countries for people being diagnosed, for people living with HIV: all on the up, and the frightening statistic that one in three people do not know they are infected.
That is the challenge, but there are specific challenges I think we should highlight this year, and the Commissioner has hinted at some of them.
The level of basic knowledge has actually been going down in the last five years: the public is less aware than it was.
Myths and misunderstandings have been growing.
One in five people do not know that HIV can be transmitted through sex without a condom.
Fewer than half of all sexually active people always use a condom with a new sexual partner.
We know that the number of people diagnosed has trebled since 1997; we know that risk-taking sexual behaviour is on the increase; we know that a quarter of all HIV-related deaths are due to late diagnosis, and a third are preventable.
And, specifically, we know that failed asylum seekers living with HIV are too often not eligible for free HIV treatment and so cannot afford lifesaving care, and can go on and infect others.
We also know that the rate of HIV among male prisoners is 15 times higher than among the general population.
All those things we know, along with the knowledge we have of the hopeful signs, of research.
Recently in Rwanda I saw for myself the research, the ongoing clinical trials and the need for trials in Africa for vaccines for Africans.
But all these things need that urgency, and 2010 is the target year; 2010 is nearly with us.
2010, Commissioner: you and I come to the end of our term of office.
I want us not to hide behind that fact and leave it to our successors.
I want us to say, in 2009, when you and I may be leaving office, at least we have fulfilled this promise.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my compliments to the Commission for its efforts, which the Commissioner has just described.
I would stress today the importance of World AIDS Day and of our joint responsibility in combating this disease.
Because a disaster is unfolding worldwide, a disaster which does not get the attention it deserves.
My group thus welcomes the fact that we are having this debate today in Strasbourg.
The figures speak for themselves.
Worldwide there are 33 million people who have full-blown AIDS or are HIV-positive, and a total of 25 million people worldwide have died of the disease.
But a lot of people act as if AIDS does not exist.
Because AIDS is associated with sex, many people prefer not to talk about it.
And that makes it hard - as the Commissioner says - to educate people about AIDS.
The younger generation of today is paying a high price for that.
Half of all new HIV infections are in people under the age of 25.
In the time it takes me to say this, six more young people will have been infected with the virus and three children will have died of AIDS.
We are talking here of a generation which has not known a world without AIDS.
The disaster is not confined to Africa.
In recent years the number of HIV infections in Europe and Central Asia has doubled from 1.25 to 2.4 million.
It is high time for the European Union to do something.
This terrible disease, which destroys the lives of millions of families worldwide, is preventable.
AIDS can be fought by effective information, readier availability of condoms, and affordable drugs.
The Commissioner rightly points out that we have allowed AIDS to become a forgotten disease on our own continent.
Europe's youngsters of today were not around for the big public awareness campaigns of the 1990s.
We must act vigorously if we do not want things to get out of hand here.
So, partly as a symbolic act and partly because we think it is a really important initiative, my group launched a campaign last month to get the tax on condoms reduced to 5% throughout the European Union.
The fact that the rate of VAT on condoms varies so widely - in some countries it is as much as 25% - shows that we do not in Europe have a shared approach to this shared problem, or at least that we are not doing enough about it.
The Portuguese Presidency has given solid backing to our campaign and we hope for a positive endorsement from Commissioner KovÃ¡cs too when he launches the debate on the European VAT system at the end of next year.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Yours for ever, AIDS' were the words I read on a poster for World AIDS Day, which took place almost two weeks ago.
The message was that AIDS is treatable but not curable.
Many people, especially younger people, lose sight of that or choose to ignore it.
The infection rates, to which previous speakers have referred, speak for themselves.
Education is the only way to prevent HIV and AIDS, and I am pleased that the Commission subscribes to that view.
Education, however, must not be confined to poster campaigns or visits to schools by government ministers.
These things attract brief attention and may catch the eye of the media too, but they do not modify behaviour patterns, especially among young people.
AIDS and HIV were once the stuff of real-life horror stories in the press.
Many people felt insecure and afraid because nobody knew how dangerous the virus really was.
I have no wish to return to those days, but with the existence of HIV/AIDS having become a fact of life and treatments having become safer, the problem no longer automatically captures the same level of public attention today.
Many people have become accustomed to these messages, and some are even tired of hearing and seeing them.
That is irrational, but it is a fact.
Education must be adapted to take account of these changed circumstances.
Education must be designed to reach out and capture people's attention, to address tailored messages to specific target groups in their own vernacular.
There are young people out there who misinterpret HIV as a negligible risk, and it is particularly important that we engage with them on their own cognitive ground and prompt them to think about the consequences of infection.
Many people still do think about the consequences, but unfortunately they start too late, namely when a doctor or social worker tells them they have tested positive.
Then the disease, which has hitherto been a dim and distant concept, suddenly becomes very real.
Only if we manage to make people think about HIV before it is too late shall we have made any progress.
Patient long-term efforts will be needed to achieve that goal.
There must be facilities, services and projects designed for target groups - the more differentiated and the closer to personal experience they are, the better they will be.
The organised AIDS charities, such as the AIDS-Hilfe associations in Germany, can continue to play an important role here if they rise to this new challenge.
That, unfortunately, is not happening everywhere.
Those who are HIV-positive today have a good chance of a long life, in western Europe at least.
In other parts of the world, such as Africa, it is a different matter.
This comfortable situation of ours, however, should not breed complacency.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a doctor who has been working with AIDS for twenty years and I have to say that, frankly, I would have expected much more detailed and pragmatic proposals from the Commission.
In the European Union, sexual relations are the main channel of transmission.
To be more specific:
1) Is the Commission urging all the Member States to organise sex education classes in schools?
2) Is it urging Member States to introduce price controls on condoms which are at present the only way of blocking sexual transmission?
In Europe the second main channel of transmission is intravenous, especially among those using drugs.
What, then, is the Commission doing to urge Member States to implement damage limitation strategies which are the only way in which intravenous transmission can be reduced among those who are unable, cannot or do not want to give up drugs?
As regards the rest of the world, I would have expected the Commission to come here and tell us: after eight months of deadlock with Parliament, we note that Parliament has voted to amend Article 6 of the TRIPS Agreement and, while that that has not led to any amendment, the Commission is committed to fighting to amend the WTO rules.
At present, the TRIPS rules allow multinationals to hold patents for twenty year with the result that drugs do not get to Africa.
We have heard absolutely nothing about that!
If those rules are not changed, speaking of Africa is no more than hot air!
Lastly, how is it possible, when everyone is talking about the fight against AIDS, that you have Commissioner Mandelson writing letters to the Thai Government asking it not to pass laws making it possible to distribute generics and, in his letters, sponsoring and naming companies such as Sanofi-Avensis?
In my view, the Commission should have something to say about that!
(FR) Mr President, yes, AIDS has claimed too many victims - far too many.
It continues to claim them and will claim many more.
Tragically, many children will be infected before birth.
We have heard the figures, they are frightening, and I do not intend to go through them again.
Sadly, the spread of AIDS is continuing not only in the EU Member States but in non-member countries too, and to fight this new wave of the epidemic it is essential that we step up preventive action, provide more treatment, care and support and forge the partnerships that are absolutely vital to the effort.
Alongside prevention we need to improve access to information, and make it easier for people to obtain advice, treatment and social services.
We need to mitigate the negative impact of this disease - one of saddest aspects being that it is a taboo condition, something people dare not discuss freely.
To achieve all this, we need to mobilise available resources and focus research, coordinate our efforts and fund specific projects.
Only if everyone concerned works together in constructive partnership can we make a significant and lasting contribution to stemming this epidemic.
One striking thing is the fact that today's young Europeans have never experienced the type of effective prevention campaigns that were run in the 1980s.
European societies need to shoulder their responsibility here and get the essential information about HIV and AIDS across to young people.
The most recent surveys show an astonishing level of ignorance about the disease among the young.
54% of young people in the 'old' EU Member States believe HIV can be contracted by drinking from the same glass as an infected person.
That shows how vital it is to improve awareness and to invest in prevention and in information about the use of condoms.
The cost of condoms is another issue that needs to be addressed.
The survey findings also show that we cannot relax our efforts; we cannot overlook what is no longer a 'new' disease.
In raising awareness, we need to deliver the right messages - messages better tailored to their audience.
Efforts are currently under way on this front.
The messages we put across need to be more up-to-date and they need to make a real impression on young people.
Until recently and largely for ethical reasons, it was left, in the main, to patients to seek advice and to request HIV testing.
In retrospect we can now identify two problems with that approach: firstly, the availability of services was poor and, secondly, people were afraid of being stigmatised and discriminated against.
In low-income countries the fact that testing is voluntary is a serious obstacle to combating the AIDS pandemic.
How can disadvantaged, poorly educated patients be expected to give informed consent?
How can a person who has never heard of HIV consent to being tested for it?
And what benefit does an individual derive from taking an HIV test in a country that has no social protection system?
Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa show that only 12% of men and 10% of women have had the test and received results.
This disease is an ongoing threat and we must not lower our guard against it!
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS remains one of the great plagues of the 21st century despite the international community's exceptional efforts to combat it over the last 20 years, albeit with occasional periods of slackening.
Number 6 on the list of UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in September 2000, is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of AIDS by 2015.
However, the current situation in developing countries - and particularly in Africa where the death rate from AIDS is still rising - demands that we redouble our efforts if we are to achieve that target.
There are several potential avenues for European action here.
Firstly, we can strengthen cooperation arrangements, particularly with local authorities in the southern hemisphere because it is only at local level that lasting solutions can be found with regard to caring for sufferers, preventing the disease, supplying medicines, running information and prevention campaigns, and generally managing health services so that they meet local people's needs.
Secondly, we must find ways of tackling the shortage of health professionals in low-income countries.
Europe needs to step in here with practical, properly funded programmes to enable health professionals to do the work they were trained for in their own countries, under proper conditions and within proper structures, with the necessary equipment and medicines.
Lastly, combating AIDS in the long term will require a firm commitment to give patients in developing countries access to the medicines they need at prices they can afford.
Given that many AIDS patients in the southern hemisphere have already developed resistance to the first-generation drugs they have been treated with, it is essential to find ways of making the latest treatments available in generic form in low-income countries.
For that reason I would ask the Commission specifically to ensure that bilateral and regional agreements currently being negotiated - especially EPAs - do not include any provisions that might make it harder for southern hemisphere countries to use all the flexibility available under the TRIPs agreement and the 2001 Doha Declaration for the purpose of protecting AIDS patients.
I have no more to say.
The unacceptable situation of millions of people dying of AIDS every year demands that the European Union face up to its responsibilities.
It is time to stop talking and to get to work.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I shall be brief, because I understand we are under pressure of time.
I just wish to make three or four points.
Firstly, this is a problem that affects the whole population and this is the message we try to convey.
It is no longer a question of risk groups and that the rest of us need not worry: it is an issue for the general population - young people, women.
We must raise awareness about this, and the political message has to go through as well.
In particular - because it was mentioned - on the issue of immigrants we take a particular approach.
The Portuguese Presidency had the issues of health and immigration as a theme of its Presidency, and access to treatment, testing and treatment and healthcare of the immigrants - even undocumented ones - is an important aspect.
This is something we are discussing not only for their protection and the human rights aspect of it, which, of course, is a priority, but also for the protection of society as a whole.
The issues that were raised, such as the possibility of the exchange of needles for drug-users, promoting condoms, sexual education in schools, the problems in prisons, are all part of our discussions with the Member States and the civil society.
We have a think-tank where everybody is involved: they have discussions and exchange best practice and experiences.
But, of course, within the European Union we realise that we do not have the competence: it is the responsibility of the Member States to implement these policies.
Therefore, we raise the profile at a political level, we hold discussions at technical level but, at the end of the day, it the responsibility of the Member States to take specific initiatives.
On the other issues raised by Mr Agnoletto, I have taken note with great interest of the issue of TRIPS.
I have noted that and also the effect it would have on access to medicine in developing countries and all the other issues he raised concerning dealing with countries outside Europe.
I will raise them with my colleagues who are responsible for these particular areas and I will inform them of the points raised by the honourable Member.
Finally, when it comes to access to ARV within the European Union, initially - and then hopefully we can extend it to other areas - we are supporting very actively the initiative of the German Presidency after the Bremen Conference to achieve access to cheap and affordable ARV treatment for all patients and those who need it.
We already have, if one can call it that, a first success story with Bulgaria.
But, of course, we will pursue it in the Presidency, with the support of the Commission, and hopefully once the model is established we can extend this approach outside the European Union.
We always have this as a target.
Once again, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate and I have taken note of all the issues raised.
The debate is closed.
Shipping disaster in the Sea of Asov/Black Sea and the subsequent oil pollution (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the shipping disaster in the Sea of Asov/Black Sea and the subsequent oil pollution.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my colleague Mr Dimas regrets not being able to be here today for this debate but, as you know, he is at the global warming conference and he has to represent the Community there.
This is a very important issue.
We know that heavy storms in the Black Sea region in November caused a tragic loss of life and property and of course damage to the environment, with an estimated leakage of 1 300 tons of fuel oil and the sinking of ships carrying sulphur.
Under a bilateral agreement, the Commission sent a team of five EU experts, who were joined by representatives of the Commission and the UN Environment Programme.
The EU experts found Ukrainian clear-up operations well underway.
Locally available technologies and resources were considered sufficient, and Ukraine expressed no need for additional emergency equipment.
The key results of the mission will be presented to the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev on 14 December.
During that meeting discussions will also focus on further strengthening cooperation with regard to improvements in the monitoring of the environmental quality of the Black Sea.
According to international oil spill statistics, the current oil spill can be considered of medium size and is not expected to be a major environmental disaster.
Of course, that does not mean that we are not just as concerned, in particular because there is always the possibility of secondary pollution.
The density of the environmental pressures, the presence of sensitive species in the strait, the political sensitivity of the area and the risk of further, similar accidents in the future all underline the need to assess the situation in a more comprehensive manner.
The European Commission is therefore considering follow-up through other instruments such as post-damage assessment missions, so I am looking forward to the debate on this issue.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's opportunity to discuss last month's Black Sea disaster is very welcome, for at least two reasons.
The first is that, with respect to many countries, including Russia, the European Parliament has a role to play as a substitute for public opinion.
Imagine what would happen in the European mass media if a similar disaster occurred, let us say, in the Baltic.
The television would regale us with pictures of damaged flora and fauna for days on end.
We would be subject to an onslaught of experts explaining the ominous effects of the disaster.
In Russia, however, the media are silent.
Only with great difficulty was I able to gather a few scraps of information, mainly from Ukrainian sources.
Our voice, therefore, is exceptionally important in this matter.
The second reason is what I would call broadening our European awareness: the awareness that regions to which we have hitherto paid little or no attention, like the Black Sea, are an integral part of our continent, not only in the geographical sense but in terms of nature, ecology, economics and culture - the awareness that we are parts of a common whole and that those parts affect each other.
Such awareness should increase our sense of responsibility, which should also extend to the Black Sea region.
Our responsibility entitles us to demand that the Black Sea basin be made much safer than hitherto.
It should be mentioned in passing that disasters on a smaller scale have occurred several times in the recent past.
In this respect the following demands are particularly important.
First and foremost, monitoring of the situation in the Black Sea - both now, barely a month after the disaster, and much later on.
The next demand is to get the European Union's neighbouring countries, at long last, to begin modernising their fleets, especially their tankers.
The Black Sea is turning blacker and blacker, not from the natural causes to which it owes its name but from the colour of crude oil.
It could become one huge oil container.
Pressure must be brought to bear on the EU's neighbouring countries to impose a swift ban on the use of obsolete single hull tankers.
I therefore ask the House to adopt the motion for a resolution that has been tabled, in which we call on the Council and Commission to step up cooperation with non-EU riparian states.
A land border can be closed relatively easily, but a sea border cannot.
As we shall not be building dams, the action proposed is also in our own interests.
on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) Mr. President, following the recent violent storms in the Black Sea, four ships sank and seven were damaged, among which there were two oil tankers.
The accidents happened in the Kerch strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov and represents the main route for the export of Russian oil to Europe.
2,000 tons of fuel oil spilled into the sea and the ships that sank were carrying over 7 tons of sulphur.
The Community Civil Protection Mechanism sent a team of 7 experts to the field to evaluate the effects and identify the necessary actions.
As rapporteur for the endorsement of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament regarding the Commission's Communication on the Black Sea Synergy, I asked the Union to become a leader in promoting the principles of the common maritime policy and developing maritime transport routes in this region.
The legislative package on maritime transport is important for the Black Sea region.
The Directive regarding port control and Directive 65/2005 on port security will increase the maritime transport safety in the region.
In 2006, under the Black Sea Memorandum of Understanding, over 4,650 inspections of ships belonging to 83 flags were performed.
Following the inspections carried out by the authorities of Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine, it was found that 69.39% of the ships had deficiencies, and approximately 6% of them were retained.
Out of the total retained ships, 8.7% were cargo ships, 2.9% passenger ships, 2.7% ships carrying chemical substance and 0.5% oil tankers.
These retentions were due to deficiencies in the systems for navigation safety, absence of rescue equipment and flaws of equipment and structures providing ship stability.
Also, the countries bordering the Black Sea, such as Georgia, are on the black list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the other 5 countries bordering the Black Sea are on the grey list.
I think that the Union should do more to increase the maritime transport safety in the region.
The European Maritime Safety Agency, together with the Secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding and the Member States, will finance studies and programmes to increase the maritime transport safety.
As of 2007, the agency will support Member States, by providing assistance, to prepare capabilities for preventing and combating sea pollution with toxic substances.
Through the TEN-T budget, the Commission has already created projects for the development of maritime routes in the region of the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the seas situated in Western Europe.
I request that the Commission carry out a similar study for the Black Sea region as well and I also request the use of the CleanSeaNet service, developed by the agency, which allows the detection of oil spill and surveillance in European waters, in the Black Sea region as well.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner.
First of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who tabled the motion for a resolution on the issue under debate on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Politically, though, I would like a much quicker reaction than merely emphasising the need for the Council not to delay in adopting a position on the seven legislative proposals in the third maritime safety package.
In my view, this solves nothing in the ecologically dangerous internal seas, such as the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, which are surrounded by both EU Member States and the Russian state, as a coastal state.
In view of the level of oil prices and the profit levels involved, Russia's oil exports by sea will grow very quickly in the future.
This corresponds to Russia's transport policy: to export oil via its own country's ports, while at the same time keeping the pipelines in the EU oil terminals at Ventspils and BÅ«tingshut.
Can we expect an increase in demand for these tankers, and will Russia's fleet of tankers receive the necessary investment to avoid further use of single-hull, 40-year-old tankers and vessels designed for river use?
I think not.
The basic motivation for potential oil transport by sea will be wrecks that are as cheap as possible.
I believe that if stringent maritime safety measures are maintained only in the European Union, this will not save the environment in the seas adjoining it unless it can bring in international standards.
Thank you.
(HU) We have seen explosive growth in many areas in recent decades, but nothing compares with the growth that has taken place in global trade and, in connection with this, the transportation of goods.
Sea transportation has played a prominent role in this explosion, since 90% of the European Union's external trade is in this area.
Since this is the biggest method of transportation, I feel that people are right to expect that this means of transporting people and goods should also be safe and clean, so that the risk of accidents occurring at sea and pollution caused by ships falls.
Over the last month three grave disasters have occurred, the total scale of which is the same as the Exxon Valdez pollution of 1989, so this must have a sobering effect.
Attention must be drawn to the importance of prevention and effective measures.
The environmental damage caused by accidents like this does not stop at the borders of a country or two, or of a continent, but endangers and will ultimately destroy irrevocably our common values and our common natural treasures.
There is therefore an urgent need for more effective international coordination than there is now, and to play a serious role in active prevention and in remedial work after accidents.
It is also necessary to review the international legislation in this area without delay, to fill in the gaps, to prohibit ships designed for river traffic from going to sea, and to enforce effectively the 'polluter pays' principle.
It is the overriding duty of the European Union to press for measures aimed at safe sea shipping at international level, as has already happened in the European Union.
Thank you.
(RO) Mr. President, the incident in November caused ecological damage both to the Black Sea, and to the Sea of Azov, proving that sea waters have no borders and oil spills caused by accidents that happen outside the European space may also affect the coastal ecosystems of the Member States.
The sunk ships that caused the pollution of the Black Sea were designed for inland water navigation and not for sea navigation, thus causing the spillage of tons of oil into the sea and affecting the natural habitats of the sea.
Over 15,000 birds and dolphins were covered in fuel oil and several rare species of flora and fauna, from the Black Sea coast and bottom, were destroyed, requiring significant efforts in order to recover the integrity of the Black Sea ecosystem.
The degradation of aquatic life is full of negative consequences, since it influences the ecological security and the quality of life and health of the population.
The acute reduction of the Black Sea biodiversity is worrying due to the continuous degradation of the ecosystem, illegal fishing and overexploitation of natural resources, and oil spills contribute to the worsening of the environmental condition in this region, which is deemed the most polluted in the world.
The European Union Heads of State and Government have undertaken the commitment to stop the reduction of biodiversity by 2010, and these objectives must be achieved in the sea sector as well.
In the European Union, we have to make sure that maritime transport is carried out under conditions of safety, and sea borders are protected as efficiently as possible from cross-border threats.
Moreover, the new Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes aims at a better implementation of the "polluter paysâ principle and I hope it will have a positive influence on the methods to prevent this type of ecological disaster.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, The Black Sea is not only an external border of the European Union after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania but also a sea of huge economic potential for the development of our Union.
If we take the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea as a single region, its market has a foreign trade potential worth over 200 million Euro and a population exceeding 350 million.
Let me briefly recall the debate in September in the wake of the big floods and fires in Europe.
Then we discussed the need for the establishment of joint forces to help Member States cope with natural disasters like those which struck us this year.
A similar need could be identified now in the Black Sea region.
First and foremost, I appeal to the European Commission and, of course, the Member States, especially Bulgaria and Romania, to launch priority study of the need for a regional rescue centre for the Black Sea region to help countries cope with serious situations like the one we witnessed a few months ago.
Secondly, a thorough analysis should be made of the root causes of these disasters and all other disasters in the Black Sea region so that to learn the lessons and give recommendations for our policy in the region.
Thirdly, it is time to set up a regional navigation information centre for the Black Sea, which will contribute to the security of transport routes and, generally, navigation in the region.
The tragedy in the Strait of Kerch is something we have to live and cope with within the shortest possible time limits, especially those of us who border on the Black Sea region.
But let us use the occasion of this tragedy to seek both reasons and opportunities for cooperation among the Member States, the Commission and the other countries bordering the Black Sea so that to enhance the security of this important European route.
Thank you.
(RO) Ladies and Gentlemen, as rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I welcome the initiation of this debate, but I also deeply regret the fact that the theme of our discussion is, in reality, a sad acknowledgment of the fact that the Black Sea is still not subject to necessary attention from the European Union and a satisfactory level of implementation of the planned actions.
Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that, since Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union, the Black Sea has become a partially internal sea and we cannot ignore its strategic importance for the entire world.
The Black Sea region is of major importance from the point of view of the European Union energy policy and transport policy.
Therefore, this forces us to develop a global and coherent strategy for the entire region, a strategy that would aim at ensuring security, sustainable development and thorough integration of environmental protection aspects.
More than that, in order to promote a veritable policy at regional level, joint efforts are required from all countries bordering the sea, which would exceed the national and bilateral framework.
Thus, I welcome the 2007 launching of the Black Sea Synergy, but I reiterate an essential aspect from my report, namely the need to take concrete and firm steps in order to develop and achieve this cooperation initiative, both within the region and between the region and the European Union.
The 11 November 2007 black tide tragedy has proved to us that, in this field, we need to combine our efforts.
The European Union has to play a central role entirely, both through increased involvement in the Black Sea Synergy development and by encouraging its neighbours and partners in this direction.
This is the only way in which we will be able to respond efficiently to the expectations and calls of our citizens who face the direct consequences of the 11 November disaster today.
(BG) First and foremost, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has come up with this opinion.
This debate comes to show that the Black Sea is now the focal point of European politics and European politicians.
I commend this approach and believe that it would benefit all citizens of the European Union.
As mentioned earlier, a lot more should be done to protect the Black Sea region.
The point is how to prevent disasters like the one which happened in the Strait of Kerch.
Because disasters can never be fully prevented but their root cause can certainly be minimized.
There are two ways to ensure better protection of our seas.
Fist, we have to contunue the promotion of regional cooperation.
Second, side by side with regional cooperation, better policies are needed in navigation.
The measures suggested in the third package of the maritime policy are in the right direction and they should be implemented in the best possible manner.
Their implementation is indispensable for the prevention of events like the one in the Strait of Kerch in the Black Sea region.
Since the European Parliament and the Commission expressed their support for the package of measures quite some time ago, it is time for the Council to become more active and undertake the necessary steps for the introduction of this package.
The successful implementation of the measures envisaged in the package, coupled with the enhanced level of regional cooperation, for instance the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the DABLAS initiative for protection of the environment. Could be an important contribution to the security of our seas and, at the same time, could ensure higher competitiveness of our navigation industry.
I believe that this disaster proves once again the importance of the issue related to our water basisns and the need for appropriate policies to prevent such accidents and to protect the environment.
Therefore I believe that the time has really come for the third package of measures within the framework of the maritime policy to become a reality and enter into force.
Thank you.
(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to explain why we are tabling this motion for a resolution on the shipwrecks in the Kerch Strait in the Black Sea.
Our solidarity goes to the victims of that disaster!
We invite the Council and the Commission carefully to monitor the situation in the Black Sea and to take concrete measures to help to reduce the ecological impact of the disaster.
Europe does not yet have the panoply of regulations needed to prevent any repetition of very serious accidents along the lines of the Black Sea accident; among other things, those regulations must make states responsible for the safety of the vessels flying their flags and for prosecuting, including through civil proceedings, those responsible for such environmental disasters.
Although the European Parliament adopted the third maritime safety package at first reading in April 2007, it has not yet been fully approved by and is inexplicably blocked in the Council, despite the commitment that the Portuguese Presidency gave in this respect to the Transport Committee and Parliament.
The package, consisting of seven reports, is a comprehensive package: it steps up maritime safety standards, safeguards passengers, limits environmental damage in the event of accidents, and sets out obligations and responsibilities on the part of states, carriers and ship-owners.
Breaking up the debate and giving priority to some aspects and not others is proof that the Council does not want to tackle the issue of safety in a serious way and wants to put a brake on the package as a whole.
Maritime safety is too important an issue to be the subject of tactics, too serious because of the events that have already taken place: Erika, Prestige, more recently Segesta Jet in the Strait of Messina and Sea Diamond in Santorini!
Because of the accidents that have already happened and because increasing maritime traffic in Europe and the world could well increase the risks in future.
It is for that reason that the European Parliament considers that all seven of the proposals must be taken forward as soon as possible, before there is another environmental disaster with human losses: to harmonise types of classification, to compel states to monitor vessels flying their flags, to ensure that vessels are inspected in ports and to monitor their movements, to decide what action should be taken in the event of accidents and to monitor and manage responsibilities as regards both third parties and passengers.
We therefore urge the Council not to turn a blind eye to this tragic warning from the Black Sea.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a few points.
First of all regarding Russia, a point raised by various Members.
I would like to begin by saying that the Community civil protection mechanism can be activated only upon a request by an affected country.
Official letters offering assistance were sent both to Ukraine and the Russian Federation and, while Ukraine answered positively, requesting assistance, Russia declined the offer.
But on the general issue of maritime safety, my colleague Vice-President Barrot wrote on 10 December to his colleague Mr Levitin, who is the Russian Minister of Transport, to raise these concerns and to stress the importance of strengthened EU-Russia cooperation in the Black Sea as well as the Baltic Sea - in order to improve maritime safety.
Addressing maritime environment problems at regional level is one of the cornerstones of the European Union's marine strategy and the proposed Marine Strategy Directive, for which a second reading agreement between the Council and Parliament has been reached.
I think this is a very positive development.
The Commission has set out its views on a strategy in the region in its communication 'Black Sea synergy - a new regional cooperation initiative'.
The proposal puts forward an initiative that would focus political attention at the regional level.
The recent accidents in the Black Sea have notably involved a special category of vessels, the so-called sea/river oil tankers, which can only sail in open seas under certain restrictions.
More generally the Commission is concerned by the possibility that this category of vessels will trade in other sea areas of the European Union or neighbouring the European Union, and in particular the Baltic Sea.
Within the EU we have strict rules on maritime safety and the condition of the vessels, but we are also concerned about what happens in international waters both because it could easily affect the European Union and because we are concerned about the global environment.
That is why these accidents also demonstrate the importance of maintaining pressure on maritime safety issues both at EU and at international level.
In this respect, as pointed out by Parliament and by Members already, it is important that examination of the seven proposals of the Third Maritime Safety Package is accelerated.
Finally, on the issue of response, the Commission is also committed to continually strengthening the Community response instruments, such as the civil protection mechanism, to ensure a rapid and effective response should such disasters occur again in the future.
This also involves cooperation with the EU's neighbours such as the Black Sea countries and of course other third countries.
I would like to thank Members for the debate and of course I will talk to my colleague about the interesting points you have made.
I have received one motion for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2)/108(5) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.

Deposit-guarantee schemes (debate)
The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on deposit-guarantee schemes.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to present a report to you today that was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Before the vote in committee, the future of deposit-guarantee schemes was the subject of intense debate, particularly in the light of specific regional problems at the present time and of the recent crisis in the US property market.
At the end of 2006 the Commission presented a communication reviewing the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes.
Before drafting the communication, the Commission conducted a consultation process.
On the basis of the empirical findings that emerged, we can conclude that the aims of the directive have essentially been achieved and that there is no need for any legislative intervention at the present time.
The increasingly cross-border nature of financial market structures in Europe, however, requires us to focus more sharply on the question of cooperation between the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe.
In its communication, the Commission identified the areas in which self-regulation measures or different treatment of the legal bases could bring about further improvements in the interests of consumers.
This approach should, in our view, be pursued further.
We believe that the dynamic discussion process involving the Commission, the Member States and the EFDI, the European Forum of Deposit Insurers, has a very useful role to play in enabling us to adapt as quickly as possible to changing circumstances.
The Nordea problem does not warrant calling for an expensive new amendment of the directive at the present moment.
I am therefore grateful to the Commission for making it crystal-clear that the Nordea problem, which is essentially about the reimbursement of contributions, must be resolved by the Member States.
Those who operate the deposit-guarantee schemes in the Scandinavian countries and the supervisory authorities there must decide for themselves whether contributions are to be reimbursed or whether deposit guarantees in those countries should be treated like insurance policies and not give rise to refund entitlements.
That is a fundamental problem, but it is a fundamental problem for the Member States.
The report can basically be divided into three parts.
The first part is a discussion of the study undertaken by the Commission and the adoption of a position on its findings, such as the amount of the minimum guarantee.
The second part addresses the question whether or not the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe cause unacceptable distortions of competition.
The third part deals with future crisis and risk management.
On the first part of my report I intend to be very brief, since it proved largely non-contentious and reflects the findings of the consultation process on deposit-guarantee schemes.
I believe our statement on the minimum coverage level, which should be adjusted for inflation when the directive is next revised, strikes a balance between the interests of the new Member States and those of the older ones.
I should like to emphasise that every Member State and every deposit guarantor already has the option of exceeding the European minimum when guaranteeing deposits.
Another important point that is reflected in the report is the examination of the question whether the diverse deposit-guarantee systems and the various methods used to fund them are distorting competition.
The Commission has set out its views and presented a study which, if its recommendations were implemented, would result in a harmonisation of funding for individual Member States.
If Member States with ex post systems were now to be asked to carry out a complete restructuring of their deposit-guarantee schemes at great expense, it would be necessary to analyse whether the diversity of the schemes and the accompanying unacceptable and expensive market distortions are at all justifiable in the internal market.
This has not yet been analysed, and such an analysis will be an important task for the future.
The third part of the report examines risk and crisis management.
The internal market and the increasing degree of cross-border interdependence require us to examine whether cross-border risk and crisis management works smoothly.
There is an urgent need for in-depth discussions with all stakeholders.
Long-standing issues such as the problem of free riders and the risk of moral hazard must be addressed in that context.
I believe that empirical studies analysing crisis and risk management are imperative if we are to work out viable arrangements for burden-sharing in the event of cross-border crises and common methods for early risk detection or develop a system for the introduction of risk-based contributions.
These studies should then determine the content of subsequent discussions.
Against this background I also flatly reject the PSE amendment, which postulates existing market distortions although there is currently no evidence of these.
We believe that the present process is the right approach.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would first like to warmly thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Christian Ehler, for supporting the policy set out in our communication.
I fully endorse your view that legislative proposals are not appropriate at this stage.
Some issues can be improved through set regulation without major cost impacts and by working together with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI).
The recent financial turmoil provides evidence that maintaining deposits or confidence is crucial during a financial crisis.
As to deposit guarantee schemes, two elements seem to be key - an appropriate coverage level and a short payout delay.
If depositors know that their deposit will be covered and if they feel confident that the insured deposits will be reimbursed rapidly, there is no need for them to join any queue outside a bank.
The existing directive has proven to be flexible and allows Member States to increase coverage according to their own economic situation.
Member States may take immediate action if their coverage level proves to be inappropriate.
The timely payout of insurer deposits can indeed be improved.
According to the directive, reimbursements should normally not exceed three months, but this reflects the technology available back in 1994.
This is why we have asked the EFDI to identify obstacles to a rapid payout.
Depositors must also be made aware of the protection available to them.
The existing information obligations in the directive are applied differently across Europe.
Therefore, we have asked the EFDI to identify best practices to improve the dissemination of such information to depositors.
With regard to cross-border crisis, I share Parliament's view on the need to have clarity about burden-sharing and the interactions between all involved parties before such a crisis occurs.
The ECOFIN conclusions of 9 October are clear on this point.
I have noted the suggestion that the EFDI participate in general burden-sharing discussions.
Let me underline that only very few schemes have powers which go beyond the mere reimbursement of depositors.
Their funds will also only cover a fraction of the amounts involved in a larger cross-border crisis.
Therefore, I am unable to support the suggestion to include the EFDI in general burden-sharing discussions.
The report also stresses the importance of eliminating possible market distortions.
As requested, we will examine this matter.
However, currently we do not think that the high cost of fully harmonising the present regulatory framework, estimated at between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 4.5 billion, would be justified.
Some level-playing-field issues are already being dealt with.
For instance, we need to facilitate topping up, where a branch should be able to offer a level of protection in a host country that is higher than in its home country.
However, sometimes, arrangements between schemes in different Member States have not worked in practice, and we support the EFDI's efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement.
Some Member States already adjust the contributions through their schemes according to the individual risk of banks.
We would like to assist interested Member States, as this would contribute towards a level playing field for banks with similar risk profiles.
In conclusion, Europe needs deposit guarantee schemes that ensure depositor confidence in a financial crisis.
With the envisaged improvements, I am confident that we will come closer to this objective.
Madam President, first I would like to thank everyone because this is a very timely issue.
We all know that ongoing financial turmoil has underlined the importance of cross-border crisis management, and the October ECOFIN decision to have more ex-ante coordination between Member States and, especially, supervisory regimes cannot be more welcome.
Banks are at the heart of the payment system and deal with the savings of ordinary consumers who are not financial professionals.
Therefore, the proper functioning of the payment systems and clearing and settlement system is particularly sensitive.
Many of the banks are functioning cross-border now.
A scattered national regulatory framework is not adequate.
Currently, not even the types of account falling under the deficit guarantee scheme's requirements are the same in every Member State.
We should not let this become a depositors' problem.
The rapporteur, Mr Ehler, has done good work in the report and showed a lot of willingness to compromise.
In particular, the report rightly emphasises the importance of eliminating distortions of competition.
As the Commissioner said, it is very important to guarantee a level playing field.
However, I regret that the report finally does not address the issue of ex-ante deposit guarantee (DG) schemes.
While it has been argued by the Member States having ex-post DG systems that this is a problem specific to Scandinavia and Nordic markets, this is not.
It is actually anti-competitive for the whole single market on a wider scale.
In fact, most schemes in Europe are ex ante.
If the rules of refundability and transferability of funds paid into such schemes are not harmonised, this distorts the choice between branch and subsidiary models in the host country, and this leads to distortion of competition.
So it is very welcome that the Commission is studying this matter, analysing whether there are competition distortions and making possible future recommendations in this area, especially on refundability and transferability of ex ante deposit guarantees already paid in money.
So I welcome the Commission initiative and Mr Ehler's report but further work needs to be done.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his text.
For once, I would echo many of the comments made by Mrs Kauppi.
We began working on this text back in the spring and I think that those of us who considered it very timely have been proved right by the events of the summer.
What happened this summer raises questions about deposit-guarantee schemes.
We simply cannot live with a system where many of the market players operate across a number of countries without deposit-guarantee arrangements that are at least harmonised or based on common principles, in the interests not only of competition by also of public confidence in market mechanisms.
I was very struck as I travelled around during the summer - and not just in the Scandinavian countries - at how this question of deposit-guarantee systems was raised systematically and was considered crucially important.
I know, of course, what the Commissioner will say: 'If you were to put together all the European-level guarantee schemes, the total would still be no more than a drop in the ocean by comparison with the sums needed to tackle the crises.'
That is a poor argument when we need to reduce our handicap in terms of both competitiveness and confidence in market mechanisms, particularly because it has the effect of distorting business strategies, as companies suddenly find themselves forced to arbitrate, for the wrong reasons, between their various subsidiaries and branches.
On the basis of all these arguments, I asked my group to support me.
The group tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to work faster and to recognise what people expect of it: while they may not express their demand loud and specifically, in terms of a priority, they do need reassurance about how Europe's financial markets work and how accurately they respond to events.
A sound, European-level deposit-guarantee system is bound to make a contribution in this respect.
Commissioner, I believe it is part of your task to assess the level of confidence or otherwise in the functioning of the financial markets at European level.
It is hardly enough, I think, to sit back and await fresh research results.
You need to take action to accelerate the response and enable us to progress on a more harmonised basis, with a better and more transparent understanding of deposit-guarantee schemes and how they operate in the European Union.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, deposit-guarantee schemes have again been in the public spotlight in recent weeks.
The case of Northern Rock, whose branches were inundated with hundreds of customers rushing to withdraw their savings, and the question of investor compensation in the event of the Bank's collapse are still fresh in our minds.
This illustrates all too well that the global integration of financial markets poses challenges for Europe too.
The increase in cross-border consolidation in the banking sector raises questions about supervisory jurisdiction, the appropriate coverage level of deposit-guarantee schemes and cross-border cooperation between these schemes.
As we know, the European minimum coverage level is set at EUR 20 000, but of course it is actually far higher in many Member States.
The funding of the guarantee schemes, however, is a matter for the Member States, and the structures of the schemes are quite diverse.
For this reason the following points need to be clarified, and clarified quickly: the extent to which deposit-guarantee schemes need to be harmonised, their funding and the proactive ex ante use of resources for damage prevention.
In the case of cross-border institutions, attention focuses in the event of a crisis on the supervisory structure, particularly in the case of group supervision, and on burden-sharing.
If a subsidiary is operating in a host Member State and belongs to that country's deposit-guarantee scheme but is subject to the supervisory authority of the home Member State by virtue of the principle of group supervision, a gulf is created between the supervision system and the deposit-guarantee scheme, and that is surely unacceptable and contrary to the interests of investors.
I do, however, support the line taken by the rapporteur.
Before we resort to legislative measures, the Member States should first eliminate remaining weaknesses in their deposit-guarantee schemes.
At the same time, the Commission, acting as quickly as possible, should conduct targeted studies of cross-border risk management and a detailed analysis of the ways in which the various schemes are funded.
On the basis of its findings, serious consideration can be given to legislative measures at a later date if they are shown to be expedient and necessary.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field.
I think it is important to conclude this from this debate.
If there are distortions, we can have different opinions - if they are there.
But if they are there, something needs to be done. We need to do that because I think we all agree that we want more cross-border competition, and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers.
It is relevant to discuss the difference between different systems, because if you have in some Member States ex-ante systems and in some Member States different ex-post systems, which in reality assumes that the state might bale out banks which cannot pay their customers, then you have a distortion.
It is my opinion that, due to the differences in opinion we have, there is a distortion already.
The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers.
I think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion.
I think it is important that the Commission respond to that in future actions.
We might have differences in opinion about how the state of play is today.
But we do agree on the need for action to be taken if the studies to be done show that there are distortions.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for that and also ask the Commissioner to respond to that with action.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Ehler for his work which comes ten years after the transposition of the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes, in a period of financial upheaval when improvements to the European financial services market are under discussion.
There is currently considerable disparity between the positions adopted by the Member States and there are important issues to resolve.
Although the majority of the Member States apply the system based on an ex-ante fund, there are still significant disparities in the level of guarantees, the size of funds and their method of financing.
To give two examples: the sum guaranteed is eight times higher in the most protective state than in the least protective state, and the guarantee fund in one state alone amounts to 40% of the European total.
This situation creates a distortion of competition.
The ex-post system threatens national and European financial stability in times of crisis.
Cross-border banking groups are also experiencing problems.
The consolidation of funds from different schemes poses practical difficulties.
A concentration of guarantees in a single system can only be achieved through a proliferation of regulations and agreements between states, something which fragments the system and makes it more vulnerable to an unacceptable accumulation of risk.
There are substantial questions marks over the aims of the deposit-guarantee scheme: harmonisation of levels of cover, risk-based contributions, utilisation of funds to provide liquidity, burden-sharing, handling of cross-border crises, liquidation of institutions and cooperation between authorities.
Deposit-guarantee schemes should provide a risk-based safety net capable of protecting depositors, ensuring fair and effective competition, providing stability for the money markets and contributing to an equitable sharing of the burden in crisis situations.
Therefore, extraction of all the possibilities from the existing framework should not stand in the way of a thorough and ambitious reform once the necessary studies have been carried out.
(BG) Colleagues, I note the fact that financial crises are not new prehomena; they are indicators of an asymmetry between the financial sector and the real economy.
The mortgage crisis in the USA has recently made financial experts say that the economies and the financial markets are interrelated and a large-scale discussion is needed to improve risk management.
The idea in the Ehler draft resolution to assess and improve the precuationary and early warning measures of the European Union with a view to ensuring the stability of the financial martkets, and the issue of guaranteeing deposits as a traditional form of savings in my country Bulgaria is very timely indeed.
In this context, I wish to emphasize that the responsibility of banks to carefully organize their porfolio and effectively manage the resources of their depositors is of paramount importance.
Of course, the greater awareness of citizens of the ways to use flexible schemes, the diversification of deposit forms and the mechanisms such as deposit guarantee funds further build confidence and promote financial stability.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions.
In closing, I would like to make two key points.
We do not believe that regulatory change is appropriate at the current time.
The directive has stood the test of time well.
It is able to adapt to changing circumstances.
In the longer term it will be crucial from a financial stability perspective for the positive guarantee schemes to contribute to smooth crisis management in an increasingly pan-European banking environment.
Any further steps towards more harmonised schemes in the European Union now depend therefore on the outcome of the wider work that is currently being conducted in the context of crisis management.
Concerning the problems raised by both Ms Kauppi and Mr HÃ¶kmark, the reimbursement of contributions to a bank that leaves the scheme, for whatever reason, is not covered by the existing directive and is therefore a matter for Member State legislation.
Harmonisation at European level would require full harmonisation of the funding method.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ehler, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their very constructive approach.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Asset management II (debate)
The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Asset Management ÎÎ.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, since the adoption of the UCITS Directive in 1985, European fund markets have experienced meteoric growth.
The directive has since been updated twice to take account of new market developments, and further modernisation is right at the top of next year's agenda.
Not least among the sources of the Commission's present reform project is the first resolution on asset management (Asset Management I) adopted by the European Parliament in April 2006, which set out the main elements of the reform package.
I am grateful to the Commission for having adopted these recommendations and for its intention to have them implemented in a legislative instrument in the new year.
The present draft resolution, entitled Asset Management II, is similarly designed to pave the way for future initiatives on the part of the Commission.
To this end the draft provides for numerous measures which go beyond the content of next year's planned revision package but which we deem necessary if the European funds industry is to become more competitive.
The following are the main points:
Firstly, the Commission should consider an extension of eligible assets to cover property funds and hedge funds.
Both products help to diversify the risk exposure of portfolios and offer attractive returns on investment. Besides scope for adding these products to portfolios, consideration should also be given to a European depository passport, which would give private investors direct access to these products.
We welcome the establishment by the Commission of an expert group on open real-estate funds (OREFs) and its decision to conduct a study on non-harmonised retail funds.
Secondly, not only retail investors but also professional providers and institutional investors should be able to benefit fully from a single European market.
There has never been any scope for these groups, who can effectively do without the traditional consumer protection mechanisms, to operate across borders without very public notification procedures.
A European private placement regime can remedy that situation.
It must be designed in such a way that it does not restrict the existing schemes, some of which are very liberal, in individual Member States.
In order to guarantee this flexibility, Parliament is proposing that the CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, should formulate recommendations for the organisation of such a regime.
The next step would then involve examining whether that was sufficient or whether there was a need for a universally binding directive.
Thirdly, the range of investment products for retail investors is constantly increasing, but the available product information does not permit comparison of the relative merits of products.
This is due in part to the highly fragmented legal framework in Europe.
If individual investors are to make informed decisions, however, information requirements and disclosure obligations must establish some degree of comparability between competing products.
The various industries should be able to compete on a level playing field under the same rules.
For this reason we call on the Commission to review the existing legal frameworks for the various product categories and to present proposals as to how the situation can be improved.
The aim is not to make products fully comparable.
Life assurance policies, certificates and funds differ intrinsically in their legal status and structure.
The aim is rather to establish equivalent information requirements.
Even maximum transparency, however, will count for nothing if investors do not possess at least a minimum level of knowledge about diverse financial products and the way they work.
It is therefore the responsibility of the Member States to encourage education initiatives in this domain.
Fourthly, investors should be able to benefit not only from a wide range of products but also from low costs.
At the present time, however, the European fund landscape is extremely fragmented, which breeds relative inefficiency and excessive costs, especially by comparison with competitor countries.
The Commission is planning to create a legal framework next year for fund mergers.
That is to be welcomed.
The Commission, however, is disregarding one of the main obstacles to cross-border mergers, namely taxation.
We therefore call for cross-border mergers to be treated in exactly the same way as national mergers for tax purposes; in other words, they should not create any additional tax liability for investors.
We are not asking for any measures to be taken on tax rates or the like.
We are merely asking for cross-border mergers not to be treated differently from domestic mergers.
Fifthly, Parliament will produce a separate report assessing the potential utility of a European legal framework for hedge funds and private equity.
The Commission, however, should prepare itself to engage actively in the international discussions on these matters.
Lastly, I should like to thank my fellow committee members, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, for their close cooperation.
I hope that the Commission, as it did the first time, will again embrace our proposals so that we can make the opportunities of the single European market fully available to both investors and the fund industry.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to commend the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for taking the initiative to elaborate an own-initiative report, and for the hard work put into that report.
I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the European Parliament for its valuable contribution to the asset management debate.
Parliament's previous report on asset management was also an excellent contribution to our work on the UCITS Directive.
A long process of analysis and consultation has, we believe, succeeded in building a strong consensus on what needs to be done and how.
We should not overload our agenda, but we are not blind to other issues and problems.
Today's report testifies to the wide range of other issues confronting the European funds industry.
We have already started work in many of the areas highlighted in the present report.
The aim is to build a robust body of evidence on which to base future decisions.
We are glad to see that a careful impact-assessment-driven process is endorsed by Parliament.
We strongly believe in that approach in the Commission.
It would ensure that future initiatives respond to real needs and provide effective solutions.
We are also applying this approach in our work on private placement.
By May 2008, we plan to present a Commission communication assessing the need for, and the feasibility of, the European private placement regime.
The report before us today calls for speedy solutions to facilitate the cross-border passporting of retail non-harmonised funds.
We are also looking carefully at this important issue, and will report to the Council and Parliament in autumn 2008.
We hope that this report will bring some empirical basis to this complex discussion.
Sometimes, listening to this debate, we might have the impression that solutions are identified before a problem has been properly specified.
We would caution against rushing to further enlarge the EU retail fund framework.
UCITS 3 already permits a wide range of innovative strategies, including some types of alternative investment.
We need to be clear about what is currently possible, and on whether risk management controls across the industry are up to scratch, before contemplating further enlargement of the retail fund framework.
We understand the European funds industry's desire to explore its lead in innovation and financial creativity, but not at the price of investor confidence in the UCITS brand.
We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report with regard to the divergent regulatory requirements applicable to the distribution of substitute products, and stress that the Commission has an open mind on whether there is a substantive issue that needs to be tackled.
Responses to the call for evidence launched in October will allow us to assess whether the existing regulatory patchwork results in a real and significant risk of investor detriment.
In the light of responses and further follow-up work, the Commission will issue a communication in autumn 2008 on the need for EU-level action.
We welcome the report's acknowledgement of the positive contribution that hedge funds provide to the functioning of markets and corporate efficiency.
Some recent industry-led initiatives to develop voluntary standards on best practices are a welcome and proportionate response to the demands for greater disclosure.
We appreciate that Parliament also considers that international responses are needed in these highly globalised businesses.
In summary, a lot has been achieved in the area of asset management.
There is a long road ahead.
New challenges constantly appear in this fast-moving business.
However, we will do ourselves no favours by rushing into hasty and ill-prepared responses.
We are glad to see that the Commission has, in Parliament, a valuable partner working towards the same goal, which is an integrated and efficient European fund market delivering for both industry and investors alike.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, in relation to this important own-initiative report on the Commission White Paper on investment funds, our position is that we have decided by general agreement to focus on the non-legislative aspects, given that the legislative proposal for revision of the UCITS III Directive will be tabled in early 2008.
That said, the issues we have decided to address are vitally important to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.
There is a risk that extending the range of eligible assets to include open property funds and alternative funds could mar the excellent worldwide reputation of UCITS products and negatively affect their distribution both within the European Union and to third countries.
To avoid any detriment to the investment fund industry in Europe, Parliament has asked the Commission to conduct an in-depth study of the possible consequences of including these non-harmonised retail funds among the assets eligible for branding as UCITS.
Investments in UCITS total thousands of billions of euros and account for around 80% of the investment fund market in Europe.
The sector is impatiently awaiting revision of the UCITS Directive.
To prevent any unnecessary and counter-productive delay with that revision, however, Parliament has clearly proposed that no extension of eligible assets should take place until legislative reform of the UCITS Directive is complete.
On behalf of my group, I have consistently urged that line and I welcome the rapporteur's readiness to compromise.
The report also calls for the creation of a harmonised framework for private placements within the Union, and I fully support its recommendations on that point.
The private placement regime needs to be based on an accurate definition of qualified investors, as provided for in the MiFID Directive.
Properly informed and qualified investors eligible to practise private placement should not, under any circumstances, face a bureaucratic surcharge as a result of rules that are not only unnecessary but actually counterproductive.
I have to oppose the Socialists' amendment calling for equivalence between Member States' systems of regulation and supervision in the context of applying the private placement regime, which would entail permitting reciprocal access to markets.
This kind of equivalence across Europe is simply unrealistic.
I must also highlight one point on which my group and I disagree with the rapporteur.
It concerns paragraph 19 on the question of so-called 'guarantee funds'.
The very concept of these funds is controversial and we tried to protest at the mistaken definition of them.
I hope we shall manage to lose that paragraph.
I must nonetheless congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work, which enables us to prepare properly for the legislative proposal.
It means we can now look forward with equanimity to the work that lies ahead next year.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I say to Astrid that she should not always assume that Socialist motions will be untenable.
Let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his balanced report.
I must tell the Commissioner that he need not always be so wary of overloading the agenda.
It is against the backdrop of the US financial and mortgage crisis that we are now dealing with the report on asset management.
Not even the European Central Bank is able to assess the full extent of the damage this crisis has caused to the European financial system and to European banks.
And there may - indeed there will - be more to come.
The global financial market is already so closely intertwined that there was no way of protecting the Union from such speculative escapades, for which all of us must ultimately carry the can.
Greedy bank executives, focused solely on shareholder value, still enjoy celebrity status, and the US rating agencies continue to do a roaring trade and to lead us up the garden path.
Knee-jerk legislation, however, is never warranted.
Nevertheless, there is a lot to be done in this field, and the Commission cannot leave the issue to resolve itself and let the market be.
One message I wish to highlight from the report is that more information and transparency lead to more consumer protection and greater consumer security.
That is a very sound starting point.
Another good thing is that the report refers to hedge funds and private equity, because more and more asset managers are investing in alternative investment products.
Hedge funds, open real-estate funds and other retail products should therefore be included in the UCITS III Directive - a task that still lies ahead.
To my mind the very concept of asset management implies steady development, whether through investment certificates, pension funds, life assurance companies, banks or private asset management.
Since 2003 we have had a directive on insider dealing and market manipulation.
Its implementation has been totally inadequate.
The fund industry in particular is always citing costly overregulation and refuses to extend its transparency and liability rules.
What we need here, Commissioner, is a clearly structured system that provides legal certainty.
I am pleased that my proposal for an improved corporate governance clause has been accepted but regret the rejection of my motion on EU supervision of financial markets.
We could and probably must think a bit further in this direction too, Commissioner.
It is nevertheless gratifying that a cross-party compromise was reached on the issue of guaranteed funds.
When all is said and done, we should and must make every effort to ensure that speculation by asset managers is restricted and that Parliament, the Commission and the Council do not distinguish themselves by collective inertia.
Commissioner, that was addressed to you.
Go to it, and do it well!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to point out that this report, though well-balanced and generally acceptable, does not in fact reflect true reality.
The problem is that most of the financial institutions, as appears to be the case, judging from the data supplied, are not adhering to the rules and regulations we have recommended.
The main problem appears to be the abuse of the discrepancies occurring in these regulations.
For this reason we must examine the report in the context of the other reports and documents, like MiFID, with the aim of finding some kind of compatibility.
Another point that I would that like to highlight is that I support Mrs Lulling's opinion: UCITS is a good name, and we therefore need to be very careful about including new products in the portfolio.
Why is that?
Because we do not know what these products are like.
I am very sorry, but in this document, as well as in the Commission's proposal, the portfolios and interests of a retail investor and an institutional, professional investor appear to be slightly jumbled.
Retail investors should have clear definitions and regulations.
However, when we have both UCITS and alternative investment funds, the reality is that in my country, for example, they are mixed together and presented to the retail investor, who then does not understand what he is investing in.
That is why we must have clearer definitions and a document that is structured unequivocally.
I do hope that next year the Commission will produce a document that is structured more clearly.
We really must protect retail investors.
Of course, private investors should have more rights, but these should be defined separately.
We should not advise people to invest in alternative funds that have not even been defined.
In my country any fund is branded alternative at present.
Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his own-initiative report and also for taking on board all the proposals and opinions of the other groups.
Harmonising the environment for asset management and products on the fund market can bring huge benefits to the European economy, as proven also by the 1985 UCITS Directive.
The UCITS Directive has become a huge brand globally.
It sells well abroad.
UCITS represent the basis for a robust fund market in Europe and they make the economy more buoyant through increased stability and the productive reinvestment of savings.
However, the topic of this report is not the UCITS revision, which is forthcoming and which we welcome.
The report addresses, instead, non-harmonised retail funds that are outside the scope of UCITS, calling for a number of important measures.
I would particularly like to welcome the private placement regime, which was also mentioned by the Commissioner.
Initiative is very instrumental in achieving the European market in non-harmonised funds.
Second, fee transparency is a long-due and underrated feature for increasing investor information.
Other measures in the report go in the right direction as well, removing market distortions.
However - and coming back to UCITS' success - we must not get greedy here or mix things up hastily.
I am, of course, referring to the debate on extending UCITS' scope to new asset classes such as open-ended real estate funds or funds of hedge funds.
I do not think the time is right now to discuss these sensitive matters.
We might end up with a more rigid regime, and we would probably find ourselves in a different financial market environment.
I also think it is very important to discuss the role of guaranteed funds.
There is no such thing as a guaranteed fund.
Our group wanted to have some flexibility.
We do not think that having a capital adequacy regime for funds solves the problem.
Guaranteed funds do not exist, and this kind of definition should be removed from the regime.
That is why we have both put forward a proposal from the PPE-DE Group.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his text.
The issues it tackles are recurring ones.
For example, what exactly divides institutional and professional investors from private investors?
Some people would have us think there is a sort of 'Great Wall of China' between the two.
I am unconvinced, and recent events have shown the extent to which financial innovation spreads from one category of investor to another, right down to the individual saver.
The fiction that we can design legislation entirely around the existence of two types of investor - enlightened, professional investors on the one hand and small savers on the other - is, in my view, a dangerous one.
We are well aware of the gradual slippage of investment products.
The notion of two kinds of investor is all very well but we need to recognise very clearly how we apply it.
The second question I would like to raise - which is also reflected in other texts concerning the financial markets - is about information for investors.
This is obviously of key importance, yet we are starting from scratch because the complexity of financial innovation is something new that has not yet been properly acknowledged or confronted.
To leave it at that, however, is not good enough: there is no substitute for responsibility on the part of those engaged in product placement and we need to remember that.
Thirdly, Commissioner, I have to say that I think you slipped up with regard to the connection between implementation of the MiFID Directive and the UCITS Directive.
Does it make sense for the MiFID Directive to be implemented in the Member States before we even know how it will relate to the UCITS Directive?
I think the current situation would be more balanced had we had proceeded otherwise.
With regard to taxation, the rapporteur has mentioned the implications for fund mergers.
I think we also need to bear in mind the implications for product placement, which could be complicated by obstacles of a purely fiscal nature.
I should also like to say something about the Socialists' amendment because the reality of the market in these products differs between countries that produce them, countries that buy them and countries that both produce and buy them.
We have introduced the concept of reciprocity, which would apply not only to opening markets and to market access but also to the nature of regulatory provision and supervision.
I think these elements are essential because the idea of a non-EU country which only produced these products having access to our markets on any sort of terms simply because we had access to its market (which might well be of no interest to European consumers) seems either unrealistic or purely theoretical and I cannot accept it.
The rapporteur has suggested more than once that reciprocity would be in breach of WTO rules.
But Commissioner, I ask you: what did we do when we recognised equivalence rules with the United States?
That is precisely the approach we are asking you to take here.
It is also suggested that the concept is unrealistic because we do not have harmonisation inside the European Union.
If, however, negotiating equivalence with third countries encouraged us to establish a common standard of regulation and supervision inside the Union, would that not constitute substantial progress?
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I hope I will be brief.
As an Easterner, from an area that is poor in capital, I am not enraptured by the fact that everyone is now biting their nails to see what will happen with hedge funds or private equity when the UCITS is extended because this does not affect our own region at all, or at least will not for a good few years.
Perhaps we will even experience something of this from the human side with property funds.
But I would perhaps emphasise what I might expect from the audit, as an Easterner.
One thing is that the banks, which very often operate as distributors within this mechanism and receive very large sums, should nevertheless be examined for some reason, since the sale cost currently accounts for 60% of total costs, and I note that in my region the banks are unbelievably profitable in this way.
If we achieve something in this, we have taken a step forward.
The second thing is that the case of the MiFID inducement has also not said very much for transparency of costs since, for example, if a bank has the fund manager and the seller, we do not know what is going on in the in-house deal, and interestingly not even such in-house deals have been able to break down the different sale prices.
Thirdly, however, some Member States are doing a great deal or implementing provisions that virtually ensure that the custodian, the fund manager and their management keep their feet on the ground.
In my country, or our countries, there are very many capable young people, and they are able to perform management activities, for example, at a good price and to very high quality, if they can, and I feel that relocation is in everyone's interests with a view to them coming onto the free market.
Finally, consumer protection.
I acknowledge that training really is very important, but alongside it we must highlight tax matters.
It cannot be that if I want to take out UCITS in another country, I will end up in a worse situation than if I did it in my own country.
Thank you very much.
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Klinz for this report.
The European fund industry has made some big strides in recent years, and the UCITS Directive has been instrumental in this.
But, while the fund industry has experienced rapid growth, it has much more potential.
This potential can be unleashed through increased competition and mobility in the industry across the EU.
I would like to make some observations about the report.
I can see merit in the recommendation to extend the scope of UCITS to invest in open-ended real estate funds and funds of hedge funds, but this should be dealt with, in my opinion, in a separate directive or legislative instrument.
I also see merit in proposals to enhance the EU private placement regime and agree that the definition of eligible investors is crucial.
It is important to note that, while the definitions contained in the MiFID and the Prospectus Directive offer a good starting point, there may be some additional issues which might also need to be addressed.
With regard to investment policy and risk management, I want to remind the Parliament that, while CESR is conducting a review of how the risk management process requirements of the UCITS Directive are implemented across Member States, it is not CESR's intention to harmonise these requirements.
Certain key areas where divergent practices exist could be explored with the objective of a more harmonised approach.
Guaranteed funds should be backed by capital advocacy requirements and this should be addressed by only allowing funds to be called guaranteed if they are backed by an adequate guarantee arrangement.
I have concerns regarding any call for a depository passport that would result in the depository being established in a different state from that of the UCITS.
This would create a regulatory gap because a UCITS and its depository would be subject to separate regulatory regimes, and complex legal issues might arise in the event of difficulties within the UCITS.
I thank my colleague for this report, which is a very useful one, and I hope that the Commissioner will be able to respond to the points I have raised.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Parliament's report shows that both our institutions' approaches to moving forward in the area of asset management are very much aligned.
We also need future decisions to be based on a thorough analysis of impacts.
We both want efficient markets that respond to the needs and expectations of the European fund industry and European investors.
Important efforts have been made in that direction.
More important efforts are ahead of us.
We are committed to delivering, but we should be cautious.
We need to preserve the reforms and the repute of the UCITS brand.
We need to take the time to involve and consult with all stakeholders, and we need to avoid unnecessary intervention that risks distorting the market but does not bring about noticeable benefits.
Only when all those conditions are met can we be confident that our decisions are up to the challenge.
We look forward to further cooperation between our institutions in this very important area.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Cooperation between the Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe (debate)
The next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision relating to the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe - C6-0311/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and, particularly, the rapporteur, Mr Adamou, for the continuous and constructive cooperation as well as the support in reaching this very important cooperation agreement.
The establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights was a big success for the promotion and respect of fundamental rights in the European Union.
It is also a success in terms of interinstitutional cooperation.
I have always been committed to ensuring that this important initiative is fully supported by the three institutions.
Smooth cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is crucial for ensuring the success of the Agency.
The draft Council decision reflects this objective.
It represents the genuine will of the two organisations to work together, and I am delighted to see that the negotiations for the agreement have been swift and made in a very constructive way by both parties.
This important agreement will enable the Agency to work to the best of its capabilities.
Indeed, in order to be fully operational, a number of measures have already been taken, and some are still in the pipeline.
This agreement will help foster a comprehensive cooperation framework.
It will help to provide a structure platform for both bodies, making mutual dialogue and common action both more possible and more efficient.
It will also help avoid the duplication of work between the two bodies.
The agreement provides for regular contacts and meetings between officials of the Agency and the Council of Europe, as well as for the regular exchange of information.
The appointment of an independent person to sit on the management and executive boards of the Agency fosters an exchange of views and cooperation.
Finally, this agreement reinforces our shared objective to promote and to protect fundamental rights in the European Union.
rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction at the excellent cooperation so far, between the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, especially in achieving an agreement with which both sides are satisfied.
I hope their future cooperation will continue smoothly on the same basis.
Despite the prolonged discussions and consultations with the shadow rapporteurs on the substantial content of the report, we were informed by the Tabling Office that under Rules 83 (7) and 51 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, it was not possible to amend the text of the Agreement and, in respect of the report itself, only procedural amendments would be admissible, a circumstance which led a number of members of the LIBE Committee to give their vote for the report under protest.
My report therefore simply approves the conclusion of the Agreement between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights.
The EU's system of principles for the protection of fundamental rights has been developed mainly through the case law of the European Court of Justice and confirmed by the express recognition contained in the EU treaties.
However, it is particularly important to ensure that this system of human rights protection is further strengthened whilst safeguarding basic principles such as non-discrimination, non-exclusion, respect for freedom of expression and religion, freedom of conscience, and social and economic rights.
The European Agency for Fundamental Rights could provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Community and its Member States with these safeguards during the implementation of Community law.
It is important to recognise that it is the Council of Europe that has developed, through its advanced work in this field, a comprehensive system of norms and legal and judicial instruments for the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law and has gathered extensive experience.
Therefore, the common aim of protection of fundamental rights, shared by the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, has to be achieved in a significant and positive manner, avoiding duplication and any risk of fragility in the well-established judicial and non-judicial system put in place by the Council of Europe for the protection of human rights and individual rights.
We must take care to ensure that there is no challenge to the legal precedent and the substantial content of human rights protection as established by the Council of Europe, an organisation with 47 member states.
I would also like to emphasise that any dangers of duplication of powers and procedures must be countered to avoid confusion as regards the aims and responsibilities of the two bodies, so that we can achieve harmonious cooperation between them.
This must be reflected, above all, in the Agency's annual work programme, and in the strengthening of cohesion and complementarity between the two institutions.
As regards the exchange of information between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, it is of the utmost importance, as far as possible, that such exchange should take place under conditions of absolute confidentiality observed on both sides.
The Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe should agree on more precise rules regarding the implementation of Article 15 of the Agreement, which provides for grants to be received by the Council of Europe from the Agency, with the aim of achieving full transparency and avoiding any insinuation of excessive interdependence between the two institutions.
It is also essential to implement Article 7 of the Agreement in a way which will allow the two institutions to exchange, by mutual consent, as much information as possible, with due regard to their rules of procedure, as far as this is possible under the confidentiality rules in force. This information should not be used by institutions other than those directly involved in the examination of the issues at stake, nor should it be made available to institutions or agencies of third countries, in the absence of guarantees and controls regarding its use.
As I have said, the cooperation between the Commission and the Council of Europe during the negotiations for the Agreement has proved fruitful, and it is expected that the two institutions will continue in future to work efficiently together, in the same spirit of cooperation, transparency and complementarily.
However, it is enormously important that the European Parliament should participate in this process, through periodic reports, and that the Council of Europe should be called on to state its opinion on all the surveys and assessments carried out, with a view to complementarity, non-duplication of work, and the transparency of the operations of the two institutions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President, I am glad to speak today as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group concerning this report on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe.
We have had long debates and a lot of questions whether there is a need for an Agency; whether the Council of Europe can accept this; whether there will be real, useful cooperation between the two.
All the time both Parliament and the Commission said clearly: yes, we need the Agency, we see the sense of this institution and we foresee good cooperation between the Council of Europe and the Agency.
Therefore I welcome the fact that, now this Agreement is here, we can talk about institutionalised cooperation.
On the other hand, I am sorry that we could not really improve this text by amending certain aspects, because I would have underlined the need to take into account, whenever the Agency is dealing with concrete issues, all the experience, the expertise, gathered by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, with its reporting system in its various committees, for example in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights where there is excellent expertise and experience in dealing with these issues.
But nevertheless I am glad, because the conclusion of this Agreement is signalling the need for this body, for the Agency, to start its work as soon as possible.
The Agency was officially inaugurated on 1 March but it still does not have its operating and management structure in place.
It is imperative to proceed and improve the situation so as to go further.
I have been following this dossier since the very beginning of my mandate, noting the extreme difficulties of designing its scope, area of competence and decision-making structures to the satisfaction of all actors involved.
We are all concerned since the Agency will gather and compile data and prepare recommendations to the institutions in the field, a remit that is hard to define in its boundaries, which is horizontal and which cross-cuts all Community policies.
We can only be satisfied if we create a credible and responsible Agency that is entrusted with enough power and an adequate budget to cope with its task.
This Agreement can help this.
We will ensure that any overlap of these tasks and duplication of work is avoided.
Let us hope that the solemn proclamation of the Charter on Fundamental Rights today will stand as one side and the Agency will stand as the other side of the same coin: a first practical step towards a future Union policy on human rights and fundamental freedoms.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, what we are discussing today is an atypical procedure, as the European Parliament is pronouncing on the advisability of a cooperation agreement between the European Union and the Council of Europe.
We have no opportunity to intervene in this agreement: we are simply assessing it and giving our opinion.
The Council of Europe is the oldest European organisation concerned with human rights and the promotion of democracy.
No one here needs reminding that cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union - and previously the European Communities - has existed since the beginning.
Accession to membership by a state wishing to join the European Union is conditional upon respect for values that are inscribed in the Statute of the Council of Europe: the rule of law, democracy and, above all, respect for human rights.
It is thus good that these two institutions, the European Communities - now the European Union - and the Council of Europe, should cooperate, not only by sitting side by side in Strasbourg but by engaging in common fields of action.
The agreement we are discussing today is neither highly original nor new, just as the Agency for Fundamental Rights is not an entirely new institution.
As we know, the Agency for Fundamental Rights replaced the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, and the Centre had a similar cooperation agreement with the Council of Europe.
