We therefore call for exhaustive monitoring of the accession agenda in relation to the candidate countries, and greater solidarity with women, for this is what they expect.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I would very much like to congratulate MrsÂ Karamanou on her excellent report on the situation of women in south-east Europe.
Indeed, equal opportunities between men and women in this region deserve our utmost attention in light of the problems caused by all types of exploitation of women.
Human trafficking in south-east Europe is giving us the greatest cause for concern and worry.
I am sorry to say that women are, in large numbers, the main victims of this terrible trafficking.
The countries of this region too are called upon to take all measures necessary in order to put a stop to this modern slavery.
For my part, it is true that combating the trafficking in women is an absolute priority, in line with our European values based on the principle of respect for fundamental rights.
The horror of testimonies from Romanian, Moldavian and other women who have been sold for a handful of dollars is intolerable.
The marketing of women must be very strongly condemned.
Some Balkan countries that persistently hammer on the door of the European Union with the aim, of course, of becoming Member States should make it their absolute priority persistently to target these mafia-like organisations, break them up and severely punish those guilty of this horrendous trafficking.
I would reiterate that we cannot tolerate the exploitation and abuse either of women or, especially, of girls, who are slaves of unscrupulous networks. Nor can we tolerate any longer the indifference of governmental authorities that all too often tend to close their eyes and ignore what is not only a problem but also a curse.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking MrsÂ Karamanou on her excellent report.
I should now like to make some comments on trafficking in human beings in that region.
I have spent a lot of time working in the Balkans and continue to do so.
I notice that a lot is happening there.
Action is being taken and, as the Commissioner said, many programmes are in place.
I have mixed feelings though.
Yes, on the one hand there is progress, but what about the other hand?
I am seeing more and more well-motivated young politicians, both men and women, who want to do something.
Improvements can be seen in the towns, but things are still very different in the countryside.
Much has been said of the humiliation of the victims.
We identified 5 203 victims between 2000 and 2003, but the actual number could be over 175 000.
So a lot of work remains to be done.
Since 2003 we have been seeing far fewer victims because the criminal sector is going more and more underground.
What are they doing?
They are bringing their victims, the girls, not to bars or brothels, but to private flats.
This makes the networks much more sophisticated.
Previously they operated in small groups, but now they are on their own â one dealer for each victim, and so the chance of catching them is smaller.
It takes a lot of work.
Secondly, blood vengeance is on the rise, not only among men but also involving women and children.
If you are an Albanian woman, raped and kidnapped and taken to the West, what happens then?
According to Albanian custom, this woman has shamed her family and even today they have the right to kill her.
That is the current situation.
So, Commissioner, I would urge you to support actions aimed at gender equality and activities and training aimed at the police, the military and the authorities.
Jobs must also be created, jobs with a reasonable wage, in order to deal with the problem of corruption.
In addition, we should involve Balkan countries in the European institutions.
Invite people from these countries to attend courses so that they can see that there is another, less corrupt, way.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the preparations by the European Union for the Review Conference on the Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel mines.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Ottawa Treaty is a corner-stone of multilateral disarmament policies.
Its political success and practical impact have become a guiding light for multilateral efforts to eradicate the legacies of hatred and lingering threat left by conflicts.
Since its entry into force significant progress has been made by the international community: 141 countries have ratified the MBT, 9 more countries have signed, over 110 countries are not using anti-personnel landmines, more than 30 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed by states parties to the Convention and, last but not least, mine action programmes are being successfully implemented in many mine-affected countries.
However, much still remains to be done.
A number of countries continue to use anti-personnel mines, and some are also believed to be continuing to produce landmines.
Approximately 65 countries are still affected to some degree by mines and unexploded ordnance and, unfortunately, new areas of conflict are adding to this list.
Global estimates of new landmine casualties each year vary between 15Â 000 and 20Â 000Â people, many of whom are civilians, including children.
The upcoming review conference on 29 November to 3Â December 2004 in Nairobi will be a major opportunity to take stock of past achievements and the lessons learned and to trace the course of action for the years ahead.
What has the EU done so far and what does it intend to do in preparation for this review conference?
The importance attached by the EU to the goals of the Ottawa Convention became a tangible fact in 1997 when Parliament created the anti-personnel landmine budget line.
In March 2000, the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Ottawa Treaty, the European Commission issued a communication and forwarded to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation on the reinforcement of the EU contribution to the fight against landmines.
In July 2001 Parliament and the Council adopted the legal instrument and its financial envelope. These lay the foundations of an integrated and focused European policy.
In 2002, the new legal instrument was put into practice through the multiannual strategy for the years 2002-2004.
The strategy is the first of its kind since the anti-personnel landmine regulations entered into force.
It constitutes an operative framework for coordinating and prioritising EU-financed projects in this field.
It contains an overall approach and detailed programming covering 33 countries for an average yearly EC contribution of about EUR 42 million.
The Commission is in the process of launching the multiannual strategy for 2005 to 2007.
The figures here also contain the contribution from sources within the European Development Fund and reflect the total level of activity we are supporting.
The setting of priorities will be conducted on an informed and coherent basis.
We will do this against a background of perspectives and goals shared with the international community and reflecting a jointly-defined orientation and policy.
We will ensure that in the preparatory work for the Nairobi Summit we coordinate within the European Union both at government level and non-governmental level, and also with a wide range of non-state actors.
This consultation is important if we are to create 'ownership', within a very broad framework, for what we do in Nairobi.
Since the adoption of the APL regulation, the European Union has played a substantial and visible role in the fight against landmines, both in political terms and also in terms of financial commitments.
Looking at the broad picture for the years 2000 to 2002, contributions to mine action from the EU Member States and the European Community stood at a sum total of EURÂ 410 million.
We hope to be able to continue our engagement at this impressive level.
We know that failure to award sufficient priority to mine action would have enormous human costs and render its development fragile and fragmented.
The mine threat can be overcome.
The deadlines were set in the Ottawa Convention and clearly challenge us to swiftly eradicate this scourge.
The Nairobi Summit will be an appeal to all of us to do more and to do it faster.
Parliament's resolution provides a forceful and positive signal in this direction.
Â Â  Mr President, by definition all modern military weapons are a source of death and destruction, but antipersonnel mines are particularly pernicious as, after the cessation of hostilities, their continued presence results in the ongoing death and mutilation of innocent civilians, particularly children.
This often causes, for prolonged periods of time, massive social and economic problems in countries, many of which are already amongst the poorest in the world and suffering from the ravages of long-term war and disease.
That is why I particularly support the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and their eventual destruction.
I congratulate the 141 States which have ratified or acceded to this Treaty and call upon the four EU Member States remaining after enlargement on 1 May which have not yet done so â namely, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Poland â to do so without any further delay.
Although it is true that some 68 states have destroyed more than 31.5 million mines, it is estimated that 78 countries still have between 200 and 250 million antipersonnel mines stockpiled, that tragically there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 new landmine victims per year and that landmines still litter 82 countries around the world.
Much still remains to be done, to echo the words of Commissioner Nielson.
The EU has pledged EUR 240 million for the period 2002-2009 to support the total ban and assist with mine clearance, victim assistance and stockpile destruction, and this support is at least part conditional on the recipient country demonstrating a commitment towards accession to the Convention.
I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague, Mr Van Orden, who has been particularly active in this campaign.
I also wish every success to the November 2004 Nairobi Conference, which seeks to review the operation of this Convention and what further measures can be taken to implement its contents, in particular how to encourage armed, non-state actors to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines without recognising their legitimacy.
This is particularly salient in Africa â the venue of the conference â which has been blighted by a series of tragic civil wars from Zaire to Liberia and Sierra Leone and which are characterised by insurgents and rebels, often heavily armed and financed by third parties.
I do not, however, accept â unlike some Members of this House â that this ban can be automatically extended to the legitimate military use of other munitions, such as anti-tank mines, as they, for instance, are less readily available to non-regular forces, because they are much more expensive and tend to be laid in a well-mapped and systematic fashion, which enables speedy clearance in peacetime after the cessation of hostilities.
Furthermore, they are not capable of being detonated by the foot of an innocent child, as is the case with antipersonnel mines.
These issues need to be considered separately as, otherwise, there is a danger of losing cross-party political consensus on this important issue.
I also support that this Parliament sends a delegation of Members of this House, as observers, to the conference so that they can report back to the House on the progress in this very important area.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, often in the political arena there is confirmation that small policies, when applied, produce big results and that big policies, when announced but not applied, produce nothing.
In this particular case, the Ottawa Treaty, which was essentially signed seven years ago and has been in application for a very short time, has proven its applicability and efficacy and is therefore a successful policy .
The choice of holding the first conference to review this Treaty in Nairobi is particularly symbolic, because we all know that sub-Sahara is one of the areas which has the biggest concentration of anti-personnel mines, given that mines are considered to be the weapon of the poor.
I should like to take this opportunity to point out that my country, which remained outside this Treaty several years ago, also recently agreed with and ratified the Treaty under the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Georgos Papandreou, and has applied it in connection with its border with Turkey where, for reasons which we all understand, there was a cold front of confrontation.
The ultimate objective of the Ottawa Treaty is to overcome the problem of land mines through coordinated action against mines at international level within the next ten to fifteen years.
This objective is considered to constitute a challenge, because over sixty countries have stated that they are facing problems on this issue and 20 of them are very seriously affected.
The experience of Europe itself after the cold war, and recent experience in the Balkans, demonstrates that this huge problem even exists on our continent.
Of course, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where hundreds of millions of mines undermine health and economic development every day, the issue is even bigger.
The United Nations plays the central role in organising and coordinating international efforts, while the European Union provides the greatest individual contribution.
Since 1992, before the Ottawa Treaty even existed, the sums quoted by the Commission to date are significant but should possibly be increased.
The European Parliament has undertaken a great many initiatives since 1992 in connection with a complete ban on this murder weapon, which exterminates human lives and prevents economic development.
However, our greatest contribution has been in implementing these programmes in a great many countries of the world; in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in the Balkans, in dozens of countries in which both non-governmental and governmental organisations are involved in removing anti-personnel mines.
Apart from neutralising mines, however, they need to pay greater attention to education, research and more general information in connection with the danger and how to prevent it.
The conference in Nairobi will provide a huge opportunity to apply all aspects of the Ottawa Treaty which have somehow not been applied due to technical shortcomings, to supplement the Treaty, to complete it and to give the world a new Treaty, a highly effective, albeit small-scale Treaty for the peace and security of the developing and, more importantly, the poor areas of the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the mine is an economic weapon, which has effects that are both physical and psychological, the latter being increased because of the insidious nature of mines.
Easy to put in place and relatively cheap, mines are a recurring threat long after the end of fighting.
Although the Ottawa agreement banning anti-personnel mines has now entered into force, only future conflicts are affected. The fight against the approximately 110 million mines across the world sadly remains a reality.
There are stocks that pose a threat of proliferation, and several Phare countries, such as the former Yugoslavia, the United States, China and Russia, should be encouraged to ratify this treaty.
Nor, unfortunately, has the time come to bring an end to the humanitarian action, carried out either by NGOs or the UN, to combat this scourge.
I also welcome the preparations for the Ottawa Conference.
Six years after the signing in Ottawa of a convention banning the use, stockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines, let us remember that it is said that, every year, there are still between 15Â 000 and 20Â 000 people in the world who are victims of such mines.
In particular, children continue to pay a heavy price for the spread of the poor manâs weapon, and children make up a quarter of the victims.
This is why it is our duty to continue the battle and, above all, to do everything possible to ensure that, finally, production of these mines comes to an end.
Â Â  Mr President, our fellow MEPs have rightly listed the problems caused by the enormous number of mines left behind, often for years, after conflicts throughout the world.
The European Parliament recently sent a delegation to Sudan where a civil war has been raging for 20 years.
Thankfully the war is over in some parts of the country, such as the Nuba Mountains in the south, but the people living there are now faced with the continued presence of thousands and thousands of mines.
Not only are more people regularly being injured in mine-related accidents, but mines are restricting access to the fields and other villages. This makes it very difficult for people to earn a living.
I would therefore like to appeal directly to all those in the world who are responsible for making these mines.
We have no idea how long mines can remain active or how long they will still be around.
I was shocked to discover in Sudan that Belgian mines are still being found there 20 to 30 years after they were made.
And that is despite the fact that my country, Belgium, was one of the first countries to work for the abolition of mines.
That was in Africa, but the problem reaches as far as the borders of Europe.
For example, remember that mines are still being used in Cyprus to protect the border between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parts.
I hope that the largest countries â China, the United States and Russia â will stop producing and using these mines as well.
A general global ban is essential, because the effects of mines still remain a threat to the existence of poor people every day.
Â Â  â Mr President, as has already been said, this House has a long tradition of concern with this issue.
I remember how, before 1999, it was above all MrsÂ Maren GÃŒnther who devoted herself to this cause, in which we have achieved a number of successes and made significant progress.
Today, we can see how most of the Member States â almost all of them, in fact; only a few have not yet done so â have already ratified the Protocol, so the assertions made only a few years ago that it was, for this or that reason, quite impossible to accede to it, have proven to be without substance.
What this shows is that this is all about political will, so I can do no other than appeal to our Estonian, Latvian, Finnish and Polish friends to see to it that they sign up as soon as possible.
I would say the same thing to our important ally, the United States of America.
They and we may be partners in the war on terrorism, but in that anti-personnel mines have no part; they are themselves an instrument of terror.
It is for that reason that we must do everything we can to prohibit production of them and trade in them, whilst also doing more to support the clearance of mines.
It has been said, and rightly, that mines hit the poorest regions hardest.
A few days ago, we heard from the Commission â and I am right behind them in this â that we intend to conduct accession negotiations with Croatia.
Croatia is suffering in that, in the fields of one of its most fertile regions, that between Vukova and Ilok, with its wonderful vineyards, mines continue to be present on a large scale, thus preventing the people from returning home.
It is even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kosovo, right in the middle of Europe.
The same is true, of course, in those regions to which we are particularly committed, such as Africa, which we have been discussing today â and I agree with all those Members who have said that things are at their worst there â and also in Afghanistan.
Although we are doing everything to help Afghanistan, our aid is concentrated on a few cities; this is due not only to errors of political judgement on our part, but also to the fact that there are so many mines scattered over wide stretches of the country that reconstruction there is making little if any headway.
That, though, is not where the eyes of the world are focused.
It is for that reason that I am glad that our resolution states that we have to pay more attention to mine clearance, to ridding the world of mines.
It would be utterly absurd, though, if we were to deploy massive resources â as we must â in support of mine action programmes, while, at the same time, states such as our partners or even certain prospective Member States were to be producing new mines, which would then be laid.
That would be nonsense from any rational personâs point of view.
For this reason, there is no alternative to a ban, which must include all Member States of the European Union, and behind which we must throw our whole weight, both economically and in terms of foreign policy.
Commissioner, I want to endorse your statement that it is not only Europe that must unequivocally ban these mines, but all the states on this earth, including the 44 that are still creating difficulties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to say that on this occasion I totally agree with Mr Posselt, which is not always the case.
In reply to Mr Tannock, it is true that there is a big difference between antitank mines and antipersonnel mines.
However, they too can be used in a perverse manner: an antipersonnel mine can be stacked on top of an antitank mine, which is extremely dangerous.
There are all kinds of perverse ways of stacking and combining these mines.
I do not mean that we should move beyond the scope of the Ottawa Treaty.
We should use it forcefully and constructively and then consider how we can move on.
The problem of increasing the number of countries actually complying with and ratifying the Treaty is still a real problem.
As a Danish government minister I signed the Ottowa Treaty on behalf of my country.
Immediately after signing, the Canadian Government gave us all a nice ballpoint pen.
I subsequently had a meeting with the roaming US ambassador.
I felt sorry for him and gave him the pen I had just used to sign, saying that at least his government would have a pen that knew how to sign the Treaty.
We still need to exert pressure on those countries that are not on board, including the EU Member State named during the debate.
The most important and effective thing way of proceeding in post-conflict situations is, if possible, to have the two sides in a conflict join together in demining mapping.
Nicaragua was a good example of this, even though that was never a dirty guerrilla war.
It was well-organised and both sides had mapped what they had done.
In Nicaragua, working together became in itself part of the reconciliation and confidence-building process.
In this case it was possible, but in many cases it is not.
This is part of the problem.
Having said that, local communities were mobilised in a fantastic way in Cambodia to provide intelligence for mapping, and a long-term broad participatory approach was taken to moving things forward.
We have to use our global presence not only to provide money but also to act as a catalyst for the use of best practice.
We should probably also be doing more in terms of research and development in the field of detection technologies.
This is all part of what we intend to do in the coming years.
Let me conclude by thanking Members for their very positive contributions.
Â Â  We thank you for your commitment to this issue, Commissioner.
To end this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions tabled by:
â JosÃ© Ignacio Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and ConcepciÃ³ Ferrer, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Cuba (B5-0192/2004);
â Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m and Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0201/2004);
â Alain Lipietz, Josu Ortuondo Larrea and Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0204/2004);
â Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0207/2004);
â Ana Miranda de Lage, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Cuba (B5-0208/2004);
â Luisa Morgantini, Pernille Frahm and Herman Schmid, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Cuba (B5-0212/2004);
â LuÃ­s QueirÃ³ and JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Cuba (B5-0214/2004).
Â Â  Mr President, it appears that today, at the request of the Cuban Government, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is going to vote for a draft resolution on the situation of the prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo.
I would ask the following question: with what authority can the Castro Government demand explanations of the situation of these prisoners and demand measures to guarantee that their rights are respected, when Cuba still has 74 citizens imprisoned in inhuman conditions, hundreds of kilometres from their homes, for the sole crime of wishing to exercise their inalienable right to freedom of expression and thought?
We also roundly condemn what is happening in GuantÃ¡namo.
However, precisely because we are demonstrating the consistency that the Castro Government so cynically demands from the European Union in Geneva â a consistency that Fidel Castro himself is incapable of showing â we also once again condemn the arbitrary detention of the Cuban dissidents.
It is true that Julio Antonio ValdÃ©s has been freed, and we are delighted about that.
But what we do not want is to allow ourselves to be deceived and forget that the other dissidents are still in prison and that this imprisonment and the conditions involved, which contravene all international conventions in the field, are a flagrant violation of fundamental rights.
Neither do we wish to forget that the Varela Project has not yet gone ahead and that Osvaldo PayÃ¡, whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize, is still unable to leave Cuba.
Hence the timeliness of the Resolution we are discussing, which is perhaps a repetition, according to the Socialist Group â and this is the reason why it has not wished to sign up to this resolution â but nevertheless necessary, because events in Cuba are, regrettably, repeating themselves and the situation not only remains unchanged, but as the months have passed has actually deteriorated.
We do not want either Parliament or the Commission to abandon people who fight peacefully to defend freedom to their fate, and nor do we want to remain silent about their suffering or about that of their families.
We want to tell them from this House once again that we are still standing by them and that, despite the isolation in which they have been confined, we are not forgetting them and we are still with them in their fight, in the hope that one day Cuba can begin to move toward democracy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, an unprecedented wave of repression hit Cuba in March and April 2003 under the pretext of the active role played among political opponents by those representing the interests of the US in Havana.
Almost 80 civilians were arrested, tried and given very heavy prison sentences, ranging from six to 28 years.
Those arrested were tried very quickly: in a matter of weeks â or even days â in the course of trials not open to the public.
The defendants were aided by lawyers not belonging to independent bar associations.
The conditions of detention of these people raise serious concerns, insofar as the Cuban authorities are providing hardly any information on the matter.
Faced with this situation, we urge the Cuban authorities to free these political prisoners and are anxious to remind them that freedom of expression is a fundamental right.
Last month, a delegation from Reporters Without Borders, accompanied by relatives of unfairly condemned prisoners, came to protest and call for the help of the European Parliament in fighting to defend freedoms.
I am anxious to stress that Cuba has ratified a number of conventions in the area of human rights and I call on the Cuban authorities to respect their undertakings.
Cuba cannot, for all that, use the admittedly disastrous consequences of the embargo, which has lasted for more than 40 years, to claim that some of its nationals, described in particular as mercenaries in the service of foreign powers, have had their human rights systematically violated.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am speaking personally and not on behalf of my group.
Secondly, I am not the author of this resolution but am actually more opposed to it.
I therefore want to throw another light on the topic.
I have recently been to Cuba to investigate possible ways of cooperating to combat trafficking in and smuggling of human beings.
This phenomenon is a serious and pressing problem in Cuba too, and the Cuban Government is working hard on it.
In the first two and a half months of this year no fewer than 30 people-smuggling operations were closed down and about 70 attempts to leave the country illegally were thwarted. Half of these involved people-smuggling.
Furthermore, five people died in a dramatic attempt to reach the United States, one person is still missing and three were found alive.
People-trafficking generally involves fake marriages and false promises of work.
Why do ordinary Cubans take such risks?
When talking about people-trafficking we often use the terms 'push factor' and 'pull factor'.
We know that poverty is the principal reason, the push factor, both social and economic poverty.
As far as pull factors go, we almost immediately think of the force of attraction exerted by the rich West, in this case the United States.
That picture is not entirely accurate.
What promises do people-traffickers usually make?
As in Europe, they promise the chance to earn more money, sometimes a lot more, and claim that their victims will be grateful to them.
A rose-tinted picture, bearing little relation to reality, is painted.
US President Lyndon Johnson approved the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966.
This law automatically gave all Cubans reaching the United States residence and employment rights after they had been in the US for a year.
This is a clear pull factor, possibly the most important as far as Cuba is concerned.
The assumption has always been that life in the United States, even for people on the breadline, is much better than life in Cuba.
But the World Bank, not exactly known for its anti-American pronouncements, has praised Cuban healthcare and education.
Compare this to the situation in the so-called Promised Land, the United States, where access to healthcare is far from universal, where affordable education is of low quality and where many prisons are privatised and outside democratic control.
I have personal experience of this.
If we are to criticise the human rights situation in Cuba we must bear two things in mind.
Who is criticising, and is the criticism reasonable and balanced?
Listening to the official voice of the European Parliament over the past few months it is clear to me that double standards are being applied, as whenever values that we ourselves regard as universal come into the picture we suddenly take a very selective approach in the case of Cuba.
Â Â  Certain Members have informed me that they are incorrectly named as authors of resolutions.
If this is the case, please forgive us, but the agenda delivered to us indicates that there are seven motions for resolutions, each with its own authors.
It is therefore correct.
In any event, we are going to go ahead with the debate and later on we will look at the real motions for resolutions or see if there is a joint one.
Now is the time for expressing your ideas.
Â Â  Mr President, I am a signatory to this resolution.
Good news from Castro's Cuba; is that possible?
Yes indeed, and I refer you to the full-page article in yesterday's devoted to unceasing internal efforts to bring about peaceful regime change on the island.
The title of the article speaks for itself: 'Third run-up to a referendum in Cuba'.
The driving force behind this planned plebiscite is still Oswaldo Paya, winner of the Sakharov prize awarded by this House.
The enmity and quibbling of Castro and his associates do not worry him; Paya sees the growing popularity of his initiative as more important.
Increasing numbers of Cubans are losing their fear of government repression.
In May 2002 Paya and his supporters handed over 11Â 020 signatures for a referendum to the national parliament.
14Â 384 more signatures were added at the start of October 2003.
About half of these were obtained in the period following the wave of arrests in March 2003.
The muzzled parliament did not respond, but this has not stopped Paya from organising a third petition.
In this resolution, the European Parliament is clearly lending its support to Cubans longing for the achievement of a democratic, constitutional state.
This House expects the Council, the Member States of the Union and the Commission to have the same supportive attitude.
I sincerely hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will make good its intention to produce a full report on the situation in Cuba during the next session.
We owe it to the peace-loving people of this island which attracts so many European tourists.
Â Â  Mr President, I am going to vote against the so-called compromise resolution, which my Socialist Group has not signed, because I believe it is unfair, biased and does not take account of the aggression and threat suffered by Cuba from the United Sates for almost 50 years.
There are several dozen countries in the world in which the situation in terms of human rights and freedom is objectively worse than in Cuba, but we do not talk about those countries with the same concern.
Instead, the European Union maintains relations with almost all of them and, incidentally, just today we have voted without any fuss to renew a cooperation agreement with one of these countries.
What we do not have in the world is several dozen countries on which the United States is obsessively fixated as it is with Cuba.
In this area, both our agenda and the scandalous double standards of our positions are set by the United States, with the naÃ¯ve or deliberate complicity of some of our fellow Members.
In principle, I am in favour of the 70 or so prisoners in Cuba being released.
I am aware, however, that people who have been shown to have collaborated with an aggressive power would be imprisoned in our countries as well.
I would also contradict those who distort the truth, both in relation to the trials undergone by those prisoners and the conditions in which they are carrying out their sentences.
Nobody would be surprised, Mr President, least of all the Cubans, if following its âbringing democracy to Iraqâ venture, the Bush administration were to embark on a similar âbringing democracy to Cubaâ operation.
For this venture as for the previous one, the White House would find supporters amongst us, but I will certainly not be one of them, and nor will I be one of those who end up regretting not having resisted before.
I would also point out that within Cuban territory there are cases of human rights violations, violations of the rule of law, illegal imprisonment and inhuman conditions, not for the 70, but for more than 600 men who have not been sentenced nor subject to any judicial procedure.
But that is happening in the part of the island occupied by the United States: in the base at GuantÃ¡namo.
I am shocked that those Members who collect signatures so that the rights of prisoners in Cuban jails are respected and in order to visit those jails, do not include the situation of the prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo and a visit to the jail there.
On the subject of the human rights of Cuban citizens, I would point out that in the United States there are five Cuban prisoners who have been handed down horrendous sentences, in trials which are dubious in terms of legal security, all as a result of actions in defence of their people from attacks from terrorist groups based in Miami.
The US Administration is denying them and their families their legitimate rights as defined in the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law.
In this regard, we have called for the mobilisation of the Council and the Commission, today we reiterate our support and we call on Parliament to support the five people who the Cubans see as their heroes, and their families, several of whom have not been able to visit, not for months, not for years, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr President, my group has always defended the principles of respecting and protecting freedoms, human, social and national rights and rights to sovereignty and democratic development.
We must always work from an objective point of view and nobody in this House can deny that Cuba has achieved a high level of social, economic, scientific and technological development, which is objectively verifiable and indisputable, despite its international isolation and the asphyxiating blockade by the United States, which it has been suffering for almost half a century.
This development has been demonstrated by the indicators in the most advanced and reliable studies and investigations by numerous United Nations bodies.
This development also includes fundamental aspects of daily life, such as education, culture, sport and health.
I regret that certain Members of this House are still expressing fury at the Cuban Government in such an irresponsible way and with so little objectivity, while refusing to condemn very serious situations in other parts of the world, resulting from the orders of Washington, that is to say, restrictions of freedoms, interference in the politics of other countries by the United States, as well as the prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo, about which you say nothing and whose subhuman situation you do not condemn.
Their human rights are not recognised, because the United States has decided that they are in no man's land, but this territory belongs to the United States, it is on Cuban territory and Cuba is a sovereign country.
We cannot have two different yardsticks when it comes to applying human rights at international level.
It is highly regrettable that certain groups in this House continuously condemn the situation in Cuba in terms of political prisoners, opponents of the Cuban Government but, nevertheless, avoid debating the horrendous conditions of the five Cubans jailed in the United States, who are denied family visits and fair trials.
Our group has been condemning this in this House and nobody has spoken out on behalf of these prisoners.
And I ask myself, do the prisoners in the United States, GuantÃ¡namo, the 10 000 in Iraq and other countries not deserve the same consideration and treatment by the European Parliament?
My group considers human rights to be universal, and we defend freedom of expression, the recognition of family visits to prisoners and respect for the government of each country, without political interference from other countries.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to welcome the fact, on my own behalf and on behalf of my group, that four political groups were able to agree on a compromise resolution, one that is in favour of Cuba, not opposed to it; a resolution that is in favour of the Cuban people, and opposed to a tyrannical regime.
I should like to mention two dates, so that we can be absolutely clear as to what is at stake: on 1Â May, ten new Member States are to join this Parliament, our milieu, the house of democracy that we share.
Ten years ago, eight of these States were languishing under the tyranny of Communist dictatorships.
Once the Wall came down, they were able to develop democratically, to share the same cornerstones of the rule of law, democracy and freedom, and to live side by side with us.
This is what we would like to see happen in Cuba.
Next Sunday, 25Â April, sees the thirtieth anniversary of the âCarnation Revolutionâ, a democratic revolution, which was promptly hijacked by the extreme left and the Communists, who wished to turn Portugal â to use the expression of the time â into âthe Cuba of Europeâ.
We strove hard in 1974 and 1975 to be able to call ourselves a free and democratic country and not a âCuba of Europeâ.
What we would now like to see is Cuba become âthe Portugal of the Caribbeanâ; we would like to see the carnations that brightened up Portugal do the same in Cuba; we would like to share the vibrancy, the colour and the warmth of Cuban culture, a culture we hold in high regard and which we would like to see smile and grow in freedom.
This is what is at stake.
Mention has been made here of double standards.
What I deplore here is the lack of solidarity, on the part of some Members of this House, with the terrible suffering in Cuba, with people sentenced one year ago to twenty or more years in prison for their beliefs.
This is a diabolical state of affairs.
If you do not wish to see double standards, then use your vote wisely, otherwise the accusers may soon find the tables turned on them.
As revealed recently in Parliament by the organisation, Cuba is currently the worldâs largest prison for journalists.
Since March, twenty-seven journalists have been imprisoned, and three were already in prison.
We must, therefore, show unstinting solidarity with all those who advocate freedom of speech, of opinion and of expression, and political freedom in Cuba.
Lastly, one or two words of support for campaigns to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Cuban democrats, such as Rivero CastaÃ±eda, a great writer and poet who is in prison, or Oswaldo PayÃ¡, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2002.
We must not tire in our efforts and must never give up on promoting the Sakharov initiative until, as we have requested and as is his right, Oswaldo PayÃ¡ is able to come here and speak to us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Nielson, on the first anniversary of the mass imprisonments on political grounds, carried out by Castro, we Christian Democrats from Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made a joint appeal in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.
We wished to draw attention to the fact that, on 18Â MarchÂ 2003 in the shadow of the Iraq war, Fidel Castro instituted a wave of repression in which 75 advocates of democracy were falsely imprisoned following summary trials.
They were each sentenced to between 15 and 27 yearsâ imprisonment.
A total of 1Â 456 yearsâ imprisonment was thus imposed upon these 75 constitutional activists.
Their fate must not be ignored by the surrounding world.
It is therefore a matter of extreme urgency that we in the European Parliament make this statement today.
As Members of the European Parliament, we believe that the judgments must be overturned inasmuch as the trials in Cuba were clearly conducted without legal rights for the accused, who were sentenced on exclusively political grounds.
We ask for these 75 human rights activists to be released, and for them to be so without delay.
Their so-called crime is that, in accordance with the Cuban Constitution, they collected approximately 10Â 000 signatures calling for a referendum on a more pluralistic and more democratic Cuba.
For that, they were given extremely long sentences.
The majority of those advocating democracy belong to the Christian and Christian Democratic human rights movement, Movimento Cristiano LiberaciÃ³n.
I, together with MrÂ RibeiroÂ eÂ Castro and 206 other MEPs, took the initiative of inviting Sakharov prizewinnerOsvaldo PayÃ  SardiÃ±as to visit us here in Europe.
Commissioner Nielson, let this invitation bear fruit by putting pressure on the Cuban regime to enable Osvaldo PayÃ  SardiÃ±as to visit us.
Â Â  â Mr President, I must congratulate the organisers of today's debate on their inventiveness.
Having failed to find any other excuse to regurgitate their slander of the Cuban people, they remembered the anniversary of the decisions by the courts which sentenced agents of US imperialism and decided to celebrate it.
However loud you attack socialist Cuba, my dear fellow Members, you cannot deny the fact that Cuba is the only free country on the American continent, the only country where the people take authority into their own hands.
That is why it has endured exclusion, threats and invasion.
That is why the United States of America and the European Union want to overturn the Cuban revolution.
If, therefore, you are truly interested in the people of Cuba and in human rights, organise a debate on its long-term exclusion or on the five Cuban patriots who are rotting in gaol in Miami, without even being able to see their families, because they acted against the terrorism which is striking their country.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have to say that what we have just heard from Mr Alyssandrakis is quite eerily reminiscent of a past that will at last be finally behind us when, in just a few daysâ time, we welcome the States of Central and Eastern Europe into the European Union.
For decades, this House has contended for freedom, human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination in Central and Eastern Europe.
It has helped to sweep away Communism and its dictatorship, banish the ghost of Stalin, tear down the Iron Curtain and now unite the whole of Europe in freedom, and it is positively spooky that a relic of this inhuman ideology such as Mr Alyssandrakis should get up in this House and defend the dictatorship in Cuba.
Let me say it loud and clear, my good friends: we are not, as you suppose, against the Cuban people.
On the contrary, we defend them.
Those who, before 1989, spoke in this House in defence of the Communist dictatorships must be ashamed when their words are dredged up from the Minutes.
In the same way, you too will one day have to be ashamed of what you have said today about Cuba, one of the last brutal and repressive Communist dictatorships in the world.
We do not have an uncritical attitude towards the United States, and God knows that I am not going to defend all the things that a blockade entails.
I take a thoroughly critical view of it.
I have to say, though, that it stands to reason that it is our duty as democrats to defend with all our might Cubaâs democracy movement, the rule of law there, and its freedom, against those who repress them, represented by the old-school Communist Fidel Castro, a man as lacking in understanding as you are, Mr Alyssandrakis, and, like you, forever yesterdayâs man.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is clearly an issue on which this Parliament likes to be divided.
This reflects political reality, but I have one plea. I direct it to Mrs Bergaz Conesa who highlighted Cuba's fine performance in areas such as health, sports and education.
That is fine, but I would add, 'and so what'?
It should be possible, without being misunderstood, to discuss the issue of human rights on its own merits, not just in Cuba, but everywhere.
It is as if this is a sort of balancing game, a sort of political scoreboard relating to the totality of Cuba's situation, character and state of mind politically.
This is not the case.
As I understand it, this is about expressing concern â to put it mildly â on human rights issues there, and as friends of that nation we in Europe are entitled to do that here without being seen as escalating or creating even more problems than we have already.
The Commission shares Parliament's concern about the human rights situation in Cuba.
We need to see progress on democracy and the opening-up and normalising of political life, especially now, one year after the mass detention of dissidents.
In our analysis things have not improved.
The EU continually follows the situation of political prisoners through the Human Rights Working Group in Havana and through contacts with family members of those imprisoned.
Last February, the wives and mothers of the political prisoners expressed their appreciation to the European institutions for the support they give.
The European Union intends to continue to raise the cases of prisoners of conscience with the Cuban authorities and to exert the pressure we can for real democratic reform and respect for human rights in Cuba.
The recent declaration by the Council presidency, congratulating the Cuban journalist RaÃºl Rivero on the award of the Word Press Freedom Prize from Unesco, called again on the Cuban authorities to release all the imprisoned dissidents without delay.
The Member States supported the recent resolution on Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission, lamenting the sentencing of political dissidents and journalists last year and expressing hope that the government of Cuba will take measures to promote the full development of democratic institutions and civil liberties.
The European Union considers dialogue with Havana important to promote political, economic and civil rights reforms.
However, positive moves by Cuba on its political prisoners are needed.
If Cuba took concrete steps to improve the human rights situation, I am sure that the European Union would immediately respond.
We regret the current situation.
We not only see scope for improvement, we also see the for improvement.
The Commission supports Parliament's initiative to invite Oswaldo PayÃ¡.
Our delegation in Havana is in regular contact with him and is trying to facilitate the visit.
Finally, despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission remains willing to provide aid to promote democracy and improve living standards for ordinary Cubans.
We regret the lower level of activity in what we are doing together for the time being and, without wanting to create further political tension, we hope and work for a normalisation of the situation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I requested the floor on a personal matter because the stand taken by Mr Posselt, who did not make the effort to listen to me, whereas I made the effort to listen to him when he spoke, has gone beyond the bounds of political confrontation.
I can accept any political argument in response to the political arguments which I put forward.
I cannot, however, under any circumstances accept revenge policies, excommunications and witch hunts.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following four motions for resolutions presented by:
â Stephen Hughes, Margrietus J. van den Berg, Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Gillig and Anna Karamanou, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the PSE, Jean Lambert, Theodorus J.J. Bouwman and Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Gerhard Schmid, Emmanouil Bakopoulos and Dimitrios Koulourianos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0191/2004);
â Anne Elisabet Jensen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0200/2004);
â Bartho Pronk, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0202/2004);
â Brian Crowley, on behalf of the UEN Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0191/2004).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the holding of the 2004 Olympic Games at their birthplace, in Greece, is a very good opportunity for us to highlight the humanitarian values connected with the Olympic spirit and with the letter of the Olympic Charter, which emphasises respect for fundamental human rights throughout the world.
On the basis, therefore, of the serious violations of the rights of workers which we have noted, including of a great many women and children, in the production of sports clothing and footwear, we call on the European Commission to take initiatives and to demand that sport article industries and their world federations apply the rules of the International Labour Organisation.
The Commission also needs to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in order to ensure that the International Olympic Committee includes respect for the internationally accepted rights of workers in the Olympic Charter and the Ethics Code.
We also call on the International Olympic Committee to demand that contracts concluded with sponsors and commercial companies include compliance with internationally recognised employment standards and fundamental rights.
In other words, all products which bear the logo of the International Olympic Committee must have been manufactured in accordance with the rules of the International Labour Organisation.
I should also like, Commissioner, to stress the importance of a campaign to raise awareness and inform Europeans in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in ancient times when the Olympic Games were being held in Greece, all wars stopped for the duration of the games.
What a pity that this no longer happens.
It was a tribute to human individuality and dignity.
However, now we see that it is precisely sports shoes that have become a symbol for human exploitation.
This resolution is a justified response to this exploitation.
The standards of the International Labour Organisation ought to be binding throughout the world.
The reverse is true at present.
Ethical investors are punished because they are the victims of unfair competition.
We must devise systems of inspection and raise awareness among our consumers and trade unions.
The International Olympic Committee should not permit advertising of goods that are not made according to ethical standards.
Europe should use these ILO standards not only as a label demonstrating social acceptability and fair trade but also as an organisational principle that we regard as binding for imports and exports.
Of course, that is not yet possible but I hope that we can develop a strategy towards this end, so that in years to come when the Olympic Games take place we will be able to say that the rules for equitable world trade and production methods have been integrated into the world trade system itself.
It is tempting to look well into the future.
For example, Flanders is now putting itself forward as a candidate to host the 2016 Olympic Games.
Can we not say that by 2016 we want a fairer world trade system based not on market value but on human dignity?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Olympic Charter and its fundamental principles stress that Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.
It is therefore crucial that these fundamental principles embrace respect for core labour standards in the production of sports articles for the Olympic Games.
Today, in the context of such production, the failure to respect labour law as laid down by the International Labour Organisation has been observed.
Several factors indicate that many sports articles are produced by subcontracting firms which, through their improper conditions of work and employment, breach not only labour law, but also human rights. They do so by failing to respect humane working hours, by not giving their employees a safe and healthy workplace and, in addition, by providing nothing like decent and reasonable remuneration.
Again, the problems relating to child labour might also be cause for reflection.
We also call on the sports industry to be vigilant in tackling this unfortunate state of affairs, which it is greatly responsible for and party to, and we call on it to adopt and respect, as quickly as possible, a genuine code of good ethical conduct, aimed at increasing human dignity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Nielson, the lack of respect for ILO (International Labour Organisation) labour rights perpetuates poverty and hampers development by driving wages down and denying education â something that constitutes a violation of human dignity.
We know that the production of sportswear and athletic footwear is organised through an elaborate international system of subcontractors.
Therefore, the European Parliament today expresses the view that the issue of working conditions for employees, especially in the developing world, must be addressed by the Commission and the International Olympic Committee.
Some leading sportswear manufacturers and socially responsible investment firms have also stated that the current ruthless business and labour practices in the global supply chain are unsustainable, lead to unfair competition and constitute an obstacle to sound enterprise.
There is also anxiety amongst ourselves, as consumers, regarding irregularities where conditions of employment and labour are concerned.
I would therefore appeal to yourself, Commissioner Nielson, and to the Commission to add to all your very many other tasks that of taking such action in respect of the International Olympic Committee and the business and sports sector and its subcontractors as to ensure that they recognise the ILOâs international labour standards and such action as to ensure that these labour standards are incorporated into the International Olympic Committeeâs regulations.
This is an issue of human dignity.
I wish you success, Commissioner, in this important work.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I think, it is only proper to thank the manufacturers of sporting goods for providing the least developed countries with employment, wages and taxes.
That there is room for improvement here is not a matter of dispute.
My belief is that we should concentrate on commending, and publicly encouraging, those who adhere to the ILO's rules.
We should call them in front of the curtain and congratulate them on maintaining standards.
We should be showing them how best practice works even in the least developed countries; such incentive systems would, I believe, be the best way in which we could help promote economic activity in these countries.
We stress the importance of acknowledging and integrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and also especially family firms as suppliers, and of encouraging that both internationally and globally by means of objective and proper invitations to tender.
Â Â  . The European Commission supports the strengthening of core labour standards and social governance in the context of globalisation.
It has taken various policy initiatives in this field.
It considers that more should be done to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation, and will contribute to the follow-up to the report recently presented by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation established by the International Labour Organisation.
With regard to the Olympic Games, the European Commission financially supports the implementation of the Charter of Intent adopted by the Organising Committee for the Winter Olympic Games in Turin in 2006.
This sets out the organising committee's commitment to dealing with ethical, environmental and social issues and to reporting on the social impact of the activities and compliance with the ethical standards.
This initiative could also be very relevant for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.
The European Commission also contributes to the promotion of corporate social responsibility, workers' rights and decent work in the sports goods industry.
It encourages the involvement and commitment of all actors, for example to combating the use of child labour in the production of FIFA-licensed sportswear and footballs.
A similar approach covering all core labour standards could be developed for the upcoming Olympic Games with relevant partners such as the global trade unions, broader civil society, the International Olympic Committee, the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry, the different brands and companies and the ILO.
The Commission will continue its efforts to promote a more cohesive approach to harnessing globalisation, also tackling issues such as the application of fair rules in global supply and production chains.
This is what the Commission can provide in response to the concerns raised.
However, with the organisers of the Olympic Games having given up the ideals of amateurism and voluntarily buried themselves in the deep dark hole of big money, there is a limit to what we can expect from them in the sphere economic ethics.
They represent just another case in which we could discuss corporate social responsibility.
In my view they are not a special case.
They lost their innocence ages ago.
The real problem is so huge that we must dig deep into our resources to continue the broader general struggle of ensuring decency triumphs in a world capable of producing child labour, etc. â with or without the Olympic Games.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions tabled by:
â Niall Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Nigeria (B5-0194/2004);
â Charles Tannock, John Alexander Corrie, Lennart SacrÃ©deus and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Nigeria (B5-0203/2004);
â Didier Rod, Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin and Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Nigeria (B5-0205/2004);
â Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Nigeria (B5-0206/2004);
â Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the PSE, on Nigeria (B5-0209/2004);
â Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Nigeria (B5-0211/2004);
â Yasmine Boudjenah, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Nigeria (B5-0213/2004).
Â Â  Mr President, Nigeria is Africa's most populous state.
It is a regional superpower and has made progress in terms of democracy, as well as contributing to vital peacekeeping military operations to settle regional conflicts.
It is also a member of the ACP and the Commonwealth.
I have many Nigerians living in London, my constituency.
Like a number of other countries with co-existing Muslim and Christian communities, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, there have been periodic clashes.
This most recent outburst of violence in the Nigerian state of Plateau is particularly troubling as not only has the violence been horrendous, but also there is evidence that Islamist extremists have been recruited from neighbouring Muslim countries, such as Chad and Niger, possibly with international Islamic terrorist connections.
Sadly, Nigeria is a country divided by ethnic and religious differences and every effort must be made by the government to build solidarity and social cohesion nationally.
The introduction of Sharia law since 1999 has been particularly divisive and we have witnessed the imposition â although not yet carried out â of lapidation, or stoning to death sentences on women convicted of the so-called crime of adultery.
It is only a matter of time before this issue resurfaces to disturb the consciences again of the western world.
In the past, I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring.
After all, the 1999 Nigerian Constitution guarantees total freedom of belief, and the country has signed international convenants on human rights.
Therefore, I appeal to the federal and state authorities of this big African country to rapidly re-establish law and order, conduct a full investigation into the identity of the culprits and, in particular, where there has been outside provocation or infiltration, bring all those concerned speedily to justice.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long to discuss the enormous problems facing the large and densely-populated country of Nigeria.
We were present as guests along with the ACP conference when Mr Obasanjo 'replaced' the military set-up with a democratic system.
Hope was strong and sincere.
But since then thousands of people have died in ethnic conflicts and all manner of violent clashes.
We were also in Kano, in the north, where a wonderful Islamic culture is flourishing and had the opportunity to compare this culture with that of other regions in the south.
But this astonishing diversity of tribes, ethnic groups and cultures risks being submerged in severe armed conflict.
Oil, which ought to be this large country's blessing, is in fact a curse because it is used mainly to buy arms and set up one power base against another.
Smaller groups, like the Ogoni people, are at risk of becoming the victims of all this.
I believe that we must take Nigeria seriously in the context of the ACP and that we must closely monitor what is happening in this large country, because it is a kind of Africa in miniature.
I hope that the recommendations contained in our resolutions, focusing mainly on the danger of intolerance, the danger of Sharia law in those countries, stoning women and so on, are taken to heart because there is a risk that the whole situation could degenerate further if we are not much more closely engaged in dialogue, but also with strong sanctions if the rules are flouted.
Â Â  Mr President, can anyone justify an attack on a church where women, men and children are worshipping?
When the attackers shout at them to surrender and lie face down on the ground, only to kill them mercilessly with machetes and axes?
Thousands dead, many tens of thousands fleeing, hundreds of churches burned, fear.
The only thing the victims did wrong was to be Christians.
These dreadful things are happening in central and northern Nigeria.
The perpetrators are, once again, Muslim fundamentalists.
Not all of them are Nigerian, some are Islamic mercenaries from Chad and Niger.
It has been discovered that some of the funds needed to pay for this sort of horrific murderous spree come from Saudi Arabia.
What should be done?
Further to this resolution, I call on the Nigerian authorities to take immediate effective measures to protect their fellow-citizens, especially Christians, who are continuing to suffer from the ongoing attacks.
They must also take steps to put an end to this Islamic terrorism, by preventive action if necessary, and to abolish Sharia law in the twelve states where it has been introduced. If the government does not take firm action to deal with the violence, we would be justified in fearing that Nigeria could become the stage for a religious war.
I call on the Council and the Commission to monitor this situation closely and to press the Nigerian authorities to take effective action.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ethnic and religious violence in Nigeria has concerned our Parliament on countless occasions.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, has repeatedly intervened and denounced the revival of religious hatred in Nigeria, especially against women, with the application of Islamic 'Sharia' law, which even makes provision for sentencing by stoning for adultery, over and above the laws and Constitution of Nigeria and also over and above the Cotonou Agreement and the clauses about respecting human rights and women's rights.
It would appear, Commissioner, that the Nigerian Government either does not have the power or the political will to impose the 1999 Constitution and the laws on the country.
Recent violence by fundamentalists and the outbreak of religious violence in the state of Plateau, which has cost 1 500 people their lives and destroyed 173 churches, is the culmination of a series of bloody events in which Islamic extremists are the protagonists.
In my opinion, the European Commission should exploit its powers and international standing to contribute more actively towards strengthening security, putting an end to the violence and promoting respect for religious tolerance and basic human rights in Nigeria.
In other words, we need closer cooperation and pressure on the Nigerian Government and President Obasanjo so that the Constitution and laws are applied in the country.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Nigeria, the largest African country with 120 million inhabitants, seems to be under permanent threat of implosion.
This oil-producing country,where the extreme wealth of a tiny minority contrasts with the extreme poverty of the population, is once again the scene of religious confrontations which, last month, caused 20 deaths when a village was attacked in the state of Plateau, a state principally inhabited by Christians.
For a long time, this region has been plunged into a genuine conflict between Islamic and Christian fundamentalists.
It is a conflict that has already killed more than 100 people in the region since February.
These sad events once again show that poverty and the social divide, added together, constitute the ideal breeding ground for all fundamentalists.
Today, Sharia law is practised in 11 northern states out of the 36 states of the Nigerian Federation.
In order to react to the Islamic threat, governors of the South, where animists and Christians are in the majority, have created a forum for the Southern states.
There are reports that in all areas, including in the institutions, mechanisms that could lead to a new explosion in the country are being put in place.
Today, faced with this spiral of violence affecting a battered population, we are anxious strongly to condemn any type of intolerance and religious violence.
Since 1999, thousands of people have perished following inter-community confrontations.
At the time, the detonator had been the introduction of Sharia law in several northern states.
We are therefore calling on the Nigerian Government to take the necessary measures and find a practical solution designed to bring this ethnic and religious violence to an end as soon as possible. We hope, moreover, that this will not just be one more debate in our institution.
Â Â  â Mr President, we must take a very firm stand against the human rights violations and acts of aggression in Nigeria; about that there can be no doubt.
In contrast to Islam, which is a great world faith, Islamism is a criminal ideology, and a very clear distinction must be drawn between the two.
We have to be careful, though, not to consider these things from one angle alone.
As we know, most of the states in West Africa are artificial creations drawn on the map by the colonial powers, so that peoples in the South are divided, two examples being the Ibo and the Ewe, who are Christians and animists and live on both sides of the border.
The same can be said of the peoples of the North, the Hausa and Fulbe, most of whom are Muslims and also live in a variety of states.
This simply happens to be the way these statesâ borders were drawn; never, throughout history, have they corresponded with the ethnic realities.
This is something that has to be clear to us, and this is something for which we Europeans really do share responsibility.
The resolution quite rightly refers to the state of Plateau.
It is in Plateau that these ethnic groups collide, and the situation is made even more acute by economic inequalities and migratory flows.
The whole place is a highly unstable melting pot and could easily explode.
It also has to be borne in mind that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic state, one of the most populous countries in the world and probably the most populous in Africa, and that there are massive oil interests at stake there, so it really does call for extremely sensitive handling and subtle thinking.
That notwithstanding, what I would like to say to MrsÂ AndrÃ©-LÃ©onardis that it is taking sophistry a bit too far to say that there is fundamentalism in both the Christian and Islamic camps.
There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria.
There is no Islamic fundamentalism there either; there is, instead, on the one hand, this complex conflict situation, and, on the other, Islamist ideologues attempting to exploit it for their own ends.
If we are to address this situation, we need sound knowledge of these countriesâ history and ethnic make-up; only then will we be able to support the peace process and prevent Nigeria from disintegrating in a bloody war compared with which the carnage in the former Yugoslavia will seem trivial.
That, as has been said, is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process, but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries, on which we can draw in our deliberations.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, I feel that this parliamentary resolution is most timely, since it addresses what is possibly the most serious human rights problem that we face at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
The situation in Nigeria is extremely delicate, but is not unique.
It is repeated elsewhere, in Sudan, for example, although this has not been sufficiently publicised in view of public attention on Iraq, where events are all the more unforgivable since they are occurring with the complicity of armed forces from the European Union.
I feel that what we are seeing is a fanatical regime gradually taking hold, in particular in Southern Iraq, in Basra to be specific.
This is a regime in which Christians are persecuted, alcohol is banned, western clothes are banned and veils must be worn, and all of this is happening with the complicity of the British troops on the ground.
The real issue at the heart of the situation in Nigeria is Islamic fanaticism.
This is more of an issue than the existence in the country of people of various ethnic backgrounds and beliefs, which is the case in most corners of the globe and is the result of the way in which history has unfolded.
This problem must be combated, and we must not continue to play it down for the sake of short-term commercial interest or our oil-based diplomacy.
This strikes me as the overriding message that we must convey to the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the Commission shares the concern at conflicts between communities in Nigeria and condemns all attacks and violence, whether apparently ethnic, religious or social, etc. in origin.
We caution against a simplistic analysis of the situation which focuses on just one area or religious group.
The violence is often related to conflicts over access to resources or triggered by political tensions.
In the case of Plateau State, the causes of violence are related to both these reasons and the perpetrators have come from both sides of the community.
It is factually wrong to describe this as something driven only by Islamic fundamentalists.
For information, I would add that Plateau State is not a state which applies Sharia law, and it is not likely to because it has an overwhelming Christian majority composed of groups of indigenous people and settlers.
In very manycases, there is a sort of social clash between incomer settler groups and the original inhabitants â a version of a conflict that we see in very manyother places.
The problem with understanding Nigeria is that there are several layers of problems, and each layer is normally enough to create a conflict.
Therefore this complex situation is something we really have to respect in order to do something useful.
For the second time this afternoon I have to say that I agree with Mr Posselt's contribution.
We have similar views on this situation.
His reference to Yugoslavia is also very important because there we have assisted in a so-called solution which is contrary to what we, for very good reasons, find necessary for Africa, namely to avoid changing the geography.
Even though we gave them nonsensical borders, Europe and others rightly agree with Africa itself that, as long as Africa does not want to change the borders, we definitely should not advise it to do that, even if it is difficult.
Conflicts between communities in Nigeria have been evident for some time and we have been following the situation as part of the early warning system for conflict which the Commission is setting up.
The Commission has also adapted its cooperation programme to reflect that situation.
Support for human rights in Nigeria is a significant component of our cooperation strategy for the country.
Nigeria was also selected as a focal country for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to respond to precisely the sort of concerns raised by Parliament.
Three projects were approved last year, including one with a Nigerian NGO working in Plateau State and Kaduna State to promote peace between Muslims and Christians.
The project also covers improving the drafting and application of Sharia law in conformity with the guarantees of religious freedom provided in the Nigerian constitution as well as respect for the international conventions providing protection for human rights which the country has signed.
In other words, reasonable co-existence between Sharia law and the constitution of Nigeria is an option.
This is what the country is trying to organise.
I mention this simply by way of a warning that we must not move blindly in one direction without really reflecting on the complexities involved.
As I have already said, other conflicts relating to religious differences are very important and we should be careful not to overlook or marginalise these other aspects.
If we fail to understand this, we will not be of much use in a dialogue aimed at stopping the conflicts.
Social, economic and ethnic problems â all these other layers of problems I have mentioned â have to be given a proper place in the analysis.
At federal level the Commission is working with Member States to strengthen political dialogue with Nigeria.
This dialogue is one of the instruments provided by the Cotonou Agreement and the Federal Government is participating actively in that dialogue.
We have adapted to the special realities of Nigeria, where the states play a powerful role, and in fact the bulk of our work relating to water and sanitation is being done in six of the 36 states that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
We have chosen the six states not on the basis of where it is easiest to work, but where need is greatest.
Although, in so doing, we are inviting problems, this is the most meaningful way of working on matters that relate to the core of the problems underlying what we are discussing here this afternoon.
We share this House's call for the Federal Government to do everything in its power to protect its citizens, put an end to violence and promote respect of human rights, including of course freedom of religion.
We hope that Parliament's adoption of a resolution which is balanced on this issue will be seen as meaningful encouragement along these lines.
Â Â  Mr RÃŒbig has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, may I make a request?
I would like an investigation into whether, during the vote on the van Hulten report, it was noted by Mr Ferber and recorded in the Minutes, that a Member was not present, which that Member subsequently confirmed.
Is he entitled to call for a subsequent correction of the vote, which did not take place in the Chamber, which the Minutes indicate that he did?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig.
We take note of what you say, which will be dealt with in the appropriate manner.
Â Â  My request to you, Mr President, is that, when we sign ourselves into the central register tomorrow morning, we should be given ample protection from the media, who we expect to be there, and who are working for a certain Mr Martin.
Although we have nothing to hide, we do not want to be harassed.
Let me assure this House right now that I would not, until very recently, have thought it even possible that I could have been systematically spied on by a certain Mr Martin, using his buttonhole camera, since at least 2002.
I was not aware of being spied on.
Had I been aware of it, I would have given this MrÂ Martin a wide berth ever since 2002.
I am equally strong in my condemnation of certain German media, who are making use of a certain MrÂ Martin as what they call their principal witness and have thereby subjected me, among others, to a disgusting campaign of defamation in Germany.
Here in this House, I have always obeyed the rules as they were in force at the time.
Â Â  Mr President, as a personal reference has been made to me, I am glad to have been given the opportunity to reply to it, so that it is not only others who can bandy statements about in this House.
I just want to make it clear that it is in no way the case that there are people in the media working for me.
I also want to make it clear that I have not been using a camera concealed in my buttonhole, and, above all, that I am very sorry, for the sake of Europe's taxpayers and voters, that it is evidently still not understood in this House that the rules are the problem and that a self-service mentality has got a foothold in this place.
What this shows, quite simply, is that only pressure from the public will bring about awareness of the need for reform, which has been long in coming and is what a number of my fellow-Members and I are working for.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that I had expected more from Mr Martin's statement.
I thought he was going to explain why the Minutes state that he voted on many of the amendments to the van Hulten report, even though he was not in the Chamber at all.
It is an inexplicable phenomenon how someone can claim to have voted on innumerable amendments, even though he was outside.
We could all do the same thing, with interviews of one sort or another out there and, later on, the President's lists...
Â Â  We are not going to deal with this issue any further.
It has been fully debated in recent days and the President of Parliament has made several eloquent statements in relation to it.
The debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are closed.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote(1).
(2)
Â Â  . I agree with the overall thrust of this report, which notes with concern that the regionâs economic decline has a greater negative impact on women than on men and that the feminisation of poverty is growing rapidly.
I should like to highlight the fact that poverty and unemployment, combined with a strong patriarchal tradition, are the main causes of prostitution, trafficking in women and violence against women.
Womenâs human resources, which are relatively plentiful due to womenâs generally high standard of education, are under-utilised in the economic, social and culturaldevelopment of the region because of discriminatory practices and prejudices.
Accordingly, the governments of South-East Europe, in the light of increasing religious fundamentalism and the return to patriarchal societies, must guarantee fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights and freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
They must also ensure that tradition does not impinge upon personal autonomy or violate women's rights and the principle of gender equality.
I am concerned to note that, in most countries in South-East Europe, the rate of womenâs participation in political life is currently below 20%, which, in comparison with other parts of Europe represents the highest level of exclusion of women from...
Â Â  . Human rights violations in the Western Balkans are particularly alarming and must, therefore, be condemned.
As Mrs Karamanou rightly points out, however, problems do exist that are not solely related to women.
I agree with the special emphasis accorded to womenâs rights, yet there are other problems, which, given their magnitude, are worthy of greater concern.
Indeed, the rapporteur acknowledges that positive developments have taken place in the situation of women.
Let us not forget that some of these countries only acquired their independence relatively recently, and that they have lived through periods of major instability, and in some cases even war.
This region is made up of a variety of ethnic and cultural groups.
Major change does not, therefore, occur overnight.
In light of all of these points, I abstained in the vote on the resolution.
I feel that the European Union must redouble its efforts to raise the level of development in these countries, and not to focus all its attention on the situation in one group only, whichever that may be.
In so doing, we will see not only positive development for women, but also, more importantly, a reduction in many of the problems that ravage the Western Balkans.
Â Â  . The call to eliminate the use, production, storage and transfer of anti-personnel landmines is right and appropriate.
We are particularly concerned to note the existence of vast mined areas, which claim thousands of victims â mostly children â and which prevent people from returning to their homes, from cultivating their land and from starting their lives afresh following military conflict.
This situation must stop.
We must mobilise, as swiftly and effectively as possible, the resources required to clear mined areas, to help with the social and economic rehabilitation of victims and to destroy stockpiles of anti-personnel mines.
It is similarly shocking that the United States â the country leading the arms race and the one that undertakes the highest number of military interventions â has announced that it will not sign up to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, and that it has decided to retain its 8.8Â million so-called âintelligentâ anti-personnel mines (equipped with self-destruction mechanisms).
The USA has also said that it will only stop using âconventionalâ anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines after 2010, or, put another way, four years after the previously agreed deadline.
Â Â  Parliament has reached the end of its agenda(1).
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 22 April 2004.
Â Â  The first item is the formal opening of the first sitting of the enlarged European Parliament.
Colleagues, today it is a very pleasant duty on behalf of Parliament to open this part-session.
This Parliament now comprises the 626 Members elected for the fifth mandate of Parliament and the 162 new Members from the 10 new Member States, which acceded to the European Union on Saturday, 1 May.
It is for our Parliament â as we have already marked in a symbolic ceremony outside â a special and extraordinary moment.
In Dublin last Saturday, Ireland's Nobel literature laureate Seamus Heaney captured this special event with the words 'On a day when newcomers appear, let it be a homecoming.'
This is indeed a homecoming and we are so pleased that so many new colleagues join us today.
It is a moment of hope, a moment that shows that determined will within the European Union, its institutions and Member States can deliver real results: a win-win situation for all involved.
Fifteen years ago, early in 1989, this would have looked like an impossible dream, but it has come true: what a wonderful moment.
From this platform I should like to issue â on behalf of the 626, to the 162 â a heartfelt, warm welcome to this Parliament.
I should like to pay tribute to all who have contributed to this moment, parliamentarians â European and national, Member State governments, many presidencies of the European Council and the determined leadership of the European Commission.
I am sure the House would want me in particular to thank Mr Verheugen for his extraordinary personal leadership.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me also to express the emotion of this moment.
We all felt this emotion when, accompanied by the Ode to Joy, our European anthem, we saw the ten new flags hoisted alongside the 15 already flying on the masts in front of Parliament.
The emotion of a day on which we are seeing the fulfilment of the ambitions and hopes of so many people who have fought for freedom for so many years.
A moment which means overcoming brutal scars, which for too many years have marked an artificial division of our Europe, the division which originated in war, the division which left many European countries separated by this wall of shame, by this completely artificial Iron Curtain, which goes against our very nature, which left all of those countries in a situation of oppression and communist dictatorship.
The twenty-first century must overcome the horrors of the twentieth century, and we are overcoming the horrors we have experienced in Europe for good.
The twenty-first century is the century which will see Europe burst onto the international stage as a leading player, in the concert of nations.
To this end, we must conclude the agreement on the Constitutional Treaty as soon as possible, which would genuinely provide us with the instruments and capacities Europe needs in order to become a reality not only on our continent, but as a principal player on the international stage.
That is what we must all achieve together.
We are witnessing an historic moment in this Parliament.
An historic moment which is a repeat of what we have seen on the television or personally, in some cases, in recent days, on 1 May 2004, which will forever remain a fundamental milestone in Europeâs full recovery.
I would like to say to these 162 new Members of Parliament, Mr President, that we in the Commission hope to continue with the cooperation that has taken place over all these years between the two institutions, together with the Council, building this thrilling project which is Europe.
A project which ultimately seeks peace and to guarantee freedom, democracy, human rights, human dignity, on our continent, but which also wishes to be a beacon and to support our values, our principles and our aspirations at international level.
I would like to say that we see the Commission, and we all agree on this, as the true heart of this European project.
But this heart beats thanks to the support it receives systematically in this Parliament.
This Commission, which has been key to promoting enlargement, this Commission, which throughout these years has been able to promote a cooperative, collaborative and respectful working relationship with Parliament and also with the other essential institution, the Council.
Mr President, these are historic days and moments.
Days which will remain in our memory, which will be an example for future generations: everybody working as one â Parliament, Council and Commission â for this great project, for this great ambition which is Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the hour in which a dream becomes reality, a moment of such magnitude that I have to admit that I am overwhelmed by it and can scarcely keep a grip on my emotions.
A freely-elected European parliament, representing 25 self-aware, free and sovereign European nations, having voluntarily bound themselves together in an association, goes far beyond the boldest hopes of those who first dreamed and thought of European integration.
More now than ever, am I convinced that this great enlargement, which has now been completed, is a shining example of the attractiveness, dynamism and youth of the European ideal, an ideal that has not grown old, and whose attractiveness is demonstrated by the nations that have had to walk a hard road in search of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
This enlargement is also evidence of what we Europeans can do when, together, we get stuck in to a great project and when we have the will to see it through to completion.
There were not many who thought we would do it, and we can take pride in what has been achieved.
As I see it, this is final proof that the idea of European integration has a future.
There are a number of popular beliefs going around at the moment, and I would like to lay them to rest.
Firstly, European integration is not an elite project; this enlargement, in any case, was a matter of the peoplesâ express desire and stated will.
It would not have come about had not the peoples of the Baltic states, the Poles, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Hungarians and the Slovenes made it unequivocally plain that they wanted to belong, once and for all, to the democratic family that the united Europe is, rather than to be left isolated in the no-manâs-land between East and West.
Secondly, this great enlargement makes Europe stronger rather than weaker, both in political and economic terms.
There are risks and problems involved in it, as well we all know, but the chances and opportunities far outweigh the risks, and we have good cause to be optimistic.
Those of you, honourable Members, who hail from the new Member States will have a difficult task back home; you will encounter scepticism and doubt because things are not going as quickly as people would like.
Whether or not the belief in European integration will remain strong enough to sustain future great projects will, to a large degree, depend on you.
Thirdly and finally, joining in this great work of integrating Europe does not mean the surrender of sovereignty or of national identity.
Those who â in both the new and old Member States â assert that European integration means the end of popular sovereignty do not understand the world as it is today.
Not one country in Europe today is capable, on its own, of dealing with the problems that beset us.
Not one country in Europe can cope with the consequences of globalisation on its own.
Not one country can single-handedly balance growth and social justice.
Not one country can, relying on itself alone, win the war against terrorism and international crime.
We can only do it together.
National sovereignty can be exercised and defended only if it is exercised jointly with others.
That is the fundamental idea, and that is why we are here.
I thank all those who have played their part in getting us this far, especially your House and your President, Pat Cox, who has given you firm political leadership.
I wish to thank the committees, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and its Chairman, Mr Brok.
My thanks go to all the political groups that have been with us throughout in a critical and constructive spirit.
From the depths of my heart, I welcome you all here and rejoice at being able to work with you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President de Palacio, Commissioner Verheugen, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to start by saying something personal.
It is my privilege to have been a Member of this House ever since 1979, when it was, for the first time, directly elected.
If, during the 1979 election campaign, somebody had said that, on 1 May 2004, the European Unionâs Member States would include three nations occupied by the Soviet Union â those being Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, part of Communist Yugoslavia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus â the latter of which will, we hope, one not too distant day be a united country â then, in 1979, when the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our answer would probably have been that this was a lovely vision, a wonderful dream, and a great hope, but that we feared that this dream, this vision, this hope â much though we desired it â would not become reality in our lifetime.
That dream has become reality.
The fact that we are able, today, to welcome 162 Members of this Parliament from these 10 countries makes this a great day for democracy, and a great deal for parliamentarianism.
Let us rejoice that we can welcome as colleagues our new Members today!
Let us not forget that it was our House, with every political group playing its part, that insisted that we would be negotiating not merely with five countries but with 12, and that those who were not yet ready would be given the opportunity to catch up.
The fact that ten countries have joined the European Union today is attributable to our demand, in this House, that the negotiations should include Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and they have made it.
We should congratulate them all.
Let us not forget that, as we know, the reports on the European Parliament in the media do not always reflect the decisions taken in it.
It was our House that demanded a timetable for the negotiations â which the Commission and the Nice Summit accepted â so that they could be completed in time, enabling the countries capable of doing so, and their people, to take part in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament.
It was our House that did that!
That is what we should be telling people, and it is something of which we can be proud, for it helps to make democracy real in Europe and to give the people of the ten countries the opportunity to send freely-elected representatives to the European Parliament.
Let us rejoice in that!
Everyday life will soon catch up with us, and, necessary though great speeches are, it is not by them that Europe is maintained.
Today is a wonderful day, as 1 May was, but everyday life will soon overtake us; we will discuss things, we will argue about things too, but we, the people of the European Union, must remind ourselves of what is new and represents a great opportunity; that the great thing about this European Union is that our discussions and arguments are now carried on with words, no longer by force and weaponry.
That is a great step forward for our continent of Europe in the twenty-first century.
My dear friends âŠ perhaps my addressing you as âdear friendsâ was a slip of the tongue, and I apologise, but we do somehow belong to one another through our shared ideal of European unity.
At the impressive ceremony outdoors, Mr President, we heard not only from you, with your impressive speech, but from Lech Walesa.
He embodies solidarity, and solidarity must mean for all of us a future in which we of course have to respect the national interests of individual countries, such as those of the Baltic States with their minorities, whilst not jeopardising those countriesâ independence, an obligation that is reciprocal.
Anything else, therefore, we have to speak out against, as Commissioner Verheugen has done, and I would like to thank him for making the important point that this Europe of ours in founded upon solidarity.
That will benefit all of us.
For the first time in its long millennia of history, this continent has the opportunity to face the future in peace and partnership.
This is our continent, an ancient continent endlessly renewing itself, and nobody will succeed in dividing us.
Side by side, we walk into the future together; this is a great day for us all!
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in particular those of you from the ten new countries joining us.
First of all, Mr President, I would like to thank you and congratulate you because you have been a worthy representative of the European Parliament during these events.
I would also like to thank and congratulate the Prodi Commission and in particular Commissioner Verheugen for having pushed ahead with this task.
Today we have a date with history and with our future.
By means of the decisive step we took last Saturday we are taking a great and historic step forward by bringing together the majority of the landmass and population of our continent, for the first time in history, without an emperor, a king, a general or a dictator deciding to do so.
This is a decision taken freely by all of us.
And that is what makes the difference.
We have heard the Ode to Joy by Beethoven, who was also someone who fought for freedom, and political censorship made him change the word to , and I therefore believe that we should call it the Ode to Joy and Freedom, because it is freedom which has united all of us.
We have been able to take this step because we believe in democracy, in freedom, in respect for human rights, in governance, in the rule of law and in a secular Union which respects everybody's beliefs and philosophies.
This is what has allowed us to unite in these circumstances.
It is democracy that has allowed this to happen.
Nor must we forget that on this continent we have lived through a twentieth century which has been the age of extremes and during part of which Nazi, fascist and communist dictatorships have predominated.
First there was the liberation of Europe following the world war and then a chain reaction which has been gathering pace; little more than a week ago we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Revolution of the Carnations in Portugal, which was a key event in terms of ending the dictatorship of Salazar; then my country joined ...
... then we had in Poland; then came the fall of the Berlin Wall and now we are consolidating what we have done following that event, with the entry of the ten new Members.
My Greek colleagues point out to me that they also defeated a fascist dictatorship, I believe that we can all congratulate ourselves because we have had to fight to win freedom and I also hope that now, with the entry of the ten new Members we can complete this historic process and that we do not have to wait long for the Republic of Cyprus to be reunited, since this too is an essential step.
Never before in European history have so many people lived together in peace, democracy, under the rule of law and on the basis of a shared sovereignty and destiny.
Europe is being reborn.
This is a great challenge and a process of historic construction of the greatest importance, not only to live interdependently, but also to respond to globalisation; Europe has a great deal to contribute.
We have great challenges before us; firstly, to overcome our own fears, and we must not forget that the general public does have these fears; we must work to educate and explain, pointing out that the opportunities far outweigh the costs, and that we are prepared to confront that complexity.
Why?
Because there is a spirit of solidarity and furthermore foundations which maintain us and fortify us through shared values.
Shared values which are based on mutual tolerance and fraternity.
The engagement â a long one â has come to an end, and we have wed.
We now share the same house and the same future.
Now we are a family with not just the same rights, but also with the same obligations, and this applies to those that were present at the outset, those of us that have joined, such as my own country and others, and those that are joining now.
I believe that the best thing we could do to end this legislature and move on to this Europe of 25 Member States is to ensure the conclusion of the process of definitively approving the European Constitution which, fortunately, has been unblocked since March.
I am justifiably proud to come from a country that has allowed the deadlock to be broken.
I believe we should call on the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, and the Intergovernmental Conference, which you will have to address, Mr President, to fulfil its duty and its historic responsibility so that we may have a European Constitution by June.
That is the next stage, which will complete this successful round of enlargement.
I hold out my hand as a mark of friendship to all our new friends and colleagues joining us today.
Â Â  I should like to welcome to the House the former Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr Gyula Horn, under whose premiership the borders first opened in 1989.
Â Â  Mr President, as the very first speaker from the new countries I feel deeply moved.
As a Liberal and Hungarian I should like to underline that on 1 May the legacy of the dreadful Yalta Pact was deservedly consigned to the dustbin of history.
This is the most important thing, and I should like to express my thanks to you all for this.
Please permit me to give my special thanks to the ELDR and the Liberal family, because the Liberals were already firm supporters of the enlargement at a time when others were perhaps still hesitating.
I was pleased and proud of the fact that the Liberal group was the only one that voted unanimously for the enlargement, and they considered us to be full members of the group from the very first day.
Now, when some governments have made a last minute decision to prevent the free movement of labour, once again it is only the Liberals who have unanimously rejected these unfair restrictions.
Yalta is over, but Europe has not yet been fully united.
I send you a message from here, that the Liberals want to remain the driving force of enlargement in the future, until Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, even Turkey, and at some point in time, the entire Balkans unite with Europe.
We Hungarians and Liberals will do everything we can to help them comply with the Copenhagen criteria.
Mr President, has the political transformation been a success?
Of course it has, since today we are all here together with you.
However, you must also be aware that the transformation was far, far longer and more painful than we once hoped.
The time has come for people to enjoy the advantages offered by the enlarged Union.
Our people hope to have a life where their hard work bears fruit.
We need to talk a lot about the opportunities offered by the Union.
I am talking about money, but I should like you to know that this is not just about money.
The Union has triumphantly united not only countries but also nations that had previously been at war with each other.
This is why I believe that the Union will provide a splendid resolution of the Trianon trauma.
Borders that have separated people until now will disappear, we will all become valued nations and citizens of Europe with equal standing.
I believe that the Union will change our political culture, hatred will be replaced by fair competition and there will be opportunities for cooperation.
I believe that respect for citizens in the Union will continue to increase, because not just in the countries that are joining now, but in also in the existing members there is a lot to be done in the area of human rights.
We will be able to meet the most important challenges â terrorism for example â in such a way that we do not have to sacrifice our freedom just to protect our lives.
In my capacity as the Liberal leader of 92 Members from 46 European countries in our sister organisation, the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, I also express my thanks to the Council of Europe.
Its contribution in developing our liberal values has been essential and now in this Chamber I reiterate that the role of the Council of Europe, with its 800 million European citizens, continues to be essential in assisting a more democratic, safer and more stable Europe.
These two organisations together can ensure that one day we can really say that Europe, after centuries of division, is now reunited again.
Let me conclude by saying that Europe is already strong and successful but we can make it much stronger and much more successful.
The potential in European citizens is ready to be released.
What else could our task ahead be, other than the freeing of this European potential?
Â Â  Mr President, we are witnessing one of those great moments which the history books of the future will talk about.
Today we are expressing our hope for a Europe of unity, solidarity and peace.
With a view to the many common battles we have before us in order to make this lovely dream into a reality, we warmly welcome the people from the ten new States of the Union.
For several years our group has made visits to those countries to promote dialogue and build partnerships with the forces of progress and with many social actors.
I thought of their hopes and expectations on seeing the moving images of the events in the various capitals marking the enlargement from the Europe of Fifteen to the Europe of Twenty-Five.
The conclusion I draw from this is that, if we want to succeed in this wonderful project, we must have the courage to open up the in-depth debate with all our citizens that we should have launched a long time ago.
It must deal with a fundamental question, which I have often raised here and which is in all our hearts: what do we want to do together and what means should we create in order to achieve it?
So, is not the main of this enlarged Union, for many of our compatriots, to be stronger in order to defend a progressive model of solidarity within globalisation?
If that is the case, we cannot, for example, accept companies in this part of Europe indulging in the blackmail of relocation and, in the other part, seeking the least social and fiscal obligations.
We must reverse this Malthusian approach with no future and accept that the real driving force for our common development is social progress and the promotion of the human capacities of all the peoples of the Union.
All the instruments available to us must be employed in order to achieve this ambition.
In order for enlargement to succeed, it is not sufficient to unite Europe, we must unite the Europeans!
Is not another reason for building this enlarged Union together to recover, for the citizens, the powers that have gradually been handed to market forces?
A document produced by the Commissionâs forward studies unit stated in 1998, and I quote: âthe Europeans are less and less willing to accept being presented with the .
We must allow greater participation by the actors and stake holders.
That is the challenge facing Europe todayâ.
Enlargement increases the urgency of this demand tenfold.
The more we remove borders, the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens.
Otherwise, the law of the jungle will prevail.
We must create new rights for employees, for the general public, we must promote a genuine participative European democracy, from the places where we live and work to the heart of the institutions.
We should set ourselves the objective of uniting the Europeans by means of common projects, with which they identify themselves and which they have crafted.
Finally, what view of the world should the enlarged Europe promote by means of these initiatives?
In a recent article, MrÂ Cimoszewicz, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, wrote, and I quote: âIt is life itself that settles the controversies not resolved by politiciansâ.
That is true.
I am convinced that, in recent times, life has in fact resolved many points which are controversial, particularly on the part to be played by the united Europe in the debate on how the worldâs affairs should be managed.
I believe that those are the challenges we now have to deal with together.
It is in that spirit that I sayÂ âÂ without hesitationÂ âÂ âyes, I welcome the people from the new countries of the Union!â
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not everyone has the opportunity to experience an historic moment such as this: a positive historic moment of peace, of joy, of real progress, where the light of hope can easily outshine the slightly grey cynicism which we often come up against.
It is a great privilege for which we should be proud of and grateful to all the men and women who have made this day a reality.
Europe has not been reunited today: it has been united for the first time, and it is united today as never before, because it has never been united on the basis of democracy and the free will of the peoples.
Over the past few days, when watching the television or personally taking part in the enlargement celebrations, I have found myself thinking often about my grandfather, Roberto, who was born in 1899 in a small town near Mantua, in Italy.
He was part of the final conscription of young men sent to the front during the First World War.
It is also to him and people like him that we should dedicate this day.
Only three generations later and we are celebrating an unimaginable event, one which for a long time we did not even imagine.
How many of us today have the same memories and have suffered the same anguish, but until today it was all characterised by different coloured flags?
Today our joy is painted in the same colours and plays to the same marvellous music.
Nevertheless, this unification â and this is something which we should all know and tell ourselves â is unfinished; it is also pointless to deny that the happiness that we feel today â here, we, perhaps, to a certain extent the initiated â is less intense and more superficial in the streets of our cities, among the people.
This is our challenge, the challenge of our generation: awareness of the path we have travelled must guide us in order to achieve the great dream, as yet incomplete, of a great united and democratic Europe.
Over the next few months, before the end of the year, we have three significant opportunities to address together, not least to win over those who still have not gauged or do not believe in the importance of this day.
The first â as has already been mentioned â is the Constitution.
We still do not have a Constitution and negotiations may have recommenced, but certainly those who are still digging their heels in are very determined.
We still do not have one, and we are not sure that we will have the Constitution that we want.
Today we have to repeat unequivocally: the Constitution we are calling for is the one adopted by the Convention and not the one put forward in part during recent summits and intergovernmental conferences.
The Europe, the Constitution that we want are still in danger, and have not yet been obtained.
Therefore, we must all take action.
The second issue which we must address â and if possible conclude by the end of the year â together in this Chamber, but also in the Commission and the Council, is the Cyprus question.
Here again there is no point being hypocritical: it is a fact that enlargement will not be complete and real until the last wall in Europe has fallen.
This, I repeat, concerns us all, because unfortunately this wall is still standing.
The third and final issue which we must tackle before the end of the year, and which is undoubtedly urgent, is the war in Iraq.
The European Union, both old and new, was unable to stop it and we must acknowledge this too.
Preparing and having peace in that country, in that region, is a responsibility shared by us all, one which we must assume quickly and urgently, otherwise also this day, like certain others, will merely be a collection of rhetoric.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply honoured that it should have fallen to me to utter the first words in Polish in this House.
Polish is the language of over 40 million Europeans.
Before our eyes, ladies and gentlemen, the division of Europe is coming to an end, a division whose sources date back to the Second World War.
In these days of joy and emotion, it is fitting, therefore, to remember all those to whom the New Europe is indebted for its reunification.
I would like to pay homage to the millions of my countrymen, soldiers and civilians, who were victims of the Second World War.
Unfortunately, their blood, spilled on the fields of battle, only secured peace and prosperity for one part of Europe.
I would like to pay homage to all those in Poland and Central Europe who, in the Stalinist era, sustained the flame of freedom on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
Their inspiration was varied: from democratic socialism through liberalism to Christian-democracy and conservatism.
Today we must also pay homage to the political prisoners and victims of the Stalinist terror, although many of them did not live to see a united Europe.
As a Pole, I take particular pride in pointing out to the House that todayâs celebrations would not be taking place were it not for the spiritual inspiration of our great fellow countryman, His Holiness John Paul II.
He inspired , the powerful social movement that led to the fall of Communism.
President Lech Walesa, the leader of this movement became a symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights for the world.
He is our guest today in this Chamber. I also want to recall with pride that the leaders of my party, [Law and Justice], as well as many of its members, were active participants in the movement for political independence that was .
At this time I would also like to express gratitude to two great leaders of the Western world whose steadfast attitude in the eighties helped break the fetters that bound the nations of Eastern and Central Europe.
I would like to thank Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan.
The great task now before us is to make certain that the fruits of the reunification of the continent are fairly divided among all the nations of the New Europe.
Our Union for Europe of the Nations Group will do everything to ensure that the New Europe gives new meaning to the word solidarity.
Â Â  MrÂ President.
Welcome; now, what belongs together is being united.
You are arriving in the nick of time and, with your hard-earned experience, you can help rescue our democracy.
Democracy means bearing with each other on a daily basis and the right to get involved in elections.
It is characterised by our being able to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and, subsequently, new laws and a new government.
We get something in return for our vote.
It can effect change and perform a monitoring function, and it can reward and punish.
It counts.
As a voter, I have some significance.
I help to wield influence.
This simple idea unites us, but it is unfortunately well hidden and not at all up front in the draft Constitution.
We can still take part in national elections and change our vote in the Council of Ministers, but we cannot vote ourselves new laws in those areas in which the EU decides.
We can take part in EU elections every five years but, here too, we cannot vote ourselves new laws or a new government.
The EU President, the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister are all to be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 prime ministers.
The most important posts will presumably go to those who can no longer get elected in their own countries.
Taken to its logical conclusion, this means you can be appointed if you can no longer be elected.
The EU Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are to constitute their government through talks with the prime ministers.
The indirectly appointed President is to decide who he wants from each country on the sole body able to table proposals.
We shall never again be able to table proposals ourselves.
This democratic deficit could be remedied by converting the EU into a democratic federation, but there is no common EU people that is ready for a common democracy.
The only realistic democratic solution is to construct the EU from below as a Europe of democracies.
Every country must have the right to elect its own Commissioner and send him or her to Brussels as our votersâ representative.
Our Commissioner must come home every Friday and say what he has done in the past week and how he will vote during the following week.
We should then have 25 elected representatives in Brussels, answerable to the voters in our countries.
One fine day, we shall be able to unite the whole of Europe in equal cooperation between free nations gathered together to carry out the tasks we cannot successfully discharge in our own democracies. If we focus upon what we cannot deal with ourselves, we have nothing to lose.
In that way, we should gain a share of influence when, otherwise, we should be without influence.
Welcome to the work for openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
Welcome to the fight for a Europe of democracies and diversity.
To our Polish friends, we would say, moreover: congratulations on your national day.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the non-attached Members are too diverse for me to speak other than on my own behalf, apart of course from offering our new colleagues a âvery great welcomeâ.
They have learnt, over a much longer period of time and much more harshly than many of us, what independence and freedom mean.
They have felt it in their flesh and blood, and I believe that, in this House, they will be able to maintain the true meaning of these words, rather than merely going through a rhetorical ritual.
Today Europe is breathing with both of its lungs, the Pope has said.
It is doing so for the first time since the end of the sixteenth century, when the Europe of the Roman Church had exactly the same borders, apart from Greece, as the Europe of 2004.
History does not develop by chance.
This Europe is going to breathe, and that is a good thing.
Please allow me, however, to stress that this breathing is not without its worries.
Europe is asking itself what its nature is and what future it has.
It is asking this question, and the problem of borders, which is currently arising, highlights the point very clearly.
I believe that this concern stems from an initial decision.
Europe would like to be political.
The European Union was created by men, by the founding fathers, who did not want it to be political: they wanted to create an area of peace through law and economics.
But must I remind you that although peace on our continent has been ensured by means of law and economics, it was born out of balances of power and acts of faith?
It was the balance of power at the end of the war which brought peace, or at least ended the war.
It was the balance of power in 1989 which brought down the Berlin Wall.
There have been innumerable acts of faith such as those by de Gaulle and Adenauer, by Walesa, by Prague, by the countries of the East, by Chancellor Kohl reunifying Germany under the very noses of the Soviets.
These are political acts of faith.
If Europe wants to be a power, a real one, if it wants to map out its own destiny, its future, and if it wants to be able to defend, to sustain, to communicate its values, I believe we should return to reality and the reality is that Europe will not be built without the States.
What are the true pillars of reality?
They are the States: it is they who can convince and lead their people not just to agreement on the superficial, but to agreement on the fundamentals.
Not merely agreement on the good things, but also agreement on the difficult things, on crises, on hardships, on those which will inevitably come, since history is always littered with crises and pitfalls.
Unless Europe is constructed with the States, it will be weak, it will be a sort of club founded upon the consumer â it is very interesting to note that we speak more often in this House of the consumer than of the citizen â it may or may not be comfortable, it may or may not be peaceful, it may or may not be rich, but either way it will be weak.
And when one cannot communicate the values one defends, when one is, shall we say, a market, oneâs future depends on predators.
Protectors are often also predators, and I believe we should remember that from time to time.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to make a small request.
On 1Â May, we saw the final defeat of Hitler and Stalin, and the victory of Walesa, Havel, Delors and Kohl.
There are many, though, both in the acceding countries and in the original European Union, and in this House, who have played their part in bringing us to this moment.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to cause to be recorded in todayâs Minutes the names of the ten rapporteurs for the ten countries.
I will read their names in the order of the countriesâ accession: SchrÃ¶der, Poos, Gahler, QueirÃ³, Elisabeth Schroedter, Souladakis, Stenzel, Gawronski, Volcic, and Wiersma; also the three rapporteurs who have passed on their brief to others: Mrs Hoff, Mrs Carlsson and Mr Matella.
I ask you to honour them by having their names recorded.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Brok, the contribution by you and your colleagues will be recorded.(1)
Â Â  âThe Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 22 April 2004 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â Mr President, on a day like today, with its especially important debates on topics laden with emotion, I very much regret that we have to get back to something as banal as Minutes, but we have among us in this House a self-appointed hero, a courageous representative of the gutter press who is capable of anything.
Mr Hans-Peter Martin has now gone so far as to falsify the Minutes of the European Parliament.
Although Mr Martin had his voting on the van Hulten report corrected 13 times over, he was not even present for the vote.
These 13 instances, right up to the final vote, include no fewer than seven votes by roll call, in which the name of Martin is not to be found anywhere in the Minutes.
There were a total of 15 roll call votes on the van Hulten report, and this paragon of rectitude took part in none of them.
All that, therefore, now has to be struck out of the Minutes all over again.
In no document of this House is there room for deception and forgery.
While it is not for me to advise you, Mr President, I find it impossible to refrain from referring to Rule 124 of our Rules of Procedure and to the possibilities afforded by it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I do, of course, strongly repudiate the accusation that I instigated falsification of the Minutes in any shape or form.
I did no more and no less than to avail myself of my rights as a Member of this House.
Â Â  â The Minutes will record that the corrections do not stand on the grounds that the votes in question had not been cast.
Â Â  Mr President, in an interview with Mr Martin on prime time television in Ireland on Wednesday last week, I challenged him on two issues.
I quote from the transcript of the programme: 'I want to put two questions to Mr Martin, if you don't mind.
Is it not true, Mr Martin, that a Cologne court earlier this week ordered you to refrain from attacking the integrity of your fellow German MEPs on this issue or it will fine you EUR 250 000 or indeed imprison you for six months?
The second question I want to ask you, bearing in mind that you claim to be interested in reforming the expenses system, concerns the vote in the European Parliament last week.
In fact I think there were just under 20 votes where proposals were being made to reform the expenses system and you were absent from every one of them.
It seems to me that this is not the action of someone who is interested in reforming the system, it is the action of a hypocrite.
You are proving what Pat Cox said about you, that you are doing this purely for personal publicity and not for genuine reasons.'
This is the man who is attacking our integrity and who is masquerading as a crusader.
This is his answer â and people should listen to it â about Mrs Gebhardt.
'I have never ever made these claims.
I am an Austrian.
I have never heard of these lawsuits or claims.
I am very much surprised that they have suddenly come up with this.'
The states: 'The court in Cologne advised Mr Martin not to further damage the reputation of Evelyne Gebhardt, threatening to sentence him to a fine of EUR 250 000 if he repeated his allegations.
He further went on to say: 'As far as the participation in the vote, I was there.'
The interviewer then asked me: 'Is there not a need for some reform?
Do you accept that some reform is necessary?'
I replied: 'Absolutely necessary.
We voted for it some time ago, but who stopped it?
Not the Parliament, it was the presidency, particularly the German and British Governments.'
MrÂ Martin interjected: 'But for additional privileges.'
I said: 'I also repeat: we voted it for last week again, but the alleged great crusader Mr Martin was absent for almost 20 votes.'
He said again: 'No, I was taking part in the votes â don't repeat this claim.'
I replied: 'You did not take part in the votes, the records show that.'
He then replied: 'I did, just look at the Minutes.'
He is a deceitful masquerader, damaging our reputation.
Someone like him has no part in public life.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Cushnahan, for returning to the Minutes at the end of your remarks.
Â Â  â Mr President, I do indeed repudiate all these insinuations and these utterly shabby assertions.
Let me repeat that, at this vote too, on being called on to speak as the vote came to an end, what I said was that I had availed myself of my rights as a Member of this House.
How that is to be recorded in the Minutes is a matter for Parliamentâs administration.
I have already told the House what the actual circumstances were.
As regards what Mrs Gebhardt has said, I would like to reiterate, for the Minutes, that I have received no summons from the court in question, neither have I had any sort of direct communication from them, and I can only say that I never made the assertions attributed to me by the Press.
That being so, I do not find it in the least difficult to refrain from repeating them, as I am in fact acquainted with MrsÂ Gebhardtâs circumstances, and have never said anything of the sort.
All this is part and parcel of a reaction that Members of this House may find understandable, but the public will certainly know what value to attach to it.
Â Â  The final draft agenda adopted by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 29 April 2004 has been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, I could not believe my eyes when I looked at this week's agenda; as you said, tomorrow, we will be voting on a request for the application of urgent procedure with regard to the agreement with the United States on passenger data.
That has, in fact, been done and dusted; after all, what did we all do in this very Chamber two weeks ago?
This House decided then neither to approve nor to reject this agreement before the Court of Justice had ruled on it, because we want to respect the Court's verdict.
It does appear, however, that the Council is unwilling to respect Parliament's verdict.
COREPER is simply dissatisfied with the democratic vote we have held and wants us to do it again.
Irrespective of what we decide, the Council itself will be rubberstamping the agreement as the first item on its agenda on Thursday morning and I have understood that our lawsuit may then be dropped.
Although we in this House will need to deliberate on our subsequent plan of action, it seems evident that we will be unable to accept the Council's urgency declaration.
We are not little children, and the decision previously taken by this House simply remains standing.
Most of the coordinators of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also share this opinion.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to remove this item from the agenda and not make us look complete fools, because otherwise we will open the floodgates to repeats of each vote whose outcome is not to the Council's liking.
It seems to me that we have more than enough to do without having to do everything twice.
Â Â  The House is perfectly entitled to hear a speaker for and a speaker against and then, if it wishes, to vote to remove the item in question.
In the light of our vote two weeks ago, the Council is perfectly entitled to make such a request if it wishes.
I propose that if you are of the same opinion at voting time tomorrow, Mrs Buitenweg, we should hear a speaker for and a speaker against, vote on the procedure and then decide how to proceed as regards the substance.
You are acting within your rights to object, MrsÂ Buitenweg; the Council is within its rights to make the request; and the House can decide what to do.
Â Â  Mr President, could you advise us before we vote as to whether there is any significance in the fact that the electorate on this issue will be different?
Two weeks ago the European Parliament had a different composition from what it will have tomorrow.
Is it right to re-run a vote with a different electorate?
I would have thought that there is at least a question mark over that issue and I request that formal advice be provided on that point before we vote tomorrow.
I agree with Mrs Buitenweg, and my Group opposed re-voting on this matter because it had already decided.
The question is in the lap of the Court of Justice.
It is important to know whether procedurally we are entitled to vote a second time.
Â Â  Procedurally, the House can decide that tomorrow.
I will obtain a legal opinion on your question on how many may vote, but I was informed in earlier contacts that all those present who are now Members will be entitled to vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I could not agree more with Mrs Buitenweg.
As I understand it, this item will be discussed tomorrow, and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that not only will a speaker for and a speaker against be allowed to take the floor, but the rapporteur will also be given the chance to speak.
I have to say that I think it will be an extremely difficult job to convince a full House of people who have not followed the entire process to date, but I rely on the fact that the speaking time to which the rapporteur is entitled will be available to me tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the commemoration of Jean Monnet and the twentieth anniversary of the draft Treaty establishing the European Union (1984 â Rapporteur: Altiero Spinelli).
Colleagues, members of the European Commission and Council, welcome to this special session of commemoration.
In western Europe after the Second World War a number of people had the courage to look at the big picture.
Among them were two people: Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, whom we commemorate here today.
We mark the 20th anniversary today of the adoption by this European Parliament of the first draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union and the 25th anniversary of the death of Jean Monnet.
I would like today to celebrate these two leaders of vision whose own leadership showed the will, political determination and capacity to think long, wide and big.
They were not people who became lost in the petty detail: they rose above the detail.
One thinks in particular of Monnet and the early generation of founders of the idea of modern European integration, who rose above the ashes of the Second World War, who were prepared to see hope at a time when there was only despair, to see opportunity when there was economic breakdown, and to see in the European project an ideal of reconciliation with opportunity and prosperity.
This marked them out as a special generation among all the European generations that had gone before.
The clarity and the strength of Monnet's vision has proven its worth because it has endured and because, even as we face the challenges of globalisation, that vision still holds true resonance today, rooted as it was and is in humanitarian values and supranational engagement.
Monnet realised early that, acting alone, 'the nations of Europe are too circumscribed to give their people the prosperity made possible and hence necessary by modern conditions'.
Monnet attached great importance to the moral and human aspects of the European idea, captured in the Schuman plan by the denunciation of the spirit of supremacy and discriminatory practices which had created complexes and ill-feelings between nations on our continent.
They tackled the source of conflict at its root.
Monnet was one of the first to understand and explain that the principle of European unification basically involves the search for a new humanism.
On our continent war had followed war, creating a fatal cycle in which the victory of some led to the desire of revenge among others.
His ambition was to break this vicious circle and to establish amongst the states the same relations founded on equality and arbitration that governed relations between individuals in democratic societies.
In this spirit, Jean Monnet became the advocate of a new morality, relying on people and their capacity to make progress by drawing lessons from the most painful experiences they had been through.
As Jean Monnet said, 'we are not uniting states, we are uniting people'.
Today one of the major outstanding challenges we face is the adoption of a new Constitutional Treaty for the European Union.
We recall here in the European Parliament with some pride the leadership that was given by this House, and in particular by Altiero Spinelli and his colleagues, some 20 years ago when they brought to fruition, through this Parliament, the first ever draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union.
I am proud to say that during this mandate, the determination to lead constitutional change and the capacity to show real parliamentary leadership has continued to manifest itself before, during and after the European Convention.
In this context let me also pay tribute to the work of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to its chairman, Mr Napolitano.
We thank them â and we thank you, Mr Napolitano â for your untiring work and your unfailing determination to make sure that we meet with success on this grand European project.
So, as we commemorate these two visionary European leaders today, I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to call on the foreign ministers of the Union of 25 when they next meet to make a solemn declaration of political intent that they will urgently bring closure to a new Constitutional Treaty for Europe.
If we do not have a Constitutional Treaty before the elections, then we want this declaration, because the people of Europe are entitled to know what they are voting on.
This declaration is the minimum necessary if a Treaty cannot be concluded by the date of the election.
I would ask Minister Roche to convey that to the President-in-Office of the Council.
In recalling these two leaders, Monnet and Spinelli, the one clear lesson for us going forward is that we too are called upon to think long, to think wide, to think big.
We too are called upon to bring the humanitarian and moral dimension into what we do, and if we do it, the Europe of values which took a great step forward in this House yesterday as we grew to a Union of 25, is a Union which in the future can touch its people as, at the time of these leaders, it touched them in the past.
Â Â  . Mr President, if Jean Monnet were standing here today, surveying this Parliament he would have good reason to rejoice.
He would see representatives of 25 countries and 450 million people sitting side-by-side, striving together for the common welfare of the people of Europe.
He would see a Parliament in which parties operate on a cross-national and sometimes pan-European basis, where representatives from across our continent find as much common cause with colleagues from other countries as they do with their own compatriots.
If Monnet were to look beyond this Parliament today, he would see countries which for centuries had been bitter enemies working hand-in-hand as convinced partners.
He would have reason to rejoice.
Like Monnet, Spinelli was a man of vision.
His vision of a democratic and transparent citizens' Union gave impetus to the idea that a Constitutional Treaty would enhance the Union's credibility.
It gave impetus also to the idea that we the citizens deserved a Union that was comprehensible to us and working in our interests.
Monnet hoped to make war between the nations of Europe not just unthinkable but materially impossible.
Today we can see that the dream is closer than ever to becoming a reality.
John Hume, the Nobel Laureate and Member of this House, once said: 'Our European Union has become the most successful peace process in Europe's long history'.
The two men â Monnet and Spinelli â were different in many ways.
Monnet tended to work quietly behind the scenes, using his legendary international networking skills to build the widest case for a new Europe.
Monnet laid the foundations for this enterprise.
Spinelli, on the other hand, was a much more public figure, a vigorous opponent of fascism in the first half of the last century; in his later days an elected Member of this Parliament.
They shared, however, a vital similarity: they were men of action, determined to harness their vision of a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Europe to the means of advancing it in the real world.
What was it about these men that has allowed the ideas they promoted many decades ago to create the impetus which, even after their deaths, propels all of us forward to continue their work?
Perhaps Monnet's biographer, FranÃ§ois DuchÃªne, described his subject best when he wrote that Monnet's secret 'came from a combination of creative and critical faculties.
He appealed to the romantic in people through the idealism of his goals, and to the expert in them through the realism of his means.'
Making a new, peaceful Europe was Monnet's greatest dream.
Twenty-five years after his death we continue to build on the foundations he laid.
Spinelli, like Monnet, believed that, without radical positive change, Europe would be condemned to repeat its past fatal errors and endanger its future existence.
In 1947 he suggested that 'nothing is sadder than the fact that the ideal Europe, the cradle of law and liberty, constitutes only part of the geographical area of Europe.
What is more', he added, 'that area is certain to shrink and European civilisation to become a mere historical memory, unless we can at least unite what at present remains of it.'
The European Union has risen to this challenge.
What drove both men was their experience and their abhorrence of war.
However, as they sought to communicate ideas and goals that would help rescue Europe from itself they could hardly have thought that from the rubble of the Second World War such a strong, united Europe would come about.
Sixty years ago Europe was struggling with the last phase of the most destructive war in its history.
Against this background the European Union, in spite of its imperfections, is a heroic endeavour undertaken against great odds.
It has a record of assisting peace and prosperity among European nations and beyond, when history seemed to insist that such a goal amounted to little more than a flight of fancy.
Last Saturday we witnessed an extraordinary reversal of history with the formal ending of the artificial divisions of Europe.
The enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States is a tribute to the potency of a dream.
It is also a tribute to the endurance and courage of many millions in central and eastern Europe who often suffered for dreaming those dreams aloud.
The Budapest uprising of 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Baltic singing revolutions of 1990 have contributed to the construction of a Europe at the outset of the 21st century that few Europeans would have dreamed of throughout the previous 2000 years of our troubled history.
The French writer Victor Hugo said in 1849 that a day would come when 'all you nations of the continent, without losing your distinct qualities and glorious individuality, will merge into a higher unity and found the European brotherhood'.
That day is upon us.
Now is not the time for complacency to find a home in the new Europe.
We cannot simply stand back and admire our handiwork.
Now is the time for new ambitions.
On Saturday the President of Ireland said: 'Our continent is ancient but our Union is young'.
We still have work to do and ambitions that remain unfulfilled.
Mr President, as you said, one of those ambitions must be the Constitutional Treaty and its very early completion.
We must be careful to protect the freedom, justice, human rights, and political pluralism that that are the bedrocks of our Union.
We must continue to build on the peace that Monnet saw replacing the deadly rivalries of his generation and their ancestors.
We must also ensure that the new needs and circumstances of the Union are reflected in its basic law.
On the 20th anniversary of the adoption by Parliament of Spinelli's draft Constitutional Treaty we must work to agree a new Treaty that will improve the basis for democratic discourse in our Union, that will build on the success of our Union, and that will make the Union more readily understood and effective.
The first major task we face together in the new Union will be to agree the new Constitutional Treaty.
In March we decided to reach agreement at the latest by the June European Council meeting â just six weeks away.
Early agreement on a new Treaty that allows the Union to develop and prosper is the best way to commemorate the work of Jean Monnet and to mark the 20th anniversary of this Parliament's draft Constitution which was presented by Spinelli.
That is the challenge that faces us over the next few weeks â working together we will meet that challenge
Even as we meet here today, representatives from the 25 Member States meet in Dublin to hammer out details in relation to the Treaty.
We wish them well in that work.
