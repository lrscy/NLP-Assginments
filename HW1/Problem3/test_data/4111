Commissioner, this is important information.
In all contacts I have with women's groups, there are two factors that keep cropping up.
Many breast cancer patients suspect that their illness is related to the environment, medicines or the use of the pill.
Could you therefore give the necessary incentives so that research in this area is given the necessary priority?
More clarity is needed about the effects of hormone-regulating substances in the environment and the use of hormones such as medicines and contraceptives.
I am particularly indebted to Mrs JÃ¶ns for her unstinting concern for, and commitment to, women with breast cancer.
Her work is a true inspiration to many women.
I should also like to express my appreciation for Europa Donna, which I should like to thank for the excellent work they are doing in making it possible for European countries to learn from each other, which is exactly what we should be doing.
(FI) Madam President, the number of cancer cases will grow dramatically in the years to come as the European population ages.
Many are worried about the adequacy of resources for treatment and growing costs.
This has to do with economic growth, and also the increase in patients' own costs.
Guaranteeing our citizens equal opportunities to receive treatment in healthcare and nursing is an important policy issue both within the Member States and at EU level.
We must ensure that age does not mean that people are less entitled to services and good care.
Next I would like to say a few words about the integration of patients into the world of work.
I understand that it is important for growth to get people back to work.
This is often important for patients as well. We patients are quite normal people on the whole.
Nevertheless, we also have to remember to be humane when integrating people back into work.
From the point of view of humanity, it is important that everyone has sufficient time to recover from their illness.
We have to remember that recovery time differs from one person to another.
(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for some excellent work.
I want to protest against Commissioner Å pidla's statement that breast cancer stops people from living a normal life.
It does not actually need to be that way.
I myself am an example of someone with breast cancer which, if discovered in time, operated on and treated properly, does not in any way prevent someone from leading a normal life and working.
Finland is one of the European countries in which breast cancer is becoming common fastest, but thanks to screening and treatment, the mortality rate has not gone up for decades.
Improved screening and treatment alone are not enough, however: we also need to examine the causes of cancer.
My colleagues, Mr Breyer and Mrs Corbey, mentioned that new research suggests that as many as half of new cases of breast cancer may be explained by environmental factors, one of which is industrial chemicals, which we are exposed to all the time.
A cocktail of chemicals that damage hormones is particularly dangerous, especially for the foetus and during puberty.
We need to do something about this.
(PT) Madam President, as we know, breast cancer is not only the most common cancer in women, it is also the biggest killer of women between the ages of 35 and 59.
Accordingly, the policy of information on breast screening must be improved and stepped up, programmes to detect cancer at an early stage must be put in place and support for research into preventing breast cancer must be strengthened.
Hence the importance of the issues that we put to the Commission.
We are also hopeful of a positive response from the Member States so as to ensure that all women, regardless of their social and economic status, have access to the prevention, screening, early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, and can be reintegrated into the labour market without suffering discrimination.
(FR) Madam President, in France, in practical terms, breast cancer means first of all, at the screening stage, a mammogram, followed by anatomical pathology confirming the presence of cancer.
This assessment should be extended to include the liver, the brain and the bones, which are the three areas targeted by metastases.
At best, in France, a bone scintigram will be taken; MRI and above all PET scans, used for early metabolic diagnosis, are not performed.
During treatment, if patients receive radiotherapy, it will be carried out by a low-ranking technician.
As a result, accidental irradiation sometimes occurs around the heart and the thyroid.
Finally, after treatment, if, when a patient suffering back pain is examined, a scintigram is taken showing a suspicious shadow on the bone, screening by PET scan will still not be performed.
Why?
Because in France, for 35 million women, there are only two PET scanners.
Why?
Because the budgetary austerity pact forbids spending on hospital equipment.
As a result, women are dying in Europe due to breast cancer, but also due to the ideological cancer of the European Commission known as budgetary Malthusianism and rampant free-marketism.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, breast cancer kills too many women in the European Union, many of them far too young.
These deaths are unacceptable given that we know that early detection can cure this cancer.
We are all aware of the mental and physical trauma suffered by women diagnosed with this illness: they have to reorganise their family and working life and, quite simply, deal with it.
However, there is absolutely no harmonisation at European level with regard to the way in which we combat the scourge of breast cancer.
Only ten Member States run screening programmes, with varying degrees of success.
European women are therefore faced with a blatantly unfair situation, simply because of which country, or even which town, they live in.
Commissioner, our aim is to eradicate this disease, in the knowledge that, quite apart from the traumatic experience for the patient, it has a cost for our society.
The solution to this blight is early, compulsory screening, organised by the governments of the Member States.
In order to be effective, this screening must be free, and above all must be well run, which requires the availability of up-to-date equipment throughout the European Union.
Digital mammography, which in the past sometimes missed microcalcifications - the most common signs of breast cancer - has made considerable progress, so, Commissioner, when are we going to have digital mammograms throughout the European Union?
Effective screening also requires all the equipment to be subject to calibration and therefore to quality controls, because there is nothing worse than giving women a false sense of security through a radiological examination that could be of poor quality.
For this screening to be effective, equipment on its own is not enough: the doctors who perform these diagnostic tests must undertake continuing training, as well as regular refresher courses and compulsory testing to evaluate their skills.
Finally, women need information regarding the prevention of breast cancer: they need advice on healthy living and food safety, and must not be afraid of screening.
Research must enable us to make progress in finding the causes of breast cancer.
I am convinced that, if we combine our efforts, we will once again be able to show what the European Union can do to improve the health of European women.
That is certainly a subject that should have unanimous support in the European Union: zero deaths from breast cancer in Europe!
(FR) Madam President, Commissioners, I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their hard work and for the clarity of their comments.
The problem we are discussing today is a serious one: one only needs to look at the alarming statistics on the occurrence of breast cancer in Europe and to see the number of deaths caused by this disease to be convinced of that.
This problem is made all the more serious by the fact that there are major inequalities between countries with regard to both the prevention and the treatment of cancer, and these inequalities have become even more pronounced since the last enlargement.
Although the Treaties state that, in conjunction with the Member States, the European Union shall work to protect and promote the health of European citizens, we nevertheless need to give greater emphasis to the phrase 'in conjunction', because the EU's guidelines and recommendations have not been taken sufficiently into account.
We now need to respond to this state of affairs, and not continue to tolerate it.
The European Union must ensure that its citizens have equal access to the detection and management of the disease, and to the best available treatments.
We can do this by legislative and budgetary means, as well as through the Structural Funds and research programmes.
We must channel all the resources necessary to research all the causes of this disease, be they environmental, social or genetic, and to undertake research into innovative treatments.
The Commission needs to present us with some proposals in this regard, and I really do think that the European Union should make the fight against breast cancer, and against cancer in general, a political priority, because together we will always be stronger.
This is the added value of the European Union that the people of Europe expect.
Studies, diagnostics, evaluations and resolutions are all necessary, but action is absolutely vital.
The Commission and the Council should therefore heed our warning cry and lose no more time.
Madam President, today we are debating an excellent resolution which has implications for all women and indeed for all families in the EU.
As already stated, every six minutes a woman in the EU dies from cancer.
That is a truly shocking statistic and one which should spur us on to immediate action.
Breast screening, which according to the WHO can reduce deaths from breast cancer by up to 35%, is offered on a nationwide basis in only 11 Member States.
Shame on all of us!
And shame on my own country, Ireland, where we have not yet rolled out breast-check nationwide.
Deaths from breast cancer in the Republic of Ireland are significantly higher than in the north of Ireland, where they have already established breast screening. But we, like many other European countries, do not yet have nationwide cover.
Finally, two crucial points: every country should have nationwide breast cancer care supported by interdisciplinary breast units at appropriate locations; and women over 69 or, in Ireland's case, 65, must not be excluded from breast screening.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the competent parliamentary committees for their initiative in instigating this joint debate on breast cancer, given that it is a given and constantly increasing risk to women's and men's health, at younger and younger ages.
The repercussions which it has on the organisation of personal, family, social and productive life have already been pointed out.
A call is therefore being made today for the Community strategy to respond to both present circumstances and emerging trends and challenges for the health of our citizens and to use all possible means to achieve the objectives of a perceptible reduction which it has set.
Breast cancer is an illness in which proper screening plays a fundamental role, as we know from the statistics at our disposal and as we have heard today during the debate.
However, this means that we need a modern infrastructure in terms of materials and equipment and specialised staff.
The 'Europe against Cancer' programme, in conjunction with all the other facilities offered by the Structural Funds, research programmes and so forth, must respond to these challenges.
Proper medical and psychological monitoring of patients is also very important, as we have already heard.
The Member States, therefore, together with the regional and local authorities, are obliged to safeguard these conditions of prevention, monitoring and therapy for all citizens in every corner of their region.
This is particularly important for the new Member States, especially as we are about to welcome another two new members to 'our family'.
I should like to emphasise here the role which civil society plays in informing and supporting patients.
Many interesting initiatives have been developed in various countries and have even been networked at European level.
We need to support their work, especially in the new Member States, and to provide the opportunity for exchanges of best practices and added value for the benefit of the health of our citizens.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations and thanks to Mrs JÃ¶ns, who is not only the main initiator of today's motion for resolution and of the question, but also works tirelessly to raise awareness of the issue of breast cancer.
That of course means that there will be huge support for this motion for resolution tomorrow.
Breast cancer is the number one cause of death amongst women aged between 35 and 59, amongst both mothers and women without children.
Every year, 88 000 women and 1 000 men in the European Union die of breast cancer.
Breast screening can considerably reduce mortality from breast cancer amongst women aged between 50 and 69.
There have been EU guidelines on this subject since 1992, but so far they have been implemented in only 11 Member States, and there are huge differences in women's mortality rates.
That is why we are eagerly awaiting the progress report that Commissioner Kyprianou announced for 2007.
However, today the European Parliament is not just discussing the early detection of breast cancer and the best way to treat it, but also prevention.
The causes of breast cancer need to be investigated in more detail, in particular the role of toxic chemicals, environmental pollution, diet, lifestyle and genetic factors, and also the question of how these factors interact.
In a few weeks, when Parliament votes on the new European chemicals policy, we will have an opportunity to send a clear signal that we take the prevention of cancer seriously.
. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we have been hearing the overwhelming figures that bear witness to the effect that breast cancer has on the lives of both men and women.
It is a matter of pure chance whether treatment is started quickly and efficiently and therefore how high the woman's chances of survival are.
As the coordinator of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I have been working on this topic for many years, and we have gained a great deal of experience.
We cannot leave it at that, though.
We have had the EU guidelines for quality mammography for over ten years now.
In Belgium, where I have my second home, I am invited for routine screening, while in my homeland of Germany nothing is happening.
The lives of mothers, daughters and wives could be saved, and the trauma reduced.
However, we are still only progressing at a snail's pace.
The Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality presented an excellent report in 2003, but very little has happened since.
I think there is a lack of political will in this matter: I can tell that the will is there at European level, but in the Member States much still remains to be done.
The Seventh Research Framework Programme now once again gives us the opportunity to exert pressure so that more money goes into research.
In the case of other women's diseases, such as migraines, too, there has been little political pressure applied to move forward and take interdisciplinary action.
As over 20 years of experience in the United States have shown, interdisciplinary breast centres can provide very efficient assistance.
We now also have such centres in Europe, but here, too, I do not see any sign of the political will to really implement that.
Let us therefore work together, here in the European Parliament, to fight against the trauma of breast cancer, and do so for everyone, not just those who can afford it.
(PT) In spite of the progress that has been made in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is still the main cause of death among women of between 35 and 55.
It is estimated that in Europe alone breast cancer kills more than 130 000 women per year.
Every two and a half minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer.
All women must have access to information, prevention and appropriate treatment.
Screening programmes, using mammography, should be mandatory in all Member States.
More information campaigns on how to lead a healthy lifestyle are needed.
The prevention and treatment of breast cancer should also be among the priorities of the Seventh Research Framework Programme, especially at a time when studies show that, as well as genetic factors, environmental and lifestyle factors can also play a part in the development of breast cancer.
(DA) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, breast cancer is the most frequent cause of death of women aged between 35 and 50, and the number of women who survive the disease varies greatly from country to country.
We must call on the Member States to set up centres to provide information and advice on hereditary breast cancer, and we must call on the Commission to present a progress report on the matter every other year.
It is important for priority to be given to breast cancer research.
The EU's Seventh Framework Research Programme should, therefore, also appropriate resources for research into breast cancer: not only into its physiological and technical aspects and into alternatives to conventional forms of treatment, but also into its social consequences and, especially, into its causes.
We need to be able to learn from each other, and this is of course precisely the kind of cooperation for which the EU also offers a constructive framework.
The EU should head European campaigns to prevent the disease and to inform women as to how they can examine their breasts.
Moreover, the individual governments should introduce national breast-screening programmes in all the Member States, because early detection of breast cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates.
(PL) Madam President, the statistics on cancer in the European Union are alarming.
Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer after lung cancer.
In the European Union, a new case is diagnosed ever two minutes and a woman dies of breast cancer every six minutes.
The best way of combating breast cancer is through regular screening and promoting effective diagnosis of the tumour.
The widespread use of mammography could reduce the number of deaths by as much as 35%, providing, of course, that the tests are carried out regularly and are readily accessible to all.
European Union provisions laying down standards in this area have been binding for 15 years.
Nonetheless, about half of the countries in the Union are not implementing regular screening programmes.
This must change.
As the European Parliament, we expect a clear response concerning the actions the European Commission intends to undertake to help Member States reach their targets. One of these is a 25% reduction in the average mortality rate by 2008.
A coordinated strategy at Union level is essential in order to combat breast cancer.
Now is the time for specific action.
Over 100 000 women a year are dying of breast cancer.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has brought forward the themes of prevention, the quality of health intervention, the urgency of research, and the right to dignity and to work. These themes form an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy.
Parliament's political objective is therefore to indicate the urgency of coordinated action, something that the Commission must carry out by assuming a stronger and more visible leading role in relation to the Member States.
It is not enough to set targets for 2008: we need to monitor them, take corrective action and understand what progress is being made.
There are no prizes for model countries in this field, nor are there penalties for those which do not make progress.
I therefore propose to the Commissioners that they introduce a kind of blacklist for nations that do not make any progress, as we have already done for airlines that do not guarantee safety.
Let us use the strength of public opinion, united with the scientific community, to support Community policies.
author. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that was a very important debate, and a very good one, for we have shown once more that this House really does stand alongside women suffering from breast cancer, and their families too.
We are, by the way, as far as I am aware, the only legislature in the European Union to mark the international month of breast cancer by debating structural improvements in the treatment and early diagnosis of breast cancer.
Today, while I would like to extend thanks to the Commission for having given us an undertaking that it will devise a certification procedure for interdisciplinary breast centres and for specialist nurses in the field, I have to tell the Commissioners that we really would be pleased if they were to put these guidelines on the web, which would not be an over-hasty thing to do in this era of modern communication, and that we have not given up the hope of their putting the existing guidelines on sale in something other than book form alone.
This debate, though, has, for the first time, put the spotlight on a completely new angle, that being the question of how to deal with women with breast cancer in the work environment and their reintegration into the labour market, and calls have been made for a campaign to make employers aware of these issues.
Commissioner Å pidla has today - if I understand him rightly - promised us one, and many thanks to him for that.
This highlights how important it is that there should be a charter of rights for people with chronic illnesses at work, and I think that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be concerning itself with that issue.
Let me close by observing that the answer, to those who have no idea how to deal with breast cancer patients, is that they should be treated in exactly the same way as those suffering from other cancers; they should not be stigmatised - which is, unfortunately, something that still happens - but should, quite simply, be treated entirely normally, which will probably do them the most good.
Thank you, Mrs JÃ¶ns.
Although I am meant only to be chairing this debate, I shall do what I am not supposed to do and endorse your call for the guidelines to be put on the Web.
The Commission does not need to use the book as a means of recovering its costs.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I should like to thank Members for a very interesting and helpful debate.
I knew from the beginning that we were on the same side, but it is good to reassure each other whenever possible.
I should like to respond to a few specific points very briefly and then make one general comment, which will cover the issue raised.
We are aware of the issue of breast cancer in men, raised by Mr Bowis.
We have to deal with it as a rare disease, because it is much less common than for women.
We are focusing on it and will raise it with experts very soon to see how we can include it in future guidelines, but as a rare disease, in the same way as we deal with other rare diseases.
On research, I should like to repeat that environmental causes are part of the plan.
The new Seventh Framework Programme will provide an opportunity to open up that area of research.
Gene-environment interaction and cancer development will also cover lifestyle and other major risk factors.
We will then be able to learn more about the causes of the disease.
That is a priority, because prevention is much more important than having to treat the disease afterwards.
The question of other cancers was raised by Mr Adamou.
We are working on those and not just concentrating on one.
Each one is a specific case and needs specific guidelines and a specific approach.
We expect to have guidelines for cervical cancer by next year, for prostate cancer by 2008 and for colorectal cancer by 2009.
We have to evaluate, we have to have research, we have to put everything together and then come up with guidelines.
We are also working on other areas such as the hepatitis B and C viruses, because we know they cause liver cancer, as well as aspects such as tobacco, obesity and other causes of cancer.
We have issued guidelines and recommendations on how Member States deal with this and the inequalities. These do not have legal force, so we cannot enforce them on Member States.
They represent best practice.
With your help, we encourage and put pressure on Member States to comply with the guidelines.
I look forward to debating this once we have produced the report.
We shall then be able to discuss the outcome and the commitment of the Member States.
This is a worrying issue. The numbers are terrifying.
If we have to put pressure on Member States to do their job on this, you can imagine what happens with rare diseases which do not affect so many people.
Putting it cynically and bluntly, there is not so much political pressure.
If we stop to think about it we could panic, but we must not.
Our job is to make sure that Member States fulfil their commitments and follow the recommendations they adopt and the guidelines they agree to.
We shall be working on that, in relation not just to breast cancer but to all the inequalities that unfortunately still exist in the European Union, within Member States as well as between Member States.
This is not the European Union of solidarity that we all aspire to and have all joined.
That applies to the use of structural funds.
The money is there, but unless spending on health is adopted as a priority by Member States, there is nothing we can do.
Again, it is a challenge for us to make Member States adopt the policies.
Unless Member States acknowledge that spending on health is not a cost but an investment - and we have to convince them of that - the situation will not improve.
That is where we have to work together and cooperate.
Member of the Commission.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to thank you for the debate, which has been extremely fruitful, and has clarified the issue of breast cancer from a range of perspectives.
I welcome the fact that other issues have come to the fore in the debate, including social issues, showing that the circumstances of this disease extend beyond exclusively medical factors, and touch also on the fight against discrimination in the work place and in society as a whole.
It is also clear that the direct opportunities open to the EU are limited, although we are not making the most of the opportunities that we do have, and in my opinion this is one of the biggest challenges that we face.
I should like to thank Parliament in general, because I firmly believe that if we manage to maintain the same level of determination and political will to resolve this issue, we really can resolve it, directly or indirectly.
Given that social and medical policy is always measured in units, and that those units are individual human beings, any progress, however great or small, can ultimately be converted into human lives, and I am convinced that we can achieve such progress and that the outcome of this will be clear.
A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (06233/2/2006 - C6-0271/2006 - 2004/0151 (COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Hieronymi)
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, today finds us debating MEDIA 2007, the third generation support programme for the European film industry.
I want to extend the warmest thanks to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and to the advisory committees for their excellent cooperation, and particularly too to Commissioner Reding and her staff, who, together with this House, have tried to do everything they could to help the European audio-visual industry develop further and be a success.
It was exactly a year ago today, on 25 October 2005, that we in this House adopted this draft programme by a broad majority.
We had wanted to adopt the programme in good time - and by that I mean early - so that it could be available to Europe's film-makers with effect from 1 January 2007, but the European Council was not, alas, far-sighted enough to stick to this timetable, and required us, in the first instance, to go through some difficult financial negotiations.
The MEDIA 2007 programme is structured in the same way as its successful predecessors, MEDIA and MEDIA PLUS, covering training, development and sales in the audiovisual sector, but not production, which is a matter for the Member States to deal with.
What makes the MEDIA programme so extraordinarily important is the fact that the audio-visual sector is, as we are all aware, one of the fastest growing economic sectors not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
If Europe wants to keep up, it has to get on the right track.
The MEDIA programme represents a response to two core problems with the European audio-visual market, the first of which is its fragmentation, which is attributable primarily to our cultural, linguistic and national diversity; while that is a treasure, and one of the most important treasures Europe possesses, it also presents great challenges in terms of market development.
Secondly, the audio-visual market in Europe suffers from chronic under-capitalisation.
The MEDIA programme does a good job of responding to those challenges.
The MEDIA programme helped fund 90% of all films produced for export within Europe, and every euro invested through it brings another twenty in follow-up investment, and so it was very definitely right that the Commission, and Commissioner Reding in particular, should push as they did for adequate funding for this on the part of the European Union, and proposed that this should amount to the sum of one billion euros.
It is unfortunate that the Council could not, in the course of negotiations, be prevailed upon to accept this sum, which was reduced to EUR 671 million, so we have managed to maintain the status quo without achieving any further development.
The new programme does, nevertheless, incorporate three priorities.
The first is digitisation, the second enhanced cooperation at every level, and the third improved access to financial institutions specialising in the funding of films.
All I can say to all that is that we are speaking out strongly in favour of a quick start for the programme, of its successful implementation and of what we hope will be adequate funding next time round.
Member of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that, like me, everyone in Parliament values the MEDIA programme, a programme that has proven itself and that has supported the European audiovisual sector since it launched.
We are now in the fourth generation of this programme, and the fact that we have stuck with the basic structure, whilst innovating with regard to the precise elements linked to technological progress, shows that the programme has demonstrated its worth, that it is important, that it is unanimously recognised by those in the sector and that it is vital to the future of our audiovisual creativity and heritage.
Mr President, I am delighted at the European Parliament's unwavering support, and in particular at the constructive and unfailing support of its rapporteur Mrs Hieronymi.
The recommendation for second reading marks a new step towards a speedy entry into force of the programme in 2007.
Parliament has done its part, and the final decisions now need to be taken by the Council.
I hope that this will enable those working in the audiovisual sector to benefit from next year, smoothly and seamlessly, from this aid that is so vital to them for many reasons: firstly, for European cultural diversity, secondly, for the creation of European productions, and, finally, for the robustness of the content industry.
For my part, I am going to promote, as in the past, the adoption of this decision, which will be a crucial step for the future of the European audiovisual sector.
Mr President, today's proposal for the adoption by the European Parliament of the common position on the decision to implement a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector is due, I would say, to the personal persistence and systematic work of a great many people, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Ruth Hieronymi, whom I too, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, honestly congratulate, together with the leading person working on the MEDIA series of programmes, Commissioner Reding.
In cooperation with the European Commission and the Council, we have come to the final version of the text of the MEDIA 2007-2013 programme, which gives especial added value to the development of the European audiovisual sector which, apart from its economic benefit and importance and the anticipated contribution to the development of employment in the European Union and of the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry, also has a particular social and cultural value.
The audiovisual sector today has huge potential for combating gender stereotypes and cultivating the attitudes and conduct of European communities on the basis of traditions, unchanged values and respect for the dignity and uniqueness of human beings.
Thanks to the contribution of the European Parliament to the strengthening of the pre-productive and post-productive stage of the majority of European audiovisual producers, the new MEDIA 2007 will continue to highlight their importance for the promotion of cultural dialogue and linguistic and cultural heritage.
We also hope that, within the framework of the globalisation of competitiveness and of the strategic objectives of Lisbon, a European industry will be promoted which is respected, strong and of differentiated content, in order to develop European values and make them accessible, by giving greater attention to the promotion of the lesser spoken languages ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like once again to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi, the rapporteur, who has skilfully made MEDIA 2007 into an excellent document with which to support the European film industry.
I am glad but also concerned; glad that support for digitalisation has become a central part of the MEDIA 2007 programme, but concerned that, at the present level of funding, the European film industry will not be competitive.
Digitalisation is a challenge that the European audio-visual sector needs in order to develop its ability for innovation.
Digitalisation could become an effective means of overcoming the division of the European market.
I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and all of my colleagues who supported my positions as shadow rapporteur.
As regards the present situation, the proportion of US production on European television stations has once again reached a record level.
Hollywood also rules our cinemas.
There was a time when the cinema belonged to Fassbinder and the French new wave.
More recently it belonged to KaurismÃ€ki and the Dogma group.
Now the intelligent European audience wants to see Asian film production.
I know that the rise of brilliant filmmakers depends largely on chance.
The present underfunding means that the next European film genius may go to work in America or go into another field of work altogether.
The media is not just an industry.
The media is a means for the creation of identity, and it is because the European Union cannot function without European identity that I would like to emphasise once again how essential it is that we support our film industry.

I would like to thank you all for the work you have done, but I must conclude by saying that what has been achieved in the area of financing is below the level it was at when we began work. For that reason, I feel sorry for Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is already a year since, at first reading, we welcomed the excellent work by the rapporteur, whom I would like to congratulate once again on her more recent work.
Furthermore, last September, Mrs Hieronymi, myself and other MEPs discussed these topics with members of the Italian Government and operators in the sector, during a long and interesting debate on the occasion of the 57th year of the prestigious Venice film festival.
We appreciate that there has been a delay.
The European Parliament has, with a great sense of responsibility, acted extremely swiftly and today brings to the attention of the Chamber the final text of the report on the MEDIA programme, which has of course been much improved, making resources more accessible to potential beneficiaries, strengthening cooperation with other Community programmes in the areas of education, training and research, as well as creating easier access to credit for the audiovisual industry in order to remedy the chronic underinvestment in the sector.
Moreover, the use of new technologies represents an inevitable shift towards rationalising costs and consequent competitiveness.
I therefore propose that the Commission should take it upon themselves to evaluate the pilot projects carried out and to share experiences where they have been successful.
In conclusion, I would like to relaunch the proposal that I made to this House last year, in relation to the report on preserving our film heritage, to create a thematic European film archive to safeguard a careful selection of films on historical events and on events relating to the development of the Community project.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with warm thanks to Mrs Hieronymi for her work and to Commissioner Reding for her good cooperation.
What our media policy is in fact about is the further development of the specific aesthetic language of European films.
At the heart of our cultural self-image is the desire to fight against Hollywood's dominance, to show our own films, characterised as they are by European diversity, and to facilitate their production and distribution.
Although we know that the audio-visual industry is also of enormous importance in terms of the Lisbon Strategy and of Europe's economic development, this is not just about the economy; it is also, in a profound sense, about cultural policy and about cultural identity and cultural diversity.
I agree with the previous speakers who have highlighted under-capitalisation and the need for a rapid start to be made, and for our media programme to be better funded.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I also would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on her work and Commissioner Reding on her work in support of this programme.
I support the continuation of the MEDIA programme for the period 2007-2013.
We must remember, as Europe integrates more closely, that it is very important that we seek to protect and promote our different cultural and linguistic diversities within the EU itself.
We must always remember that the diversity of Europe is its greatest strength.
In essence, the MEDIA programme will help to develop the audiovisual sector in Europe during the coming six years.
Amendments by the European Parliament have ensured that the importance of European cinema is being recognised under the MEDIA programme for the purpose of intercultural dialogue, linguistic and cultural diversity and non-discrimination.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this proposal has been another plank in the attempts to impose EU ideals and censorship on an unsuspecting public.
It is less about support to industries in the EU, and more about protecting them from outside competition in the real world.
I have to ask: why is this proposal necessary?
Well, maybe because in implementing such a programme the EU can exploit yet another area where its message can be delivered to folk who will not believe or contemplate that they are being manipulated.
I quote: 'It is to be recalled that (...) the programme MEDIA has now clearer references to the importance of European cinema for intercultural dialogue'.
But it wholly ignores the bigger intercultural dialogue between the different European cultures and those of the wider world, for instance that of the Indian subcontinent.
Not only that, but each and every aspect of this report duly sets out another attempt to interfere with commercial activity.
We are told that the programme will cost EUR 671 million.
We also know that he who pays the piper calls the tune.
But where is the added value?
Who benefits?
It ignores what folk might want to see, given freedom of choice.
However, the EU will benefit by distorting the marketplace in the minds of citizens.
Ah yes, EU citizens, those poor folk who had citizenship forced upon them, from which there is as yet no escape!
(PL) I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work.
As we are all aware, the audiovisual sector is a very important element of our economy.
Over a million people are employed in it. This sector also plays a crucial social and cultural role, because almost every European household boasts a television set.
Unfortunately, and it pains me to say so, films produced in Europe represent only 26% of the European film market, as opposed to the 71% accounted for by American productions.
I cannot agree with the previous speaker that some kind of force is involved here.
It is indeed incumbent upon us to provide European audiences with a choice.
This must, however, be a choice involving good quality European productions, because the percentages I mentioned just now certainly do not reflect the quality of the films we are able to watch.
It is therefore to be hoped that the MEDIA 2007 programme will help to redress the balance.
Strengthening European cultural diversity and European cinema production is a noble aim, but it can only be achieved by simultaneously strengthening the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector.
Obviously, digitalisation is one way to combat fragmentation and under-investment in the European film market, but what is really required is a better distribution system on the European market and also on the international markets.
Nowadays, technological progress in terms of digital services facilitates better dissemination of European audiovisual products.
However, the lack of private sector involvement, especially in the context of financing ventures in the audiovisual sphere, will not allow the MEDIA 2007 programme to be fully implemented.
The current offer concerning credit for audiovisual production is very inadequate, particularly regarding films created by small and medium-sized producers.
The same is true of the grants available to young filmmakers.
I trust the MEDIA 2007 programme will not go to waste.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, today is a particularly important day for the Committee on Culture and Education, with the reports by my honourable friends Mrs Hieronymi, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, Mrs Pack and Mr Takkula on the multiannual programmes for the audiovisual sector, culture, youth, education and European nationality tabled for final approval by plenary.
The members of our committee merit congratulations.
Despite the delay in approving the programmes, which was due to difficulties in reaching agreement on the financial perspective, we believe that the resources which will be made available, even though inadequate, will allow these programmes to continue to offer their benefits.
In particular, the MEDIA programme may play an important role in improving the competitiveness of the European cinema industry, by giving financial support to the development of audiovisual works, the training of professionals in the sector and the strengthening of the distribution and circulation of European works.
We also need to highlight here the efforts made by Mrs Reding.
The development and promotion of European films is of decisive importance to the maintenance of cultural diversity and economic development and employment.
Unfortunately, the great wealth of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is also the cause of an even greater structural problem on the audiovisual market.
I refer to the extensive fragmentation of the national markets, which does not allow the European cinema industry to acquire a larger share of the European and global market.
MEDIA 2007 needs to help combat the lack of cross-border circulation of European works.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and Commissioner Reding for the positions she has adopted.
I think it is very important to support the audiovisual sector and European cinema in order to ensure diversity and plurality in Europe and to work towards the main aims of the European Union.
I think that it is also very important for endangered cultures, for the languages of stateless nations, for minority languages and so on. The reference in the report to the regional and local levels is very important, because it focuses on the need for real diversity in the European Union.
That is a great support.
Also, we have to support independent producers in order to enrich audiovisual output and make it more in tune with reality and with European culture.
(EL) Mr President, if you watch television in any country of the European Union and do not see the news, you think that you are in the United States.
The American culture reigns; that repulsive culture with violence, crime, rape and so on which enters our homes so easily.
We need to protect the European family from this culture, which does not suit us.
Clearly, therefore, we need to strengthen European cinema; we need to strengthen the culture and civilisation of this continent, but I greatly fear that the means introduced in the report are powerless.
Television is 'nitro-glycerine' in the hands of the person controlling it.
It provides the food that person wants.
I would refer to Euro News, which we fund, which a short while ago called all the Italians mafia for something to do with football.
Euro News comes along and makes its own policy, saying 'Macedonia', unlike the European Union, which calls this country FYROM.
The point, therefore, is that we need to give financial support and, at the same time, control where our money is going and how some of it is being spent.
This is an important matter, if we want to be successful on a vital issue, because it is opinion-forming.
Of course, the history of the Member States can also be strengthened, if you want.
I do not know the history of Poland, just as Poland does not know the history of Greece.
We are now one family.
We should know where everyone comes from. Who we are and where we want to go.
So this needs to be funded and I hope that such provision is made, but of course it needs daring and not the method with which we are approaching things today.
Member of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, I would once again like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Culture and Education and its chairman and rapporteur, for their valuable assistance in the interests of European creativity and cinematographic diversity.
I share the opinions and the concerns of those Members who say that, unfortunately, the funding is not adequate for our ambitions.
We have not received the funding we asked for: it is regrettable but true.
We must therefore act to ensure that the new programme, with less funding, is an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and to concentrate on those actions that have real European added value, while calling on the national governments to take responsibility for the other actions.
As the rapporteur has already explained very well, we will then stick with the actions that have proven themselves over the years.
Having said that, we will also add, for example, support for video on demand, which is becoming a priority.
We will also support digitisation, which is a particular opportunity for the circulation of European productions, and we will increase support for distribution in order to create the necessary synergies for the era of online film.
We are also going to introduce a new action to support the presence of European films on the emerging markets in other continents.
Those are the most important elements of this initiative, which enjoys the almost unanimous support of the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and those in the sector.
Mr President, thank you for Parliament's assistance, which will be understood, from the outside, by both viewers and creators of audiovisual productions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Culture programme (2007-2013) (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)(06235/3/2006 - C6-0269/2006 - (Rapporteur: Mr GraÃ§a Moura).
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process that will culminate in the vote on the Culture Framework Programme 2007-2013 at second reading has been complex and slow: slow essentially because of a series of setbacks regarding the financial perspective, as we all recall, and complex due to the nature of the issue and to the varied range of contributions to the debate from all members of the other committees that issued their opinions with the members of the committee directly concerned.
What ensued from all of these contributions was rich dialogue on the Culture Framework Programme 2007-2013, which subsequently went from first reading to the current stage of proceedings.
This process was marked by formal and informal interventions from both the Commission and the Council, leading to fruitful exchanges of views and consensus positions that can only be viewed as extremely positive.
As a result of all of this, most of the amendments adopted by this Chamber at first reading have been enshrined in the common position.
Of these amendments, I wish to highlight the explicit reference, in the recitals and in the body of Article 3, to the importance of a common cultural heritage shared by Europeans, an idea that encapsulates the objectives of the programme.
We must accordingly monitor, at all times, the implementation of the specific objectives laid down by the programme relating to this enormously extensive heritage, which has for centuries been ingrained in all fields of human activity.
Given that these fields relate to our civilisation and culture, they also reflect our identity.
It has also been possible to agree on satisfactory arrangements for the duration of the actions, scheduled to take between one and five years; for the intervention of cultural operators, the number of which per country will vary according to the nature of the action; and for the funds from the budget granted to each of the sectors concerned, in particular the granting of additional resources for cooperation measures, that is to say, for smaller projects, as opposed to larger-scale or multiannual cooperation projects.
This will make it possible to consider actions by small-scale operators, who tend to be closest to the citizens, without neglecting the larger-scale, more visible actions that involve more countries over a longer period of time.
In addition to all of this, I would like to highlight the provision for special actions aimed at raising awareness among Europe's citizens of cultural diversity in the Member States.
Some of these actions are already provided for, such as the European capitals of culture, and support for European bodies operating in the field of culture, which, very importantly, function as ambassadors for European culture, and many of which have received crucial backing from Parliament in the past.
If the rules change on account of the financial regulations in force and these bodies thus find themselves having to apply for the aid they need under the Culture Programme 2007-2013, it is vital that they are not overlooked and that they remain able to pursue their actions.
The Commission and the Council expect that the multidisciplinary nature of the programme will make it highly flexible and able to support many innovative proposals.
In spite of some reservations that I expressed during the debate at first reading, I sincerely hope that they are right.
Against this backdrop of the institutions working together and heading in the same direction, there is just one negative point, which is easy to spot.
I refer to what can only be described as the very meagre resources granted to the Culture Programme 2007-2013.
At first reading, a number of us who contributed to the debate - in other words, not only me, the rapporteur - drew attention to this point.
This is a third generation programme aimed at going further and being more effective than previous ones.
It is a programme that encompasses a broader range of actions and boasts a larger number of interested Member States.
It also involves higher management and monitoring costs, and yet the budgetary appropriation falls well short of what it needs to achieve these objectives and well short of what all those responsible - the members of the Commission, the ministers of culture, the cultural agents and operators, and the politicians - feel is absolutely vital.
Even so, I feel that we should express the wish that the Culture Programme 2007-2013 is a great success and that it makes an eloquent contribution to the development of the Europe to which we are all committed.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I am pleased to be here at the end of the second round of negotiations.
I sense a very positive feeling about proceeding with the final vote and decision.
We are now looking at the range of programmes for which I am responsible, including youth, education and the citizenship programme.
We start with culture.
This is highly symbolic and very important because we believe that, as in the past, culture can provide many important answers to the future of Europe.
Let me remind you that in December 2004 President Barroso said that cultural values rank higher than economic ones, because the economy helps us to live, but it is culture that makes life worth living.
I am pleased to say that an excellent climate of cooperation between our institutions characterised the whole legislative process and brought us to a very satisfactory compromise.
I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for his excellent work and, for similar reasons, the whole Committee on Culture and Education, under its chairman Mr Sifunakis.
Its support for this programme is an important contribution to the forthcoming decision.
I am also very pleased that the general line proposed by the Commission in the original proposal has been welcomed by both Parliament and the Council.
The next Culture Programme will thus promote, firstly, the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector, secondly, the transnational circulation of works of art, as well as of artistic and cultural products, and, thirdly, intercultural dialogue.
I am equally convinced that the programme will contribute to the flourishing of multilateral cooperation within Europe, as well as to the development of a European identity, thanks to the interactions which we encourage between citizens.
We will have EUR 400 million at our disposal.
I also wish to thank the European Parliament for its support.
We might envisage more support, but we first have to be aware of the limits and, secondly, support is growing and there will be more opportunities to organise cooperation.
However, as Mr GraÃ§a Moura has just said, we need to be efficient.
I want to confirm that the Commission is able to accept the three amendments contained in the report; they correspond to the compromise between our three institutions.
I very much hope that the next Culture Ministers' Council in November will reach a final decision.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I support the overall aim of this programme, namely strengthening the common European cultural area and reinforcing the sense of European citizenship.
These are very laudable aims.
I was, however, surprised to read, in part of the Council's common position of June of this year, that the Culture Programme (2007-2013) contributes to, I quote 'the strengthening of the transversal objectives of the Community, by contributing to the elimination of all discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation'.
Transversal Community objectives - what kind of newspeak is that, ladies and gentlemen?
Are we witnessing a renaissance of Socialist Realism?
Does this all mean that the key criterion used in the assessment of future projects will be their supposed impact on discrimination?
Perhaps it would be best to entrust the assessment of the projects to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna or to the recently established European Institute for Gender Equality.
I would like to point out that I did not find a reference of that nature in the earlier version of the programme, Culture 2000.
Europe was divided for over 50 years.
Our programme should therefore provide an opportunity for increased awareness and understanding of the cultural diversity of the nations of Europe and the cultures suppressed by Communist totalitarianism in Central and Eastern Europe in particular.
This should be the thinking underpinning the projects in the new version of the Culture Programme (2007-2013).
Culture should be perceived as a means of facilitating the cultural integration of 27 Member States, rather than as an integrated world view.
Culture must enjoy complete freedom.
It promotes the cause of freedom most effectively when it is involved in spreading it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, on the work he has done on the fundamental topic of the Culture 2007 programme and, in particular, on the agreement he has reached on behalf of the European Parliament.
I would like briefly to go over the three points that I championed for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament within the Committee on Culture and Education.
Firstly, with regard to the transversal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the agreement reached goes in the right direction: nobody can object to increasing the coherence of the programme, which will make it possible to put a stop to the fragmentation that for a long time has characterised the European Union's cultural activities.
However, intentions are one thing, and the resources proposed are quite another.
I now come to my second point, the issue of the budget, which was also mentioned just now by the rapporteur and by the Commissioner, too.
I would say this, and I will keep saying it for as long as necessary: there is no point in the European Union setting ambitious objectives such as promoting cultural diversity and cooperation if the available budget is not up to it, being no more than 15 cents per citizen per year.
We have called for a substantial increase in the budget allocated to the programme, so that it can play a part in the rise of a European culture and identity, which will enable us to move beyond national self-interest, and hence to escape from the crisis from which the Union has been suffering for a year and a half now.
It has to be said that the 2007-2013 financial perspective, stabilising Community expenditure at 1% of the European Union's GDP, will not allow us to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves in this programme or to give culture the role we intend for it in the building of a stronger Europe with greater solidarity.
Therefore, we cannot allow ourselves to punish this programme for a second time by delaying its implementation.
As Aristide Briand said, if we cannot have the means for our policy, we must have the policy for our means.
We therefore need to act quickly to implement this programme soon, so that we do not disadvantage the cultural organisations on the ground, which rely on this funding and which have been waiting for months for a decision to be taken.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I would like to congratulate Mr GraÃ§a Moura on the quality of his work and to thank him for the favourable attention he always paid to our proposals.
His report is excellent, which is hardly surprising coming from this Portuguese writer who is such an ardent defender of the Portuguese language.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would urge Parliament to give him its full support.
This programme covers the following objectives: promoting the transnational mobility of people working in the culture sector, encouraging the transnational circulation of works of art and cultural and artistic products, and promoting intercultural dialogue.
That said, one wonders how, with such a limited budget, we will be able to safeguard and promote linguistic diversity and encourage language learning and the teaching of music and performing arts.
One also wonders how this programme will be able to promote and develop the European Union's external visibility thanks to the promotion of its cultural diversity and of the aspects common to all its cultures.
I am therefore very disappointed that the Commission has not understood the vital role that culture plays in our European identity, and I find it particularly serious that it felt able, on the basis of the interinstitutional agreement containing the financial perspective for 2007-2013, to approve such a tight budget, amounting to only EUR 354 million, compared to the 600 million called for by the rapporteur and the 408 million proposed by the Commission.
The budget for the 'culture programme 2007' for the period 2007-2013 now represents just 0.04% of the European Union's budget granted in the financial perspective.
All artists in Europe will be amazed that the European institutions still consider culture to be the icing on the cake, as a luxury that takes second place to necessities.
If promoting culture involves raising awareness levels and curbing obfuscation, this shrunken budget is not the way for Europe to set an example.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking Mr GraÃ§a Moura for his work on this important aspect of our European policy.
People like to quote, whenever we discuss the significance of cultural policy for Europe, the saying to the effect that 'You do not fall in love with the internal market', for Europe adds up to more than just the internal market, even though it is something we cannot do without.
Europe has a great deal to do with the cultural identity and our cultural riches, which we want to preserve and develop.
Culture can divide people from one another, particularly when it emphasises differences, but our cultural policy is aimed at bringing the people of Europe together through culture, establishing contacts between them, making it possible for them to establish contact with, and feel a sense of belonging in, the world, indeed, with different, and in diverse, worlds.
The smoothing away of differences is not something that we should be in fear of; it is something to be encouraged, something that is at the heart of our European cultural policy.
That is why the three objectives - the encouragement of cultural exchange, the mobility of artists and cultural dialogue - are the right ones, but the amount of money voted earlier will not enable them to be achieved.
If we want to do more for Europe on the cultural front, we will have to muster the courage to set a bigger cultural budget over the coming years.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, a nation's standard of living is a function of material assets, but its identity is determined by its culture, in the broadest sense of the term.
Culture is a nation's true wealth, and the driving force behind its existence and development.
Culture also constitutes a platform where nations can reach understanding and integrate.
Culture develops through a historical process. It does not take kindly to brutal interventions or to being forced to develop along specific lines.
Culture needs freedom.
The Culture Programme (2007-2013) we are debating today is intended to organise the aims and restrict their number.
It also aims to support the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector, the transnational circulation of works of art, as well as of artistic and cultural products, and also intercultural dialogue.
From the simplistic point of view of European integration, the proposed aims are understandable.
From the point of view of cultural development, and the meaning and multifunctionality of culture, the approach is too narrow to be accepted without further ado.
It is essential to include action for the protection and support of the sources of culture, especially where they are under threat.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
European cultural heritage is a major part of our Union's wealth and I am therefore grateful to the three institutions for the efforts made so far to safeguard and promote it.
The great value of the Culture programme, which I hope will also be retained in the next programming period, lies not only in promoting the mobility of persons and works in the sector within the Community, but above all in the great opportunity that this represents for small operators and small communities in the EU to keep their own histories and identities alive.
Promoting individual cultures at local level is in fact extremely valuable, as much for the European Union in general, which bases its unity and strength on the diversity within its borders, as for the economy of the social fabric and regional realities at all levels.
I therefore fully support the Council's proposal to find a balance between small- and large-scale projects, to make it easier for small operators to access the programme, and to allocate half of the available funds to these kinds of measures.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I welcome the very positive responses; there may be still some pressure for doing more.
We all want to do more for culture, because it is important for the European mentality and European identity; for living together in one broader and broader house.
I think that the best narrative of Europe is diversity and unity.
Diversity growing means an invitation to promote and deepen unity, and unity based on values is mostly promoted via our cultural programme.
I am sure that some points that were mostly to do with the budget are invitations to do more in future.
If you recall the previous programme, we had seven cents per culture, per year, per citizen - Mr Bono mentioned that now we will have 15 cents.
There were invitations to do ten times more - 70 cents per culture.
I just want to remind people that the budgetary authority in the Union is Parliament.
Your support, but also further support, will help to create more space.
The citizenship programme is also based on the cultural Article 151 of the Treaty.
First of all, this is the competence and basic responsibility of Member States.
We are supporting Member States in their cooperation, not replacing them.
We will have the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008 and the achievement in negotiating a new convention on cultural diversity protection and promotion under UNESCO shows the success of this Union.
I want to assure Parliament that the implementation of the programme as soon as possible after the final decision will allow us quantitatively and qualitatively to do more for culture via Culture for Europe.
I am sure that we will have many occasions to work together on the implementation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 12 noon.

Explanations of vote
(FR) Mr President, my reference to the Rules of Procedure is based on Rule 6(7) and Rule 7 of the Rules relating to immunity.
As no debate has taken place, there will be no oral explanations of vote.
With regard to the case in which action is being taken against our fellow Member, Mr Borghezio simply because, following a judgment, he wrote the word 'Shame' on the pavement, a word that, moreover, it was possible to remove from the pavement, I shall simply say, following that hypocritical decision: shame on the rapporteur, shame on the Commission and shame on this Parliament of hypocrites and dissemblers who apply a variable-geometry case-law in the defence of immunity.
in writing. I support Mr Chichester's report.
I believe that the Galileo satellite system serves two vital purposes.
Firstly, it will enable the EU, independent of the United States, in association with its partners, to develop and deploy a global satellite system that will give an autonomous capability in this area.
Secondly, it shows symbolically the EU's commitment to playing an increasingly global role in world affairs.
Regardless of the technological and material advantages that will accrue, this political dimension is vital in itself.
in writing. (SV) I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the position put forward by the June List on 27 September of this year.
I have voted against this report because it rejects the Council of Ministers' draft amending budget No 3.
Unlike the majority of the Committee on Budgets, the June List believes that the Council of Ministers is perfectly entitled to redistribute expenditure between the different institutions of the EU in the course of the budget procedure, if it thinks this is the right thing to do.
in writing. (SV) The amending budget is made up of three distinct elements covering completely different fields.
I have chosen to vote against the whole package as put forward.
When it comes to the total of EUR 259 million to be provided by way of financial support to encourage economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community, the following question arises: is there yet an overall solution designed to promote peaceful and stable development on Cyprus at a time when the EU is getting involved in this situation and contributing significant financial resources to Cyprus?
In respect of the appropriation for the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the June List is already on record as being sceptical towards the entire project.
With regard to budgetary adjustments following modernisation of the accounting system, this is more of a technical issue, even if I am sceptical about the overall activities of the European Development Fund.
in writing. I welcome this report.
It endorses the EU proposal for a Strategic Partnership with South Africa which is comprehensive and which moves towards real political cooperation with the most significant political power in Sub-Saharan Africa and the strongest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 50% of the region's GDP.
Whilst praising the considerable progress made in post-apartheid South Africa in consolidating a functioning parliamentary democracy as well as the economic strides made as a middle-income developing country and as a leader of the Southern African Development Community, the report focuses on the need to address the considerable social challenges still facing the country.
These challenges include particularly the high incidence of HIV/AIDS (with 18.8% of the population currently infected) and rates of unemployment of more than 40%.
I fully support the report's call for HIV/AIDS to be tackled as a priority for economic development, as well as its emphasis on the Strategic Partnership providing a single framework under which the existing EU cooperation instruments can improve performance in the interests of the South African population and economy.
in writing. - (FR) The European Union is South Africa's largest trading partner and the biggest provider of development aid to that country.
The South African economy accounts for 50% of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa is an engine of development for Africa and a political power working for peace in those regions of Africa that are in conflict.
That is why I consider it essential, 12 years after the end of apartheid, for the European Parliament to support today the establishment of a Strategic Partnership with South Africa.
The report emphasises the fight against AIDS.
It also cites measures designed to promote economic revival and to combat social inequalities, and refers to integration and support for exchanges, as well as to incentives for foreign investment.
It asks South Africa to use its influence to foster a peaceful solution to the political crisis in Zimbabwe.
A new economic, social, health or political crisis would have a considerable impact on the whole of southern Africa, as well as on RÃ©union, which maintains many economic and cultural links with South Africa.
If this agreement is important for Europe, it is vital to RÃ©union, as we have everything to gain from the stability of our South African neighbour and partner.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with reference to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin's report on the Financial Instrument for the Environment, I would like to express my extreme concern for the environment regarding pensioners in Italy.
I voted in favour of the report, but I would have voted for it much more willingly if this directive, as well as protecting the environment, had also protected Italian pensioners.
I take this opportunity to protest against President Prodi's centre-left government, which has tabled an amendment to Article 85(6) of the budget law, deducting from the pensions of the 500 000 Italians who have worked in Switzerland a good three-quarters of the amount to which they are entitled in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Cassation.
An environment in which pensioners are deprived of their right to a fair pension is not healthy.
in writing. LIFE has proved to be an invaluable EU environmental policy since 1992.
Now we have an opportunity for LIFE + to become even more valuable, in particular to the smaller and newer Member States, which could receive a more equal spread of budget over the period 2007-2013 of â¬2 billion.
I fully support the Council proposal to delegate the implementation of 80-85% of the budget to national agencies and so I have voted against this Report.
For example, the overall amount indicated for Ireland from the programme is â¬25m.
This funding could then be doubled through co-financing instruments up to â¬50m.
Environmental Projects in Ireland which could benefit under the seven- year programme include waste prevention, waste reduction and recycling initiatives, development of innovative technologies with positive environmental benefits, local and regional environmental awareness campaigns and the development of special conservation areas.
in writing. (PT) The Council common position, to which this report relates, is substantially different from the Commission's original proposal in 2004.
I wish to highlight the inclusion of the 'Nature and Biodiversity' component, the objectives of which include supporting the further development and implementation of the Natura 2000 network, including in relation to coastal and marine habitats and species, and, most importantly, stemming the loss of biodiversity in the Community by 2010.
The inclusion of this component in the Life+ Programme tallies with the position adopted by Parliament at first reading in July 2005, and this is something we welcome.
Despite the fact that we voted in favour of the programme and its objectives, we are compelled to express our disappointment that the budgetary resources earmarked for the Life+ Programme, covering the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, are woefully inadequate, as a result of the disappointing agreement on the Budgetary Framework for 2007-2013.
They fall short of the assessment made by the Commission itself, which, let us not forget, put the needs of the Natura 2000 network at EUR 6.1 billion per year, that is, EUR 3 billion under cofinancing.
They also fall short of the amount proposed by the Commission in 2004.
The guarantee of cofinancing the Natura 2000 network via the structural funds will not enable it to meet all of its needs.
The LIFE+ Programme and its predecessors are the main funding instrument for the EU's environmental projects.
The Council has acted wrongly and insensitively in substantially reducing the budgeted amount.
Parliament has reintroduced the amount originally agreed upon, in line with the financial perspective, for funding the Natura 2000 network, which is aimed at preserving nature and biodiversity.
An amendment has been incorporated aimed at ensuring that the European funds earmarked for the environment are not used for other purposes relating to the LIFE+ Programme, such as spending on human resources, because the Member States are to have a project management team, rather than the usual management by seconded staff.
There is also a compromise amendment laying down that if no agreement is reached at second reading steps will be taken to ensure that funding of ongoing projects will continue.
For Portugal, this report is very important because a large proportion of the mainland and the outlying areas forms part of the Natura 2000 network, funding for which is set out in this report.
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs therefore support the Isler BÃ©guin report.
in writing. Though I believe LIFE funding has done good work, the problem has been the excess of demand over supply and the difficulty of supervising what is going on because it involves fairly small payments to a large number of projects and this report does not address these issues.
In 2003 the Court of Auditors looked at the LIFE scheme and found that financial beneficiaries failed to keep sufficiently transparent and detailed accounts.
LIFE money was also found to be involved in substantial land purchases where there were insufficient guarantees that this land would continue to be used for nature conservation purposes once the implementation period for the actions was over.
The Court asked whether the Commission had set up an adequate system of management.
The answer is that, as the fund is currently organised, the Commission cannot do so.
It is therefore perfectly acceptable and sensible for the management role to be devolved to the Member States.
This does not mean that environmental schemes will suffer from the withdrawal of LIFE money, but that money may be better spent and more transparently supervised.
in writing. I voted for the amendments to the common position on LIFE+.
I am particularly concerned with the requirement for a 55% allocation of funds for nature and biodiversity.
Important as these areas are, such a requirement would limit Member States' ability to allocate funds for projects addressing their own environmental priorities such as climate change.
in writing. (SV) I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in September 2005.
The question we should ask ourselves is as follows: should the EU be dealing with political issues of this nature or do they fall within the area of competence of the Member States?
The June List's answer is clear: this is a matter for the Member States.
If the Member States wish to pour extra resources into promoting their national film industries, they are obviously entirely in their rights so to do.
The EU, on the other hand, should not be running special programmes to promote the European film industry.
If a large number of EU countries believe it necessary to cooperate within this policy area, they can do so without the interference of the EU.
Intergovernmental agreements or cooperation between film companies can take place outside the framework of the EU.
The EU does not need further sweeping and expensive projects.
The EU should instead strive for targeted cooperation on significant and truly cross-border issues.
(DE) Mr President, I have voted against the GraÃ§a Moura report on the grounds that, firstly, the approach underlying the 2007-2013 cultural programme, namely that cultural networks need subsidy only at their outset and become self-financing thereafter, goes against their non-commercial character and runs counter to the sustainability of support grants intended by the EU.
This cultural programme also formulates intercultural dialogue in abstract terms, so that this objective might well refer to anything or nothing, and transparency is therefore out of the question; that is another reason why I have voted against this report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Romagnoli for his technical support, which has enabled me to explain my vote on the report by Mr GraÃ§a Moura establishing the Culture Programme.
I voted in favour as I am hopeful about the future of this European Union, but I should like to stress that there is no such thing as culture when, in Italy, Mr Prodi's Socialist-Communist government has decided, in accordance with Article 85(6) of the budget law, to deduct part of the pensions of the 500 000 Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland, thus ignoring the judgment of the Court of Cassation, which ruled that these very pensioners were entitled to draw four times their current pension.
This is not fair, and I hope that 'culture' will also signify respect for pensioners' rights.
in writing. (SV) Cultural issues are, of course, very important.
The June List is of the opinion that cultural policy should, in principle, be handled by the Member States.
As far as European cultural heritage is concerned, however, it may be justified for certain matters to be dealt with at Community level.
Nevertheless, we believe that the appropriations given to this Culture Programme have been much too liberal, given that this is an activity that should essentially be the responsibility of the Member States.
I have therefore voted against the amendments in this report.
in writing. (PT) I should like to congratulate Mr GraÃ§a Moura on the position he put forward at second reading on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013).
I wish to express my support in particular for the amendment to the common position as regards financial support for the actions mentioned in Article 8(2)(d) of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Papadimoulis's report is slightly different to the previous ones, because it talks about the establishment of the Community civil protection mechanism.
I voted in favour, even though I would have preferred this report to have provided not only for civil protection, but also for the protection of pensioners.
I am referring to Italian pensioners, who should be protected by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, and by his Socialist-Communist majority.
They have decided, in accordance with Article 85(6) of the budget law, to deduct a good three-quarters from the pensions of the 500 000 Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland.
This decision is in breach of the Court of Cassation rulings, which oblige the Italian Government to pay these pensioners the pensions that they deserve.
in writing. (PT) The civil protection mechanism was set up five years ago to facilitate the mobilisation and coordination of civil protection resources in the event of emergencies inside or outside the EU.
In 2005, more than ten countries activated this emergency response mechanism.
The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the mechanism on the basis of the experience acquired since 2001, to lay down a legal basis for future Community action in the area of civil protection and to strengthen the rapid response and preparedness instrument for emergencies.
This report includes the 'public health' dimension in civil protection.
It also stresses the importance of solidarity among the Member States and of a more effective European monitoring system. Furthermore, it addresses the issue of effective land management and use in disaster prevention and the use of military assets to prevent and combat emergencies.
This mechanism is vitally important for Europe as a whole, but in particular for Portugal, a country that is devastated every year by droughts and fires, which fall under the proposed mechanism.
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs therefore support the Papadimoulis report.
in writing. (PT) The report adopted today, which is aimed at making the emergency response by the EU and the Member States more consistent and effective, is one that we broadly welcome, despite a few reservations.
We know that the primary objective of civil protection is to prevent collective risks and the serious accidents or disasters arising from them.
Hence the need to minimise these collective risks and to offset the impact should an emergency arise, to rescue and provide assistance to people and other living things, to protect cultural and environmental assets of major public interest, and to help the people affected to return to a normal life.
Accordingly, we welcome the possibility of investing in studies, training, prevention and monitoring, and in fostering an exchange of experiences in order to learn from past experience - positive and negative - and to rectify any shortcomings.
We also support the creation of a targeted, appropriate emergency communications network, the launch of extensive information campaigns, and the adoption of educational and awareness-raising initiatives aimed at the public and in particular the youngest members of society.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report.
Prevention is a basic factor in reducing risks, but not every disaster can be prevented.
Faced with emergencies, the European Union must no longer, therefore, rely on improvisation.
'Man's habitual shortcoming is not to anticipate the storm during fine weather', said Machiavelli.
The European Union must show that he was mistaken.
Before implementing any action plan, it is important to draw up a list of existing resources, both material and human.
It is on the basis of such information that vital coordination between the Member States will take shape with a view not only to tackling the disaster but also to ensuring that European action is more visible on the ground.
It is just as crucial, moreover, to lose no time in arranging for new facilities to be installed in areas that we well know are at risk, particularly from fire and flood.
The protection of the individual and solidarity between Member States are fundamental principles of the European Union.
I do not, therefore, understand the Council's resistance to developing these civil protection actions, not to mention creating a special Community force.
Yes, the initial responsibility for civil protection falls to the Member States, but that does not mean carrying on regardless.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. (SV) We welcome the Commission's proposal to improve the civil protection mechanism introduced in 2001.
Europe, like the rest of the world, is hit by all kinds of disasters and crises, and it is clearly desirable to institute intensive coordination in order to respond to such events.
Unfortunately, we have been forced to note that both the Commission's proposal and Mr Papadimoulis' report make explicit reference to military resources having to be available for civil protection activities.
We are strongly opposed to all forms of initiative relating to military cooperation within the European Union.
We therefore chose to abstain in the final vote on Mr Papadimoulis' report today and to vote against the Commission's proposal.
The development of strong and adequate mechanisms to prevent and deal with natural disasters is fundamental for the protection, assistance and relief of the victims of natural disasters and for dealing with environmental disasters.
In Greece, the inadequacy of such mechanisms was revealed again during the recent floods in several areas.
In particular in the strategy for preventing and restoring disasters (anti-flood protection, reinforcement against earthquakes) and relieving victims, the policy of the Greek Government presents criminal shortcomings.
One transnational civil protection mechanism may help in dealing with natural disasters.
However, it cannot and must not replace the extension and reinforcement of independent mechanisms in the Member States.
Similarly, civil protection mechanisms cannot operate to cover up responsibilities for deliberately causing environmental disasters.
The creation of mechanisms which undertake to deal with disasters due to deliberate action or negligence (as proposed) gives an even larger margin for unaccountable action by companies, with disastrous consequences for the environment and public health.
Primarily, however, the establishment of mechanisms to respond to 'terrorist action' cannot be accepted.
Practice over recent years confirms that the fight against 'terrorism' is designed to stifle and direct the grassroots movement, the class, trade-union movement.
The 'prevention of terrorism' through the monitoring mechanisms which it is proposed to strengthen is leading to more restrictions on fundamental democratic rights.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report because I believe given the cost of 'disasters' on Member States in terms of human lives, economic losses and injuries, it makes sense to pool resources and thus pursue economies of scale in areas such as logistics and transport.
It is well known that, in Europe, civil protection in relation to natural disasters falls within the competence of the Member States.
Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there are worrying delays and a sense of indifference, due to a lack of coordination.
It is precisely for this reason that, for years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a European Civil Protection Agency that would have the task of bringing the various national laws in line with each other and that would be responsible not only for preventing and anticipating risks, but also for managing emergencies.
Strangely enough, in fact, neither the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies nor the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism take into full and due consideration all of the activities aimed at studying and determining the causes of disasters, at identifying the risks and at singling out the more vulnerable regions subject to such risks - in other words, the 'anticipation' of risks - even though they are crucial when it comes to tackling natural disasters effectively.
This Agency, created on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, should not only repair the damage caused by natural disasters, but also, and above all, fund preventative actions aimed at eliminating or reducing the causes of such disasters.
in writing. (SV) I am opposed to the Commission's proposal that the Member States should make use of each other's military capabilities.
A coordination centre able to assist in directing fire-fighting helicopters to where they are most needed at the time is, however, a sensible and cost-effective idea.
Moreover, when major disasters strike, there is a great lack of highly advanced fire-damage prevention, and it would therefore be a very good thing if we were able to get help to each other quickly in such situations.
This is precisely the kind of cooperation that the EU should be undertaking.
I am voting in favour of the report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can there be any transparency in Europe when, in one of the 25 Member States - namely Italy - 500 000 pensioners who have worked in Switzerland and returned to Italy are paid pensions equal to 25% of the amount paid to Italian workers who work in Italy?
It is true that Switzerland is not yet part of the European Union, but it is part of the European Economic Area.
It would be good if a Member State of the European Union behaved properly towards those of its own citizens who have worked abroad and who are entitled to the same pension as citizens residing in Italy.
(DE) Mr President, speaking also on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation, let me say that there are several reasons why I voted against this report.
One is the demand contained in it for persons who have entered the European Union illegally to be accorded equal rights with - or, indeed, more rights than - legal immigrants as regards such things as the right to accommodation, family benefits, health care and access to educational institutions.
The report also presses for new grounds for the grant of asylum, for example to a person who has been forced into marriage or has agreed to what is termed an arranged marriage.
Giving in to these demands will do nothing to solve problems, but will instead create new ones, for measures like these do in fact exert a suction effect, attracting even more illegal immigrants.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted against the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, and I shall now proceed to explain why.
If one is talking solely in terms of women who have migrated legally, then one must certainly help them to become familiar with our system of standards and values, to become integrated and also to help their families to do so.
It is particularly when one comes to the second or third generation of immigrants that conflicts can arise, which - as we have had to learn from the French experience - can result in acts of violence that may even be unavoidable.
We must, however, come what may, prevent culturally and religiously motivated problems such as forced marriages, honour killings and genital mutilation from occurring in the first place.
Family reunifications involving second, third or fourth wives - which go against the prohibition, customary in Europe, of bigamy - must be brought to an end without delay.
It is because the report makes no such requirement that I have voted against it.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted against the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, since I take the view that it blurs the dividing line between legal and illegal immigration, fails to draw an adequate distinction between our positions on the two and thereby, ultimately, constitutes a positive incitement to illegal immigration.
I see that as politically misguided and as sending the wrong message.
Legal immigration needs to be better organised and regulated, while every form of the illegal variety needs to be combated.
At the end of the day, I take the view that we should solve the problems that exist on the ground in developing countries and should get much more directly involved in this than we have been to date if we are to get human, economic, social and religious problems out of the way.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy your lunch, since I believe that this is today's last explanation of vote.
I voted in favour of the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report on the role and place of women immigrants in the European Union.
In this instance, too, I would have preferred the report to have included something in relation to the position of the 260 000 or so Italian women who have emigrated to Switzerland in order to work and support their families and who, once back in Italy, have drawn a pension equal to 25% of the amount that they would have received if they had worked under the same conditions in Italy, and this despite the mutual agreement between Italy and Switzerland.
I do not think it right to behave in this manner towards women in general, and especially not towards those women who are old-age pensioners.
Long live pensioners!
in writing. Although we all agree that the plight of irregular immigrants is something that we have to work hard on, and that these unfortunate people should be treated with all the dignity a human being deserves, we must not forget that the influx of irregular foreigners into our countries is causing a big headache to the authorities, especially in Mediterranean countries.
I therefore think it would be wiser to amend the Dublin II regulations prior to committing ourselves to something that may prove to be too big for us.
We are obliged to do so, not only when considering the state our detention centres are in and the pressure that they are causing in our countries, but also out of respect for the immigrants themselves.
We should not give them false hopes.
I think we should get our house in order prior to offering something which at present I am sure we cannot guarantee.
I urge all concerned for the umpteenth time to grab the bull by the horns and make a genuine effort to have Dublin II amended
The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the report on women's immigration.
The fundamental rights of immigrants must be respected and should not be dependent on gender or on belonging to a specific group within society.
We support joint management of migration policy, which is a natural extension of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement.
We are, on the other hand, opposed to a common integration policy because this area is best dealt with by the Member States themselves.
We are also against the introduction of registers of female genital mutilation as this would represent an intrusion into privacy that we cannot support.
in writing. (PT) Female immigration is known to be rising steadily in the EU, currently accounting for some 54% of the total number of immigrants.
The reasons for it fall into a number of categories, including economic migration, family reunification, and seeking refuge and asylum.
Women often face a large number of difficulties and forms of discrimination.
Public support mechanisms, particularly social structures and services, must therefore be strengthened.
It is particularly important that international conventions are implemented, especially the one on family reunification.
The human rights of immigrant women - including access to education for their children, the right to family benefits and the right to healthcare - must also be guaranteed, whether or not their situation is legal.
In any event, we believe that immigrant women entering an EU Member State for the purposes of family reunification must be given the opportunity to obtain their own legal status independently of their spouse as quickly as possible.
We also feel that immigrant women and young people should be allowed to reside in a Member State and should be accorded all the support they need, especially those who have suffered physical and mental violence, including the practice of forced or arranged marriages.
in writing. - (FR) The report devoted to immigrant women is alarming.
Indeed, the situations it depicts (absence of personal status, exploitation, mutilation, crimes of honour etc...) point to the terrible failure of policies on immigration and integration.
The report seems to demonstrate that immigrant populations intend to carry on with their practices and customs in the European Union, regardless of the fact that some of these are in flagrant violation of our laws and values.
It neglects to mention that immigrant women themselves, or those of immigrant descent, sometimes attach more value to respect for their traditions than to respect for the law and that they are, then, very far from being, as the rapporteur naÃ¯vely imagines, instrumental in promoting their children's integration.
It also overlooks the fact that marriage of a national of non-European origin with someone from their country of origin has - in France and certainly in other EU countries - become the mean reason for immigration, ahead of family reunification.
When they are marriages of convenience, such marriages are a source of illegal immigration.
When they are not, the fact is that, despite his or her nationality on paper, one of the spouses is not integrated and is not about to be, either.
If we continue down this road, we shall only promote further ghettoisation in our societies and increase the risk of confrontation between communities.
in writing.
(SV) The June List has previously stated that the EU is a union of values. In the light of this, I have chosen to support those wordings which make clear that all groups in society should have equal rights.
The June List supports constructive measures designed to attain greater integration of vulnerable groups in society.
We are nonetheless of the opinion that it is the national parliaments and the regional authorities that should, essentially, be dealing with this pressing issue.
I am critical of the general trend whereby the institutions of the EU seek to extend their influence and competence within more and more areas.
It is important to draw a clear dividing line between what is to be decided by the EU and what is to be decided at national and local level.
in writing. - (FR) This report has completely lost the plot, combining as it does all the fantasies of the Left and the Greens.
Here are just a few examples. Paragraph 7 calls on Member States to grant immigrant women whose status is irregular and whose children are attending school the right to family benefits and allowances.
Paragraph 10 calls for the procedures for granting a residence permit to be simplified.
Finally, paragraph 17 calls for women immigrants to be encouraged to participate more actively in the social and political life of host countries.
Obviously, everything is being done to transform, as if by magic, something that is a problem - namely illegal immigration - into something that is all very fine, moral and humanistic, namely legal immigration.
There is not a single word about putting policies in place for returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. Nor is there anything about the possibility of implementing a coherent and effective codevelopment aid policy in these countries in order to put a stop to the growing exodus from, in particular, African countries.
There is nothing but the desire, expressed from the beginning to the end of this report, to welcome ever more immigrants and to give them ever more rights.
Reports like this one do not help build Europe. Rather, they destroy Europe.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against this report in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality because I consider paragraphs 6 and 7 to be unacceptable and inadmissible.
Indeed, I am of the view that access to family benefits and health care for anyone whose situation is irregular would be an incitement to mass immigration, something that is unacceptable, given the immigration problems with which we are already faced.
Moreover, an increase in illegal immigration would further exacerbate the conditions confronting migrants.
The European Union cannot adopt a report that further encourages the work of people smugglers and that leads a lot of women to risk their lives in order to emigrate illegally to Europe in the sole hope of being able to receive social benefits.
I should like, however, to emphasise that I am very committed to protecting women's rights.
I consider that the efforts made to guarantee immigrant women's fundamental rights by means of this report are commendable, but everything must be avoided that might have harmful effects that would, in fact, make the situation of these women even more difficult.
in writing. - (FR) Studies, statistics, reports, assessments ... With Parliament's support, the European Commission has, for some months now, been busily analysing the social, professional, political, economic and family situations of immigrant women in host countries.
That is all well and good, as there is at present little reliable information that can be used in this area, even though we all know that women, and in particular Muslim women, suffer all kinds of discrimination.
What, however, concerns me about this report is the fact that it highlights the rights of immigrant women who have entered Europe illegally.
The right to vote, the right to family allowances and housing benefits, the right to remain in the host country ... The report calls for, and lists, a whole package of rights but, bizarrely, it has not a word to say about a policy of returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin or, again, about a co-development aid policy for all those countries, very often African ones, which are suppliers of immigration to Europe.
Europe keeps on welcoming people left, right and centre.
In reality, Europe is transforming something that it deems unacceptable, namely illegal immigration, into something that it deems to be humanitarian and moral, namely legal immigration for population purposes.
in writing. This is an important report, much of which deserves to be implemented.
Urgent action is required to improve recovery rates.
However, my British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the report overall because we do not accept in principle that the long-term solution to many of the problems in this field is the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor, an idea which is reiterated in this report (paragraphs 43-45).
Such a Public Prosecutor would be an unacceptable interference in the constitutional responsibility of Member States for their judicial systems.
Furthermore, as there is rightly widespread opposition to its introduction, emphasising its necessity is a dangerous diversion from tackling the real problems at hand.
For this reason we are obliged to abstain on the final vote.
in writing. (PT) The recovery of inappropriately used Community funds must be investigated on a case-by-case basis and requires greater attention, not least from the Member States.
In this regard, I wish to highlight the example of the relocation of companies that have enjoyed the use of Community funding for years, and situations in which public health is put at risk in one or more Member States.
Cooperation between the different Member States and bodies should facilitate and improve the swift recovery of the amounts concerned and prevent the companies or organisations involved from continuing to enjoy Community funding.

This is a valid cause, but we object to it being used to launch a further drive towards federalism; the report proposes the creation of an EU-level public prosecutor's office and public prosecutor, which would be a further step in the scaling back of the Member States' sovereignty.
That concludes the explanations of vote.

Welcome
I am told that we have a distinguished visitor in the official gallery.
It is Mr Akbar Ganji, renowned writer and journalist, who was released in March following a six-year jail sentence for his activities in support of democracy and press freedom in Iran.
Mr Ganji, we welcome you most warmly to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
The European Parliament actively supported Mr Ganji during his long spell in prison and his hunger strike and called for his release on several occasions, particularly in its Resolution on Iran of 13 October 2005 and also by means of several letters and interventions by the President of Parliament and by the chairpeople of the Delegation for relations with Iran and of the Human Rights Sub-Committee
In fact, Mr Ganji has taken part in a joint meeting of those bodies this afternoon, and I have no doubt that they will have gained much from his knowledge and experiences.
Draft general budget for 2007 (Section III) - Draft general budget for 2007 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII)
The next item is the joint debate on the budgetary procedure 2007.
In this debate we shall examine
the report by Mr James Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 (Section III) [C6-0299/2006 - and Letters of amendment No 1/2007 (5733/2006 - C6-0000/2006) and No 2/2007 (9010/2006 - C6-0000/2006) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007, and
the report by Mr Louis Grech, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 (Section I, European Parliament; Section II, Council; Section IV, Court of Justice; Section V, Court of Auditors; Section VI, Economic and Social Committee; Section VII, Committee of the Regions; Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman; Section VIII (B), European Data Protection Supervisor [C6-0300/2006 -.
rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for introducing us to this first budgetary debate for 2007.
At the outset I should like to thank all those who brought us to this stage, particularly those in the secretariat of Parliament's Committee on Budgets and those associated with it.
Without them it would have been impossible to get ourselves to this state of preparedness.
In setting out the guidelines for the 2007 budget - one that is different from others in the sense that it has been the first budget in the new financial perspective - much of the first part of the year was spent in negotiating the result of the financial perspectives.
Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place, because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as, let us hope, the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation.
In terms of general considerations, there are three that I should like to set out, which have shaped our strategic thinking in the Budgets Committee in presenting this budget to Parliament.
Firstly, as we noted in the annual policy strategy (APS) discussions in May, which form the basis for our preparation for this budget, the speed of globalisation outside Europe is shaping our policies.
I believe we have rightly criticised the Commission for taking a laid-back and complacent view on this.
We need to be able to take account in our budgetary policies of the effects of what is happening elsewhere in the world.
Secondly, we are acutely aware that the results of the financial perspective discussions have left us with fewer resources than we might otherwise have hoped, and therefore lead to the need for prioritisation in the way in which we shape our policies.
Thirdly, we must communicate better with our citizens and give them the confidence that we are capable of running the budget effectively.
That being said, what has the process now led to in what we voted for?
First is the general outlook.
In terms of commitments I believe we have been very prudent in allowing significant margins in the various parts of the budget, well under the ceilings provided for in the IIA; and for the first time since 2000 we are not requesting the flexibility instrument.
On the question of payments, we have taken a horizontal approach that reflects the approach taken by Reimer BÃ¶ge, as our rapporteur on the financial perspectives - whose report Parliament adopted - in outlining a number of priority areas; and this is what we have reflected in taking payments on first reading to 1.04%, yet again well beneath the ceiling allowed for 2007 of 1.06%.
This is also keeping a ratio between commitments and payments below 80% in most cases.
In terms of the pilot projects and preparatory actions, we have a range of different possibilities; in terms of internal policies, where we are wanting to underpin innovation, and where we are looking in terms of security at a major initiative on migration management, thanks to our friend and colleague Mr Deprez from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; and, last but not least, on external policy, to see what we can do to build up linkages with China and India, because, as reflected from the outset, in the present globalising world we do not have the right kind of networks which link our business and scientists with those of China and India.
We are putting these in as preparatory actions to be approved under the 2007 budget.
Lastly in terms of payments, I have mentioned the common foreign and security policy, the CFSP.
There are some in the Council who think that we are not being particularly generous in leaving it at a cut of 50%.
There were those who wanted 100%, but we reached 50% as a good compromise because there are a range of people, particularly in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also elsewhere in this Parliament, who would like to see the commitment entered into by the Council fulfilled for the way in which we handle the common foreign and security policy between Parliament and Council.
Equally, in terms of the special representatives, where we are recommending that the whole sum be transferred to the EU delegations, the point we are making on first reading is that we want to have, if not special treatment, at least clarity in the way in which these people are appointed.
As the amendment says, we would like to adopt guidelines for the decision to establish, select and appoint EU special representatives and for the regular assessment of their work.
Turning now to the second aspect, which is value for money, this is an innovative concept where what we want to do is to stop throwing good money after bad.
I do not think there is anybody in this House who has opposed this particular kind of concept, which is involved in identifying those lines where we know from the different reports available to us that the policies are being implemented poorly, either quantitatively or qualitatively.
Thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgets - though it would have been nice if the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control could have contributed more to this process - by looking at our own cost benefit analyses, at the Court of Auditors' reports, at the budget forecast alert and at the synthesis reports provided by the Commission, we have been able to identity a number of lines which we unanimously have voted into reserve at 30% on first reading in the Committee on Budgets.
The intent is to be able to release these sums by the end of the year on second reading, so long as we can have a satisfactory explanation from the Commission on 15 November, when we will have a joint Committee on Budgets-Committee on Budgetary Control meeting to examine these lines and to see whether they are now operating positively.
The whole idea behind this is that we can purge the budget of those lines which are operating ineffectively, and move towards what we are looking for, which is a positive statement of assurance.
Where the Council has suggested that this might be against the Financial Regulation, I think Article 43(1)(b) makes it quite clear that where there are sufficient grounds for us to put monies in the reserve, then we are entitled to do so.
It would be nice if, by the end of our process - maybe on the margins of our conciliation meeting with the Council on 21 November, or in our vote in December - we could come to a common statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how we handle this concept of value for money on a regular basis, so that we can make it a part of our process, rather than something treated in an arbitrary manner.
There are a few last comments on other aspects - budget control and value for money.
The first of these is shared management: the problems about which we heard from the President of the Court of Auditors in the Budgetary Control Committee yesterday evening, when, much to my surprise and that of other colleagues, he said he was not particularly interested in shared management because the Council pays and it is the Commission that takes responsibility for signing off the budget.
I do not think it is possible to have a statement of assurance unless the Member States sign up to their responsibilities under the budget for the funds that they pay, which amount to 75 or 80% of the budget.
Therefore, shared management is something we think is important to have implementation of the IIA provision.
Secondly, as regards work on the agency - which Mrs Haug has so ably coordinated for us - we are putting sums of money of the increases in reserves so that we can hear views from the agencies as to what they will be doing with their money and their work programmes in order to get value for money once again.
Last but not least is the question on the administration, where the Council actions on first reading to effectively diminish the number of Commission posts by some 2000 in the next few years are something we have not been able to sign up to.
We believe that we need a screening exercise of the Commission by 30 April 2007 so that we can understand what the mid-term demands of the Commission are before taking radical action to cut back.
In addition to that, we would not only like a state of play from the Commission as to which of the outstanding regulations we could have withdrawn, but above all what we would like is to be sure that we have clarity between what we have here in the budget process and the legislative process of the work programme which is decided on by the Commission today; so that when we have a final decision on this budget, hopefully in December, and the resolution from Parliament on the legislative work programme, then both of these can be bound together and we can have the Commission President come to Parliament in February 2007 and tell us what the final work programme of the Union is.
Otherwise it is unclear to citizens.
Therefore, I would conclude by saying that this is a budget which in terms of priorities is what I would call a budget which is consistent and forward-looking; in value-for-money terms, it is a budget which can be said to be coherent and prudent; and lastly, that in taking these two building blocks together, we will be able to look forward to the review which will be coming by 2008/2009 and have a very clear position for the European Parliament in order to ensure that where we need increases in particular policies or different actions to be taken on policy matters, we will be well prepared for that debate.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - (MT) The budgetary increase given to the other sections in 2007, when compared to that given in 2006, was only marginal and much less than that requested in the preliminary draft.
The increase agreed upon reflects the rate of inflation and the amounts related to each institution's specific priorities.
The Committee on Budgets decided to restore more than EUR 10 million out of the reductions of around EUR 29 million made by the Council to the other sections, excluding Parliament and the Council.
The 2007 budget was based on the institutions' essential priorities, while ensuring their unhindered operational and functional efficiency.
Globally, the increase for institutions amounts to EUR 31 million compared to the EUR 48 million requested.
Over the years, Mr President, exaggerated margins have become common features of some institutions' estimates.
This practice, or rather bad practice, brought with it an awkward system of last-minute transfers or the cancellation of certain appropriations.
This situation will be difficult to manage when, in a few years' time, the property-acquisition process will start to decline.
In this regard, we believe that an increasingly activity-based approach would be more effective.
Moreover, the presentation of budget estimates should be more standardised, motivations should provide clearer justifications and estimates should be more accurate.
With regard to Parliament, the Committee on Budgets agreed that the final amount of the 2007 budget should be of EUR 0.1397 billion, that is to say a margin of EUR 25 million below the maximum of 20%.
This level corresponds to 19.65% of the administrative expenditure under Chapter V. In this regard, however, Parliament is not renouncing its traditional 20% share.
In fact, the committee extends its support to the appropriation of unused funds for unexpected, but justified, expenses by means of 'amending budgets'.
The creation of an efficient structure, together with the implementation of a redeployment exercise should be the main objectives in the strategic planning for the 2007 Establishment Plan.
Moreover, the filling of vacancies resulting from retirement will not be considered an automatic process.
With regard to support and services for Members, we agree with the Secretary-General that the main objectives relating to the 'raising the game' exercise were, broadly, achieved.
However, there is a recurrent complaint that there is insufficient information about the support services available for MEPs.
The administration should address this shortcoming and corrrect it by no later than the end of this year.
Mr President, due to lack of time I am unable to to talk in detail about all the priorities addressed in the budget and in my report for 2007.
These priorities relate to the EUR 48 million allocated for expenses connected with enlargment involving Bulgaria and Romania; the measures taken for the simplification and upgrading of legislation; the scrutiny of the cost-efficiency of translation services, especially with regard to the length of texts; the authorisation of EUR 9.5 million in supplemetary funds for the improvement of the visitors' programme; the decision to keep EUR 6.7 million in the reserve for Web TV, a final decision about which will be taken after a presentation of the prototype in CoBu; and the need for greater control of the administration of multinlingualism, for which we put EUR 3 million in reserve.
The misuse of this service by some, including political parties, should attract sanctions.
EUR 50 million have been reserved for buildings, and we must ensure that buildings policy is periodically reviewed.
I must conclude by saying that budget implementation requires better management if objectives are to be achieved.
There is also a need for annual reports based on more detailed information about the work carried out by the institutions.
These reports should be used to justify requests for additional funds so that Parliament might arrive at a more rational decision about fund allocation.
This way, budgets financed by European taxpayers will provide real added-value to their everday lives.
Finally, I would like to thank all those who contributed towards the drawing up of this report.
I would especially like to thank the Secretary General, who has handed in his resignation.
We will miss him; whether he will miss us is another matter.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here at Parliament's debate on the 2007 budget.
I can assure you that we will note with interest the issues raised during the discussion and pass them on to all our colleagues.
The budget's drafting process is a long one.
I appreciate the frank atmosphere of debate that has reigned all year long between Members of the Council and Parliament.
We last discussed the issue at the budget trilogue on 18 October.
I had an opportunity then to give a few tentative reactions to the draft amendments by the Committee on Budgets, to be voted on in plenary on Thursday.
Before I present certain important matters to the Council, I would like to deal with certain issues of quality, which are of importance for the work of the Union as a whole.
It is my intention now to speak frankly and call a spade a spade.
I believe that the Committee on Budgets, under the leadership of Mr Elles and Mr Grech, has worked without bias, by also focusing on what can be accomplished using our citizens' and taxpayers' money.
Hopefully, the Commission too will become involved in this work.
The value for money from Union taxes must be made a regular process.
The value for money concept must become something that pervades the entire budgetary procedure.
In my opinion, the first reading of the budget should concentrate on facts and figures.
I do not think that the budgetary authorities should make political statements at first reading.
I said at the Council presentation of the draft budget on 5 September 2006 that the EU's budgetary procedure is in need of innovation.
Without innovative budgetary solutions we cannot promote the Union's competitiveness or make the institutions' administration more efficient.
The budgetary authorities must take concrete action to achieve their objectives in this 2007 budget.
From the Council's viewpoint, Parliament's intention to increase payment appropriations significantly, when there is no proven need to do so, is not the right way to build a bridge between the EU and the general public.
An increase on this scale would only result in an enormous surplus in the first year.
The 2007 budget should be based on realistic and justified appropriation needs.
Halving the common foreign and security policy budget is simply not acceptable.
In the interinstitutional agreement concluded five months ago, Parliament approved an average sum of EUR 250 million per annum.
That being the case, I believe that the EUR 159 million advocated by the Commission and the Council is a reasonable figure.
I would therefore ask how Parliament's suggestion of EUR 73 million can be justified.
I would hope that the plenary session will act responsibly with regard to these two whole areas.
The budgetary authorities need to develop a procedure for the use of reserves in the very near future.
Appropriations should not be set aside merely for tactical reasons.
Here too, the provisions of the Financial Regulation must be complied with to the letter.
As we all know well, the 2007 budget is the first to be covered by the new interinstitutional agreement.
It is very important that all of its old familiar aspects, such as ceilings and adequate margins, are respected right from the start.
The new agreement also has new provisions on, for example, pilot projects and preparatory operations.
I would highlight the importance of these provisions, which clearly state that pilot projects and preparatory operations are not the exclusive right of one budgetary authority.
Both Parliament and the Council must also respect this aspect of the content of the new interinstitutional agreement.
The 2007 budget is a package.
It is important that the budgetary authorities establish the jointly agreed package within the framework of the budgetary procedure.
The crucial elements of the overall package are interlinked.
Finally, I would like to return to the revision of the Financial Regulation.
This is a subject that Parliament and the Commission have been anxious about, and they have been urging the Council to make haste.
President Borrel last raised the matter in his discussions with Prime Minister Vanhanen on 17 October.
It is with pleasure that I can now state that the Council adopted a common position on the revision of the Financial Regulation on 19 October.
We can therefore hold negotiations with Parliament on the Financial Regulation on 21 November.
I am sorry that we have not been able to keep to the timetable proposed by the Commissioner responsible for the budget in her letter in June.
The Commission had hoped that the meeting would be held last week.
I believe, however, that the timetable that I have referred to will give everyone sufficient time to formulate a comprehensive overall solution.
I hope that these brief comments of mine have done something to clarify the Council's opinions.
I earnestly believe that Parliament and the Council can reach a good common solution on the budget for 2007 in the discussions in the weeks ahead.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to express the Commission's appreciation for the work that was done by the Committee on Budgets and its rapporteur, tackling more than 1200 proposals from other committees in the process of the preparations for first reading.
We know what that means and how it was done.
In general, the Commission has had a positive reaction to the proposal that has been placed on the table by Parliament for tomorrow's vote.
However, I should like to mention three sensitive points, which we would like to solve, together with Parliament, before second reading.
The first point is about the horizontal reserves on 30% of budget lines on value-added programmes.
We are a bit concerned about the first application of the programme - not as a political idea, which we supported from the very beginning, but the first application of it on the amount in general and some conditionalities that are coming together.
However, the Commission and its secretariat are ready to come in the middle of November for the hearings, to which Parliament has invited us, to explain as much as we can, to allow Parliament to lift as much as it will be able to before the second reading.
The second element is on agencies, especially three new ones.
They are supposed to come into being in 2007.
The Committee on Budgets was removing preparations for them.
We understand that it concerns point 47 in our new interinstitutional agreement.
The relationship between two budgetary authorities needs to be clarified and the new procedures defined -that is why we will in the near future be asking for technical meetings between the three institutions to clarify the situation in order to allow those three agencies to come into being as of January 2007.
The third element is a reserve of EUR 50 million on Commission staff salaries in heading 5.
We would like to thank Parliament for restoring the cuts which have been performed by the Council, but reserves are still of concern to us because conditionalities are wide and there are a lot of them.
But as I said in the beginning, we will strive to make as much information as possible available before 15 November and before the final conciliation with both arms of the budgetary authority, so as to be able to lift as much as we can.
If a reserve is not lifted at least partially from 1 January, we are not able to start recruitment at all for anybody, including from new Member States and the replacement of retired staff.
In general we are positive.
We are ready to work closely with Parliament on lifting and fulfilling all conditions provided at first reading as a proposal for us.
We hope that by 21 November we will be able to come to an agreement that will be good for all three institutions and acceptable.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (HU) The foreign affairs chapter was perhaps the greatest loser in the seven-year budget, which immediately calls into question whether the European Union will be capable of fulfilling its role as a global player.
It is especially unfortunate that in the annual budget process, the Council has made even further significant cuts to its foreign affairs budget.
It was for this reason that the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided to restore the preliminary draft budget on numerous points, and thus to allocate the original amounts.
We set up the European Parliament's foreign affairs priorities as that we deemed it necessary to devote more resources to the candidate countries and potential candidate countries, to spend more on those countries on the eastern side of our European Neighbourhood Policy, and to provide more humanitarian aid to Palestine.
The Committee on Budgets did not agree with all of our proposals, and therefore we are submitting these proposals once again on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
In the interest of a responsible and consistent foreign policy, we call on you to accept the proposal of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DE) Mr President, perhaps I might be permitted to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Elles on his strategic thinking, particularly with regard to China and India.
This is a new thing and something we should take very seriously.
We in the Committee on Development have managed to get the funds from the preliminary draft budget reinstated, to keep the budget transparent, and to produce a report that is already in line with our colleague Mr Mitchell's on development cooperation instruments, but I have nevertheless tabled two amendments in the plenary, which were not, however, adopted by the Committee on Budgets.
One of these was Amendment 250, which was intended to set up a pilot project for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, which were, I would remind the House, the subject of a report we adopted earlier this year.
If we want to build up the self-employed and small business sector in developing countries, we need to give SMEs an enhanced role.
It really would be vexatious if we were to fail to put in place a pilot project that underlined our own call for stronger SMEs in developing countries.
The other amendment to which I referred was Amendment 253, which has to do with exchanges with other parliaments.
It refers to our own House's Budget and to the possibility of maintaining links with other legislatures, such as the Pan-African Parliament or the Parliament of Afghanistan, which would enable this House to have a real and positive influence on the democratisation process around the world, and so I urge you, on Thursday, to vote to adopt this amendment too.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (LT) The budget is essential in implementing projects that are important and beneficial to the Community and its citizens.
One such project is the Globalisation Adjustment Fund of EUR 500 million.
I suggested assigning the funds to the reserve of the following year's budget of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We will vote on this in December.
However, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to draw your attention, and especially the attention of the Commission, to the rules established for the use of the funds.
The question is whether the money will actually reach a particular unemployed person?
The money cannot be misappropriated as it had often been the case with donor aid to undertakings in the process of restructuring.
I foresee a considerable risk of misusing the Commission's funds.
It is against this that we, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, have voted.
We cannot accept the rules unless they are substantially amended.
I therefore call upon you to take a firm stand and demand that the Commission guarantee the transparent and effective use of funds.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the start of the first financial year of the Financial Perspective that we negotiated in April and adopted in May is almost upon us; the financial framework is a tight one, and presents us with a number of problems as regards the achievement of our policy objectives.
The Commission took a very cautious approach to drawing up the preliminary draft budget for 2007, and the Council - as always unperturbed by what the experts might say - cut it even further down to size.
The Committee on the Environment tried to save what could be saved by reinstating the figures from the preliminary draft budget and making responsible increases in a few lines.
The Committee on Budgets took on board all the Committee on the Environment's amendments, and for that I am very grateful to my fellow-Members who sit on it.
We cannot, however, regard the overall situation as satisfactory, since the financial year 2007 will present us with as yet unresolved problems with LIFE+ and the action programme on health.
Agencies are the only area in which we can look forward to the future with optimism on the grounds that they are being properly developed and funded, and by that I mean not only those agencies for which the Committee on the Environment is the competent specialised committee, but all of them, cooperation with which has undergone a marked improvement over the last two years; indeed, the personnel and personnel development plans for them will be in our hands by the end of the year, and I take a positive view of all of them.
It has to be said, though, that there are persistent difficulties with the new ones - the Gender Institute, the Human Rights Agency, and the Chemicals Agency - and, contrary to what the Commissioner has just said, these are not of a merely technical nature, for there is as yet no legal basis for any of them.
We in this House are still waiting for the start of negotiations with the Council pursuant to Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement - negotiations, that is, on where the money for the three new agencies is to come from.
Perhaps the Presidency of the Council might be so good as to move this process along a bit.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I should like to make three points.
Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for increasing payment appropriations for priority programmes linked to the Lisbon Agenda, like the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
These are key initiatives that not only provide work for Europe's valuable and highly skilled scientists but also prepare the EU to face future challenges as a global leader.
We should not overlook the significant and positive impact that they have on our regions and their populations.
Secondly, I commend this report for the concern it expresses for the Galileo Programme, which has been under-funded in the 2007 draft general budget.
This showcase EU programme is a major technological, economic and political challenge and we really need to be sure about it.
I do not understand why we are prepared to cut funding in this area.
It would be an embarrassment for the EU if this project were to stall or fail due to lack of financial backing.
Thirdly, since many areas, such as the ones I have just mentioned, require increased funding, I do not understand why, when the ITRE Committee's request is for a smaller budget, this does not come from the Security and Space Research programme, where we should reduce payments and not increase them.
Turning to more general non-ITRE issues, on the structural funds I support the call in this report for an increase in payments.
This is the one area where ordinary citizens see the difference EU policies make to their everyday lives.
My own region, the West Midlands, is a case in point.
EU funds have acted as a catalyst in re-energising the potential and development of local communities.
On external affairs, Asia is one of the largest and most populous regions in the world.
It contains 60% of the world's population.
So I am amazed that the Commission has cut funding.
Last year money for the tsunami disaster was taken from other Asian programmes without any increase and this year, because the tsunami funding has decreased, the Commission has cut the funding again.
Has the Commission forgotten that the money is desperately needed by the Asian programmes which were sacrificed, where the EU is committed to meeting Millennium Development Goals?
I ask the Commission to justify this.
I welcome this report's call for transparency in the allocation of funding for information and communication.
We need full transparency across the board, so EU taxpayers' money spent on EU policies should be totally traceable and published on the Internet.
Then we can see exactly how much money goes to whom.
This applies equally to the Members of this House and especially to agriculture.
Finally, I should like to congratulate both the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, on producing excellent reports.
I thank them for their hard work.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President: one minute, two points.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has quite simply voted for the maintenance of the Commission's proposed spending on consumer protection, not the deep cuts proposed by the Council.
So we are voting for the status quo as proposed by the Commission.
Secondly, I should like to mention Parliament's budget for communicating with our citizens.
Each year American congressmen are allowed to send four four-sided newspapers to every single one of their voters to tell them of their glorious achievements.
I propose an amendment that would allow each of us here to send one free four-sided newspaper to each of our voters every year to tell them what we are doing.
I hope colleagues will support the amendment, which would help make up the communication deficit.
We have a few voters here in the visitors' gallery, but there are millions out there who do not know what we are doing and we need to communicate with them.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the financial perspective, the amount for the trans-European networks - the 30 top-priority transport projects - has been cut back to a third of the amount that the Commission originally found necessary.
We still do not have the legal basis for the funding in order.
Nor do we know how the reduced amount is to be distributed over the next few years.
We have therefore chosen to put the whole of the amount for 2007 - almost EUR 800 million - into reserves until everything has been clarified.
We cannot, of course, make use of the first year's budget without having a clear idea of what is to happen over the next few years.
You do not build half a bridge.
It is a question of 'either/or'.
In the case of the three agencies for maritime, aviation and railway safety, we want to see the Commission's figures reinstated in the budget.
These are new agencies in the course of being set up, and they need space in which to work.
Last but not least, I would draw attention to the pilot project for safe lay-bys along European motorways.
With more stringent rules governing drivers' rest and driving periods, it is important for European drivers to have proper and safe conditions in which to rest.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, I should like to say 'well done' to the rapporteur: he has certainly shown a steady hand.
On an overall level, payments in the 2007 budget must reach 1.04% of EU GNI if we are to deliver effective programmes to our citizens.
It is also crucial that we adopt a qualitative, value-for-money approach with the resources that we have.
Somebody made the comment that the Council pays.
In fact, it does not. The citizens pay.
We are dealing with taxpayers' money; they have entrusted their money to us and they rightly expect to see positive results within the context of overall value for money.
As rapporteur on the REGI Committee, I strongly urge that the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget be restored and that cohesion be considered one of the policy priorities of the EU.
Finally, I call on the Commission to clarify the legal base of the peace programme and enable resources to be allocated to the International Fund for Ireland.
As an Irish MEP, I am pleased to have the opportunity to thank the EU for its continuing support for peace and IFI funding.
Well in excess of EUR 1 billion has been given to promote peace-building, understanding and tolerance.
You have supported communities and shown faith with ordinary people in the border regions of Ireland.
You have played your role and you can take credit for that.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Elles, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, all the amendments by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been accepted by the Committee on Budgets.
First of all, I am delighted that the amendments concerning the restoration of the Preliminary Draft Budget have been adopted, and I am even more delighted that the amendments concerning the increase in aid to the poorest people have been adopted: food aid, refunds for milk, free distribution of fruit and vegetables, promotion activities, the distribution of milk to schoolchildren and aid for bee-keeping.
We should have liked more account to have been taken of, in particular, suckler-cow premiums - vital in disadvantaged areas - aid for energy crops and pilot projects on energy efficiency.
We shall take the liberty of re-tabling amendments along those lines in plenary.
Overall, we consider that the Committee on Budgets has been attentive beyond our expectations to the amendments that we were proposing, and we would thank you, Mr President, Mr Elles, ladies and gentlemen, for the constructive spirit in which your decisions were taken.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (ES) Mr President, our committee has drawn up certain observations with regard to the cuts introduced by the Council in relation to the European Commission's proposals.
The most significant of these cuts is the EUR 10 million cut in the reserve in international agreements, which is being taken away - is disappearing - both for commitments and for payments.
The Committee on Fisheries believes that this could even create problems with regard to the Union's legal obligations in this field, and we are therefore calling for the initial sums to be restored.
The Council's other reductions relate to the payments of the European Fisheries Fund: EUR 23 million for the convergence regions and EUR 7 million for those that are not included in this category.
The Committee on Fisheries believes that these cuts would make it impossible to pay the advance of 7%, as stipulated in the Fund's own Regulation.
Ladies and gentleman, the general contribution allocated to fisheries is already modest enough, and we therefore find these cuts unacceptable.
As well as being arbitrary and unjustified, they send a very negative message at a critical time for the sector, and we in the Committee on Fisheries are therefore asking for the figures proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget to be restored.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe in principle that we should go after value for money, for the effective and economic use of funds is what matters.
On the other hand, though - and this is where we have different ends in mind - Europe needs money if we are to be able to enthuse people and move the European project forward, which is what we want to do, and that will not be possible unless proper funding is made available.
Let me remind the House of this morning's debates on the culture programme and on Europe's culture policy, and of the debates we are going to have this evening on lifelong learning, on youth policy over the coming years and on 'Europe for the Citizens'.
This morning, it was lamented - as it will be this evening too - that we do not spend enough money in this field, in an area that really does have an impact on people, on Europe's citizens, and builds a link between them and Europe.
We share together the great problem of how we get people not only to accept Europe, but also to be enthusiastic about it, and that is why, far from cutting back on these programmes, we should be investing more in Europe's future.
That is also why the Committee on Culture and Education has been highly consistent in rejecting the cuts the Council wanted to make to these programmes.
Mr President, Mrs Wideroos, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I want first of all to say a well-deserved thank you to the general rapporteur, our fellow Member and friend Mr Elles, as well as to the Committee on Budgets as a whole, for the way in which it has taken account of the priorities of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Among these priorities, there are two that obviously deserved a very special effort when it came to the budget.
The first priority was better control of the EU's external borders, which are now subject to permanent and considerable migratory pressures, with the whole of the southern border under particular pressure.
Anyone who needs convincing of this need only watch television and read the newspapers every day.
In this connection, it was essential to strengthen the operational resources of the FRONTEX Agency, which we established for the purposes of external border control.
Happily, the Agency's resources were, indeed, strengthened, with the support, in particular, of our general rapporteur and Spanish fellow Members who helped us correct - I do not know, Mrs Wideroos, whether to use the word 'stupidity' or 'incoherence'; I shall opt for 'stupidity' - the stupidity of the Council, which had, for its part, reduced the resources of the FRONTEX Agency in spite of current circumstances.
We had a second priority, this too recognised by the whole of Parliament and enthusiastically supported by Europeans, if all the available polls are to be believed, which was to increase the resources earmarked for the fight against terrorism and organised crime which, as you well know, make a mockery of the EU's internal borders.
On this subject too, our message has been heard by the Committee on Budgets which has, in particular, increased the resources set aside for Eurojust.
These too had been reduced in the Council's draft budget. Mrs Wideroos, I shall leave it to you to choose a suitable adverb to characterise this reduction.
I make no bones about the fact that, where the 'freedom, security and justice' sector is concerned, the Council is equal neither to what is at stake nor to Europeans' expectations, and our Parliament will be able to take pride in using its vote to correct the inconsistencies in the position of the Council, whose members delight in making all the right noises but balk at acting together to confront serious problems they have in common.
It is a terrible shame.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, it is often said that knowledge does not take up any space, but in this case I believe that the debate and the reflection on the future of Europe should have a space in the budget.
When we met with the general rapporteur in July, I told him, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that this may appear to be the least important thing in this debate, but that in reality that was not the case.
We are debating the way we want Europe to be in the future and, in order to realise our dreams, we need funds and resources, above all so that we can inform the citizens, strengthen the institutions responsible for relations between civil society and the European institutions and promote the debate.
Are we going to achieve that with the budget we have?
The amendments presented by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have been taken up to a certain extent by the Committee on Budgets.
In that way we will be able to promote proper reflection on these matters and also ensure that the citizens understand some - if just a little - of this debate that we are holding here and know what the Union's budget is.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, I should like thank my colleagues, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who have done considerable work on the EU budget for 2007.
In general, although I support the approach of our rapporteurs, in the final analysis we must guarantee sufficient funding for common foreign and security policy and we must find a solution to the funding of the agencies.
However, the ongoing negotiations can only be based on a mutual understanding that all sides abide by their earlier commitments.
I address this to the Council in particular, which has repeatedly proposed extensive budget cuts in areas of great importance to the European Parliament.
