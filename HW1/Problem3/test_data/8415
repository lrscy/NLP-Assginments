I voted in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, one of the reasons why we abstained in the vote on this motion for a resolution was because we did not find the slightest mention in it of the grave discrimination contained in the Slovenian legislation on compensation â legislation that penalises refugees and their children for the terrible events that took place in the post-war period in these countries.
Today, 10Â February, is the second time that a day of remembrance has been celebrated in our country.
On behalf, too, of a Member here today, the MEP MrÂ Gobbo, I would like to mention the flight of 350Â 000 of our compatriots that were driven out of their countries and, above all, the sacrifice and the tragedy of the more than 10Â 000 people thrownÂ âÂ in many case when still aliveÂ âÂ into caves and ditches in these countries: a tragedy affecting the Istrian, Giuliano-Dalmatian and Fiumano peoples and which is still present in the lived experience and the suffering of these lands; a tragedy that Europe too should remember and commemorate.
It is another holocaust that calls to mind the tragedies of totalitarianism of the last century.
Â Â  . We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion for a resolution on the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights because, generally speaking, the resolution proclaims the ÎU to be the 'honest' judge of respect for human rights but says nothing about the blatant violations of human rights within the ÎU: persecution of trade unionists, electronic files, monitoring personal life on the pretext of combating terrorism, infringement of the rights to housing and work and equal access to health care, education and social welfare, taking away physical integrity and life in the workplace for greater profit etc.
And:
- the resolution criticises the Commission on Human Rights for becoming highly politicised, obviously implying that the refusal by the majority of its members to satisfy the demands of the ÎU and the USA to condemn states and precisely serving their ideological and political expediencies (Cuba, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Belarus etc.);
- it avoids firing on the USA, where executions and blatant violations of human rights are a daily occurrence;
- it proposes a 'fair' trial for Saddam Hussein, while not only does it not propose a trial for Bush, Blair and their accomplices, it also proclaims them as guarantors of justice;
- human rights are again being 'exploited' to pave the way for the CFSP, in other words military intervention.
Â Â  . The question of human rights is one to which we could never be indifferent, yet this does not give us the right to give lessons on human rights.
It does, however, give us sufficient moral authority to refuse to accept other peopleâs criteria for determining whether behaviour in the area of human rights is good or bad.
Our abstention, far from being tantamount to indifference, is intended to show how important the question of human rights is to us and how we do not accept the approval of resolutions that are based on market ideology and related concepts, in which certain countries are mentioned and certain others not, in which there appear to be favourite sons and black sheep... whereas there are no prodigal sons â perish the thought! â in the field of competitiveness and productivity.
We similarly refuse to accept the smokescreen of compensation, in which the inclusion of some makes up for mere reference to others.
This explains our vote.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation strongly supports genuine human rights and the need for the UN Commission on Human Rights to take a robust position to overcome abuses in many parts of the world.
We therefore welcomed many aspects of the resolution, not least the concern expressed at the lack of action over Zimbabwe.
However, we do not support the one-sided statement regarding the situation in the Middle East which makes no mention of the appalling terrorism against Israelis; the unrealistic and broadly unsympathetic attitude to strong counter-terrorist measures; or indeed the unquestioning approval of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
We therefore abstained on this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Katiforis presents a report on the role and methods of rating agencies.
Also in this case, when I closed my eyes, I saw MrÂ Katiforis who was running and running and was breathless.
âWhere are you running?â I asked him.
He said âI am running so that I arrive to present my report before the collapse of Parmalat in Italy.
Fatuzzo, you know MrÂ Mennea.
Tell him to get the rating report because he will certainly run faster than me, being a Moscow Olympic runner, and he will, therefore, get to present it and get it adopted before Parmalat collapsesâ.
I am sorry to say that this was a dream that has not been realised: MrÂ Katiforis did not manage to get to present his report and have it adopted before the sad event of the Parmalat Bond collapse.
Â Â  . Recent financial scandals, such as Enron and Parmalat, are further evidence of the consequences of liberalising capital markets and the role of the rating agencies that gave the creditworthiness of these giant transnationals a clean bill of health, even though they did not disclose any information on their activities.
This was only allowed to happen because the rating agencies are a product of the private sector, a self-regulating product of the market that creates mechanisms to assess the creditworthiness of entities that finance themselves by collecting money from third parties, such as companies that float on the stock market and even States, in terms of issuing public debt.
Rating agencies wield great power in the financial market, since rating is a legal condition of eligibility for investment portfolios.
Additionally, the ratings âmarketâ is highly concentrated and the biggest agencies, two of which have their headquarters in the USA â one gave Parmalat a positive rating â operate an oligarchy.
As a self-regulating instrument of regulation, the rating agencies serve to extend the liberalisation of the capital markets.
In order to make them an essential regulating body, they would have to be regulated by public bodies within the framework of national legislation and jurisprudence.
The report manages to ask questions and make diagnoses, but does not prescribe any medicine, which only serves to encourage these self-regulating instruments.
The question is more political than technical, and, politically speaking, the end-product justifies our vote against.
Â Â  Knowing that I was to vote on the activities of public utilities in developing countriesÂ âÂ and I said I would vote in favourÂ âÂ many pensioners that were listening to me in Milan, last Saturday, urged me to discuss the possibility of ensuring that, in European Union interventions in developing countries on issues of public services, pension systems in the said countries are improved, given that we are not managing to give more to pensioners in Italy and in Europe, nor, in particular, to do our best to ensure that widows have 100% of the pensions of their late spouses and that all those that work have 120% of their final salaries.
Â Â  â The rapporteur acknowledges that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises and of public services in poor countries â privatisation desired and imposed by big Western investors and by the states that defend their interests â has helped increase poverty in the developing countries.
Now that the European Commission, which is among the guarantors of the interests of big European investors, seems to be advocating more diversified forms of privatisation in these poor countries, to their disadvantage, the rapporteur openly backs its recommendations.
Well, we, on the other hand, do not.
We are, on principle, opposed to the open or creeping privatisation of public services, for it leads, always and everywhere, to a deterioration in the populationsâ living conditions.
In poor countries, this drastic impairment of peoplesâ conditions of life, and even of survival, is all the more appalling in that, as the rapporteur acknowledges, it is aimed at depriving what are already some of the most destitute peoples on the planet of the very little that they have, a process that is to the sole benefit of the Western multinationals which, for their part, make more profit than they can cope with.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .â To economists, major profit-making international businesses, based in Europe, America or Japan, are often the benchmark for the developing countries, which would automatically prosper if those businesses were given the freedom to take over loss-making activities and export raw materials.
This assumption is short-sighted.
For centuries, the economy in those countries was controlled by the north, as a result of which they were forced to produce cheap products for the market of rich countries, to the detriment of their domestic economy and the provision of services to their own people.
To a large extent, following the removal of colonial government, they have themselves had to develop and extend provision in the fields of education, health care, public transport, house building, postal services, electricity, drinking water, telephone and sewage.
Generally high development costs and low profit expectations have meant those sectors did not initially appeal to foreign private companies.
Moreover, we saw that, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the early development of industry in Japan was possible only thanks to state-owned companies that were privatised only after they had become profitable.
That is why it was useful that the Committee on Development and Cooperation not only considered privatisation and full liberalisation but also the provision of services, poverty reduction, small businesses, cooperatives and a sustainable role for government initiatives.
It is lamentable that todayâs plenary has seen the Christian Democrats standing in the way of a majority for these instruments against poverty and underdevelopment.
Â Â  . The rapporteurâs endeavours in this apparent âmission impossibleâ to give words their real meanings is worthy of praise.
The term âcooperationâmeans supporting the development of companies in third countries, as suggested in the title of the first communication that laid the basis for the report; it also means reforming State-owned companies, which are the basis of public services in these countries, and the need to assess all possible solutions, as suggested in the title of the second.
Such support is, however, straitjacketed by the predominant concept of companies that can only be regulated by the market, which has adopted the predominant strategy of structural adjustments, the predominant solution to which is to dismantle and privatise public services.
The rapporteur questioned ideological concepts and raised questions from a perspective that was not strictly commercial.
It is significant that he referred to the water supply and drainage, to education and to health services, which, in his opinion, should fall within the competences of the State and local authorities.
For local investors and SMUs, in the case of privatisation, to proceed as a matter of priority with the proposal that each TNC should commit as a minimum investment 0.7% of its gross turnover or 5% of its net profit into new investments, as Offset projects in these countries each year, in the context in which we live, is verging on provocation.
This is how this report was greeted by political forces that felt threatened by the presence of a rapporteur tabling alternatives to improve what had appeared incurable.
Â Â  All the Christian Democratic proposals by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats having been, in principle, adopted in plenary, thereby considerably improving the content of the report, I have voted in favour of the latter in the final vote.
The fight against poverty is the main objective of EU development policy.
History shows that state monopolies have often led to economic inefficiency, mismanagement, corruption and injustice in developing countries.
Particularly in the case of services for the benefit of everyone, such as the supply of water and energy, together with education and health, the state sector has failed in the majority of these countries.
Reforms in this sector can therefore contribute to improvements and growth.
Through a number of amendments by ourselves in the PPE-DE Group, this is clearly shown by the report.
The report is therefore in line with the Commissionâs assessment that the fight against poverty can only seriously be taken up through the objective consideration of all the alternatives for reform with a view to increasing economic growth and countering corruption.
Monopoly situations, be they public or private, must be replaced by competition and diversity with a view to increased fairness and better economic management.
Clear legal framework regulations must stand as guarantees of the right to services for the benefit of all.
Small enterprises can operate as important engines of growth in the developing countries and should therefore be supported financially and through technical aid.
Â Â  . Delays have occurred in transposing this directive into national law in some Member States, which shows the problems that its implementation has generated, particularly in industry.
This has led the Commission to embark upon a wide-ranging consultation process with all those concerned.
We will not know, therefore, about the actual transposition of the Directive until Member States have submitted their national reports.
Although the directive has been in force since October 1999, in new installations and existing installations where the operator intends to carry out significant changes, a transitional period has been granted until October 2007, which requires special support to be granted to industrial SMEs and to farmers.
The integrated prevention and control of pollution, which is the aim of this directive, can be achieved with a permit system for installations, which we welcome.
Different circumstances must, however, be taken into account and the most contentious areas of the directive must be clarified, in order that we find acceptable solutions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this resolution.
Ever since the Gothenburg Summit the EU has been proposing âsustainable developmentâ, which is the only guarantee of human development that deems respect for the environment as an essential prerequisite for rapid progress.
I therefore consider it to be extremely important that we proceed responsibly â as in the question before us today â towards implementing and transposing directives that lay down this intention in law.
Concepts such as âcross-complianceâ in the technical conditions of operating licences, sharing best practices and defining best available techniques (BATs), are just some of the ways in which we can ensure the integrated prevention and reduction of pollution resulting from a wide range of industrial and agricultural activities, and in which we can reach a higher level of environmental protection.
Within the framework of the 1996 Directive under consideration, a system of permits for new installations is established, which forces operators to adopt pollution prevention measures.
It also urges all installations to comply with the same rules from 2007 onwards.
I agree with the rapporteur when she stresses the importance of forcing Member States to present their plans for assessing transposition (also by 2007) as soon as possible.
For this purpose, a âGuidance Documentâ clarifying the definition of âinstallationâ and other key terms would be most helpful âŠ
Â Â  The ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) operates today as an important independent organisation, based on national research institutions.
There is therefore no reason for the EU to seek membership and appoint people to work in the ICES.
Firstly, it would place a question mark over both the ICESâs and the Commissionâs independence, since the Commission is the main user of the ICESâs results.
Secondly, there is a limited number of qualified researchers.
If the Commission is to appoint researchers to this task, it will lead to a drain on the national institutions, for the simple reason that the Commission pays better.
The June Movementâs three Members of the European Parliament, Ulla SandbÃŠk, Jens-Peter Bonde and Bent Hindrup Andersen, chose to vote against the report, a decision for which the following explanation of vote was given.
In principle, the June Movement believes that all attempts by the EU to dominate the ICES should be voted down.
This ought to be a national concern.
The June Movement believes it would be better if the EU were to call upon the nation states to increase their scientific capacity in relation to the ICES and, if need be, to coordinate research efforts in the area.
Â Â  . In order to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources, it is important that we are provided with detailed information and credible scientific opinions regarding the current state and ongoing development of these resources.
The overriding concern is reliability of information, which has often been called into question, thereby creating unwanted tension between investigators, scientists and fishermen.
There are therefore two crucial issues:
- The first entails fishermen taking an active role in the management of fishing effort and participating in the evaluation of studies into resources in conjunction with investigators and scientists.
Fishermen have the most to gain from the sustainability of resources and from stock recovery measures.
It is therefore important that we create suitable bodies that enable effective communication between all those concerned;
- The second entails a thorough evaluation of the socio-economic impact of stock recovery measures or measures aimed at reducing the fishing effort.
The implementation of these measures, which is sometimes voluntary on the part of the fishermen, as happens in Portugal in the case of sardines, requires compensation at public, national and Community level.
It is also necessary to increase EU funding in research in the fisheries sector and to create the material and human conditions required to improve scientific advice.
Â Â  . Scientific research has become an essential instrument in implementing the common fisheries policy and is crucial to the sustainable management of resources.
The limits placed on fishing in the EU have had devastating socio-economic consequences.
Portugal has been particularly hard hit by such measures, especially in the conversion of activities and in the destruction of large parts of the national fishing fleet.
I see the consequences of fisheries management measures every day in the ports and fish markets of my region and I am furious that the Commission continues to pursue the same policy, without having any evaluation carried out into the socio-economic impact of implementing these measures.
It is therefore important that these special arrangements, given their irreversibility, are duly justified in thorough scientific reports containing highly credible information on the development of resources.
Given the lack of objective information, current scientific reports give rise to conflicting interpretations on the part of Member States, thereby counteracting the effects of measures to protect fisheries resources.
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the work of the rapporteur.
I share his concern about the lack of scientific advice on fishing, and about the scarcity of financial and human resources.
I also endorse the need to strengthen the ties between science and industry, thus giving the final results greater practicability.
Â Â  . The report drawn up by Mr Lage addresses the important question of the credibility of scientific opinions used in fisheries management, given the frequent differences of opinion between scientists and fishermen regarding the current state of fisheries resources.
EU measures based on scientific advice can have a devastating impact on fishing communities.
It is in this light that we see the importance of this issue and the need to improve the quality of this advice.
Mr Lageâs warning therefore gives the Community the opportunity to base the common fisheries policy on more accurate, more timely advice, thereby leading to a stronger scientific basis than has thus far been detected.
It is unacceptable that we continue to see the âCommissionâs apparent unwillingnessâ, as Mr Lage puts it, to have regard to all the scientific advice available.
This only serves to increase suspicion of bias in their decisions, which tend to overlook fishing communities that are already completely unprotected.
My vote in favour of this report is, therefore, also an expression of solidarity with Portuguese fishermen, who have been so severely affected by the Commissionâs â and in particular Commissioner Fischlerâs â Fisheries Policy.
Â Â  â The Lage report rightly emphasises that the management measures adopted by the European Union are too often based upon faulty and unreliable scientific diagnoses.
The socio-economic consequences of management measures adopted on such a flimsy basis are considerable: it is the very survival of entire fisheries and, indeed, entire industries that is at stake.
The scientific effort must therefore be increased and relate both to the biology of marine environments and to the selection of fishing gear, as well as to the socio-economic consequences of the measures for managing the resource.
The current imbalance in the CFP, which does not take overall account of the joint objectives of conserving the resource and ensuring the continuity of fisheries, must definitely be corrected.
To this end, the future Regional Advisory Councils will have to play an absolutely key role in formulating requests for scientific advice.
They will have to request a range of management options, accompanied by estimates of their biological and socio-economic consequences.
Such a development should permit an approach that is no longer brutal and irreversible but gradual, progressive, flexible and continuously adaptable.
I am pleased that it has been possible to adopt the amendments I had tabled along those lines.
Â Â  That concludes the voting.
(1)
Â Â  We shall now continue the item which was interrupted, which is the debate on the report (A5-0022/2004) by Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the development of agricultural incomes in the European Union (2002/2258(INI)).
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by saying how appalled I am that Commissioner Fischler is not here.
This simply defies belief, given the importance of the debate.
Farmers have a right to decent incomes.
The guarantee of profitable producer prices must, therefore, be the guiding premise of the common agricultural policy, in order to ensure farmers a decent standard of living on a par with other sectors of activity.
This will in turn ensure that agricultural activity is sustained throughout EU territory.
While these aims are enshrined in the CAP, the mechanisms of the policy â placing emphasis on reducing producer prices and on liberalising the agriculture markets both externally and internally â are entirely at variance with them.
We know that this policy has been responsible for the disappearance of thousands of agricultural holdings and jobs, promoting the concentration, intensification and verticalisation of production, the centralisation of land ownership and the growing rural exodus.
It has, furthermore, exacerbated the injustice of the uneven allocation of agricultural production aid among producers, production and countries.
It is this model that, twelve years after the 1992 CAP reform, perpetuates the profound injustice that 20% of the major holdings receive 80% of aid.
In Portugal, 1% of the major holdings receive almost half of this aid, a situation that we have always contested.
The current reform of the CAP, with the decoupling of production aid based on historical references, perpetuates this imbalance.
The decision not to proceed with genuine modulation and the establishment of aid limits was something of a missed opportunity.
Aid should not be simply a matter of transferring money to rural development, but should instead act to offset the profound inequalities in the distribution of aid among farmers and countries.
It is also important to point out that reduced prices of products and increased production costs, even taking into account the partial compensation of production aid, led to the disappearance of around 16% of agricultural holdings between 1995 and 2002.
Not that consumers saw the benefits of these price reductions.
The consumer price index rose, in fact, during the period concerned by around 11%, while the producer price index fell by more than 1%.
A determining â and worrying â factor in this situation is the gradual deregulation of the CAPâs market mechanisms, in addition to the fact that these mechanisms discriminate between continental and Mediterranean production.
In view of the volatility and uniqueness of the agriculture sector, effective mechanisms must be introduced to regulate the market and to stabilise supply, so as to guarantee farm incomes.
It is also important, as the rapporteur advocates, that we provide adequate external protection for agriculture and that we create Community mechanisms enabling us to intervene in any disaster that may befall the sector.
We also feel that rural development should be strengthened, yet this would entail increasing the agriculture budget, not freezing it until 2013, as decided at the Copenhagen Council.
Increasing the agriculture budget would make it possible to offer compensation to farmers in the least-favoured regions or to those on lower incomes.
This is essential if we are to maintain multifunctional agriculture and high quality farm produce.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the report by MrÂ Garot is plausible and realistic and, therefore, positive, even if not all of the figures that he reports relate to the different types of agriculture that we have in the Union; for example, the 7% increase in income and the 15.7% decrease in the number of farms does not correspond to hill and mountain farming, where the figures are, unfortunately, very different: only a 1% increase in income, but more than 25% of farms are abandoned.
I would therefore like to mention that hill and mountain farming does not represent a secondary aspect of European agriculture as a whole: it covers 20% of the useful agricultural area and 30% of land; and 5% of European citizens live in mountain areas.
Leaving the mountains not only has economic but, as we know, also social and environmental effects.
Leaving the mountains means endangering a whole system, the hydrogeological balance and the control of forest expansion.
It means putting an end to every type of agro-tourism, which would lead to repercussions for valley areas too.
What are the possible solutions?
To allow fixed and suitable compensation for hill and mountain farmers that takes account of the commitment to multifunctional agriculture; and to launch a specific but comprehensive policy for mountain areas that, for the most disadvantaged areas too, guarantees services and aid to improve the general quality of life and not, therefore, just the economic level of those who choose to live there.
The strong push towards rural developmentÂ âÂ shown in the recent reform of the CAPÂ âÂ gives some guarantee, but it is not enough.
The specific nature of mountain areas needs to be explicitly recognised in the Treaties and in structural measures, and we need to have the courage to act with determination to overcome, as far as possible, the restrictions of State aid.
Â Â  Mr President, this area is extremely complex, but it is most important that we address it to ensure the continuing viability of our farms and rural areas.
Comparisons of farm income can be very difficult: they depend on the base year used â 1995 in this case â and the figures vary depending on whether you take an aggregate, a family, a household or an individual measure.
We must compare like with like.
Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2% in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion, and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64% of this figure.
Our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 5.8% in 2002 to EUR 14Â 900.
There are large variations, depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming.
For instance, in 2002 average farm family income on the 40% of farms classified as full-time was EUR 27Â 760.
On the 60% of farms classified as part-time, the income was only EUR 6Â 590.
However, farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified.
The 1999-2000 household budget survey shows that almost 60% of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources, contributing to the future viability of many farms.
On the average farm income in the EU in 2003, we ranked eighth.
According to the most recent Eurostat estimate, average income per full-time job equivalent, adjusted to inflation, fell by 0.6% in Ireland in 2003, compared to an average increase of 0.9% in the EU as a whole.
The distribution of direct payments in Ireland may be more equitable than in other EU countries, as there are relatively few very large farms, particularly arable farms.
While the top 20% in the EU receive 73% of direct aid, our farm survey shows that approximately 40% of payments went to the 20% of farmers with the highest family farm income.
The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling.
Public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector, and the European Union could be left covering the highest or uninsurable risks, which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems.
I welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the Council.
A higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes.
Before any rate is decided on, the first step should be to evaluate the Community's rural development needs, cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost.
I am opposed to a major redistribution of direct payments, as suggested.
The purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production.
I have always supported the concept of decoupling.
The aim is to avoid a major disturbance of production patterns and land values.
Farmers have established entitlements and any redistribution would lead to losses and gains.
Redistribution would also impact on production decisions by farmers, whereas the intention was to respond to market signals rather than force change upon them because of a fundamental change in the level of support.
The CAP reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry.
The options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from WTO challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as regards the economic aspect, I can only congratulate MrÂ Garot on his articulate and accurate report.
It is a report, which, not least, rekindles some of the issues and questions that we have put to the Commission during the current term: for example, the establishment of sectoral contracts to increase the level of quality, if necessary, but in any case to guarantee quality in agriculture; access to the European market for products from third countries that are subject to the same standards as European products; and a crisis management system.
Furthermore, the report calls for consideration of the fact that the reduction and the fall in agricultural prices has not in fact had any effect on consumption.
Having said that, however, and at a purely theoretical levelÂ âÂ and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development know my position as regards the proposal for mid-term revisionÂ âÂ I believe that we have taken on a huge responsibility, the effects of which we will be able to analyse only in a few yearsâ time, since the formula chosen for regulating the markets and stabilising pricesÂ âÂ aid for production that is direct, fixed and de-coupled âÂ will lead us to gradually dismantle the agricultural sector.
We made choices based on a vision rather than on a foreign policy as regards CancÃºn.
We have seen the results of CancÃºn, and we have seen how the talks at Geneva have been resumed.
Among other things, I believe that some figures in the Garot reportÂ âÂ the 7% increase in agricultural prices from 1995 to 2002Â âÂ refer to historical prices and do not, for example, take into account the inflation rate that has a marked effect upon agricultural prices.
The whole of the agricultural situation projected until 2011 in the European Union is, in my opinion, very much more sensitive, and with much more complicated rules, than the situation presented by MrÂ Garot.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me too start by thanking Mr Garot for his own-initiative report.
Income policy in the agricultural sector has a direct influence on the attractiveness of the farming life, and consequently on the continuation of agricultural production; connected with the effect it has on rural development.
Europeâs farmers enjoy very widely differing levels of income.
In recent years, agriculture has had to cope with profound structural change, and that is not yet over.
Between 1995 and 2002 alone, the number of farms in the EU has decreased by an average of 15.7%.
European farmerâs income consists in part of direct payments and not merely of production yield; moreover, the fall in prices for basic agricultural produce bears no relation to the way the prices paid by consumers for food have changed.
In future, too, production costs will increase as a result of the greater demands made of agriculture, while farmersâ compensation payments will not be increased correspondingly.
What compensation payments must do is to guarantee that societyâs needs are met: the desire for healthy and safe food and for an environment fit to live in.
Compensation payments for agriculture are justified insofar as they reward its multifunctional services to society, above all â as Mr Santini said â in the mountainous, less-favoured, and peripheral regions of the EU.
The European Unionâs agriculture will also need a strong dose of entrepreneurship and an underlying production role.
Farmersâ understanding of their own occupational role and their social status increasingly depend on to what extent the agricultural policy promotes farming enterprise.
It is at this that the individual instruments must be targeted, but the common agricultural policy must not permit the first pillar to be played against the second.
Nor may we disregard the requirement that these agricultural policy instruments be provided over a specified period, thus making it possible to plan and act within a longer timeframe.
There is no getting away from the Financial Perspective as a means of giving our farmers, to some extent, the certainty they need in order to plan ahead, which agriculture and rural areas need.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a sincere thank-you to MrÂ Garot for a constructive report that is very good at depicting todayâs agricultural economy.
Agricultural economics is a very important subject for the development of thriving rural areas.
Thriving rural areas are entirely dependent upon the existence of profitable farms.
In a Europe in which 50% of farmers are over 55 years of age and only eight per cent under 35, a whole new attitude to agricultureâs entrepreneurs is required.
If I were now asked to give advice to people who had recently started up a farm, I would reply that they should make their financial calculations without reference to funding by society and not rely upon the good will of politicians.
The report contains a number of points I cannot support.
For example, it talks about ensuring âa fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilis[ing] incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Unionâ.
A second point emphasises the importance of âmaintain[ing] the level of public support for agricultureâ and the significance of creating âconditions that will guarantee employmentâ and so forth. If these sentences, worded as they are, were read out to todayâs farmers, they would leave them cold.
In a country like Sweden, these words do not correspond to reality.
Only 0.5 per cent of the population are now farmers.
Restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly.
The mid-term review has meant that everything has stopped, apart from the running down of agriculture.
That is not of course something that can be blamed solely upon the European Community.
A lot of the blame lies, for example, with the Swedish Government.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Wachtmeister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .Successful â that is, profitable â agriculture is an essential part of the rural economy and a major influence on the viability of basic rural services, from schools to post offices.
Many agri-businesses in Scotland are facing major pressure on net incomes.
In addition to the farm-gate price pressures which all farmers face, Scots producers, especially those in Highland and Island areas, have to cope with high costs of transportation and other challenges such as climatic conditions.
Scots food producers must be encouraged by the new CAP to capitalise on their already good reputation for natural production methods and resulting production of good quality and healthy foodstuffs, which consumers will want to choose.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0018/2004) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on agriculture and agricultural research in the framework of CAP reform (2003/2052(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, I believe that this report, with the short debate on it that is shortly to follow, fits in well with what we have been discussing: not only avian influenza, but also MrÂ Garotâs report, which has shed light on the difficulties faced by European agriculture, whilst also stressing its significance by reason of the multifunctional role given to it and in view of the status of agriculture as a dominant factor in the overall ecological and social balance of agricultural landscapes.
Consideration must be given to why it is that agriculture is in such a difficult position in this respect, even though the European Union is one of the areas importing the most agricultural produce and food.
Why â for this is the theme of the report â does the Sixth Research Framework Programme allocate only 5% of its funds to agriculture?
This does not do justice to the importance of agriculture, and it must also be noted that the research into agriculture announced in this Framework Programme is to a large extent aimed at rationalising production rather than at the sustainability issue.
Take the problem of genetically modified organisms, for example: although it must be admitted that a vast amount is spent on genetic engineering, little is being done as regards coexistence and the sustainable and long-term cultivation of crops that have been genetically modified alongside those that have not.
Let me return, though, to this morningâs consideration of avian influenza.
We cannot fail to notice that, in the countries where it occurs, certain breeds adapted to industrial production are in conflict with the traditional and indigenous breeds.
The former have developed an immune system that can deal with certain diseases, but now have to contend with genetic defects capable of affecting the immune system of the indigenous breeds.
As a result, this is where the pandemics then strike, and the indigenous breeds are culled â that is, destroyed â so that these countriesâ genetic resources, vital above all for their subsistence farming and food sources, suffer as well.
The question must be asked â and this would be quite a research topic â why these industries go to these countries in the first place.
Do they do it in order to sort out the problem with hunger that exists there, or do they do it because of better production conditions and opportunities to make a better return on the capital they invest?
Look into the situation and you will discover that neither these industries nor their capital generally belong to these countries; instead, the capital originates here, here in the industrial nations, which want to do business there, and then we in this House lament â as does Mr Garot in his report â that our agriculture is producing less.
It is no longer competitive, because these countries work to different social, environmental and hygienic standards.
Comparative studies of that would be extraordinarily important.
I have mentioned subsistence farming, which is an important source of food not only in these countries, but also in the EUâs new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe.
This is something else into which research should be done.
In this report, we have attached the utmost importance to the question of the role played by women in the work done.
Most women working in industrialised farming work in less-valued jobs, whereas, in other fields of agricultural activity, they tend to play leading roles on which the maintenance of these landscapes depends.
The point we are generally trying to make is that we expect more attention to be given to agriculture when preparing the next â that is, the Seventh â Research Framework Programme, and that the expected results of agricultural reforms in the European Union and of changes elsewhere in the world should be accompanied by research that will provide us with insights as to what the direction of our policies should be in the coming years and decades.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for this report and also thanking the Members of your House for the initiative they have taken.
The Commission welcomes this report, which we see as a good basis on which to prepare the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development, and as something of which it can make use.
As you are aware, the decoupled payments under the new common agricultural policy will enable farmers not only to become more competitive, but also to respond better to the marketâs requirements.
This is where research can also make an essential contribution to improvement, by helping to develop more efficient production processes, by means of diversification and by introducing new and competitive crops.
It can also help enable farmers to fulfil the demands of what we term cross-compliance, and, above all, to provide a sound scientific basis for our understanding of good agricultural and environmental practice, that is, of what is meant by a healthy condition.
What the regions want and need is set out in the rural development programmes, in which local stakeholders, civil society and the scientific community must also be involved.
That was one of the conclusions reached at last yearâs conference in Salzburg.
Let me now briefly address some of the statements and recommendations made in the report.
Although it is quite clear that the sustainability of agriculture must be one of the priorities of research policy, the content of the Sixth Framework Programme has already largely been laid down, and only minor changes can be made to the annual work programmes, so we have to devote a great deal of attention to preparations for the Seventh Framework Programme.
The Commission gives priority to research into alternative production methods and sources of income in rural areas, as well as to the endeavour to get away from the piecemeal approach in favour of research into the whole chain â in a sense, from the farm to the table.
Issues of the safety and quality of food continue to play a very special part in this.
It is also important that the public be involved in debates about research, and that the results should be evaluated.
These considerations prompted the organisation of the conference âScience at the service of societyâ on14 and 15 October 2002, and a second conference on this subject will be held in February 2005.
Research into improved marker vaccines must be extended to include other diseases on list A, although budget limits must of course be adhered to.
The same applies to research into medicines for minor species and into plant protection products for plants that are not widely cultivated.
In both these areas there is the ever-worsening problem of dwindling interest on the part of private-sector researchers, it being apparent that profits will not be as high as they would be if large quantities of medicines or plant protection products were involved.
This, I believe, is where the public sector has a contribution to make.
I also share the view that social and environmental research into sustainable development in rural areas has to be stepped up, and that there is a particular need for research that is capable of supporting women in their roles in rural development â something that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned earlier.
Although the subsidiarity principle must not be lost sight of, I do share the view that âon-farmâ research needs to be encouraged, with the accent on suitable farming methods and diversification.
Prioritised under the heading of âScientific Support to Policiesâ, research is already being done into the utilisation of agricultural raw materials.
As its predecessors did, the current Framework Programme funds projects in the field of environmentally-friendly cultivation and related to low-cost farming methods, although it must be remembered in this context that, particularly when we are in the middle of a WTO negotiating round, there is also a need to produce research material relevant to international issues and, in particular, also to issues relating to developing countries.
I would not wish to conclude this speech without mentioning the fact that we must not simply ignore research into biotechnology, for it is another area in which we can expect results of potential use to us in the agricultural sphere, provided that sufficiently intensive research is carried out.
Overall, the Commission acknowledges the importance of Parliamentâs report and also the need for a communication on the future direction, structure and promotion of agricultural research in Europe, which it will also produce.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very warmly for producing this own-initiative report.
The Commissionerâs remarks confirm how important this initiative is.
The sixth framework programme for research currently has a budget of around EUR 16Â billion, of which a maximum of 2% may be allocated to agriculture and rural development.
This very welcome own-initiative report calls for an increase in the funding allocated to agricultural research from the EUâs research budget.
We have made a clear decision in favour of the European model of agriculture, which means that we are committed to maintaining multifunctional and sustainable farming in all regions of Europe.
Further development and research are inextricably linked.
To conserve resources in response to socio-economic and environmental conditions, further research in the areas of organic farming, extensive agricultural management and, above all, non-food production is essential.
Developing knowledge in the use of renewables for energy and materials must be pursued as a survival strategy.
As the report points out, priority should be given to improvements in yield security, quality of life and environmental compatibility.
On-farm research is an indispensable tool in the integration of nature conservation and agriculture, and above all in the sustainable maintenance and use of organic habitats in the agricultural landscape.
This report is intended to draw attention to the fact that agriculture research is also important for society and should be given greater priority.
Again, I welcome this report on behalf of my group.
At the vote in committee, greater priority was given to biotechnological research than was originally the case in the report, as we took the view at the outset that biotechnological research already has good programmes.
A well-functioning rural environment is inseparably linked with a well-functioning system of agriculture.
As a representative of farmers and rural regions, I welcome this report, and it is our genuine hope that these demands will finally be heard in the seventh framework programme for research.
Â Â  Mr President, the common agricultural policy is beginning the greatest transformation of its entire history; it would therefore be a serious mistake to keep research within parameters which have become obsolete.
We must therefore change the approach we have taken so far to agricultural research.
This is precisely the challenge faced by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in this European Parliament initiative report.
He deals with it very sensibly in a report which I believe to be excellent.
He essentially proposes that the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programme for Research should change in accordance with this new situation.
The Commissioner has told us that the Sixth programme is being applied â and the report says this â but nevertheless I believe that we do have time for the Commissioner to introduce certain modifications relating to the role of women in rural development, as it appears he is going to do.
It is also very important that the drawing up of this Seventh Framework Programme for Research should reflect this approach, which considers research into sustainable agriculture and rural development.

Paragraph 2 is fundamental, proposing that at least half of the budget for food technology and agricultural research be dedicated to sustainable and practical research into the various farming systems, and I would therefore be grateful if the Commission could also provide for this allocation of at least half of the budget for this purpose.
The report supports research intended to improve the quality and safety of foods from farm to table and stresses the importance of small-scale farming and of small- and medium-sized retailers.
In this way a totally innovative potential is established, because we must remember that, until now, this small-scale agriculture had been completely forgotten.
Small- and medium-sized retailers had also been forgotten in the intensive agriculture of the past and the immediate future.
All of this had been relegated within research and is quite rightly what the rapporteur now advocates as a profound change, an approach which reconsiders agricultural research from top to bottom, as is necessary, in other words, reorienting research towards the service of agriculture in harmony with nature.
For all of these reasons, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and ask the Commissioner to change this approach as soon as possible and allocate the funds requested today by the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, this own-initiative report on agriculture and agricultural research has my full support.
I too take the view that the right approach has been adopted by addressing future-oriented issues on the basis of an analysis which preceded this own-initiative report.
I hope, of course, as previous speakers have already said, that the Commission will draw the right conclusions, for the CAP reform in particular has brought about a paradigm shift in European agriculture and I hope that scientific monitoring will be effective here in future too.
I think it is right, and would like to reiterate here, that the budget for the next framework programme has been set on the basis of proposed projects.
I am unsure how the 2% is arrived at, but I think it probably conceals projects as well.
In the settlement of the current programme, it will be very interesting to see exactly what has happened.
Agricultural research is generally multiannual, and I have been told about projects undertaken within this multiannual research framework that have never entered their final phase due to budget cutbacks.
The Member States are also very keen on cutting research funding.
Yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources.
In the previous debate, complex issues relating to more intensive research into income and income generation options were discussed in more detail.
It will be very interesting to see how this will look in future, who will be dealing with it, and in which areas, under which conditions and with which assumptions.
I too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular.
Everything else, however, has been set out so comprehensively in the report that it requires no further comment from me.
Â Â  Mr President, recent CAP reform will result in some fundamental changes, particularly at farm level.
The decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with, I hope, new opportunities.
If we believe, as I do, that the European agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable, equally it must be commercially viable and competitive.
On the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 2013, we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective.
It would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely.
What would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality?
The only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research.
Two per cent of the current EU research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective.
In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Hyland.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0024/2004) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the Northern hake stock (COM(2003) 374 â C5-0314/2003 â 2003/0137(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Souchet for producing this comprehensive report on the recovery of the Northern hake stock.
The Council discussed the recovery plan for hake in December 2003 and accepts some of the proposed amendments set out in the report: firstly, we have now deleted fishing effort from the proposal.
Secondly, we have reduced the minimum safe level according to the precautionary approach from 143Â 000 tonnes to 140Â 000, and the critical limit from 103Â 000 tonnes to 100Â 000, as recommended by the scientists.
Despite these amendments, the objective remains the same.
The aim is to restore Northern hake stocks to safe biological limits, which entails a number of measures.
Firstly, we must set a critical limit below which, according to scientific advice, stocks would be at risk of collapse.
We must also set guidelines on the establishment of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) based on a scientific evaluation.
The TAC will be set according to the precautionary approach unless it results in a reduction in the biomass in any given year.
If the size of the stock falls below the minimum level, the Council must reduce the TAC.
However, the TAC may not vary by more than 15% year on year.
Finally, the proposal also contains measures for more effective control of vessels catching North Sea hake, as well as provisions for the prior notification of landings.
Landings of more than two tonnes of hake may only take place at authorised ports and stricter provisions on storage and transport also apply.
So much for the proposal; I will comment on the proposed amendments in my closing statement.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner â whose presence we are grateful for â ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Souchet, on the wonderful report he has presented to us, on an issue which was not at all easy â Northern hake.
Firstly, the Commission presented us with a proposal which, initially, was combined with cod â and which our Parliament rejected, as has been said already.
Secondly, it made a separate, but very rigid and severe, proposal, which compared Northern hake with cod, with a genuine recovery plan and with fishing effort.
Our Parliament had been consulted at the same time as the Council, and the negotiations were carried out in parallel, which obliged our rapporteur to be flexible in terms of adopting our draft report.
Mr Souchet has made a serious study of issues relating to hake â as he has said, our Committee on Fisheries spoke to the sector â and has presented a report which fundamentally changes the Commission's original conceptions, for which he has our full support and thanks.
I would also like to thank Mr Souchet for having accepted the numerous amendments which we had presented on behalf of the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â I am truly grateful to him for this â since we have ensured that it is not a recovery plan, but rather a genuine management plan.
I would like to draw the Commission's attention to this issue: it is a genuine management plan without fisheries effort, in accordance with the sector's request.
The Souchet report is coherent, solid, reasonable and combines the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing of Northern hake with the social and economic aspects of the fisheries sector.
The combination of these two aspects is something fundamental which we hope will be taken into account in the future.
We believe that the future regional advisory councils will have to help us not to take false steps and to present proposals for the management of fisheries resources which have the consensus of both scientists and the sector itself.
We have also appointed Mr Souchet rapporteur for the future management plan for Southern hake.
Although it will possibly be the next Parliament established following the June elections which has to deal with this issue, the Committee on Fisheries will have to hold the necessary meetings so that, having heard the advisory councils which are created in this regard, both scientists and the sector can take part in the debates on Southern hake, and this must take place in parallel with the socio-economic measures we have requested and adopted already in the modification of the FIFG.
And more importantly: in the future, the FIFG will have to provide for socio-economic measures so that, when any recovery or management plan is adopted, it is automatically accompanied by the corresponding socio-economic measures.
We congratulate Mr Souchet once again and we hope that by means of this report, which we will vote on tomorrow, we will have taken a very important step in terms of supporting sustainable fisheries and the fisheries sector.
Â Â  Mr President, on 27Â June 2003 the Commission published a new proposal aimed at guaranteeing the sustainable recovery of the Northern hake stock and its reduction within what is considered the safe biological limit, a precautionary level of biomass which is set at 165 000 tonnes.
The first innovation, which we should be grateful for, is that the Commission has finally decided to separate stocks of hake and cod into two different plans.
There was no other choice following the clear improvement in hake stocks, a direct result of the management measures applied by the sector over the last two years.
When we move on to the analysis of the measures proposed, we discover that the Commission is not taking account of the best scientific information available, nor is it dispelling the doubts of the fisheries industry, since once again there has been no dialogue with the scientists and the proposal has been drawn up without the serious participation of professionals.
The Commission is working on the basis of scientific opinions the content of which it does not specify and which, as the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, quite rightly says in his explanatory statement, has not been revealed to the Committee on Fisheries either, despite our having requested it.
The precautionary biomass should have been established on the basis of these scientific reports which do not exist.
Neither does it appear that this biomass is in proportion to the state of the stock affected, since the latest independent scientific reports and observations of professionals demonstrate that it is not below the safe biological limits.
Neither do we have scientific evaluations from the ICES which guarantee to us that the reduction of fishing effort proposed will lead to an effective reduction in catches, nor an evaluation of the effects of the technical recovery measures â which I referred to earlier â which have been applied for two years and have had such good results.
Neither does the Commissionâs proposal seek a balance between biological recovery and socio-economic repercussions.
Once again, I must point out that the approach is based on exclusively biological considerations and does not take account of the socio-economic context when recommending the re-establishment of stocks within one year, rather than adopting a progressive approach, based on multi-annual TACs, and this is incompatible with the capacity for survival of the companies in this sector.
The technical measures, which, as we have said, have produced good results, are completely overlooked.
What Mr Souchet proposes in his report, namely the replacement of this recovery plan with a multi-annual management plan, is the result not just of the â I believe correct â analysis of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries and of our own debate, but also of the guidelines already defined by the European Parliament itself and Mr Souchet in relation to the management of fragile stocks: the application of simple and flexible rules, such as multi-annual TACs, rather than rigid systems with uncertain effects, such as measures based on the fishing effort.
Â Â  Mr President, the Northern hake stock is outside safe biological limits.
This is basically ICES' way of saying that it is in deep trouble.
That is why the Commission has been trying for some years to convince the Council of the need for a recovery plan.
The recovery plan proposed had a number of positive elements, including a formula for setting TACs and a reduction in fishing effort.
Nonetheless, in its 2003 assessment ICES noted that the reductions indicated in the proposed plan are very far from achieving cuts in fishing mortality that could rebuild the stock in the short term: in other words, ICES is basically saying that even the Commission's proposal was not enough to ensure rapid stock recovery.
What have the Council and the Committee on Fisheries done?
They have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal, primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort: the very thing that is most needed.
Council even went one step further by increasing the TACs for hake by almost a third where the Commission had recommended a reduction.
In December 2002 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was a great success and, amongst other things, it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied.
But at the Council meeting in December, the Council set 199 TACs in total.
As an indication of the seriousness of the situation the Commission recommended cuts of greater than 10% for a quarter of them â that was 49 stocks.
But the Council rejected much of that advice.
For 42 stocks it set TACs that were more than 10% higher than the Commission's proposal.
In some cases it set TACs at double, or even treble, the recommendations.
For ten stocks they adopted an increase where the Commission had recommended a decrease.
If this is the way Council and the Fisheries Committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing.
Something has to be done.
The Commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical.
The Council needs to take a realistic approach to the situation facing the fisheries industry and listen to the scientists' advice.
It must listen to ICES' advice to ensure the survival of the fishing industry in Europe, otherwise we are basically voting for its demise.
It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee could actually reduce what was already an inadequate proposal by the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, better a whole lie than a half-truth â that is how I would like to paraphrase a well-known proverb, the truth of which I am experiencing first-hand these days.
It is namely the case that one of my fellow MEPs suggested to the press that the Dutch members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and also of my own group, never reimburse any of their travelling expenses.
Radio, television and newspapers accepted this piece of information without checking it out properly.
Since that time, my fellow MEPs and I have been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails asking me why I keep money back.
This is bizarre; the reason why I do not return any money is that I do not declare any trips that I have not taken.
I am aware that many fishermen are in a similar situation.
They do not have to fight a lie but a half-truth.
The situation of Northern hake may not be full of hope, but it is not so bad that a recovery plan is needed.
Relying on ill-defined data, the Commission is proposing a drastic reduction in the quantity of fish to be caught.
Recent information from biologists suggests that the situation surrounding hake is not so bad as to call for drastic action, and so I wholeheartedly support Mrs Souchetâs report and call on the Commission to adjust its plans.
A control plan for Northern hake with adequate monitoring and enforcement is sufficient in order to offer this fish species a future.
Insufficient scientific research is already putting fishermen at too much of a disadvantage.
It is time for sound scientific research to benefit both fish and fishermen.
Â Â  Mr President, for a minute I wondered whether Mr van Dam had come to the wrong debate, but I am glad that he turned his attention to Northern hake.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
Mr Souchet is one of the most hard-working members of the Committee on Fisheries and his expertise in this area has earned him the accolade of being appointed rapporteur on the recovery of southern hake, a report which is currently in the pipeline.
During our deliberations in committee, it was repeatedly stated that the advice we received from ICES â the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas â in respect of stocks of Northern hake was at odds with the advice of fishermen.
Indeed, the fishermen claimed that hake stocks were not in a state of terminal decline, as stated by the scientists.
Once again, this divergence of opinion has demonstrated the need for fishermen and scientists to work together in the preparation of management strategies.
It is also clear that the Commission must be prepared to listen to the advice of fishermen as well as to the dire warnings of scientists.
In this respect, I am delighted that plans for the creation of Regional Advisory Councils, which Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna mentioned, will bring together fishermen and scientists.
These plans are well under way and constitute an essential part of the CFP reform package.
Had an RAC been in place in this instance, I do not think we would have had the original recommendations for drastic cuts in hake TACs combined with severe effort limitation targets which the Commission proposed and which have shocked the members of the Committee on Fisheries.
Cuts as proposed would have devastated the sector and caused widespread socio-economic hardship.
I am glad that the Commission has revised these proposals in the wake of strong representations from the sector.
We all support sustainable fishing.
We all have an interest in seeing the long-term recovery of Northern hake.
However, we also have a duty to sustain the livelihood of fishermen and to protect fishing communities.
A balance therefore has to be struck which links best practice to achievable socio-economic goals.
So, despite what Mrs McKenna said, I believe that Mr Souchet has sought to achieve that balance and I commend his report to the House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, even though I am not a member of the Committee on Fisheries, I have now and again ventured to intervene in this debate concerning fisheries.
I am doing so today too.
I am doing so because I am in such despair about the fact that we shall not be able to bring about a strict recovery plan, not only for hake but also for other species such as cod and other threatened white fish.
This plan for the Northern hake stock was adopted in December, and the objective was clear: to protect the stocks and obtain an acceptable level of security.
The truth is that the Council and the Commission together have weakened the original proposal so that it no longer complies with that objective.
I think that the proposal that has now been negotiated by the Committee on Fisheries is very poor.
I absolutely cannot vote in favour of it because it would further weaken an already weakened proposal.
An absolute minimum would be to stick to the Commissionâs original proposal, because stricter controls are needed.
Economics and social problems, which are always referred to, are also important issues but, if we do not apply the precautionary principle when it comes to the biomass and fish stocks, we quite simply do not make it possible for fisheries to continue.
That is something we should appreciate.
We have now rejected four or five recovery plans from the Commission.
It quite simply has to be realised that neither in this House nor in the Council is there any political will to adopt measures that genuinely take account of the precautionary principle and guarantee that we have fisheries in the future too.
I am very concerned about what this will lead to.
I should like more people to fall in with my policy when we vote on this matter, for I am now beginning to become extremely impatient and anxious.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his attitude towards the amendments I have proposed.
The European Commission's initial proposal of introducing a recovery plan for Northern hake was not â or at least did not seem to be â anything more than an unjustified transposition of the measures applied to the recovery of cod to this species.
Clearly, the executive Committee did not take account of the latest opinions of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), according to which the hake stock will reach a level of total safety if over the next five to eight years the level of mortality from fishing is maintained.
It will therefore reach a safe biological level, to use the term recently used by the Commissioner.
According to this information, it is not necessary to implement a drastic recovery plan for Northern hake.
Rather than a recovery plan, it would be more appropriate to implement a management plan in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, in a manner which is compatible and also consistent with the biological and environmental component, on the one hand, and socio-economic factors on the other, within the context of the new common fisheries policy.
That is the will expressed by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion: to replace the recovery plan proposed by the Commission, which imposes severe restrictions on the fishing effort and extremely serious social consequences, with a management plan which allows for the establishment of a total allowable catch that is compatible with the maintenance of the reproductive biomass.
The European Commission recently presented another proposal for the recovery of Southern hake stocks and langoustine stocks, and it has not calculated the socio-economic consequences for the sector of the measures proposed in that case either.
A scientific study is therefore needed, as well as the opinion of the new regional advisory councils provided for in the reform of the common fisheries policy.
Furthermore, we should also stress â and I will end here, Mr President â that the Council of Ministers for fisheries last December committed itself to consulting the professionals of the sector before drawing up an action plan for these species.
The involvement and participation of the sector in decision-making should not be forgotten given that these decisions affect the viability of fishing, jobs, living conditions and the very survival of families which live in European regions highly dependent on fisheries policy.
And I believe that we must insist on this involvement and this participation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the first plan to recover cod stocks, the Commission decided to propose a new initiative, this time on Northern hake.
There is a further initiative in the pipeline covering Southern hake.
While the sustainable management of fish stocks clearly justifies the conservation of species deemed under threat, measures aimed at limiting fishing must be properly based on accurate and up-to-date scientific opinions, and must take on board the first-hand observations of fishermen.
The deficiencies in scientific research are well known.
Parliament has had the opportunity this week to express its opinion on the matter by means of the Lage report.
In this context, the Souchet report is excellent, drawing attention to the need to keep data up-to-date, based on information provided by international bodies in the fisheries sector.
These limitations have had a devastating socio-economic impact on sea professionals, restricting already limited fishing activity still further.
The figures presented by the Commission for limiting the hake catch are such that if they were implemented they would be socially devastating, economically untenable and commercially unmanageable.
It appears obvious to state that socio-economic impact should be assessed prior to presenting any recovery plan.
This, however, did not occur in this case.
Such measures are therefore only acceptable if strictly commensurate with the aims of sustainable exploitation of stocks and if their economic impact is taken into account.
Great variations in total allowable catches (TACs) may in some cases lead to companies converting fishing activity from one species to another, thereby indirectly causing imbalances.
On various occasions, Parliament has drawn the Commissionâs attention to the excessive inflexibility of the recovery plans.
Consequently, a multiannual, flexible and gradual approach would certainly be more suitable, in that it would lead to fishing effort perfectly suited to the state of stocks, which will not be achieved by implementing inflexible plans, with irreversible and socially devastating consequences.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the arguments and problems outlined by the individual Members at this stage and would now like to comment on the amendments on that basis.
First, I should say that I reject all the proposed amendments which aim to rename this entire project a âmanagement planâ rather than a recovery plan, because it is still a recovery plan.
I think it would be wrong for us to gloss over the situation, although I gladly admit that the situation for Northern hake is less critical than for Northern cod.
On Amendment No 2: I must reject this amendment as this recital is already contained in the framework regulation on the common fisheries policy.
It is not that I reject it on principle; it is quite simply redundant.
As regards Amendment No 5 and the consultations with the Regional Advisory Councils, or RACs, as they are also called, I am pleased to reassure you that as soon as they have been set up, we will naturally be consulting the RACs regularly on this issue.
However, we do not need a recital for this purpose, as that is the whole point of the RACs â to be consulted on such matters.
I reject Amendment No 6 because the hake stock is below the precautionary level and is therefore not yet within safe biological limits.
The purpose of Amendment No 7 is to show that we need criteria to determine when recovery has been achieved.
It would be quite inappropriate to determine politically when recovery has been achieved.
That is a scientific issue.
I reject Amendments Nos 12 and 27 because the additional control measures are absolutely essential.
It is the fishermen themselves who frequently complain that control is uneven.
We really do need these measures.
I can accept Amendment No 15 in part and I approve of amending the precautionary value for the biomass.
I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 16.
We should not be setting priorities for scientific evaluations here.
It would be a little too simplistic to say that the practical observations made by fishermen should be given higher priority than systematic monitoring by scientific institutions.
Of course the fishermen should contribute their data.
Some of the uncertainties surrounding the scientific evaluations are due precisely to the fact that there is a lack of such data, as fishermen only tend to pass on data which they think will influence the evaluations in line with their own interests.
I can accept Amendments Nos 19 and 20 in part.
The TACs are based on a fishing mortality rate of 0.25, and we incorporated this value into the proposal at the Council meeting in December.
However, I cannot accept Amendment No 21.
After the Council meeting in December, the proposal was amended so the Council has more scope when setting the TACs.
The minimum level no longer needs to be reached within one year; instead, the TACs can be set so that this is achieved over a longer period.
Consequently, I must reject Amendment No 25 as well, as the Council must have the opportunity to reduce the TACs in exceptional cases if this is necessary on biological grounds.
Unfortunately, I must also reject Amendments Nos 22 and 23, for logically, they would mean that the TACs could be amended by more than 15% year on year, and that is not acceptable.
We must have the same degree of fluctuation in both directions; otherwise, the rules will be uneven.
I can accept Amendments Nos 8, 11, 18, 24 and 26 in full.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next item on the agenda was to be the Commission statement on salmon, but at 4.30Â p.m. we have the Commission statement on the financial perspective, which will be chaired by the President of Parliament and which is to be attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and it cannot be changed.

Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, so as not to spoil the statement on salmon, which would have to be stopped after five minutes, we are going to suspend the sitting until 4.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the broad political framework for the next financial perspective: Making Europe prosper â policy agenda and budgetary means for an enlarged Union 2007-2013.
I should like to place on the record my appreciation â and that of the House â that the Commission, in response to Parliament's request, adopted this communication this afternoon and has come directly to the House to report.
President Prodi and Members of the Commission, we thank you for that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, Western Europe was in the process of creating the great single market, an objective that we set for 1992.
History decided that the huge expectations linked to integration would in turn be linked to the unexpected hope of unifying the whole of Europe in peace and democracy.
Since that extraordinary moment, we have taken huge steps forward, and large parts of the democracies born out of the collapse of the Soviet bloc will soon be part of the Union.
Our economy, despite the problems and uncertainties, is enjoying an unprecedented level of prosperity; in Europe we have a quality of life that is the envy of the world; and, above all, differences in wealth and opportunity between the Member States have been reduced over the years: this is a success that no other political organisation can boast of.
We cannot, however, say that we are satisfied.
We cannot because, for some time, doubt has been taking root in the hearts and minds of Europeans.
This is a reaction to the process of globalisation of the planet with the far-reaching and ever-faster changes that it entails.
Today, Europe wonders if it will be in a position to keep hold of the levers of change in order to continue to control globalisation, or if it will confine itself to accepting the situation and protecting itself against the dangers.
We need only to listen to the questions asked by the citizens, questions that are very simple.
They are asking the following: are the cultural reference points with which we identify going to be eradicated?
Why is it that sometimesÂ âÂ in fact, oftenÂ âÂ becoming old implies the risk of getting poorer?
Why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness?
Questions like this give rise to two opposing attitudes: one part of our society withdraws into itself, searching for an illusory security behind antiquated, and sometimes tribal, slogans, which foment xenophobia and intolerance; but the overwhelming majority of Europeans, however, look to us for positive answers and always ask us what Europe is doing.
This is a healthy and mature position because it assumes a simple fact: no European country can act alone in the globalised world and no one can, alone, meet the challenges of the rise of the large countries of Asia, the technological challenge of North America or the migratory flows from the South.
The strength to meet these challengesÂ âÂ our strengthÂ âÂ lies solely in our Union.
Time has proved Monnet, De Gasperi, Adenauer and Schuman right; we must combine what we have in common; we must fight for the common interest because that is the only way in which we can protect the individualâs interests.
Ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was the culmination of our collective recognition of this situation; in Gothenburg, the project was completed, fully incorporating sustainability as a key component, and this strategy generated energy and enthusiasm; it made the Spring European Council the high point in terms of control, drive and determination.
Nevertheless, despite everyoneâs efforts, this process is faltering.
Operational decisions are becoming increasingly rare and, often, we are limited to calls for voluntary action.
Why is this the case?
Because, in order to have a real impact, the strategy needs a project that is coherent and verifiable; it needs to organise the necessary instruments, those of the Member States and of the Union, which includes the Union budget.
We must, in fact, use our resources to increase the prosperity of Europe in line with its values; we need to transform the Union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy; we need to ensure jobs for our citizens and make economic growth socially and environmentally sustainable.
Before going into the detail of some of todayâs decisions, I want to explain the spirit that drives us and the procedures we followed.
Budgetary planning is about linking resources to needs.
Since resources are limited, financial decisions must follow priorities and political choices; that is, follow and not precede: this is a fundamental concept.
I have stated on many occasions that it is unacceptable to plan the future of our finances on the basis of a simple percentage point.
Some have saidÂ âÂ in all seriousness tooÂ âÂ that the Union budget must not be more than 1% of European GDP.
The problem with this position is that it puts figures before the political project: it is like starting to build a house from the roof.
I understand that countries introducing difficult reforms also want the Union to apply restrictive policies; nevertheless, this approach is incoherent because national expenditureÂ âÂ at the level of each individual stateÂ âÂ and Union expenditureÂ âÂ incurred jointlyÂ âÂ are not interchangeable as they are different in qualitative terms.
The Union budget is not unnecessary expenditure that must be reduced to a minimum; Community expenditure funds common policies, that is to say those activities that the Member States have decided to manage together; these are more effective than national initiatives and, in many cases, are unavoidable because they address problems that are by their very nature supranational.
There are many instances, in the life of the EU, where EURÂ 25 spent together is worth more than one euro spent in each of 25 countries.
This is an absolutely essential concept that we should fix in our minds.
Making savings in the Unionâs budget does not increase national public resources, but only undermines the foundations of the house we all live in.
We must, however, channel the available resources towards the priorities in such a way as to maximise the benefits.
For all of these reasons, the Commission discussed the new Financial Perspective by first examining what needs to be doneÂ âÂ that is to say, starting with the project for the Europe that we want to seeÂ âÂ and then, only afterwards by tackling figures and percentages.
The results do not, however, depend solely on the amount available.
For example, we have established that the current budgetary structure and certain management rules are too rigid and that this rigidity has often put a brake on the Unionâs work to the detriment of the common interest.
This is not just an issue of the quantity of resources, but also of the way in which they can be managed.
We are, therefore, also proposing a budgetary structure that can respond more flexibly to new and unforeseen circumstances.
I would like to make one final, fundamental observation before moving on to the specific aspects of the proposal.
Every organisationâs financial plan is, as we have said, an expression of its underlying principles.
Of the Unionâs principles, the one that I would like to stress is that of solidarity between the citizens and the Member States, solidarity that sees resources transferred from the richer countries to the poorer countries and regions.
Our plan is in line with this underlying political decision and develops it in a new way, by placing cohesion policy more clearly at the service of competitiveness and employment than was previously the case.
There are essentially three reasons behind this decision: it is a choice in favour of coherence, justice and opportunity.
I say coherence because the key objective of our political policies in future years will be to encourage sustainable development.
Unbalanced development will spawn rejection and fear of Europe in the most disadvantaged and outermost regions, rather than trust and involvement.
Furthermore, it is a question of justice because no one can be asked to participate in a joint project without being given the opportunity of keeping in step with growth.
Finally, it is a question of opportunity, because experience teaches us that balanced and sustainable development, especially in the poorest regions, is itself a source of further prosperity for the richest regions.
This is the thought underlying the financial plan that I put before you today.
I will now move on to briefly explain the key points.
As I have said, there are three major priorities: to encourage sustainable development, to put into practice the idea of European citizenship and to strengthen the role of the Union as a key player on the world stage.
So: sustainable development, European citizenship and the role of the Union in the world.
I would like to stress one aspect of the first point.
Since the internal market is for the most part already in place, we need to incorporate related policies in the broader context of a growth strategy.
This is a very important proposal, which changes the hierarchy in the Union budget: we are now in a position to promote the competitiveness of European businesses by exploiting the fact that they are already operating in a market with no internal borders.
I must repeat that there is only one way to increase competitiveness: through quality, technological development, research and innovation; in a broader sense, the absolute priority is investment in human resources.
This is the unifying point, the major change in this financial proposal.
It is absolutely essential that we devise a common strategy at European level to link up our research centres and to produce the best scientists and the best academics in the world.
Europe and the world of education needs to be opened up to life-long learning.
We have the tradition, we have the ability, we have the infrastructure; it is now up to Europe to invest all the necessary economic and political resources.
Turning now to the second point, I have often said that, even now, our citizens may sometimes feel that they have split loyalties: to their city, to their nation, to Europe.
One of our objectives will be to put the principle of European citizenship into practice.
The Union must work together with the national governments to guarantee the same level of human rights, security, protection and quality of life across its territory.
This involves the fight against crime and terrorism; it involves the joint management of external borders and of migratory flows that takes into account the human dignity of the immigrants and considers them to be a valuable resource for our economy and our society. It involves, finally, developing services of general interest that are the backbone of our social model, such as health, food safety, education, energy and transport.
Above all, now the Unionâs final borders are being outlined, the time has come to picture a real European identity.
This will be the new frontier in the decades to come.
There will probably not be any geographical advances, but there will certainly be progress on the spiritual front.
We must, therefore, also work to encourage creativity and exchanges in the fields of culture, the arts, literature and methods of mass communication.
Finally, as regards the role of the European Union in the world, enlargement and the prospect of the complete unification of our continent, Europe will really be able to become a force for stability and a reference point across the world.
The time has, however, come to shoulder the responsibilities that this entails in a mature way.
Firstly, we must assume a clear responsibility at regional level by implementing the Commission strategy to develop a circle of friendly countries.
Over the next few years, we must develop this neighbourhood policy to share projects and policies with our neighbours and to guarantee peace and stability by spreading greater prosperity and our founding principles.
Our responsibility does, however, go beyond our role at regional level.
Europe must maintain and increase its contribution to growth, because the gap in opportunities and living conditions between the North and South of the world is incompatible with our political, civil and human traditions.
This state of affairs is also not in our interests, and it increases the irregular migratory flows that so alarm our citizens.
The Union must, therefore, continue to encourage dialogue, peaceful solutions and multilateral approaches.
We must find a single voice on the world stage, with the ultimate objective of having a joint representation in assemblies such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
All over the world there are people that see in us a hope for peace and a wise and balanced force.
We cannot disappoint these expectations; we must overcome our differences and, together, propose the model that we have fine-tuned in the course of 50 years of the Unionâs existence.
These, ladies and gentlemen, are just some of the many objectives contained in our Communication.
To achieve them all, as we are constantly being called on to do, we need a far larger budget than that which we have been given up to now.
Nevertheless, the Commission is realistic, extremely realistic.
We have worked meticulously for a whole yearâÂ involving six groups of Commissioners and all of the College on several occasions in various seminars, and also all the Directorate Generals and every governmentÂ âÂ and the materials for this huge amount of preparatory work will be published on the Internet, if you want, and are able, to use them to make it possible to have a more detailed debate.
We have analysed, assessed, taken decisions and arranged for reforms.
We have decided, not without difficulty, to remain within the current ceiling of the Unionâs own resources, in other words 1.24% of European GDP, plus the ACP (EDF) cooperation funds that have to be entered into the budget.
It is on this basis that we have acted with rigour, determination and clear intent to review expenditure which, by limiting payments to an average of 1.15% of GDP, leaves us sufficient margin to be able to work calmly.
We are convinced that, even if it is certainly not sufficient to achieve the objectives sought by the Member StatesÂ âÂ and put to us unanimously by the Member StatesÂ âÂ it will be possible, with a sum of this size, to achieve specific results.
Indeed, we are concerned not just with numbers but also with the effectiveness of expenditure.
We do not confine ourselves to justifying the need for resources, but we are also setting out a new structure to use them in a better and more rational way.
This means continuing to improve the administrative culture and governance of the European Union.
If, in fact, we maintain, on the one hand, that, in a large number of cases, action at European level is necessary and more effective, the Commission plans, on the other hand, to involve other bodies to rationalise the implementation of our measures on the ground.
In particular, the partnership with the Member States is a relationship involving the ever more active mobilisation of the regions and local authorities.
Finally, we are working on greatly simplifying the instruments that are currently used.
To give you just one example, we propose to reduce the measures currently used in the field of external relations from more than 100 to six, each one dedicated to a specific political and operational area.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that I am presenting to you today is not a technical accounting document; it is a political declaration and I ask you to look at it as such.
It aims to provide the operational framework for managing the major changes to the Union in future years.
The Commissioners, the Commission departments and myself have devoted ourselves to the task with energy and enthusiasm, and I am sure that you will not fail to see this energy and enthusiasm fully reflected in the results of our work.
These pages are, for the Commission, a major expression of renewed trust in Europe and its institutions.
We now hand them over for Parliament and the Council to analyse, and I would be happy if, for you too, they were also a message full of hope and realism for our future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to make three comments.
The first concerns the amounts necessary to meet the aspirations of everyone who wants to see a successful Europe in the future â whether that ceiling should be 1% of GNI, or 1.24%, or somewhere in between â and to remind everyone that today is the start of what will probably be a 12-month process.
Even though Mr Prodi has made a statement, if we go by past practices I do not expect a conclusion on this for at least a year.
In December Mr Colom i Naval, who is the rapporteur on the financial perspectives, presented a working document in the Committee on Budgets on the appraisal of the financial perspectives from their inception in 1988 to 2002.
Over those 15 years, the average budget implementation is, remarkably, 1% of GDP.
The Council could say that is sufficient, but to get an average of 1% over those years means we have to spend above 1% in certain years.
In fact, we spent up to the figure mentioned by Mr Prodi â 1.15% â in 1993.
My point is that this type of flexibility is needed if we are to continue to have a decent average.
If that average has to be 1%, then there will be years when we will have to exceed 1% quite significantly.
I am still not sure whether the Council's figure of 1% includes the EDF.
I do not think it does, but that would therefore make it 1.03% at best.
I want to make a comment to those Member States which criticised the Stability Pact for being too rigid.
They should also see that if there is a case for flexibility in the Stability Pact, then we do not need rigidity in the European Union budget by sticking at 1%, as some Member States propose.
That has been shown in Category 4, where, without the flexibility instrument, we could not have financed the actions in Kosovo, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq or in other areas.
We need that flexibility in the budget.
Speaking in a personal capacity, we could manage within the 1% if those same Member States had not already agreed that agricultural expenditure should be set in concrete up to 2013.
I quote from the Commission's document: 'A ceiling around 1% of GNI would fail to meet the European Councilcommitments on agricultural payments, would undermine the phasing-in of cohesion policy in the ten new Member States and would jeopardise existing levels of other policies.'
It goes on to say: 'Alternatively, cuts would be needed across the board and existing agreements would have to be reopened, including the amounts decided at the Brussels European Council of October 2002.'
I hope the Council takes cognisance of that fact.
My second comment is specifically to the Council.
To get an agreement on the new financial perspectives needs an interinstitutional agreement.
I just want to remind the Council that we are one of those institutions, and it will need Parliament's agreement to get an interinstitutional agreement.
We do not care if we do not get it: we will just go back to Article 272 of the Treaty and will still manage the budget without the Council's say-so.
That is not a threat, it is just a comment to the Council, which it should bear in mind as we go through this procedure.
My last point is that for almost the past 15 years â all the time I have been in this Parliament and on the Committee on Budgets â the rapporteur for the financial perspectives has been Mr Colom i Naval.
This will probably be his last plenary session â I am breaking news here.
He will be offered the job of head of the Court of Auditors in the Catalan Government, and no doubt will be taking it up very shortly.
I want to pay tribute to his unceasing work; he knows more about this subject than anyone else â dare I say, boringly so!
He can quote the interinstitutional agreement chapter and verse, but I have been glad of it on many occasions.
I want to thank him for all his work over those 15 years, and also wish him well for his new post.
I hope I express the whole of Parliament's wish in that sentiment.
Â Â  Mr Wynn, thank you for your contribution and your announcement in respect of the future of our colleague, Mr Colom i Naval.
On behalf of the House I should like to congratulate Mr Colom i Naval on the nomination.
We wish him well, but express regret that as a result of his taking up this appointment we shall lose him before the end of this legislature.
Â Â  Mr President, we welcome the debate this afternoon.
As the Commission President has announced, this is a Commission decision already, and to come first to us in the Parliament is always an agreeable thing so far as budgetary matters are concerned.
First, from my Group's perspective, we will be taking the view that Mr Wynn has just expressed: we would rather be very prudent about whether we need the financial perspectives at all.
We had multiannual agreements which keep discipline, which we did not have before the financial perspectives were introduced.
We do not wish guidelines â which is what financial perspectives are â to become an end in themselves.
We should recall very clearly as we go through this discussion that we have the right under Article 272 of the existing Treaty â not necessarily under the Constitutional Treaty but the existing Treaty â to be able to continue the budget process, and we shall therefore be very careful to see that parliamentary rights are properly safeguarded in the whole process.
Secondly, if there is to be a financial perspective, we welcome the ideas that the President has put forward today about better flexibility, categorisation and looking ahead to how money will be properly spent.
Let us be clear that there will not be any decision in this Parliament about the final nature of this financial perspective.
We also have to take inspiration from Mr Colom i Naval's advice and knowledge of this.
You and I, Joan, had a common view about the last financial perspective and I sense it is very clear that we have a shared view on this one, particularly regarding the length of the financial perspective.
We have made it very clear, in Mr Wynn's resolution and in our own Group documents, that we do not want a financial perspective to go beyond the term of office of the next Commission, because how can one possibly justify in democratic terms that we are deciding for future parliaments and for future Commissions?
We should stick to the term of office of the next Commission, which is five years.
To suggest a date after 2013 is to suggest that an old parliament will be committing a new parliament after 2014; it does not work.
We will have to come to terms with that fact.
The last thought is that now we are going to have enlargement â 25 countries â we know the difficulties will be very great in managing a European Union.
Does this financial perspective address Turkey in any way?
Or will that be an additional expenditure?
Should you decide in December 2004 to start negotiations?
For many in my political group, and maybe across the Parliament, to start full negotiations with a country when you do not even know what your existing financial capacity is â to run a union for 25 countries in this way â would be extraordinarily inept and irresponsible, because we need to know what the basis will be when we are negotiating with a country of that size.
Therefore, in conclusion, please let us avoid, when we come to decisions on this, a Soviet-style approach to planning which is going to take us too far into the future of our commitments.
Secondly, let us make sure that it is properly democratic and let us not take decisions which we will regret later because we have taken on countries for which we do not have the financial capacity.
Â Â  Mr Colom i Naval, in the light of the announcement by Mr Wynn, I do not know whether this will be your last speech in this House, but in any event, you have four minutes!
Â Â  Mr President, I plead for indulgence.
Indeed, this probably is my last speech in this House â at least from this seat, as I am in the Chair tomorrow and Thursday.
Mr President, allow me a few moments to thank the Chairman of the Committee for his kind words and to express my thanks for your kind words and the applause and congratulations I have received from many of my colleagues who came here today knowing that this would probably be my last speech to the Assembly from these benches.
I must say that for someone who started their political career in the anti-fascist underground, at the age of 18, the opportunity to be here in the European Parliament has been an unforgettable experience.
I look on my 18 years in the European Parliament as a privilege and I would like to thank all of my colleagues, the Bureau, and in particular my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and all of the officials and co-workers with whom I have worked during this time.
If you miss me, in any event, my new role does not allow me to be paid, as you know, so I can advise you âfree of chargeâ.
Having said that, allow me to move on to the topic in hand.
For the last time as rapporteur for the financial perspective, I can say that at last we have the promised Commission communication on one of the key issues affecting the European Union in the years ahead.
Until very recently, last Friday in fact, we only knew of it by means of press leaks and rough drafts and had had practically no official notification of it until the tripartite dialogue held in Dublin.
The Commissionâs speeches, and especially that of MrÂ Prodi, have given us a more positive image than the text we had seen to date, with which I disagreed due to some of its apocalyptic tones.
In my opinion, we have to have a more positive vision and I think that that must be our approach to addressing the problems and proposals for action in order to ensure economic growth in the Union in the years ahead.
I am afraid, however, that once again we are beginning to build the house from the roof down or, to be more precise, from the ceiling down.
We are starting , , from a maximum ceiling for the budget within which we are trying to fit the policies, rather than looking at the policies and the funding they require and determining the extent to which the resources needed to finance them are available.
As far as I am concerned, the Commission has to some extent fallen into the trap of âthe gang of sixâ: the Treasury Ministers who call themselves ânet contributorsâ, who have proposed staying within 1% of the ceiling for the financial perspective.
I believe that the most fundamental negotiating tactic required us to go further than that and to be more ambitious, and not to stay within the limits set by the Commission â itself and the budget authorities â in 1992 to meet the needs of a European Community that at that stage had 12 members.
That is the percentage they want us to retain.
I think it shows a lack of ambition.
We want to increase the competitiveness of the economy, fulfil the Lisbon objectives, maintain the cohesion policy, finance enlargement, and solve the statistical problems concerning the flows to the poorest regions of the current 15 Member States.
We want to have a foreign policy, a security policy, perhaps a defence policy too, an R[amp]D policy, and so on, but where will the money come from?
I feel it is important that at last the proposal to include a European tax has been included, but stillâŠ
We must ask ourselves whether or not these figures are hiding reductions in the so-called political priorities and â I stress â agriculture and the Structural Funds.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should all remind the Commission and the Council that because of the Councilâs systematic refusal, the perspectives have not been included in the Treaty until now.
Therefore, until the Constitution enters into force in the terms approved by the Convention, we are under no obligation to sign this agreement or to approve any package for the financial perspective.
I hope that the Irish Presidency takes note of this with a view to moving the Constitution forward as quickly as possible.
I will not go into any further detail regarding the duration, but I would like to raise a couple of technical questions.
What are the consequences of reducing the number of headings to five but increasing the number of subheadings?
What rules govern the transfer of money or appropriations from one subheading to another?
If we have a financial perspective, what form will the flexibility mechanism take exactly?
Moreover, we have a figure of 1.24% but it is vital to clarify the concepts of payment appropriations, commitment appropriations, and the vague reference to gross domestic product, gross national product and to gross national income.
These are questions that, I should mention in passing, could mean a difference of EURÂ 7Â 000Â million.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the progress of European integration in a united and enlarged Europe requires generosity and a broad-minded approach, and it seems that our ambitions far outnumber resources.
Â Â  I would ask those who are not leaving this House to become a member of the Court of Auditors in Catalonia to stick to their speaking time!
Â Â  Mr President, President of the Commission, it seems that some of our Member States have been seized by a seven-year itch: it is the irresistible urge to scratch around for the best financial deal for themselves.
But in their rush to advance their own interests, the Member States are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for Europe.
Liberal Democrats and Reformers believe that governments should first, as the admirable Mr Colom i Naval has suggested, take a long, hard look at what they have asked the European Union to do, and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job.
Governments should also ruthlessly tackle waste and fraud, most of which occur at national level, and target spending on our priorities to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers.
Britain, France, Germany and three other states have formed an unholy alliance, united only by their zeal to keep down their budget contributions.
Even putting aside the wider benefits that the European Union buys, the EU needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities.
This year we will integrate ten new Member States.
Europe is charged with important new responsibilities abroad, and with the task of keeping us safe from crime and terrorism at home.
Reviving growth requires progress on the ambitious reform agenda of Lisbon.
Do the six states really expect the EU to do all of this on 1% of Europe's gross national income?
With spending set to reach 1.11% of GNI in 2006, a ceiling of 1% in 2007 means not recalibration but cuts.
None of these Member States can tell us where the axe will fall.
Indeed, I would wager that they cannot even agree among themselves.
My warning to Europe's citizens would be : buyer beware!
These are the same governments who agreed in 2002 to a 1% annual increase in spending on the common agricultural policy.
If Member States demonstrated a real willingness to reform the CAP further, it would be easier to take seriously their calls for parsimony.
As it is, we are running this Union on just over 1% of the gross national income of the Member States, when the budget of the Federal Government in the United States is 20% of GNI.
We must continue to strive for savings where possible, but also equip the Union to meet the objectives we have set ourselves.
My Group believes that the key to better value lies in a modest budget increase, leaving a safe margin for unforeseen expenditure, linked to reform, less waste and more intelligent investment.
Not promises of smarter spending from Member States with no will to deliver it.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have on several occasions, on behalf of my group, denounced the propensity of the European Council to set new priorities for the European Union while refusing to grant it the commensurate financial resources.
All too often this short-sighted policy has caused us to abandon an area that is deemed to be crucial one day in favour of another area that is deemed of vital importance the next.
It is by robbing Peter to pay Paul that we have, on average, survived on a derisory budget.
In 2004 this reached a historic low, below 1% of GDP, which is 20% less than the ceiling on which the Fifteen had themselves agreed for the period 2000-2006.
With enlargement on the horizon, this short-term vision of the Unionâs responsibilities is now creating a potentially explosive situation.
If the six Member States that are net contributors to the European budget actually go ahead with their plan to freeze expenditure at current levels from 2007, many fine promises will go up in smoke!
The major works projects, rather hastily baptised the âgrowth initiativeâ, risk being buried once again.
As for regional and social aid and the appropriations for the Cohesion Fund, they will melt away like snow in the sun for the majority of their current beneficiaries and many of their future recipients.
Farewell cohesion!
Farewell solidarity!
On a social level this is known as cynicism; on a political level we call it irresponsibility.
I might have severe words for the Member States concerned, but this does not mean that I am awarding any plaudits to the Commission.
Your communication, MrÂ President of the Commission, is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs.
Where is your previous ambition, although there is clearly more to responding to the challenge of ensuring the balanced development of an enlarged European Union than just increasing the financial perspective by one or two tenths of a per cent of GDP?
I would remind you that by 2007 the Unionâs population will have increased by a third.
The income of our new Members is less than half that of the Fifteen and, from many points of view, I do not think that the famous acquis communautaire is doing them any favours.
I therefore remain unsatisfied, MrÂ Prodi.
I would add that the Commissionâs position is not without its contradictions.
On the one hand, it legitimately expects a number of Member States to increase their net contribution to the Community budget, but on the other it pushes the cult of limiting public expenditure so far as to take the Council of Ministers to court for not respecting the Stability Pact.
Polite requests or punishment: you have a choice.
Furthermore, many problems remain outstanding.
I will mention just one: the regions that in the future will essentially be deprived of benefiting from the Structural Funds, despite the fact that there has been no significant change in their situation.
Quite simply, the arrival of poorer regions in the Union will automatically â I would say bureaucratically â lower the threshold for becoming eligible for these funds.
It is understandable that the forthcoming negotiations are giving serious cause for concern more or less everywhere.
These are all symptoms of what to me is looking increasingly like a crisis in the European project.
After the split on the war in Iraq, the âstupidâ affair of the Stability Pact and the breakdown of the Brussels Summit on the Constitution, we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are.
It would appear to be absolutely essential to re-found Europe.
Faced with the risk of a dangerous wave of disenchantment amongst the public, as I see it our only hope is to be found in the growing call for a new kind of Europe.
The coming months will be decisive in determining whether a beautiful utopia is waxing or waning.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to extend my warm thanks to President Prodi for this early presentation of the proposal on the financial perspectives.
It gives us, as Parliament, as well as the national governments, plenty of opportunity for listing our priorities for the next few years.
After all, the budget is, logically, the financial translation of the policy that we want â nothing more, nothing less.
In this respect, I should really like to congratulate the Commission.
It is trying, in an honest and courageous manner, to point out the cost of the content of the plans made by the European Heads of Government and also of the Commission itself over the past few years.
In my opinion, the Commission is, in this sense, much more honest than the six net contributors who, last December, said that they would pay not one cent more than they are doing now.
In that sense, I share in the critical attitude of my fellow MEPs.
One per cent and not one cent more, irrespective of enlargement, irrespective of the need for Europe to play a more prominent role in the world, irrespective of plans for European border control and irrespective of the promise to turn Europe into the world's most dynamic knowledge economy: plans of this kind are always announced with much pomp and circumstance, but at the end of the day, Member States refuse to accept the implications.
More tasks for the European Union, certainly a larger European Union, will also require more money.
I would like to urge you to put your money where your plans are.
Current expenditure, too, could also, of course, be held up to the light.
Cutbacks could definitely be made there, and my group would be willing to talk about this.
The problem, though, is that those very six countries that are fixated on this one per cent also refuse to discuss further reforms with regard to the European budget's biggest debit item, namely agricultural policy.
It is a policy that is still massively rewarding farmers and is detrimental to animals and the environment.
The net contributors refuse to talk about this for reasons that are beyond me.
It is time we started talking not only about the amount involved or about what Mr Prodi said about the roof of the house, but also about a really useful way of spending the citizens' tax money.
In this respect, I have numerous doubts regarding the Commission's proposal.
It wants to set aside a great deal of money under the heading of sustainable development, which is fine â it touches my green heart.
However, what exactly is so sustainable about the proposals you have formulated?
The Commission has developed a whole strategy to stimulate research, but why has this not been done for the environment?
Why have all the plans to make agriculture greener by stimulating rural development at the expense of intensive agricultural production been abandoned?
Why is there not more funding for rural development?
The European Union is also very ambitious when it comes to foreign policy.
The ties with the new neighbouring countries must be strengthened and Europe must play an important role globally. My group welcomes this.
This role also requires an idea about how, for example, future international crises should be paid for, which is what is currently lacking.
Mr Wynn also made the point that, if there is no flexibility in the European budget, then there is the risk that the bill will always be at the expense of other policy measures.
Accordingly, the bill will, for example, eventually have to be paid by our new neighbours, while we are, in fact, trying to strengthen those ties.
More flexibility also with regard to foreign policy is really something that is yet to be incorporated into the Commissionâs plans.
I look forward to hearing more about that.
Â Â  I would like to thank MrÂ Prodi for presenting this programme, which can be seen as important, and it is certainly different from what was suggested by the rumours that were going around beforehand.
Of course, we cannot, however, claim that it is a great success to have established the same reference figureÂ âÂ 1.24Â âÂ that we already had before.
I would like, however, to thank the President of the Commission for having reached an agreement, albeit an incomplete one.
That being said, I must, as a young Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, certainly be anxious and express my fears for agriculture, culture, the TEN projects, technology, research, the universities and all the programmes that we launched and announced so enthusiastically.
I believe that, in view of the imminent enlargement to the East, we cannot definitely say â and, above all, the Council cannot say â that this is a major agreement.
We can simply say that it is a watered-down agreement.
I think that MrÂ Colom i Naval, whom I thank for his contribution, Mr Wynn and also the President of the Commission will be able to support a young man like myself when I say that I would like to recall the words of a great personality, Ignazio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits.
He said that he feared the day when no one fought him any longer.
Well, I think that we must all fight with this same spirit to see a Europe that is certainly stronger, but one that develops more and is able to have more resources for our projects.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is a Dutch saying, '' or, to put it another way âgrasp all, lose allâ.
This is aimed at Commissioner Schreyer, who wants EU spending to reach up to the ceiling of 1.24% of the Gross National Product.
This proposal is unrealistic from the outset, given that six net contributors want to restrict the EU budget to 1%.
The past decades have shown that subsidies for regional policy hardly have any impact, except in Ireland.
It is therefore surprising that the Commission should propose to increase this item by 23%.
Has the Commissioner ever heard of subsidy addiction?
We propose an automatic restriction of the net revenue of the Member States that enjoy a level of prosperity above 90% of the European average.
Annually, they should not receive more than 1% net of the Gross Domestic Product.
This would give the necessary breathing space for the much poorer regions in the acceding countries.
It is likely that structural policy in those countries is also more effective.
The fifty-fifty distribution between old and new Member States, as now proposed by Commissioner Barnier, is a stab in the dark.
Given the narrow margins in national budgets, little political realism is shown by the decision to spend money on tarting up a European institution that will, at best, be a replica of NATO.
One proposal meets with our approval.
It concerns the introduction of a general correction mechanism for Member States that contribute excessive amounts to the funding of the European Union.
For the rest, we would ask the Commissioner for multi-annual budgets that, instead of stating more of the same, offer real priorities and realistic, viable options.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I approve of the Commission proposalÂ âÂ even if it is not very substantial, and I support those who highlighted the factÂ âÂ not to go lower than what was agreed, which is already an absolute minimum for a Europe that has grown, that will continue to grow and that rightly seeks to enlarge the scope of its political actions outside its institutional confines in order to embrace a wider horizon.
From this point of view, it is certainly important to support such an approach.
As others have stressed, however, at this stage in the European debateÂ âÂ where it is so threatened by tendencies always to want to do more as well as to want to scrimp and saveÂ âÂ the Commission should have gone a step further.
Thanks to the Commission and its Sapir report, we know how much we really need to change the priorities of our investments and our budget to be competitive and to give Europe the hopes and objectives that MrÂ Prodi referred to.
The Sapir report has, however, remained in a draw because it worries many people and many governments who do not want to hear talk of certain issues.
So, at a time when the Commission has got into the habit of touching on sensitive issues, as it did with the Stability and Growth Pact, there is, for example, this agreement, which seems to be set in stone and which, while we are discussing the CAP, we are committed to not touching until 2013.
This issue should, then, have been included in todayâs communication.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the initial analysis made by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, when he referred to the fact that recent years have been marked by a impressive collection of dogmas that have been destroyed, of impossibilities that have become a constant reality and of constant realities, such as the Berlin Wall, that have fallen like the Cedars of Lebanon, as recounted in the classics.
In my view, that is the context surrounding this Commission communication, in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances.
This Commission communication will have to be supplemented by the own-initiative report to be prepared by Parliamentâs Committee on Budgets and adapt to the new circumstances of enlargement; the European elections will produce a new Parliament and there will be a new Commission.
In any event, we must welcome the Commissionâs work and the new budget headings: sustainable development, putting the people at the heart of our project and boosting a more visible and effective foreign policy of the European Union.
I would also like to highlight very clearly the alternative put to us by President Prodi of choosing between two models of Europe.
He told us that between the tangible Europe, the definite Europe, and the Europe of the net balance and net beneficiary, he chose a model compatible with the former, which is a higher model, a model of the Europe of values, the Europe of peace, of understanding, of harmony and of solidarity.
This solidarity must go hand in hand with the Lisbon spirit and strategy.
Therefore, Mr President, I welcome the strategic choice made by the Commission today to present a communication that is not based on a model of a selfish Europe but on a model that has been capable of making the figures work for the ideals.
Â Â  â Mr President, President Prodi, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are embarking today on a debate whose preparation in recent weeks has already been accompanied by a great deal of shadow-boxing, and I am pleased that the proposals are finally on the table so we can talk about them.
I am not so lacking in self-confidence that I feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting.
Nor do I feel any need to be bound solely by the Commissionâs proposals, just as I see little reason to take the individual statements from the Council or parts of the Council as a benchmark for myself.
Instead, as Members of this Parliament, which is one of the institutions to vote on this financial perspective, we will address these issues over the coming weeks and months, and indeed over the coming years â that is how long such difficult discussions can take.
In doing so, it is not acceptable for one side to say: âWe have an idea and we want a vast amount of cash to implement itâ.
That cannot be the right approach.
However, the other side also cannot say: âLook, you have a bit of cash in Europe, see how far you get with thatâ.
Both of these approaches are wrong.
Here is what we have to do.
We must face up to the challenges that we are already discussing jointly, and then work through them point by point.
Let me say this: all of us â including those who have been regaling us with grand words today â will have to be flexible on a number of issues.
We will have to discuss what we want to do in the field of research and development.
At our last session, we agreed that 3% of gross domestic product should be spent on this policy area in Europe.
This 3% cannot be accommodated in the budget, for then the 1.24% or 1.0% or whatever would not be worth the paper it is written on.
We therefore need to talk about budget combinations.
We must discuss what should be done at national level in the Member States in future, and we must discuss what we can best do jointly at European level.
We need to do this in all the areas before us.
That includes foreign policy, for example, where the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget; we will integrate it.
We will also have to discuss what proportion of international conflict prevention we want to fund from the European budget and what the Member States will cover in future.
We have adopted a figure of 0.7% of GDP as a guide here.
As regards justice and home affairs, we will have to discuss whether we want to maintain Europol and Eurojust as small units, as at present, or whether we are aiming for further development here.
Another question is how much of the fight against organised crime should be funded at European level and what should be funded at local level.
All these issues will have to be discussed.
We will also have to talk about what comes under each budget heading and which proportion is paid from which budget.
I am very flexible here, and I am approaching this debate with an open mind.
I believe this is essential, for otherwise â especially given the war-cries now resounding through the corridors â it will be impossible to create the right atmosphere for a substantive joint debate.
I think we have found some good things in the proposals you have presented.
We will be looking at them.
We will of course be discussing with you why the proposed duration of the financial perspective is seven years.
It is important to highlight the fact that this may result in a Parliament such as this one â as Mr Elles has said â being excluded completely from the debate about the funding of the European Unionâs future.
A seven-year period could produce that situation.
We will need to talk about the growth rates that you have taken as a basis for your financial calculations.
I think I saw at one point that you are assuming economic growth of 4.5% per annum.
If we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in Europe, we will have no problem with any aspect of funding.
We therefore need to discuss which statistics you are taking as a basis for your overall figures.
We will have to discuss the structure you are proposing, and whether it is transparent, efficient and flexible.
Our interest in reforming agricultural policy also means that we want to invest in the development of rural regions within the framework of general agricultural policy.
Is this possible, based on your proposals?
Or will we have new hurdles to overcome yet again in a new financial perspective â hurdles which cannot be overcome?
We need some measure of flexibility because as several other speakers have said, challenges will arise over a seven-year period which we cannot predict today.
I am firmly convinced that we, in this House, should engage in this discussion with self-confidence.
We have our own ideas and we will set out our vision of the Europe we want to achieve. We will talk about the resources to be deployed for this purpose.
I look forward to our discussions with you.
I also look forward to the discussions with the Council.
Both of you will have to deal with a self-confident but serious and solid Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissionâs proposal for a financial framework for the period 2007-2013 is right in its priorities, and I wish to thank President Romano Prodi for that.
The EU is lagging behind all our main competitors in the areas of economic growth and competitiveness, and that is why financial investment in the prerequisites for growth is the right and necessary area of focus.
Research, the encouragement of innovation and the adoption of high technology are promoters of growth. So is a high-level infrastructure.
Investment in transport and energy networks will immediately create new jobs and strengthen business conditions even in remote regions and those where development has fallen behind.
The EU, including its most peripheral areas, must be taken account of in this work.
Similarly, investment in the young is crucial.
Programmes of education and training must be extended and diversified for youth to be able to acclimatise more readily to an international working environment.
Another problem and priority is Structural and Cohesion policy.
The new Member States need support for reconstruction and for strengthening their economic environment.
This cannot be allowed to happen, however, at the expense of the economically frailer regions of the old Member States.
That is why the provision of funds has to be increased on an equivalent scale.
If the development promised under the financial framework is to succeed, the administration has to be thoroughly modernised.
The reform of the Commission carried out this term is only a basis for reforms.
Power and responsibility have to be devolved both within the bureaucratic machinery and from the Commission to the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, the Community of Europe was born out of a desire to achieve peace and prosperity, a wise and two-fold objective, as it is not possible to achieve one without the other.
One of its fundamental pillars is social and territorial cohesion, in other words, making all citizens genuinely equal by combating imbalances and inequalities in existing wealth and opportunities.
In two monthsâ time the Union is going to be enlarged with the accession of 10 new Member States and some 75Â million citizens.
Its wealth will be far below the current average of the Europe of Fifteen and if we hope to continue to maintain our two-fold Community objective, if we hope to overcome the inequalities suffered by these new Europeans, we cannot contemplate allocating fewer public resources to this end; rather, we should step up our efforts to help.
In this respect, I must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual Community expenditure, payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income, while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation.
In other words, we are allocating fewer resources to developing the Community, and yet there are some, such as the signatories to the well-known âletter of the sixâ, who want to reduce them even further.
I support the Commissionâs proposal that there should be no reductions in future.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodiâs presentation on the EUâs financial perspective allows us to make some brief comments on the economic and social cohesion policy.
I do not intend at this time to state whether or not the financial perspective proposed here by the Commission represents percentage gains for one country or another.
This is not the reason for my intervention.
Besides, in this context, we must not forget that those countries that intend to enjoy Community funds as of 2007 have yet to meet their biggest challenges: they must overcome their structural backwardness and must ensure the economic and social cohesion of their populations.
I therefore prefer to concentrate on the political significance of the Commissionâs proposal.
If the Commission maintains or, should I say, takes the risk of maintaining, the level of financial resources of the EU at 1.24% of the Communityâs gross national product until 2013, it would be making a decisive investment in the European policy of solidarity, as the only means of achieving the homogenous growth of the entire EU, in the wake of the Lisbon strategy.
At a time when we are integrating ten new countries, this must be a prime objective, to which the benefiting countries, be they old or new, must respond with the ability to carry out the crucial reforms implied and presupposed by European solidarity.
Parliament has therefore no choice but to offer political support to the Commissionâs proposal.
We must also do all we can to ensure that the proposal of the six wealthiest Member States â to reduce the Community budget from 1.24% to 1% of Europeâs GNP â is not allowed to triumph.
We must, therefore, criticise in the strongest terms those politicians who utter fine words on Europe and solidarity, but whose real priorities lie in preserving national interests.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commissionâs campaign is now beginning for transferring EU taxes and more funds from the taxpayers to the EU.
Instead, the June Movement proposes a halt to European tax and expenditure.
Not a single penny should be appropriated to Brussels until there is an accounting system through which we can see what the money is being used for.
For 25 years, I have tried to obtain detailed information about how the EU uses the money we pay in quotas.
There has still, for example, been no success in tracking down the âskimmed milk supremoâ who, for many years, was the biggest recipient of EU subsidies in Denmark.
We have still not seen statements of account from the secret accounts in the Eurostat scandal.
We know, however, that the chief accountant, Marta Andreasen, who insisted on correct accounts, has now been suspended for 17 months and is banned from showing herself in the Commissionâs buildings, where those who have manifestly been responsible for the fraud can go about freely.
This state of affairs does not provide the necessary permission for sending funds via Brussels.
The June Movement instead proposes that the EU focus on the cross-border matters we cannot solve ourselves and keep away from everything else.
The subsidies to the present EU agricultural systems can be phased out by 20% per year over five years.
The EU should completely cease giving structural aid to the rich Member States.
The poor countries and the new Member States should be exempted from paying quotas so that there is real solidarity and not only a redistribution from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poorer countries.
With such a reform, the net payers will get away with paying less tax, at the same time as the net recipients will be in a significantly better position than at present.
At the same time, allow details of each appropriation and item of expenditure to be accessible on the Internet.
In that way, we can avoid waste, excess and fraud, and vigilant journalists and employees in companies and other institutions that receive subsidies will quickly be able to reveal if money is being misused, wasted or misappropriated.
Finally, just a few round figures.
Last year, Denmark paid DKK 15 billion in EU quotas.
Danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of DKK 10 billion.
The total net income received by Danish agriculture was only a fraction of the direct EC subsidy.
Money is flooding out of EU coffers without ending up in the hands of the needy farmers, and this shows, more than any amount of words, the need for a halt to expenditure and tax, including in the EU.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the EU budget will be tough.
At a time when the net contributors do not have unlimited resources at their disposal and net recipients are keen to protect their vested interests, it will be difficult to achieve a constructive solution.
As this solution, the Commission is proposing an increase in own resources.
The idea of granting the EU its own tax competence â the keyword is the âEurope taxâ â is being discussed.
Given the difficult economic situation and massive austerity measures being applied in numerous EU Member States, the letter from the six governments is quite understandable, in my view.
If savings are being made across the board, then the EU cannot â no, esteemed colleagues â must not shy away from this desire for savings and reform.
Anything else would damage the future of the EU and would ultimately be impossible to justify to the public.
In the conflict over the EUâs future finances, there are two options: either to carry on muddling through, repeating the sins of the past and trying to fund everything at once, or â the second option â to see the future framework for the EU budget as an opportunity.
Ever since the decision to admit ten new Member States, at the latest, it has been clear that reforms are essential.
Yet so far, no one has been willing to grasp the nettle.
Is everything just fine in the EUâs subsidy policy, for example?
Is it clear why the EU subsidises tobacco cultivation while banning tobacco advertising at the same time?
Is it really the clever option to fund the transportation of animals right across our continent and beyond?
These are just two minor examples.
However, one thing is clear: reforms must happen, and this is an opportunity.
It takes political courage and probably also a political vision of Europeâs future shape, tasks and prospects.
After all, a budget is merely a set of policies presented in numerical form.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this financial perspective must enable us to live up to the ambitions that we have for Europe, ambitions that require us to seek increased growth and competition.
To this end, we need to spend less, but spend better.
Reform is therefore necessary, not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the âsprinklingâ approach that we have adopted so far, but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public.
Meeting the expectations of the public means quite simply, for example in employment policy, not having any more of these policies of providing secondary assistance or patching up the crutches that are already available.
Because if we want to create 15Â million jobs, we will need to innovate under the Lisbon Agenda and implement new policies that are original and dynamic and that foster private initiative.
We will need to educate, inform the public, pursue these policies that we have started to implement, policies that generate jobs, and in addition accelerate structural reforms.
We will need to promote investment in infrastructure, in transport, in communications, in human resources and in research, which is still being left out in the cold and whose budget is in my view far from adequate.
Let us nevertheless bear in mind that all of this should meet an objective of sustainable development, a factor in creating stability.
And let us refrain from making scapegoats of certain groups of society, such as our poor farmers, because we really do need them and they need us.
Clearly, we find the proposals that the Commission has made to us reassuring, and I would particularly like to welcome the proposals for the new regional policy put forward by Commissioner Barnier.
The choice that has been made seems to me to be an excellent one, because it will provide the enlargement countries with the necessary support without isolating the regions in the current Member States that need these funds.
We must actually continue to meet the needs of the areas covered by the present fifteen Member States, fostering their competitiveness and growth so as to fight against unemployment.
Were we not to do so then the public would simply not understand.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the European Commission is endeavouring with its proposal to strike a balance between the increased financing requirements of enlargement and the difficulties of the short-term economy and the options of the strong Member States.
However, sustainable development in the Member States must be supported and the role of the European Union as global partner must be strengthened.
In addition, the new financial perspective must send out a clear political message about equal treatment and solidarity between the Member States and, if you will allow me to dwell on this point, the needs of the regions which suffer the repercussions of so-called 'statistical convergence'.
The citizens in these developing regions see political cohesion as the main element in making the idea of the European Union a worthy idea and I do not agree at all with the view heard in this Chamber that there are no beneficial results from this policy.
At the same time, the citizens in these regions wanted and agreed to the extensive enlargement which will be completed in a few weeks' time.
Morally and politically, therefore, it is fair for these citizens not to lose so much that they lose the feeling of solidarity which they have had to date, enjoying its fruits.
Clearly, there must be a smooth withdrawal of Community aid from these regions, with a transitional period in which support is wound down.
It is vital during this period to safeguard adequate funding.
Any thoughts of making reductions, especially large reductions, in appropriations which, it can be presumed, would have devolved upon these regions without enlargement, jeopardise the efficacy of the political cohesion which is under way and, consequently, must be treated as harmful to the credibility of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr Prodi, it is difficult not to agree with the situation as you have described it here today.
I have two doubts, which I am sure you will be able to solve: first of all, I come from a long history of militancy in a party that must surely remind you of something, and during that time I have learned that too much realism in politics often means the start of conflict.
It seems to me that your request to freeze at 1.24%, that is to say at the current level, the amount of GDP allocated â an allocation which, inter alia, is still based on 12 countries, whereas we are now 25 and will probably continue to expand â is a position lacking not only in ambition but also in courage, and I base that criticism on two facts.
Firstly, we have just approved a quick start programme for public works designed to relaunch the idea of Europe and the single market, in which we need the Member States to be involved and to provide resources, which is why I find it extremely difficult to understand the position of the six Member States that have called for a reduction in the amount allocated.
Secondly, in any negotiations, sticking to a position knowing that some of the Member States do not agree with the reference to 1%, appears to me to be quite a complex negotiating position from a tactical point of view.
The second doubt concerns the timing.
The current financial situation is programmed up to the end of 2006; the Commission must present a proposal before July 2005 and the agreement must be reached before May 2006.
So then, why the urgency?
So that we can rush things through in a Parliament whose mandate is about to expire?
As Mr Wynn correctly pointed out, our Parliament has an extremely important role to play, but that role will be played by the Parliament to be elected on 13 June.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neither the restriction to 1% nor the Commissionâs proposal for an expansion to 1.24%, which amounts to 1.15% in reality, can be the signal we send to Europeâs citizens and taxpayers today.
Naturally, the letter from the six governments so soon after the collapse of the Summit was a mistake in terms of its timing, tone and content and was therefore quite unacceptable.
Equally, however, in response to the Commissionâs ideas â and you, President Prodi, have presented some interesting keywords, although we will have to discuss them in far more detail â I must say that what is urgently required in the coming months is a critical review of the European Unionâs agenda, with a focus on both positive and negative aspects across the board in all policy fields, if we want to identify honest and practical responses for Europeâs citizens.
Naturally, the outcome of our discussions today cannot be binding on the new Commission, which will still have to be approved by the new Parliament; nor can it be binding in any way on the new Parliament in its capacity as part of the budgetary authority.
As part of this more critical approach, however, it is essential, first and foremost, to complete the constitutional treaty and define the system of powers, also in line with the subsidiarity principle.
This also means that if powers are transferred back to the Member States in an enlarged EU, we will need fewer resources for these areas at European level.
However, it also means that if tasks are transferred to the European level â such as foreign, security and development policy â the Member States will have to look again at the possibility of not only increasing the EU budget but also reducing spending at national level.
I would like to conclude by raising two points.
After all, it is not just a matter of freeing up budget funds in order to deal with new objectives, improving competitiveness and growth potential.
What I think is missing, especially in the light of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy to be discussed next month, is that here, the Commission itself has not established the coherence on many legislative proposals, which is necessary to achieve the binding consolidation that will generate growth potential and entrepreneurial freedoms throughout the European Union.
If what you are proposing in the budget is flanked by such initiatives, our credibility will be much improved.
In addition, we see the option of reverting to Article 272 of the Treaty without binding new Parliaments and new institutions as a very exciting one.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission communication on the new financial perspective as an interesting debating exercise for the future.
It will not be this Commission or this Parliament that take the final decisions, but here is the result and we must thank the entire College of Commissioners for having incorporated the various sensibilities.
We consider this to be a good basis for negotiation.
A financial perspective that is properly negotiated among the three institutions is a vital element for the rational development of the Unionâs expenditure and for ensuring growth, competitiveness, employment, and economic and social cohesion within a framework of budgetary stability.
That is the financial perspective on which this Parliament would like to vote.
We would never vote in favour of a financial perspective based simply on accounting calculations or imposed unilaterally by one institution that had not negotiated with the others.
This Parliament has already set out its position on three aspects of the financial perspective.
The first of those was its duration, which in principle should coincide where possible with the duration of the mandates of the European Parliament and the Commission.
Secondly, we have also stated our support for providing greater impetus for the political objectives laid down in Lisbon and Gothenburg.
This development takes shape through the Unionâs annual budgets and it is clear that without sufficient financial resources there can be no credible objectives.
Indeed, look at the 2005 draft budget and you will see what budget restrictions are.
Thirdly, we have on many occasions expressed our support for a financial perspective that is capable of fulfilling the objective of cohesion.
Cohesion is and will continue to be the major inspiration behind the EUâs policies along with growth and stability.
The 0.45% of gross national income for cohesion measures has been incorporated by this Parliament and forms part of our approach.
If we cut corners with cohesion policy we will surely fail.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the presidency of the Council, I thank President Prodi for the presentation on the policy orientation provided by the European Commission for the Union's next multiannual financial framework: it is an important communication.
The negotiations ahead will be of fundamental importance for the development of the enlarged Union well into the next decade.
What is at issue, therefore, is much more than the financial framework for the Union.
It is also the policies and priorities which can best address the aspirations of your citizens.
As mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, the negotiations will run well into 2005.
However, the Irish presidency will begin discussions and give priority to advancing the dossier as effectively as possible.
The President of the Commission will brief Coreper tomorrow, and on 23Â February there will be a first discussion by ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Our aim as presidency will be to initiate and advance discussions and, in cooperation with succeeding presidencies, to map out how best to process the dossier and lay a solid foundation for our successors.
We hope in this regard that the spring European Council might be able to agree on the calendar and process for negotiations.
The Council looks forward to working constructively with Parliament and the Commission in advancing this important dossier.
With your permission, Mr President, may I finally join with you, Mr Wynn and others in the warm expressions of congratulations and goodwill to MrÂ Colom i Naval and to wish him all the very best for the future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I will say a few words and then Commissioner Schreyer will reply to some of the more technical questions.
There has been one general criticism running through this debate â a debate for which I am sincerely grateful, because Parliament has genuinely exercised its institutional pride on the issue of the budget and has given us precious advice â criticism made by some important Members of Parliament, beginning with MrÂ Wynn: a lack of ambition, as MrÂ Fiori also pointed out, and the assertion that an excess of realism leads to weakness.
So, I should like to point out that the structure of the budget we are presenting indicates a radical change with the past â not only quantitatively but also qualitatively; it constitutes an ambitious project that will give rise to serious problems and a fierce debate when the time comes for it to be adopted.
I ask you to consider just a few figures: I have spoken about sustainable development; I did not want to provide analytical data because I believe that we need to consider such data together at some length, but in relation to the Lisbon process funds will increase by 62.8% â from EUR 47Â billion in 2006 to EUR 76 billion in 2013 â allowing for a 32% increase in cohesion funds, 300% for funds earmarked for education and training, 200% for research funds, 400% for funds earmarked for competitiveness and networks.
We have made choices that are coherent, precise and dramatically different from those of Lisbon: we have placed, within the context of an extremely ambitious draft budget, appropriations for the area of justice, which is one of the major areas of the Union â it was not by chance that I referred to it as one of the Unionâs three lines of action â that is to say funds are to increase by almost 200% from EURÂ 1 billion in 2006 to EURÂ 3.6 billion in 2013.
These, I repeat, are radical changes.
Finally, the international situation: funds are to increase by almost 40% from EURÂ 11 billion in 2006 to EURÂ 15.7 billion in 2013.
So then, we have made some stark choices â which I hope will be accepted â in keeping precisely in line with the objectives.
We did not, ladies and gentlemen, begin building from the roof, but from the foundations, studying the new objectives and analysing what had been decided in previous years with the decisions taken at Lisbon and subsequent decisions.
On this basis we have constructed a coherent budget so that Europe can relaunch itself, re-establish a united policy on justice and internal affairs and re-establish its voice in the world.
There are three areas on which we have consolidated and focused our attention, and therefore this is a response which I consider ambitious; realistic and ambitious.
I say realistic because it is clear that genuine situations, temperaments and even political trends cannot be ignored.
I assure you that the procession of the six ambassadors who brought me the 1% letter resembled more than anything a funeral cortege, and it is clear that this makes no sense in a Europe that must react, that must go forward, that has enormous responsibilities for everyone.
So, we have taken a major gamble: stark choices, extremely radical choices, as the detailed line by line analysis of the budget will show.
In conclusion, a final observation: why have we started so early, Mr Fiori?
Out of respect for those who are to come after us.
The timeframes are extremely long.
When, at the end of our term of office, we hand over the whole project with its roadmap, when our work is completed, they will need â so it has been said â about twelve months, possibly more: going on past experience, 18 months will be needed to fine-tune the finished product; that means the beginning of 2006, January/February 2006.
Care must be taken to provide enough time to learn the procedures, prepare the financing procedures and organise the financing structure, which is only just adequate, so that the objectives we have set ourselves can be met.
The work we have carried out is wide-ranging but absolutely essential.
