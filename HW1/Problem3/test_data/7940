The fact that a wall is now being erected there, partly even in occupied territories, to screen Israel from the Palestinians, makes a mockery of the phased plan's intention.
The fact that new settlements are still being planned makes a mockery of the phased plan.
Where does the phased plan lead?
It is a road to nowhere.
We must take action.
We must monitor this plan at ground level, and we must ensure that the situation does not escalate any further.
What happened after the dramatic attack in Haifa, an attack deep in Syria, and one that we deplore and denounce, simply invites further military escalation.
The Turkish parliamentâs decision to send troops to Iraq from Turkey, goes against the wishes of the Turkish population, but has been taken under American pressure; it also goes against the wishes of the interim government and of the Iraqi Kurds and is clearly intended as a threat to the PKK.
The Turkish population fears, with good reason, that this will spark another spiral of violence.
The Iranian regime too, whilst meeting with strong criticism from public opinion at home, is reaping profit from the situation in Iraq.
They are the victors.
They are gaining more influence over their Shiite fellow believers, not only in society, but even in the government, and they are now putting the pressure on to destroy the Mujahedin.
This is once again an attempt to force a military solution, a bogus solution in other words, while we continue to talk about a roadmap to peace.
I am asking the European countries, the Commission, the Presidency of the Council to come up with answers to these pressing questions.
Can we still, under these circumstances, cooperate with Israel without imposing conditions?
Can we still keep the Association Agreement in operation?
Can we continue to turn a blind eye to the obvious presence in Israel of nuclear weapons, kept in reserve as a political lever, but also as an alibi to be able to wage conventional wars more easily?
Is it not there that we should be looking for weapons of mass destruction?
Should the Atomic Energy Agency not intervene and do its job?
I am therefore asking for a less resigned and a more active stance on the part of the Quartet, and I hope that we can still curb the spreading of war and that we can truly turn into the direction of peace once again.
Â Â  Mr President, the focus at the forthcoming summit of European Union leaders will primarily be an economic one.
Coming so soon after the Rome Council meeting, it is in itself a clear indication by our leaders of their intent to put in place measures to reinvigorate the European economy.
The European economy needs to be reinvigorated.
This year growth has been less than 1%, which by any standards is an exceptionally poor performance.
Whilst economic fundamentals remain basically sound, growth within the European Union is clearly sluggish and investor and consumer confidence is very low.
We must really answer the question as to what we must do to turn around this economic situation.
The bottom line, as a number of colleagues have said here this afternoon, is that now is the time for decisive action to be taken.
The Lisbon Strategy must be implemented in its entirety across all its strands.
The European Union must become the strongest knowledge-based economy in the world.
This is imperative if we are to remain competitive and attract direct foreign investment into our community.
This means that we must take full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies that are coming on stream.
Equally, the benefit of new technologies must be spread to all regions in Europe and to both urban and rural areas.
European Union leaders must work towards completing all outstanding components of the EU financial services action plan, as well as creating a level playing field for mergers and company take-overs.
Completing a fully-effective internal market requires the progressive creation of an integrated market for gas and electricity to enhance security of supply in Europe.
European leaders must look to promote initiatives which guarantee that pension payments can be made in the future for an ageing population.
Notwithstanding the economic nature of this summit, it would be very hard for European Union leaders to ignore the escalating violence in the Middle East, and nor, indeed, should they.
I believe that the European Union has a role to play in brokering a ceasefire between the various factions in the Middle East and I would strongly urge the Italian Government, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, to continue to remain actively involved in the Middle East at this critical juncture.
Finally, discussions will undoubtedly take place on the margins of the summit with regard to the provisions of the new European Union Treaty.
It appears that negotiations in this respect started quite well at the weekend and we wish the Italian presidency every success in giving us, at the end of the day, a package that will be for the benefit of the people of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a new opinion poll shows that, at present, only half the Danish population has heard of the draft European Constitution.
Seventy-eight per cent want there still to be a Commissioner from each country.
Only 12% are prepared to do away with such a representative.
The Danish Government has therefore now at long last joined the chorus demanding a Commissioner from each country.
I collected 123 signatures to that effect in the Convention.
For all that, it does not form a part of the Conventionâs draft, and this shows how the word âconsensusâ can be misused when ordinary democratic procedures involving proposals, amendments and votes are abandoned.
Better late than never, however.
Will the Presidency of the Council now confirm that it is campaigning for a Commission with a representative for each country with full rights?
The next demand must therefore be that it should be the voters themselves or the national parliaments that choose their Commissioners.
The elected representatives, who are answerable to their national parliaments, could report â in the Danish representativeâs case, each Friday to the Europe Committee â on what they did the previous week and on what they intend to vote for the following week.
They could inform the public and act as the elected representatives of the voters in the body that has a monopoly on tabling legislative proposals.
They could be the votersâ representatives in Brussels instead of Brusselsâ representatives in relation to the voters.
Being elected by the national parliaments would be no obstacle to the Commissionersâ also being accountable, as managers of their portfolios, to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
On this point, the next Treaty should include a proper statement of the Commissionersâ responsibilities, corresponding to the ministerial responsibility familiar from civilised democracies.
A minister or a Commissioner must also be responsible for things about which he or she was unaware.
We cannot have a Solbes, who does not accept responsibility because he did not know what was going on in Eurostat.
He has managerial responsibility, whether or not he is to blame.
He must accept responsibility and, in the process, ensure that the culprits are held to account.
Before the Constitution is finally adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference, every subject in it should be discussed thoroughly by the people.
How will the Presidency guarantee that the outcome does not come as a bad surprise for the majority of voters in our countries?
Â Â  Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, in a few days time in Brussels there will be discussions on reviving the economy, and I am concerned that they will end up reopening the debate on the Stability Pact, on whether it takes the right line, that there will end up being a debate between States that are asking to be able to spend more and to be able to increase their deficit beyond the commitments made in the Pact itself.
I fear thatÂ âÂ sadly, once againÂ âÂ there will be no discussion as to what the European Union and the European Institutions could do to encourage and to contribute to the EUâs economic growth.
MrÂ Prodi, a little more than a year ago, you commissioned a high-level group of experts to carry out a study on an agenda for a Europe with an expanding economy.
This study made some very specific, very thorough and very important recommendations on what the European Union could do to contribute to growth, first and foremost by re-orientating its own internal budget, that of the European institutions: in fact, we also need to question the approach taken by the European budget, to ask to what extent it helps economic growth.
This group of experts, thenÂ âÂ the committee chaired by AndrÃ© SapirÂ âÂ made an extremely clear proposal: re-direct the European institutionsâ budget, the 1.25% of European GDP, which is only a small amount but is being put to very poor use and does not serve to contribute towards European growth.
The recommendation was quite clear: a major political decision has to be made, and this decision involves removing the burden of the common agricultural policy, which takes up and accounts for almost half of our funds, from the European budget.
The funds that would be freed up by merely rethinking agricultural policy and agricultural protection, which has such a negative impact on the image of Europe abroad, couldÂ âÂ thanks, not least, to the leverage effectÂ âÂ help give an enormous boost to economic research and to technological innovation, which needs to be financed by large-scale saving which only Brussels can provide.
These same resources could also be used to boost the implementation of the infamous European networks to better connect markets.
All this could be done, but it is not being done.
I believe that, at European level, we need, first and foremost, to reassess our budget and our agricultural policy, otherwise, it will become increasingly pointless to pontificate about the Lisbon objectives.
One final thought, Mr President: immigration will be discussed.
This is a good thing and I hope that a clear signal will be given to European citizens that immigrants are and can be an asset to economic growth rather than a problem.
Â Â  MrÂ President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, first and foremost, the next meeting must take stock of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which opened last Saturday in Rome.
In my opinion, the result is favourable on the whole: the adopted text gives us good cause for hope after the pessimistic forecasts beforehand.
I, personally, am optimistic, having experienced the Conventionâs shilly-shallying, problems and difficulties; I am absolutely convinced that no one will want to take responsibility for letting two years work fail, no one will want to take political responsibility for failing to give Europe the Constitution that 450 million citizens are expecting.
Of course, no substantial compromise should be made on the Constitution text; of course, small adjustments will have to be made, but the balance of the Constitution should remain as it is.
What adjustments can be made?
I firmly believe that the areas where majority voting is used should be extended: unanimity is an obstacle; it is a concrete pillar blocking the EUâs progress.
I also firmly believe that a compromise can be reached on the number of Commissioners: in my view, the countries that will be part of the EU from 2004 should be represented from the outset; subsequently, we could see if we could get round the problem by using Commissioners without portfolio, but I feel that, to start with, there has to be a Commissioner for each of the countries that will be a Member of the EU.
Then, of course, I also firmly believe that an explicit reference to Europeâs Judaeo-Christian roots should be written into the preamble to the Constitution.
I would also like to pause a moment to praise the Italian PresidencyÂ âÂ as MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo has just done.
A commitment was made in the Chamber in Strasbourg to ensuring that the European Parliament was represented at the Intergovernmental Conference: this has been the case and can be seen as a success for this House.
I am sure that Parliament will be able to continue to make a useful contribution during the debate.
The second issue, MrÂ President, is reviving the economy.
YesterdayÂ âÂ and we can only welcome thisÂ âÂ Ecofin gave the go-ahead for the first step in implementing the trans-European networks: these are major plans that will create new jobs as well as making our regions and our countries more competitive.
When prioritising, President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we need to focus clearly on a Europe that is going from the West towards the East, but also at the Europe which is looking from the North to the South.

We can only revive the economy by pursuing the Lisbon process: raising the retirement age is a necessary reform, we need to give an answer to our children so that there is a system which guarantees their future in 10, 20, 30, 40 yearsâ time.
Furthermore, I also agree with MrÂ Prodi on the issue of research: this is a commitment made by the current President-in-Office of the Council in his speech in Strasbourg, and I firmly believe that the future of our economy depends on promoting investment in research as well.
Turning now to the final issue, immigration, it cannot be a national issue.
Italy has 700Â km of coastline, which is not just the Italian border, but also Europeâs southern border.
Because of this, there is absolutely no doubt about the fact that it is the EUâs duty not only to take on some organisational responsibility, in terms of policing measures, but also to shoulder economic responsibility in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we should indeed not underestimate the significance of the next Brussels summit, or the effect that it will have.
The public will take a sceptical view of this Europe of ours for as long as they feel that nothing, or virtually nothing, is being done to provide them with more jobs.
They will also take a sceptical view of the European Union for as long as they do not see investment in their infrastructure, sufficient to modernise it and to make our continent more competitive.
Not merely economic but also psychological factors are involved in restoring to Europe the courage and determination it will need to be a leading continent. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that there is to be more investment in infrastructure and in research and development.
In ECOFIN, the finance ministers have once again got cold feet.
Mr Watson may be happy with that, but I am not, and I hope that the prime ministers will get the better of their finance ministers when it comes to real investment in the modernisation of infrastructure.
You referred to the market in electricity.
Does not our liberalisation of the electricity market without ensuring sufficient investment, especially in the grid, create a problem?
We will now have the same problem with the railways.
We have decided to deregulate them, and are in the process of putting together a second railways package, which will mean cutting tariffs and prices.
If, however, we do not at the same time require the public sector â and, where possible, the private sector â to invest in the railway network, we will see the same thing happen as has happened in Great Britain, where too little investment has meant also too little investment in peopleâs safety, more accidents and hence a discredited public sector.
At the end of the day, I believe, it has to be made abundantly clear that this is not about jeopardising the Stability Pact.
If anything today endangers the Stability Pact, it is the rigidly dogmatic interpretation of it, which leads the public to see it as a bad thing.
If it is applied intelligently, sensibly and flexibly, in the way that the President of the Commission has called for on many occasions, without it taking us back to a massive Budget deficit, then that will be the Stability Pactâs salvation, as the budgets that are currently at risk are not in that position through too much being invested in the countries in question; many of them are at risk from excessive consumer spending.
Investment, though, would make for increased growth.
Let me just say something brief about foreign policy.
Reference has already been made to the situation in the Middle East, and it will be further discussed tomorrow.
I believe that the Council, and the European Union as a whole, must unambiguously repudiate terrorism and make that clear to any and every country that flirts with it â which is not always to say that they support it, but that they tolerate it.
It must, though, be made equally plain to Israel that it must not perpetuate the cycle of violence or even, perhaps, set one in motion.
Recent months have seen quite enough acts of aggression in the Middle East, founded on the assertion that there were dangerous weapons here, weapons of mass destruction there, and terrorism somewhere else still, all of which has often turned out to be untrue.
We have to make it perfectly clear to Israel that, while we endorse its firm commitment to self-determination and to countering terrorism, it too has a contribution to make towards achieving peace.
If I may make a final comment, you said nothing about Russia and Chechnya.
Chechnya has just had elections that were a farce, and I think we also need to speak plain language to Russia, which is an important partner for the European Union.
Your prime minister, Mr Berlusconi, thinks highly of Mr Putin, he is a friend of his and gives him very warm welcomes.
At the same time, though, MrÂ Berlusconi is not inclined to mince his words.
I believe that Mr Berlusconi should tell Mr Putin quite bluntly that we cannot put up with what is going on in Chechnya.
This is the time for Russia, too, to work out a policy for bringing peace to Chechnya.
Â Â  Mr President, we are grateful that the Secretary of State made a report on the first session of the IGC.
I have to say that, like Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I greatly regret the suppression of the notion of the Legislative Council, a decision which will not foster the separation of powers within the European Union.
The more serious problem appears to be caused by Spain and Poland, on the grounds that they are to lose the blocking minority they enjoy beneath the Treaty of Nice.
I have to say that these are spurious grounds for complaint.
The facts are that Spain and Poland need several more partners to join with them to reach the 38% of the population needed to block a decision.
The Convention proposes to lower the QMV threshold from 62% to 60%: a mere 9 million people.
This is at best a marginal question of bruised self-esteem for Spain and Poland.
On Thursday, I trust the true friends of Spain and Poland will explain to Mr Aznar and Mr Miller that they should drop their complaint and assist the IGC in reaching a speedy political agreement to respect the first and second parts of the Constitution.
The IGC will then be free to proceed to refurbish and modernise Part III, which is its proper responsibility.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the severe economic slowdown, the stagnation, the recession and the increase in unemployment and poverty are some of the more visible manifestations of the failure of the European Central Bankâs rigid monetary policy and the budgetary consolidation procedure blindly imposed by the nominal convergence criteria.
Modifying the spirit of the StabilityÂ Pact, therefore, is not enough. Neither is implementing it more flexibly.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that an in-depth review of the pactâs objectives and criteria is required if monetary and budgetary policies are to contribute to economic growth and employment.
I would like to ask the Commission and the Council the following question, therefore: when calculating the 3% budget deficit, are you prepared to discount, with immediate effect, public spending and costs incurred as a result of exceptional circumstances, such as the fires which devastated Portugal this summer?
Such a measure is urgently needed.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when, on 10 July, a standing ovation greeted the Conventionâs adoption, in this room, of the draft constitution, the elation on the one side and the disappointment of the other could not obscure the fact that we had found the highest common denominator for the future of Europe.
Now, here it comes again â the Intergovernmental Conference.
The bazaar is open to those who trade in national interests.
The governments have again seized control of the European constitutional process and act out the wielding of their power in splendour and pomp on a feudal stage, on which they make great affirmations of belief in Europe, whilst behind its scenery, people are already shouting the odds about their national interests.
Although the Convention must be silent, now is the time for this House to speak up as the trustee and advocate of this, the greatest possible European consensus.
We cannot stand by and watch as this replay of Amsterdam and Nice, perhaps with the outcome of Nice II or Nice III, takes us to the slippery slope and back to the lowest common European denominator.
Far from being a task force or a preparatory group composed of motley experts, this Convention was a unique forum of all the national parliaments, including those of the accession countries, including those of Spain and Poland, of all the national governments, including those of Finland and Austria, and it was also a forum for the European institutions, Parliament and the Commission.
After eighteen months of negotiation, a great and historic consensus was achieved.
Under pressure from the governments, the Convention cut much of it out.
The parliaments were represented; it is they, rather than the governments, who are the masters of the treaties, and they wanted to go a good deal further alongside us.
Under pressure from the governments, we made great compromises.
Now is the time for us, in this House, to remind the governments that negotiations involve such a thing as good faith, and that, at the end of eighteen months of negotiations, you cannot behave as if you were not there and put on a shadow-boxing show that pits large against small and East against West, bearing no relation whatever to reality.
I was very much surprised that the President of the Commission had nothing to say about this historic course of events, but large versus small is not Europeâs game.
Simply rotating the presidencies of both the Commission and the Council is enough to represent the equality of all countries.
It is, though, the attack by the national executives on European parliamentary life that must be combated, and it will be the public who will pay the price.
The idea of a Legislative Council was central to the separation of the powers in the European democracy, central to Parliamentary control of the Council, central to the public character of European lawmaking and to the idea of its proximity to the citizen â yet it was disposed of at the first sitting!
Disposed of consensually at the first sitting, without asking either the parliaments or the European institutions, all of which had asked for it!
This is an attack on the hard-won majority decisions that were to make Europe capable of acting!
The European Public Prosecutor, the public nature of lawmaking â this is not shadowboxing; this is an all-out assault on the very idea of Europeâs new architecture as a European democracy and as a great step forward towards its political unification.
It is for us in the European Parliament, being also delegates to the Convention, to publicly denounce this national tug-of-war, to do so with all possible determination, and as loudly as we can, so that it is not just nationalism that makes its voice heard in Europe, but also the ideal of political unity!
Â Â  Mr President, it would have been nice if previous speakers had not doubled their speaking time, because we all have other engagements after this debate.
Courtesy is not, however, the most common feature of this Parliament.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, one of your illustrious predecessors, JacquesÂ Delors, said in a recent interview that the European Parliament would do better to deal with matters of concern to Europeâs citizens rather than focusing on human rights in Guatemala or on womenâs rights in Equatorial Guinea.
These are undoubtedly interesting matters but, at the moment, what Europeans are more concerned with â and something that the Brussels Summit, if I am not mistaken, is due to address â is the incredible growth deficit that is threatening to engulf the European economy and, within the European economy, those countries in particular that chose to put their fate in the hands of the euro and the European Central Bank.
Whatever the criteria selected, be it debt, deficit, growth, unemployment, inflation â the three Member States that did not opt for the euro and which have kept their national currency are doing the best, including â see the Commission report on this matter â in the field of competition and the Lisbon strategy.
The three countries that should be stepping up to receive their medals are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, which has, moreover, just given an unequivocal response to European monetary policy.
Because the Brussels summit is due to oversee the changeover between MrÂ Duisenberg and MrÂ Trichet, perhaps it could consider the policy that has been conducted since the euro was introduced in 1999?
Incidentally, Commissioner Prodi, that event is something for which your mandate will be remembered, because you took office before the euro had been introduced and you will leave after it has been established.
One incredible aspect of this currency is that it is propelled towards peaks by the dollar â not of its own free will but like a cork tossed up by the power of the wave â whereas everyone knows that thousands of jobs are being axed every day, as the result both of a Malthusian policy and now of a negligent attitude towards the currency market which makes the euro the main handicap to the European economy, particularly for the countries in the euro zone.
Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, on this matter, which is one of the European citizensâ deepest concerns, is anyone going to remind the European Central Bank of its job, which is to ensure growth, or at least to ensure that we have a currency that benefits the European economy?
Â Â  MrÂ President, after many years of greatly underestimating the problem represented by the perils of illegal immigration, today, at last, if somewhat belatedly, the European institutions seem to be starting to take an encouraging line by beginning to make the set of policies designed to address and combat practically the challenge of illegal immigration fairer and more effective.
The Council has to move on, thenÂ âÂ that is what the is calling forÂ âÂ spurred on, not least, by the effective impetus of the Italian Presidency.
It is precisely on these issues that we were pleased to hear a clear, precise report by MrÂ Antonione, representative of the Italian Presidency, on the lines that are emerging from the Justice and Home Affairs Councilâs work and discussions: a substantial proposal to set up a border management agency, particularly for sea borders.
MrÂ Tajani rightly pointed out the importance of having 700 km of borders in our country, at Europeâs southern boundary.
Then there is the quota policy, and thus integration, which must be dealt with in relation to employment and not with populist proposals that give too much ground, such as the proposal put forward by MrÂ Fini to give the vote to third country nationals: this would be a step in the wrong direction, it is an inappropriate proposal which is out of place, which goes in the opposite direction from a responsible, specific commitmentÂ âÂ the direction in which the European institutions are goingÂ âÂ to strive to oppose illegality.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the opening last week in Rome of the Intergovernmental Conference, which has the task of producing the definitive text of the European Constitution, was marked by the President-in-Office of the Councilâs call for goodwill and by the willing optimism of several Member States including France and Germany.
The Italian President-in-Office of the Council stressed that this Conference is the Conference of European will, of Europeâs will to be Europe and political will is going to be the keyword of this Intergovernmental Conference.
The groundwork has been done by the European Convention, chaired by ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing and it is now up to Ministers to demonstrate that they have this will with, of course, the additional possibility of improving the draft Constitution that we now have.
Some Member States of the Union are openly threatening to oppose any outcome that would call into question what they call the âNice â.
I deplore this attitude, because stability must not be confused with stasis.
Was it not, after all, the Laeken European Council that fervently wanted the Treaties to be revised to ensure more democracy, more simplicity and more transparency?
Besides, following the unanimously acknowledged success of the Community method, so brilliantly illustrated by the European conventions on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on the Constitution, our partners cannot act as if the Union were simply an intergovernmental organisation.
We must lead the way in order to ensure that enlargement is a success.
The forthcoming European Council must also apply itself to revitalising the economy, as several speakers have said.
On this subject, I am pleased at the growing awareness of the fact that the stability chapter of the European economy should not be able to relegate the chapter dealing with growth, business start-ups and employment into second place.
Our citizens expect their leaders to create conditions that will enable Europe to be dynamic, prosperous and more cooperative.
Only by freeing our economies of the burden of excessive taxation and excessive bureaucracy will we be able to create lasting wealth and enable the majority of society to benefit from this wealth.
This once again requires the political will to undertake reforms that are far-reaching and sometimes relatively unpopular in the short term.
Some countries in the Union, including France, are boldly setting about this task and I hope that these efforts are not only acknowledged but also receive encouragement from Europe.
Lastly, in the field of external relations, I wish to tell the Presidency of the Union how important we consider the Rule of Law together with protecting human dignity to be in managing the external borders of an enlarged Europe, as well as respect for the international legitimacy of the UN in combating international terrorism.
Whether in the European Union or elsewhere in the world, now is the time for multilateralism and for joint action and not for going it alone.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a statement by the President-in-Office of the Council which could appear positive but which worries me very much.
You have spoken, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of new common initiatives at European level in the field of immigration.
Do you know why it worries me?
Because we have not yet reached any agreement on any of the old European common initiatives in the field of immigration.
It worries me enormously that we are increasing the volume of paperwork that we already have in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on European initiatives in this field without achieving any results.
There is just one single Directive (of those proposed by the Commission), just one, on which an agreement has been reached: the one on family regrouping.
And it is a compendium of exceptions â there are more exceptions than there are Member States â and it is such a weak Directive that we will have to wait to see what this Parliament does with it.
Because, in reality, what it has generated inside and outside this Parliament is enormous frustration.
We need agreements on what the Commission has already proposed in relation to the legal framework for the management of legal immigration.
We do not need a lot more ideas: they are all on the table.
I am worried also because when we talk about new initiatives, we talk about somersaults.
Somersaults like the one the President of the Commission has communicated to us and which is entitled âEuropean fund for the return of immigrantsâ.
This leaves me entirely perplexed.
Can you explain to me the added value of action relating to the return of immigrants?
Can you explain to me what contribution will be made by a European fund which cannot be created at the moment by the Member States, who have full competence in the field of return?
Are you telling me that they cannot exercise these competences because they do not have sufficient money to do so and that we therefore need a European fund in order to implement the national competence of expelling citizens who are here illegally?
I really do not understand this.
I am however in agreement, and I think it is a good idea, with the common management of borders.
I do actually believe that we need to do something here, and I would be in favour of supporting the Commission's proposal.
I would like to end by saying that an element of border control relates to immigration and another which relates to crime, as you have said.
I am very much in favour of combating organised crime and I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether, in this field and within the field of justice and home affairs, you believe you will be able to implement the European arrest warrant before the date set, as planned by this House and the Council?
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that EU leaders will finally address the case for legal migration, although we have to be clear that numbers or quotas must be set at national level and not by Brussels.
The Council continues to focus mainly on keeping people out of Fortress Europe.
We still have no agreement on integrating legal immigrants, or on core aspects of a common asylum system; no agreement on making racism illegal in criminal law, and no agreement on fighting human trafficking through protection of victims and encouraging them to be witnesses.
For all the rhetoric, how many people-traffickers have actually been put behind bars?
The summit will look at all the proposals for developing new databases on EU and foreign citizens, including biometric identifiers.
This all raises big questions of privacy and civil liberties, but it has been done in secret and with no democratic control.
Finally, I hope leaders will rectify their shameful failure so far to act jointly to secure release or a fair trial in a civil court for the 25 Europeans in Guantanamo Bay.
We are meant to have a common foreign policy and a human rights policy.
So far, for those citizens in Guantanamo Bay, there is little to show for this.
I hope that will change at the summit.
Â Â  Mr President, the Brussels European Council should, in line with the Italian proposal, examine the idea of a programme of major works to stimulate growth.
In principle, we are in favour of these projects, which should focus not only on transport but also on the environment, telecommunications and research and development, as set out in the Franco-German initiative.
Indeed, we believe that these works should â in principle â eventually improve productivity in the internal market.
They should â also in principle â be eligible for part-funding by borrowing because they will benefit future generations, on the condition, however, that we do not allow debt to get out of control.
This, though, is where the problem lies.
We have serious doubts as to the ability attributed to these projects to stimulate growth.
First of all, of course, there will be delays in implementing the projects, but this is not the key issue.
The key issue is that their benefits will be impeded, or even cancelled out by the problems holding back growth in Europe and which have almost brought it back to zero.
There are first of all structural constraints, such as the reduction of the working week in France, which are not being corrected as rapidly as they should be.
We then have the phenomenon of industrial and agricultural relocation that is causing problems for Europe, a phenomenon that we have condemned since the Uruguay Round and which is now growing worse, with terrible consequences for growth and employment.
The third factor that is pushing us towards a situation of zero growth are the rigidities of monetary union, which admittedly provides some advantages, such as eliminating national currency fluctuations, but which also has disadvantages, such as eliminating a decentralised and flexible form of monetary management only to replace it with a centralised and uniform system.
Even in the context of the current system, we should at least try to conduct a more active currency policy that punishes our economy less.
In any event, Mr President, unless these three serious obstacles to growth are removed, major works will not stimulate growth and, even worse, will put us in debt for no good reason.
Â Â  â Mr President, the forthcoming European Council will be yet another step towards a Constitutional Treaty.
It is remarkable that the media always emphasise the differences of opinion between the governments, an issue completely unrelated to the true meaning of such a treaty for the EUâs own citizens.
It would be much better â as many are aware â to explain to the citizens that the object of the exercise is to guarantee the same level of legal protection for every EU citizen throughout the European Union, and that this is particularly achieved by including the Charter in the Treaty.
This is a fantastic achievement and it is worth pointing this out very clearly in the Treaty.
Everyone says that they are agreed on 90% of the result that is presently before us, but, in fact, too much notice is being taken of the 10%, which could not possibly be very important, especially since the Council is now clearly stating that there is consensus about the basic ideas.
This is what should characterise the publicity surrounding the Convention results.
In terms of our relations with the outside world, the drawing up of the Constitution is also extremely important, because no third country should be in any doubt about the fact that the European Union is an alliance of democratic constitutional states.
This fact cannot be altered and on this score, nothing should be overlooked.
We should say this emphatically to some Balkan countries, as we do to Turkey.
Needless to say, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much hopes that the structural reforms themselves will be assessed on the basis of a wide European outlook, taking into consideration the interests of all and the need for clarity for the sake of the citizens.
Let me make a small point about the appointment of Commissioners.
You often hear that every country should have its own Commissioner.
It seems to me a matter of extreme importance that we in this House should, at some point, spell out to the outside world that, as soon as we discover that a Commissioner has adopted a national stance, we then step in to remove them from their post.
Karel van Miert, from Belgium, once stated in his memoirs that the minute you are sworn in as Commissioner, you lose your nationality.
Whatever we decide with regard to appointing Commissioners, we should constantly bear this in mind: never and on no occasion should the impression be created that the appointment could be of a national nature.
There is a foreign policy issue about which I should like to say something.
Certain things are going extremely well, for example the police missions in Bosnia Herzegovina and in Macedonia, or the military action under the leadership of one of our Member States in Congo.
We also know, however, that major problems still exist elsewhere, for example in western Africa, where various fires are smouldering.
We as a civil superpower can play a preventive role in the countries where violence has not yet broken out.
Our role is then to damp down the fires in neighbouring areas.
I would in this connection mention Guinea-Bissau, which is in urgent need of assistance in the run-up to regular elections, which it now wants, and aid from Europe will certainly be needed.
I would thus invite the Council and the Commission to explore the possibilities for peaceful intervention to maintain peace in that country.
I hope that the Council will be characterised by responsibility and solidarity, and thereby give an enormous boost to public confidence in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have taken the floor again, very briefly, to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate, who have made an important contribution, at times critical but, as far as we are concerned, a valuable contribution in terms of proposals and guidelines for the tasks before us, both as regards the issues that will be addressed by next weekâs European Council as it seeks to find solutions to the issues that we have discussed, and also as regards the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am also very pleased to note that MrÂ Prodiâs report and the report that we have drawn up as the Presidents-in-Office of the European Council are in perfect harmony.
I hope that this presages excellent work, and good results.
I would like to conclude my brief reply by confirming the commitment given by the Italian Presidency to the European Parliament to report all the developments of the Intergovernmental Conference immediately and to confirm our willingness to take part in focused debates between the Council Presidency and Parliament, this also being a way of ensuring that the best possible results are achieved.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The propaganda-driven support for economic recovery for the Brussels summit is confined to means used a thousand times before: neo-Keynesian methods and âNew Dealâ type mini programmes which are now proven to be unable to bring about positive results for the workers and which increase exploitation, unemployment and poverty.
These measures merely safeguard contracts for the large companies and support the concentration of capital, especially when accompanied by measures to cut back the workers' employment and social rights.
Pension rights and pension funds are again in the line of fire and the generalisation of âflexibilityâ in employment and wage freezes are being promoted in the name of competitiveness and reducing labour costs.
Immigration and respect for human rights are also in the line of fire.
We are seeing coordinated measures to deport, extradite and âmove onâ immigrants, border guards on land and sea and other measures which offend human dignity and guarantee even greater exploitation of immigrants.
And all just a few days after the start of the Intergovernmental Conference which is being called upon to secure capitalism constitutionally, to redistribute power between the powerful and to cede even more national sovereignty to the Euro-unifying centre.
It is certain that the peoples will not remain inert in the face of the further intensification of the attack and will develop even further their fight to resist and counter attack.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the report (Î5-0313/2003) by Mrs Frassoni on the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement on âBetter Law-Makingâ between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and
- the second report (Î5-0235/2003) by Mr Medina Ortega on simplifying and improving Community legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, I have asked to divide my speech into two parts: one now, lasting three minutes, and another lasting two minutes, after the debate.
I would like to speak now about the interinstitutional agreement on âBetter Law-Makingâ.
This agreement was the result of difficult, lengthy negotiations in which we all asked ourselvesÂ âÂ Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but us, above all, I have to sayÂ âÂ if it would not be better quietly to give up, given the difficulty of trying to find any real advantages over the current situation.
First of all I would like to thank MrÂ Gargani, MrÂ Swoboda and MrÂ Clegg, with whom we had a good working relationship, as well as the technical group that negotiated with us, for, ultimately, a positive outcome was, in any case, achieved.
Therefore, if we are here to urge Parliament to support this agreement, it is because I believe thatÂ âÂ albeit minor, tentativeÂ âÂ progress has been made.
I would like to focus, in particular, on two issues that I feel are of particular significance: co-regulation and self-regulation.
Not so much because the results achieved were ground-breaking but because I believe that, if we use it properlyÂ âÂ particularly we in this HouseÂ âÂ this agreement will make it easier to combat an extremely worrying trend, which I am sorry to say the Commission and the Council seem to endorse, the trend towards alternative methods of regulation to legislation, and here I am referring, in particular, to what are known as voluntary agreements.
Recent experience in the field of road safety and CO2 in cars has shown us that the risks of not achieving objectives, in terms of effectiveness and enforcement across the board, which a normal law could have achieved, are very real where these voluntary agreements are used.
It is precisely in response to this potential danger that we have become extensively involved in this difficult debate, which included many other elements tooÂ âÂ as Members will be able to see if they read the text, there is also a lot of waffleÂ âÂ but, at least, on the issues of self-regulation and co-regulation, some minor progress has been achieved.
We must, however, fully admit to defeat in one area: we did not succeed in getting the right of call-back from the Commission âÂ the right to suspend the use of a voluntary agreement if we do not approve of it.
We are extremely disappointed about this because it was the CommissionÂ âÂ and this has to be saidÂ âÂ that did not want to step down on this point.
We have simply obtained a political willingness from the Commission to take unambiguous, clear opposition from Parliament into consideration.
If it is deemed necessary, it will, therefore, be up to Parliament to organise opposition to the voluntary agreement in order to force the Commission to recall it itself.
One last thing, MrÂ President: the difficulty that the Commission and the Council have in going further in this area seems to be exactly the same as that we encountered in the negotiations on comitology, which we hope has been overcome once and for all thanks to the agreements concluded by the Convention.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been dealing with this issue since the beginning of 2002.
We were responding to several Commission communications which raised the problem of the shortcomings in Community regulations.
I remember how, in conversation with a Spanish national legislator â a very experienced one, by the way â he told me that nobody could understand Community directives.
We do so much work on them and so many people are involved in their production: the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and so many others, that in the end we have a text which could be described as a âcamelâ, in other words, a horse designed by a committee.
And that is the real situation.
While we must recognise that the regulation is a little more appropriate, the directive, on the other hand, is a real disaster.
The Commissionâs natural concern was of course to improve this situation, a concern which the Council and Parliament also share.
Above all at a time when Parliament is increasing its legislative powers, it makes no sense for us to continue with this procedure for producing legislation.
At the same time, however, we in the Committee on Legal Affairs realised that, in order for the Commission's proposals to come to fruition, it would be necessary to provide a constitutional framework suited to this issue.
We raised this within the first points of the report, and then the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which had decided to produce a series of reports after debating the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs, realised the importance of the issue in terms of Parliamentâs institutional role and, on a very sound basis, accepted the report.
Meanwhile, we insisted on our conviction â and that of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well â that it was necessary to reach an interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions in order to prevent the respective institutions from being deprived of their powers.
I believe that the result of this exercise â during which the two different committees of Parliament, Legal Affairs and Constitutional Affairs, have dealt with the issue â has been positive.
I believe that the interinstitutional agreement reached is a good agreement and I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Frassoni, on the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the work she herself has done and also the good work done by President Gargani and many members of that interinstitutional working group â Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg â and we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are happy with the result.

This report for which I am rapporteur was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs before the interinstitutional agreement had been reached.
We therefore proposed a series of recommendations to the interinstitutional group on it.
Since the agreement has now been reached â and I believe that to a large extent our objectives have been achieved â I believe that the best option is for the report to be returned to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that we can, taking account of the actions included in the interinstitutional agreement, move forward on that basis.
I would insist, of course â and here I agree with MrsÂ Frassoni â that we must deal with the problems of self-regulation and co-regulation.
Because we are too happy to talk about civil society and then, when we talk about civil society here in the European Parliament and the European Union, we invite representatives from certain organisations, which somebody or other tells us are representative.
But in reality, in democratic systems, civil society is expressed by means of the electoral process.
The electoral process provides civil society with a formal means of expression, and the result of that electoral process is the legislative bodies, and it is they who have to adapt the general regulations.
The problem with self-regulation and co-regulation is that they represent a step backwards; they mean returning to the Middle Ages, when certain sectors produced rules which bound everybody.
In modern societies, these rules must come from society as a whole, by means of elected bodies, elected through perfectly formalised and guaranteed processes, which in this case means the European Parliament, the Council â insofar as the Council is made up of governments with elected leaders answerable to their national Parliaments â and also the Commission, insofar as it is elected by the Council and by the European Parliament.
I therefore have the impression that the interinstitutional agreement has placed certain restrictions, but we in this Parliament must continue to insist on the need, on the one hand, to improve the quality of Community legislation and, on the other, not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and not to give up the progress made in our Europe through the development of the liberal and democratic State, which ensures that decisions are made by legislative bodies elected by popular will.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament debate and vote this week represent an important phase in the final chapter of negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which has resulted in the interinstitutional agreement on âBetter Law-Makingâ.
The initiative that led to the current outcome began with the Commission communication on better regulation and its action plan simplifying and improving the regulatory environment, but it was the enthusiasm of the European Parliament and its President that drove the European Council, which met in Seville in June 2002, to urge the three institutions to adopt an interinstitutional agreement which sought to improve the quality of Community law and the conditions of its incorporation, including deadlines, into national legislation.
Our three institutions replied immediately to the request and opened negotiations.
First of all, the work was carried out in the High-Level Technical Group and, in the final stages, took place at political level.
The group of European correspondents undertook major preparatory work.
On behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks to those who played a part in the positive conclusion of the agreement: in particular, MrsÂ Frassoni, her colleague, MrÂ Medina Ortega, and MrÂ Gargani, MrÂ Swoboda and MrÂ Clegg, representatives of Parliament, as well as CommissionerÂ deÂ Palacio, who represented the Commission in the preparation of this work.
As for the Council, thanks are due to my predecessors of the Greek and Danish Presidencies.
The agreement seeks, as set down in paragraph 1, âto improve the quality of law-making by means of a series of initiatives and proceduresâ, which are detailed in the agreement itself.
I would like to point out, MrÂ President, that, in this agreement, our three institutions commit to ensuring better coordination, better communication and cooperation in carrying out their legislative responsibilities.
In it we recognise the importance of greater transparency and accessibility and we are addressing the issue of turning to co-regulation and to self-regulation.
We are renewing the commitment to improving the quality of legislation and to establishing procedures for pre-legislative consultation and impact assessment.
We would stress the need to improve the transposal of Community law into national legislation.
Finally, we are renewing our commitment to simplify and reduce the volume of legislation.
MrÂ President, tomorrow, the European Parliament is going to vote on adopting the interinstitutional agreement âBetter Law-Makingâ and the Commission will formalise its approval in subsequent days.
To complete the approval procedure, the General Affairs Council will adopt the decision to approve the agreement in next Mondayâs session.
It will be our task to ensure that the agreement is enforced faithfully and is fully adhered to.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for their contributions to the discussion on our initiatives in the field of âbetter law-makingâ.
I reserve particular thanks for Mrs Frassoni and Mr Medina Ortega.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the three institutions have concluded an interinstitutional agreement on âbetter law-makingâ.
This agreement clearly and broadly commits the three institutions to improving their working methodologies and the quality of law-making by means of a range of initiatives and procedures that it sets out.
Consequently, the interinstitutional agreement establishes a solid base for improving the culture of clarity and coherence in drawing up legislative texts and for improving the programming and transparency of the legislative process, whilst respecting the powers and procedures laid down in the Treaties, and the broad principles of democratic legitimacy, subsidiarity and proportionality and legal security.
The Commission finds the agreement to be extremely satisfactory.
First of all, it is coherent with the proposals we made in the âbetter law-makingâ action plan of June 2002.
The lines that we then defined are now confirmed.
Next, the agreement is well-balanced: it makes frequent references to the Commissionâs own commitments but also notes the commitments of Parliament and the Council concerning improving the quality of regulations.
In particular, it sets out provisions that complement the proposals contained in the action plan for the programming and transparency of legislative work.
The agreement also establishes a definition of a stable framework for using so-called alternative instruments, or , which are co-regulation and self-regulation.
The agreement will allow these instruments to be used and will prevent the multitude of problems encountered in the past when examining this type of measure on a case-by-case basis.
Lastly, we should note the progress that has been made and the commitments that have been given with regard to impact studies and to simplifying the , and transposing Community law-making and monitoring its implementation.
Now, of course, the greatest attention must be paid to ensuring that the agreement is implemented.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the interinstitutional agreement which we are talking about is the result of the negotiations within the high-level working party formed by representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council Presidency.
Together with Mr Swoboda, Mr Clegg and MrsÂ Frassoni, I feel that we must thank the High Level Technical Group which helped us in our work, but I would, of course, also like to mention the contribution made by the politicians to the outcome achieved: an agreement whichÂ âÂ although, as MrsÂ Frassoni said just now, it certainly fails to satisfy everybody in ParliamentÂ âÂ I believe is an extremely important compromise, which we must acknowledge this evening in this House.
We worked on the basis of the mandate given to us by the Conference of Presidents on 4Â July, and I believe I can say that we adhered firmly to this brief and to this will, which, together with the President of the European Parliament, we often witnessed in individual and delegation meetings.
The objectives set down in the mandate concerned adequate guarantees regarding Parliamentâs rights as a legislative authority, complete transparency during the legislative procedure and the choice of innovative solutions conducive to more effective and responsible law-making.
In short, Parliamentâs aim was to enhance democratic legitimacy and the quality of Community legislation, which is something I believe we all want.
Alongside the negotiations, the European Commission adopted a series of documents on simplifying and improving legislation, on which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market expressed its opinion by adopting MrÂ Medina Ortegaâs report, which you have just heard presented.
The draft interinstitutional agreement reasonably fulfils both the Conference of Presidentsâ mandate and the guidelines that are contained in MrÂ Ortegaâs report.
Furthermore, although we used the Treaty as a referenceÂ âÂ our reference was, of course, the TreatyÂ âÂ the agreement is in line with the draft Constitutional Treaty that was adopted by the Convention and which is being debated in the IGC.
I would like to mention briefly that we have resolved some extremely important issues: the legislative planning, coordination of legislative work between the institutions; the Council informing Parliament on both the annual and the multiannual draft strategic programme; the presence of the Council in committeesÂ âÂ in committees as well as in the House, of courseÂ âÂ which I feel is important for the exchange of views necessary for Parliamentâs work, the Commission commits to participate regularly in the work of the committees, preferably at ministerial level, but, in any case, at the highest level appropriate and at an accountable level.
As regards transparency, there is confirmation of the importance of informing the public about the progress of legislative work, as the Convention recognised to some extent; the choice of form for legislative acts, which the Convention also includes in the proportionality principle, while the monopoly of the right of initiative conferred on the CommissionÂ âÂ I want to make this clear to ParliamentÂ âÂ cannot give it exclusive responsibility for the choice of form for a legislative act.
ArticleÂ 12 lays down that the Commission must take into account recommendations from the other institutions; with regard to co-regulation, on the most sensitive issue of call-backÂ âÂ to which MrsÂ Frassoni attaches great importanceÂ âÂ I would point out that Parliament has already adopted the Wallis report to this end; I believe that we have made great progress in this area, as well as in terms of self-regulation, control and giving economic operators and the social partners the possibility of adopting guidelines in this field; the issue of comitology, impact assessment, timeframes for implementation and transposal.
I cannot dwell on this any further but I would like to say, in conclusion, that we made sure that the agreement did not jeopardise the future role of Parliament, as MrÂ Cox has told us at each stage.
Not only have we not compromised Parliamentâs role, but I believe that we have enhanced the European ParliamentÂ âÂ and this is an important fact that remains in this term of officeÂ âÂ as a legislative body in the interinstitutional balance of powers and in the interinstitutional agreement.
Â Â  â Mr President, better legislation is high on the European agenda.
Legislation must improve and become more transparent, and that is a task for the Commission, Parliament and Member States alike.
I believe that the interinstitutional agreement concluded in June is a sign that the Commission, Parliament and the Council are aware of this responsibility.
Better legislation is essential for an internal market that functions at its best.
Only if citizens and businesses are fully aware of their rights and duties can the internal market function well.
European legislation must be readable and not cause any unnecessary red tape.
If we as Europe want to become the world's most competitive economy, then we need to ensure at the very least that we can leave behind the unnecessary bureaucracy.
It is therefore very gratifying that in 2002, the Commission published a whole series of documents that examine the possibilities of better legislation, but it is important that both the Council and Parliament should remain actively involved in achieving it.
Improvements in legislation call for very concrete measures, and so I regret the somewhat vague wording in which the Commission has postulated its policy to improve European legislation.
If the European Union does not want to be constantly faced with the need for improving its legislation, it is important for Community law to be given a thorough overhaul from here on in, to ensure that qualitatively sound legislation is introduced.
A crucial element in the establishment of better legislation is the analysis of legislation for the financial and administrative implications by means of an impact assessment.
Citizens and businesses are still being weighed down by a much too heavy administrative burden.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have called for the introduction of the business impact assessment for a long time.
It is, however, important for this impact assessment to be carried out by an independent body.
The impact assessment proposed by the Commission, which is to be carried out by the same officials who drafted the legislation, has already prompted me to refer to Baron von MÃŒnchhausen, who tried to drag himself out of the swamp by his own hair.
As rapporteur for the European impact assessment, I will also certainly opt for an approach that tends towards an independent assessment.
As well as establishing better legislation, it is at least equally important to determine the alternatives to legislation.
Reducing the administrative burden also means placing more emphasis on the use of non-legislative instruments, such as agreements with social partners and self-regulating mechanisms.
It is my conviction that these regulations have an important complementary character with regard to existing Community legislation.
Apart from carefully examining alternatives for European legislation, it is also important for the implementation of legislation and national legislation by the Member States to be carried out more effectively and monitored closely.
One remark to finish off; after this plenary debate, the Medina-Ortega Report will be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where it will be adapted to the interinstitutional agreement.
I unreservedly endorse this course of action.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the desire of each and every party to defend its own position means that it is not an easy matter for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to set about rearranging their relationship.
Nor is it easy for a parliament to express its willingness to surrender part of its legislative competence.
It is relatively easy if this surrender is coupled with a call-back-position, that is, with the right of recall should it become apparent that the implementing or secondary legislation does not reflect the objectives and intentions of the legislator, that is, of Parliament.
That is why we concentrated on this issue and the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, is one among the many who have pointed out its importance; Mr Medina Ortega, too, has pointed out that, at the end of the day, the Members of this House are elected to pass laws.
They are not elected to be spectators or observers at a trial, but to be legislators, and that is what the public expect us to do.
We must, however, bear in mind that we do not possess the expert knowledge that some institutions or groups have, and such expertise needs to be used â by which I mean not only the giving of advice, but also having the opportunity to co-determine implementing legislation on the basis of laws passed by this House.
I would like, though, to re-emphasise the importance of having the facility of right of recall, and that is something we have achieved.
Much in the same way as with self-regulation, it was evident to us from the outset that we neither want nor are able to prevent it, but it must be clear that self-regulation must not nullify this Houseâs legislative competence, but, as Mrs Frassoni has made very clear, we must be firm in taking action to deal with any threat to curtail our legislative competence.
At the end of the day, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, is obliged to take appropriate action.
Many other things are important, including improvements to the mutual information requirements, and to the information given to the European public.
The Commission and the Council took it in turns to put up a great deal of resistance to Parliamentâs demands in this area, especially where the call-back position is concerned, but we got our way in the end.
The Commission and the Council had probably not reckoned on what I might call an unbeatable team working on this, chaired by Mr Gargani, whose composure was impregnable; Mr Clegg, whose actions were characterised by British reserve, but were nonetheless effective; and Mrs Frassoni, whose combination of toughness and charm was vital in softening up somewhat the Vice-Presidents of the Commission, something that we know is not exactly easy.
That being so, I believe that we have come up with a very good solution.
I recommend that the House bear this in mind and adopt the Frassoni report accordingly.
Â Â  Mr President, as was mentioned before, this is indeed a welcome agreement.
I much enjoyed working with my colleagues, Mr Gargani, MsÂ Frassoni, Mr Swoboda and other colleagues in the Council and Parliament, even though it was a painfully protracted process.
We arrived at an agreement which is a lot better than many of us expected at the beginning.
As has been said by a number of speakers, it is not a perfect agreement.
No agreement is perfect.
It is a bit of a mixed bag.
As Monica Frassoni said, there is a bit of 'blah blah'; there are some slightly vacuous passages, but there are also some incredibly important procedural advances.
For a minute or two I should like to focus, if I may, on what happens next.
There is no point in reaching this agreement on paper after all these months of protracted talks if we do not transform the advances we agreed upon into a practical effect as soon as possible.
I should like to emphasise two aspects where I think we need to look for follow-up as soon as possible.
Firstly, paragraph 36 of the agreement says that 'within six months of the date upon which this Agreement comes into force, the European Parliament and the Council, whose task it would be as legislative authority to adopt at the final stage the proposals for simplified acts, need to modify their working methods by introducing, for example, ad hoc structures with the specific task of simplifying legislation.'
That is a very important objective and it will be quite tricky to achieve.
I urge both Parliament and our colleagues in the Council to make sure that the deadline of achieving the process of simplification is indeed met within the six months specified here.
I should also like to refer you to paragraph 30.
It deals with something that everyone knows is close to my heart, which is the advance I hope we will make in conducting impact assessments across all three institutions.
The text says 'As soon as possible after this Agreement is adopted, the three Institutions will carry out an assessment of their respective experiences and will consider the possibility of establishing a common methodology'.
Monica Frassoni's commentary on this agreement is absolutely outstanding in its clarity and fairness except in one respect, where I think she is a little negative about the potential of reaching agreement on impact assessments.
My own feeling is that there is simply no way that we will achieve the general principles referred to in the common objectives in the agreement - namely legal certainty, the promotion of simplicity, clarity and consistency in the drafting of laws - if we do not make rapid progress â as called for in paragraph 25 â in establishing a common methodology to have environmental, social and economic impact assessments, not only attached to draft proposals from the Commission, but also in significant amendments tabled by ourselves and by the Council of Ministers.
I hope that there will be some sense of urgency over the next few months to achieve real, practical progress on the back of the agreement, and especially on these two important objectives of simplification and impact assessments.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to pay a compliment to the four speakers before me in the debate who took part in the negotiations on this interinstitutional agreement and particularly to commend, as Nick Clegg did, Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement to the House.
However, I want to slightly disagree with some of the points that have just been made.
When we talk about better legislation, it seems to me that suddenly there descends upon this 21st Century parliament the feel that the late-18th Century Beccaria and Bentham walk the stage with us.
Legislation is a science which can be improved, because we all know what the good of the human condition is and all we have to do is devise technical means to achieve it.
We know, as Mr Medina Ortega has just said, that this is not, in fact, the case.
The duties of the members of a democratic legislature are not to seek a single institutional view.
The judges of the members of a democratic legislature are to address the dialectic of contemporary politics, to express the points upon which we disagree and not the points upon which we agree.
Out of disagreement or debate comes perhaps, in the end, wisdom and decision, but we do not start out on the assumption that there is one right answer and it is a technical question of how to achieve it.
Nor can we reasonably start out from the assumption that impact assessment is easy.
We have 'legislation missiles' which make impact as they land and through that we can tell what the impact is.
Everybody who has studied the sociology of law is well aware that this is not true.
What legislation has actually brought about remains controversial for years after it has been passed.
There are many strands in the effects of legislation.
We do not even always agree on the juridical impact, far less the economic impact of legislation.
A week or so ago, we had a huge argument about the Copyright Directive because people were not sure, not about the cost, but what it would actually mean in its implications before the courts of law.
Legal certainty is a myth and an illusion.
The most that good legislators can do is diminish legal uncertainty and we should approach our task with due modesty in that regard.
That brings me back to the point about subsidiarity which matters to us all greatly.
Impact assessment taken on the grand scale seems to suppose that all law impacts equally and in the same way on all parts of this vast and diverse Union.
What an absurd view.
It is not true.
Every time you look at a real case, you find that it impacts differently in different places.
This is what makes subsidiarity so important.
I strongly commend Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement.
I shall vote for it, but I express some doubts about the underlying suppositions of this debate.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one theme of our joint debate today is a very important one, the quality of European lawmaking.
One improvement to it is to be in the form of an institutional agreement between the three institutions; as for the other, the Commission, starting with the White Paper âEuropean Governanceâ at the end of 2001, has produced to date no fewer than sixteen comprehensive documents in the form of communications and reports on âEuropean Governance and better lawmakingâ.
Some of these documents constitute a sort of undertaking on the part of the Commission in respect of its own work, and that is laudable.
Others touch directly on Parliamentâs rights as laid down in the Treaties, such as, for example, the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, termed comitology procedures, or statements on the creation of new legal instruments, such as, for example, open coordination, self-regulation, co-regulation and similar. The new interinstitutional agreement is meant to be a sort of undertaking on the part of the three institutions to lay down the use of these instruments, which has never before been specified in any of the Treaties.
Although our counterparts have done important work, and despite my gratitude to them for doing so and thus enabling themselves to really get to grips with these issues, I have to say that I am less happy about our entering into another obligation, as anyone reading the text of this interinstitutional agreement could only wonder what added value would thereby accrue to Parliament over and above its rights as laid down in the Treaties.
I do not think that will amount to very much; worse still, by signing up to this agreement only a few days after the ceremonial opening of the IGC, which will also deal with this topic, and without being constrained to do so, we in this House are binding ourselves in chains and, indeed, renouncing the full use of the parliamentary prerogatives that it has taken two laborious decades to secure for ourselves.
The only way Parliament has, in the past, been able to progressively extend its influence in the teeth of the Commission and the Council has been by making the utmost use of the rights accorded it by the Treaties.
By signing up to interinstitutional agreements of this sort and concluding agreements with the Commission, as we did with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are ourselves again curtailing our own rights, thus, as I see it, putting everything completely the wrong way around.
The quality of European lawmaking is so important an issue that we should not treat it lightly.
Those on the receiving end â by which I mean the public to whom legislation applies, the Member States, which have to transpose it and all involved in implementing it at every level â suffer when laws are bad, and so we should stop churning out loads of paper through all the institutions and instead put it to the test by submitting and enacting laws that really are better.
That is in our hands as Members of this House.
Today, the eighth day of October, sees this House, by means of the Medina Ortega report, making a second attempt at stating its position on a Commission communication on simplified and improved regulation dating back to December 2001, since which date, three summit meetings of Heads of State or Government have given their attention to the issue without Parliament having been in a position to respond and thereby make its influence felt.
Producing more paper in this way sets a bad example, when we should, instead, be supporting the Commission in reducing the amount of EU legislation, which now amounts to some 97Â 000 pages, and in cleaning it all up.
That, too, would help the quality of European legislation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Medina Ortega.
For me, better legislation means European governance that is more democratic, achieves more for its citizens and becomes more comprehensible for everyone â a more efficient, more democratic, more transparent Europe.
That was the Conventionâs key objective in drafting the constitution.
Some Heads of Government were at risk this weekend of slipping back into their old power and money games, thereby, in actual fact, overlooking what the European public actually wants.
Fortunately, we are able â and this is also topic of discussion here â to do a great deal within the parameters of the European Treaties.
In the White Paper on âEuropean governanceâ, the Commission has tabled a large number of proposals for better governance, of which improvements in the legislative process formed an important part.
This is an area in which we have made some real progress.
The Commission has meanwhile tabled various proposals in this framework, including the programme for consolidation, codification and simplification of legislation, which will reduce the volume of legislation by no fewer than 35Â 000 pages.
This should, for a change, get a mention in the papers.
In the area of legislation, however, the co-legislators â Parliament and the Council â should be given a central role.
The Commission made an unfortunate start, but later decided on an agreement with Parliament and the Council, which culminated in the interinstitutional agreement.
It gives plenty of scope for a swifter, simpler European approach in areas such as environment and social policy.
If, however, the results are not satisfactory, Parliament can intervene and claim, and indeed exercise, its right as co-legislator.
In my view, the Commission and the Council have been far too slow to concede this, and they are still showing far too little generosity.
After all, there is no real democracy without Parliament.
Nobody needs a technocratic power governing above and without the European people.
What we do need is a drastic approach to tackle excessively lengthy procedures, the lack of results and the overall transparency deficit.
In this House, Mr van Doorn tabled a proposal for a bureaucracy test of some kind, an independent assessment.
I rather like the concept, provided that the information we gain from this eventually ends up with us as co-legislators.
In the final analysis, decisions must, of course, be taken by us in unison, together with the Council, and that is, of course, at the heart of the struggle we are having here, so I hope that the Commission is prepared to deliver on the agreements.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very pleased that we are moving forward in terms of better lawmaking.
As a pro-European I find it extremely frustrating that we bring forward legislation in this place that is not properly thought through and that not only damages this Parliament: it also damages our credibility.
We also need to look at current legislation to see whether it is being implemented across each Member State.
If it is not being implemented, is this because it is unworkable?
If it is unworkable, why do we not just repeal that legislation, instead of simply bringing forward further legislation in the same field, as we appear to do at the moment.
We also have to look at whether it is really necessary at European level in all cases.
If it is necessary then we have to go for comprehensive impact assessment, based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence in some areas where it is applicable, such as health and safety legislation in the employment and social affairs field.
We must also take into account the situation in each Member State.
The accuracy of impact assessments really must be improved â I must say that I do not believe that they are very good at the moment.
They must also be available at a very early stage so that we can have genuine consultation.
That consultation should include the actual instrument which is most appropriate for that specific subject area.
All the outcomes and all the contributions should be put into the public domain.
I am very pleased that MrÂ Medina Ortega has agreed to refer back his motion.
It is right that he should do that.
I congratulate him on all the work that he has done but his motion has, of course, been superseded by the interinstitutional agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, I largely support the reports before us on better regulation and the interinstitutional agreement, and indeed their objectives: to secure a reliable, up-to-date and user-friendly body of law to benefit all our citizens, workers and businesses.
This will involve removing the 'dead wood' â the obsolete or outdated texts â which should result in decreasing the volume of the without affecting legal status.
There is a need to improve presentation and ensure user-friendly access to a Community body of law, the modernisation and simplification of existing legislation and policies have to be phased in.
However, the task should not be underestimated.
The Single Market is one of our great success stories, but the sheer volume of legislation spawned by the Single Market to ensure harmonisation of Member State procedures is daunting.
Amendments, originating in any of the official languages and then translated into all of the others, often leave the finished product â when it is translated back into all of the official languages â turgid, pedantic and generally cumbersome and uncomfortable to the native eye.
Yes, the legal status is intact, but the text is not user-friendly.
Our addiction to acronyms has spawned a new language: Eurospeak.
After six months in any of the Institutions, we are all using it, further isolating ourselves and our work from 'Joe and Mary Citizen'.
Cocobu, CFSP â or is it PESC? â Coreper, and the latest is GARC, which I think stands for the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
In short, our texts need urgent detoxification from this addiction.
Impact assessment is a particular area of current interest for my country, Ireland.
Our specific interest is in developing a means of competitiveness-proofing for EU legislative measures, to ensure that the EU strategy is one that stimulates economic growth in order to meet the Lisbon 2010 objectives.
We would like to achieve real progress in the development and use of impact assessment to underpin competitiveness.
The text of paragraph 30 of the interinstitutional agreement is inspired by the proposal in Mr Medina Ortega's report to have the possibility of impact assessments on codecision legislation, prior to the adoption of any substantive amendment, either at first reading or at the conciliation stage on the basis of jointly-defined criteria and procedures.
I will not hold my breath, Mr President.
For the record, the Commission's own integrated impact assessment procedure is in its infancy.
For 2003, the Commission identified 44 proposals for so-called extended impact assessment.
It seems however, that only four were completed.
I should like the Commission to comment on this, please.
The expected legislative proposals on chemicals not included in the 44 originally identified, but assessed now in response to political and other pressure, will be the first real, extensive impact assessment carried out on a draft proposal.
Only then perhaps will its usefulness become apparent.
In conclusion, to use the Commissioner's own words, there is a solid basis here, but perhaps it is a wish-list.
Let us hope it is the former.
Â Â  Mr President, as we all know, the Commission has been preoccupied with the question of better governance of this Community model which is called the European Union for years now.
Part of this strategy is to simplify and improve law-making.
These issues have been monitored for a long time by the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, which is why his rich experience of the lacunae, malfunctions and weaknesses in law-making are crystallised in his report.
His proposals cover all stages of law-making, from the preparatory work for legislation, the drafting procedures and how the content is worded, to the stage in which legislation is applied by the Member States.
As time is short, I shall comment on three of the basic overall problems which arise.
The first is of a purely political nature and concerns the permanent clash between the bureaucracy of each administrative mechanism and, consequently, between the corresponding mechanism of the European Commission, which considers that efficiency is a technical matter, thus undermining the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is the only principle which can lend credibility to any legislative text.
If, therefore, we want real reform in law-making, the Commission will need to take suitable initiatives and to set an example which will give absolute priority to democratic legitimacy and to safeguarding the balance between the institutions.
Secondly, from the moment when particular importance is attached, and rightly so in my opinion, to the quality and transparency of the numerous consultations needed to promote a legislative proposal, the minimum consultation specifications proposed should include the representativeness of the social agencies participating by setting strict criteria of representativeness and the procedure for regular revision of the list of representative organisations.
Representativeness is not a vested right of any agency and must be confirmed gradually.
And finally, the Commission communication, which quite rightly makes proposals on improving how legislative texts are incorporated in the Member States but which, although there are also proposals in the reports relating to the application of the law, does not take account of these proposals.
If it at least respected democratic legitimacy, it should be consulting Parliament on why it is not taking account of these proposals.
Â Â  Mr President, as colleagues have already commented this evening, these are very important reports because lawmaking is arguably the most important part of government and it defines, in many ways, the fundamental character of any system of governance.
I have been in and out of this Parliament now for almost 15 years, and throughout that period there have been reports about the subject matter that we are discussing this evening.
What I am not sure about is whether, over that period, legislation has improved or worsened.
But I am sure that there is much more political interest in, and debate about, this subject now than there was in my earlier days.
That, I am sure, is something of a move in the right direction.
Nevertheless, the proof of the pudding is in the eating - as we say in Britain.
It is not what the Commission, or the Council, or the Parliament that matters: it is what we that counts.
What, therefore, are the crucial points?
The first is, of course, democracy.
All procedures for government, whether administration or legislation, must be underpinned by the ballot box.
Those who take decisions in these areas must be answerable and accountable for what they do.
Finally, the systems in which they work must be transparent.
Secondly, all this must take place in the framework of a rule of law.
Where abuse occurs, there must be available legal redress administered by an independent judiciary.
This can take place in a whole variety of areas: whether there is a failure to transpose, or whether something takes place as a result of improper procedures.
To pick up on a point that Mr Medina Ortega made, the areas where self-regulation is in place must in turn operate under the rule of law.
Thirdly, there is that frequently banded-about word âsubsidiarityâ.
We should not be doing at European level what should in fact be done at a national level, however exactly you define that.
Fourthly there is proportionality.
Any legislation that we draw up must be proportionate to the abuse or the mischief which it is intended to address.
In this context, while I commend the proposals of the Mandelkern Report, we must be careful that the impact assessments do not themselves turn into an additional bureaucratic hurdle in the legislative process.
Finally, of course, there is a need for clarity.
All I can say is, as an Englishman, that an awful lot of the English that is produced in Brussels is not recognised as such by my fellow countrymen.
We should lead by example.
Do we actually improve legislation as it passes through this House?
I think the truthful answer is that âsometimes we doâ, when in fact the answer should be âalwaysâ.
We should begin by putting our own house in order.
Â Â  Mr President, there are many aspects to this debate: better drafting, wider consultation and so on, and we are making progress on a number of these.
However, the issue I would like to address is what I would call 'horizontal subsidiarity', it is not vertical subsidiarity that Lord Inglewood just addressed in his comments about the level of government - European, national or regional.
It is about whether or not you should legislate, whether you should leave it to self-regulation, co-regulation or no regulation at all.
There too we need a hierarchy; we need an onus to prove the need to intervene.
It may be that you do not need to regulate in certain matters or on certain subjects.
If you do, it may be that self-regulation is enough, and if that is not enough, that co-regulation is enough.
However, when it is not enough â and only when it is not enough â then we should intervene and adopt legislation.
The question is, as with vertical subsidiarity, who decides?
It is right that the legislative authority should decide.
Those who are accountable to the population as a whole, rather than to certain sectoral interests, should take that decision in the first place.
That is why I welcome the interinstitutional agreement and the Frassoni report â and I congratulate Mrs Frassoni on her report.
This interinstitutional agreement does not contain an enormous amount, but it does contain recognition that to co-regulate you first need authorisation from the legislative authority.
That is a very important principle and is something we have achieved in this interinstitutional agreement.
I should just like to add a word about interinstitutional agreements in general.
We now have a large number of them, many of them overlap, some repeat the same subjects using different wording.
We will soon have to come back and codify and simplify the various interinstitutional agreements that we have into a single, clear, concise text.
It is one of the first things we should return to once we have settled the issue, hopefully soon, of adopting our new European Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, I also welcome the fact that we have now reached the point with this inter-institutional agreement that we can begin to make good on our commitment to deliver better and simpler legislation.
I would also like to congratulate the team of negotiators and indeed our rapporteurs.
If we get it right, good clear simple legislation could mean fewer infringement cases in the European Court of Justice, it could also result in laws which are easier to enforce in our Member States.
I believe that consumers and citizens need to know what redress they can expect from EU law, and businesses need to be clear about standards and practices they must aspire to, in order to implement EU law.
Yes, regulatory impact assessments may be a technical tool, but they are a vital tool in both involving more stake-holders and providing for checks and balances on the executive, improving both the quality of debate in this House and our ability to call the executive to account.
We can also use impact assessments to evaluate the benefits of proposed legislation and equally to look at where co-regulation, self-regulation or soft- law can be useful tools.
I know some of my colleagues are concerned that soft-law options would undermine or take away Parliaments prerogative as a legislator.
I accept that there are cultural differences between Member States on this issue, but we also have to accept that sometimes legislation can be inflexible and difficult to change whereas codes of conduct can have effect more quickly, particularly in unfair business practices.
Of course, Mr MacCormick is right that legislation is about politics.
It is not just a scientific exercise of impact assessments.
For that reason this Parliament and its elected politicians will always be an essential part of the legislative process.
I also agree that callback is an essential part of that right of scrutiny.
We should give our support to the better legislation agenda but Parliament will need more resources and powers to be able to respond to and evaluate impact assessments and use these regulatory procedures to call Commission and Council to account.
The better regulation agenda will require a change of culture, power and responsibility in all our institutions.
It should not be to the detriment of Parliament; in fact it should strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of future legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, I asked to speak again after the debate because I was very interested in hearing what the Council and the Commission had to say.
Now I have heard them, and their speeches have confirmed for me that, if we want this agreement not to remain an empty vision, then it will depend exclusively on the European Parliamentâs ability to ensure that it is respected and that it enters into the practice of our institution.
During this debate, exactly as was the case during the negotiations, we encountered a certain inflexibility on the need to ensure that, where alternative methods to legislation are concerned, there should be a legislator and, for the European Parliament, in particular, the possibility of evaluating how they work and if necessary, of rejecting them.
MrsÂ McCarthy, the problem is not the cultural difference, which can certainly exist between us regarding voluntary agreements; the problem lies in the fact that, when the voluntary agreements do not work, then we must, as the legislative authority, have the right to recall them, and this, I am sorry to say, is partially possible but only if we fight long and hard to get it.
MrÂ President, I would like to speak briefly about the issue of impact assessment.
MrÂ Clegg, who was part of our negotiating team, is right: at a certain point, we stopped insisting on this issue, not least because Parliament may well not yet be ready to act united on this question.
Impact assessment remains, I would stress, a highly political issue, on which we even risked losing some of our prerogatives during the negotiations, binding ourselves too rigidly to an obligation to complete an impact assessment which, in practice, we are still not technically in a position to do.
Furthermore, I believe that the Commissionâs approach to this issue varies enormously.
For some matters, indeed, the assessment is carried out and is seen as important, whilst for other matters it is completely abandoned.
In relation to this, I would like to give the example of the famous Van Miert list on trans-European networks, where the Commission has completely abandoned the idea of any type of impact assessment for this important measure.
I repeat: impact assessment remains an issue that this interinstitutional agreement has not succeeded in closing, and I think that we must be aware of this act responsibly for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, I should just like to say that the procedure whereby the rapporteur comes back again and replies at the end of the debate is an excellent innovation.
I congratulate you and Mrs Frassoni for organising the previous debate in this way.
Â Â  I found the agenda already prepared, so I will communicate your congratulations to the person who deserves them.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0294/2003) by Mr Bodrato, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Green Paper on European space policy (COM(2003) 17 - C5-0209/2003 - 2003/2092(INI)).
Â Â  Mr President, the Green Paper presented by CommissonerÂ Busquin, which Parliament particularly welcomed, once again put forward the strategic importance of space policy for the independence, safety and economic growth of a Europe that wants to remain at the forefront of scientific research and technological innovation.
In recent months, a turning point was reached with the constitutional Convention, which gave space policy a specific role, thus representing a legal base for Community programmes and consolidating the strategy begun with the extraordinary success of the Galileo programme.
Nevertheless, we must not disregard the fact that the Commission has also given a specific response to the unprecedented crisis that has struck the space sector, specifically launchers, undermining the activity of many industries and accentuating distortions of the world market.
The space assetis crucial to the concentration of professional expertise, research and technology, which characterise the development of the knowledge-based economy.
It is a resource that cannot be wasted and the Commission and the European Space Agency Council have shown that they are fully aware of this.
Parliamentâs report stresses the role of the ESA and national agencies, and expresses its satisfaction with the framework agreement, which the European Community and the ESA supported and Parliament strongly pressed for.
This framework agreement confirms the unique role of the ESA in organising research and technological and industrial development.
This role must be specified in a European space programme that redefines the responsibilities of the Commission in the face of public demand and new initiatives that call for political representativeness and a specific institutional competence.
Giving Europe a role as leader on the international stage, involving all the EU countries is not incompatible with the firm belief that international cooperation is necessary: cooperation, in the first instance, with the United StatesÂ âÂ thinking here of the International Space stationÂ âÂ but also with other countries, including Russia, Japan and China itself.
We must, however, be aware that the quality of international agreementsÂ âÂ in particular those relating to spaceÂ âÂ depends on the quality of scientific, industrial and also financial support.
Europeâs goals have to be supported by public resources, as is the case across the world, and by more active organisation of common policies in fields such as agriculture, telecommunications, the environment and transport.
We need to give stimulus to private initiatives, as is the case with Galileo, but we need to take note that the objective of doubling the space budget in ten years will only go part way towards bridging the gap with the United States.
Space science has played a pioneering role.
The quality of human resources and basic research, however, warrants greater attention.
The future of the European Space policy depends on this being given.
This is why we believe that the next framework programme for research should dedicate more funding to the space sector, guaranteeing a quota in this field for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are becoming an indispensable support for new innovative enterprises.
My final point concerns the Conventionâs guideline for an arms agency that is open to all the Member States, according to the structured cooperation method.
This guideline can help to implement the industrial and technological asset.
This is notÂ âÂ and we need to make this clearÂ âÂ about militarising space, but rather about recognising that this is about twofold activities, both military and civil, as well as a strategy for European security that cannot be abandoned because of the temptations of US unilateralism.
To avoid misinterpretations, the report refers to the United Nations resolution on prevention of an arms race in outer space and to the Convention itself, which proposes to promote peace and to contribute to security and sustainable development on earth.
We are now looking forward to the White Paper, after discussing the Green Paper.
Our expectations are based on the positive opinions that we have expressed thus far and they are, we believe, the expectations of the scientific world and the European industrial world too.
Â Â  . â Mr President, MrÂ Bodrato, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to thank Mr Bodrato and the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for the quality of their report and for their constructive proposals.
This once again demonstrates Parliamentâs commitment to and support of space.
The consultation on the Green Paper provided the opportunity for a very open debate on the future of space exploration in Europe and to examine many contributions from all sectors.
On this basis, we are now committed to preparing the White Paper on the medium and long-term objectives for European Space policy, as Parliament asked of the Commission in January 2002.
Some crucial points of convergence have materialised.
The first is that Europe needs a high-level space policy that is independent and ongoing.
The second point is the acknowledgement that our space industry is structurally vulnerable.
As you have pointed out, we did have problems where launchers are concerned, and a decision by the ESA Council helped us to find a solution, albeit one which will only be useful in the short- and medium-term.
We must now find a more structural solution.
Lastly, it is crucial that we take a closer interest in the space telecommunications sector in order to increase demand and to maintain skills in our industry.
My third and last point concerns the European Unionâs new responsibilities in space-related matters.
In the Unionâs new political context, the approaches of the European Space Agency and of the national space agencies must be combined into a joint vision that will create a genuine space policy at European level.
To this end, I welcome the agreement reached between the ESA and the EU at the Council of 22 September: this is a crucial step.
By the same token, a space policy must be a horizontal Union policy, which serves other policies too.
It would set out strategy and would contain the guidelines that would help to ensure a coherent European space effort.
It should cover not only the civilian domain but also aspects of security and defence.
Formulating such a policy would, of course, require a clear legal base in the future Treaty and this is the intention of the Convention proposal seeking to grant the Union competences in the domain of space that it would share with the Member States.
The Commission, like Parliament, hopes that this proposal will be accepted without amendment at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am obliged to Mr Busquin, who knows that I have for a number of years had a particular interest in Galileo, which has become very dear to me.
Yet I am constantly being asked what Europe is really looking for in space, and why Europe should spend money on space when there are other problems on Earth that are so pressing and in need of high levels of funding.
So, although I do not expect this issue to meet with either rejoicing or unqualified approval, my firm conviction, which I know to be shared by many of my fellow-MEPs, is that space is of strategic importance for Europe and for the European economy.
Thanks to new technologies, it provides new opportunities.
It provides jobs for our engineers and prospects for the future.
Europe must not be satisfied with technological achievements that are less than first-class, and Europe is capable of them.
It is a matter of fact rather than a secret that space policy is one of the core issues for the twenty-first century.
Our everyday lives are already being shaped by the most varied applications made possible by space and the satellites we have put into it, behind which lies technological know-how that needs to be nurtured.
We, in Europe, have valuable resources, by which I mean not only engineers and technicians, but also research establishments and enterprises.
These give rise to innovations, but, as I keep being told, and as I have heard this afternoon, researchers and brainpower go where more is on offer, not only financially, but also in terms of technology.
That, Commissioner Busquin, is why I believe there to be an urgent need for real efforts to be made towards a coherent European space policy, as you have so aptly described it.
Europe must become aware of where it stands and of what opportunities it has.
No longer must we make declarations; now is the time for us to at last take action.
Europe must also be willing to invest, and, while there is no doubt that this can sometimes be a painful business, the space sector is not only highly cost-intensive, but also highly competitive.
Let us then take up this challenge!
Without decisiveness and commitment, Europe will lose independent access to space, and will also lose out when it comes to the applications resulting from it.
Commissioner Busquin, I share your view of the dangers of dependence on others, and so I welcome the Commissionâs Green Paper on European space policy and Mr Bodratoâs detailed and stimulating report.
Europe needs a political signal to begin a new chapter in space travel, and I hope that we will, by a clear resolution tomorrow, help to give European space travel the right impetus!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Guido Bodrato, for the remarkable work he has done and for the ability he has demonstrated to listen to divergent opinions and to reconcile them.
I believe that this is an altogether remarkable document.
This report is particularly exciting because it comes at the end of what has been a historical period for space, thanks in particular to the crucial boost given by MrÂ PhilippeÂ Busquin and his staff.
Indeed, for the first time, Europe is outlining something other than a policy to regulate competition and the internal market. It is drawing up a genuinely proactive industrial and technological policy which I hope will reassure all those who sometimes doubt whether Europe provides any real benefit.
Europe has achieved these results firstly through Galileo, which has given us the opportunity to create the first European mixed investment company, in other words, a joint company that will support an industrial and technological project.
It has also done so by laying the foundations, with the help of the Green Paper, of a space policy that acknowledges that space is a major technology by dint of the importance of its applications in all spheres, including the civilian; a policy that acknowledges the need for proactive political support; a policy that recognises the need to uphold our independence with regard to the emerging powers. This is a point of which CommissionerÂ Busquin has reminded us and one that we feel is extremely important.
At the same time, we must remain open to the world because, in the background, extremely fruitful cooperation is taking place with the USA, with Russia, over the Soyuz system at Kourou and with China over Galileo. In other words, space is entering a new era: an era of growing influence for the European Union as a space power that can act completely independently of the worldâs superpowers against the backdrop of a crisis, in particular the crisis besetting public budgets.
We now need to follow the direction set out in the White Paper.
I personally hope that relations between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Union improve.
We need the ESA and its skills, but we also need the Union and its political support if we are going to be able to speak with a single voice in the first division.
I also wish to see institutional consolidation within the Commission.
Because the Treaty provides for space competence to be shared at European level, the Commission will have to ensure that full use is made of this competence.
In this regard, I wish to express my attachment to the framework programmes for research and development and for the âaeronautical-space lineâ, which appears for the first time in the sixth FPRD.
I am also committed to developing a culture of programmes and the capacity to launch sectoral European programmes through the other Commission services.
Having said that, I am thinking in particular of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) for the environment and of the follow-ups to Lisbon for education.
In other words, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Busquin and Mr Bodrato and say that this is a fine example of a dossier in which Europe can do most when it moves ahead with political will.
I offer my best wishes for success and continuity for what we have managed to achieve together in the five years of our mandate.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the publication of the Commission Green Paper on European space policy in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA).
In my view, this Green Paper demonstrates an awareness of the importance for Europe of developing the space sector in industrial, strategic and also political terms.
Last May, we held a debate on the future of this sector, in light of a serious crisis related to fierce world competition and to funding problems.
The Green Paper, the Bodrato report and the newly announced White Paper contain practical proposals that could ultimately help us to overcome this crisis and finally add some real ambition to an independent European space policy.
To this end, I welcome the outcome of the Galileo programme and I share the stated desire to develop Community integration.
I do hope, however, that this integration will not call into question the independent competences of the space agency in its role as programme coordinator and leader.
I should like to address two issues.
The report insists on the need to create synergies between civilian and military activities â I heard Mr Bodratoâs words quite clearly â whilst advocating the use of space for peaceful purposes, which I support. He hopes that the satellite systems will benefit not only transport and the environment, but also security, so that Europe has its own strategy, management body and its own resources.
All well and good, but I am convinced that priority should be given to the use of space for peaceful purposes: the needs are enormous, whether we are talking about the environment or about risk management.
Europe must not fall in line with the US model, which gives priority to research and development in the military sphere above any potential civilian applications.
Lastly, one crucial aspect of an ambitious European space policy concerns funding.
The report emphasises that the provision of public funds is crucial to the development of space programmes.
There is a major contradiction between the Unionâs stated aims and reality.
There has been no increase in the budgets allocated to Europeâs space agencies, whereas the US dedicates six times more public funds to space than do all the European countries put together.
The Union must, as a matter of urgency, release funding that matches the ambitions it has stated.
This is also a requirement for Community integration and, as I see it, only public funds can guarantee long-term investment, which is crucial in the space industry, as is maintaining high-level skills.
This is a prerequisite for an independent, dynamic European space policy that uses cutting-edge technology and which creates high-quality jobs.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, European space policy is becoming the spearhead of European policy as a whole, due to the hopes it engenders for cutting-edge research, for the new technologies, for the economy and for development.
It must be realistic; in other words, it must make sense in the context of US and Russian space policy and act as a driving force for the European Union.
I congratulate Mr Bodrato on his report, which has the merit of expressing this desire.
We feel, however, that it focuses too much on military applications, which are not the intended aim of this policy.
This is why we are proposing Galileo, which will be a purely civilian organisation, as opposed to the USAâs GPS system or the Russian Glonass, which are under military control.
We propose to support ArticleÂ 150 of the Convention under discussion, so that space forms part of European policy as a whole.
A joint organisation must be set up at European level and the European Space Agency (ESA) must be more a tool of this integrated policy than an intergovernmental body.
Work in the space sector must form part of the context of the European research area and the bulk of resources allocated to this field should be shared by the Unionâs Member States.
All players involved in space policy and in particular the European Parliament which supports our space policy must sit down at the same table.
Our group will set great store by these proposals and will pay close attention when the White Paper on space, which is due to be submitted to us by the end of the year, is adopted.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr PiÃ©trasanta.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0294/2003) by MrÂ GuidoÂ Bodrato, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on European space policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have had many discussions on space travel before, and I am glad that the subject is now accorded much greater importance in European debate than was the case ten years ago.
I might add, with all modesty, that this House can take the credit for this.
We grasped the strategic significance of space, but also the fact that very little money is to be made from it, so that means that space travel needs to be supported by public funds, but what will certainly show a profit in the years to come will be the activities derived from space travel in the fields of telecommunications, measuring techniques, and so on, which we have often discussed.
There is no future for space travel, though, without carriers in the form of satellites, if â let me add â there is no manned spaceflight.
In Cologne, there is now a centre providing training for astronauts.
Our disagreements are in fact not so much about the purpose of space travel â about which I believe there to be broad consensus â as about its military aspects, which are a new factor.
Let me say that I do not think that we should shy away from this issue, as â in contrast to ten or twenty years ago â Europe now has its Foreign and Security Policy.
We cannot separate one from the other.
I will admit that I find learning rather difficult, but one is never too old to learn more, and so I would very much urge that particular attention be given to this aspect.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, few but honourable Members, however important the development of the space policy of the European Union is, its orientation is equally important.
Despite the initial proclamations about the use of space for peaceful purposes in the direction of development, knowledge and applications, direct or indirect references to military use have been multiplying recently, to the point at which it is clear that it is this use that mainly interests the European Union.
This orientation is also clear from the European Commission's Green Paper and from the STAR 21 report and from the meeting organised by the Greek Presidency in Athens on 8 and 9 May on the subject of âSecurity and Defence Aspects of Spaceâ.
Militarisation is being promoted both in order to serve what we see as the aggressive common defence and security policy and on the pretext that it is the only way to strengthen the aerospace industry with public funding.
Admittedly, this industry is under intense pressure from its competitors. Perhaps, however, its problems originate in the promotion of corporate profit as the driving force, in liberalism, competitiveness and the free market which prohibit non-military public aid?
Although the report by the Committee on Industry which we are examining contains a series of correct findings and proposals, such as acknowledging the role of the European Space Agency, the reference to the need to promote research and international cooperation, however, adopts the military use of space and goes too far.
Thus, not only does it praise the proposal to set up a European Agency for Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities, but it goes as far as reiterating âthe valuable role which the military use of satellite systems can play in peacekeeping operationsâ.
What peacekeeping operations does it mean?
Perhaps the continuing murderous attacks against Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq?
The involvement of the European Union in the further militarisation of space is a severe blow for peace because it brings it to the same level of responsibilities as the United States in the military competition race.
Finally, it would be a very negative development for science and the peoples if the European Space Agency which, as a transnational organisation at the level of the European continent makes a huge contribution to the development of space science and research, were to become the agency of those pursuing military objectives.
For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you not to strengthen this move.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that in the fast process of globalisation which humanity is experiencing â a process which also shrinks the horizon of our world by seeking a universal cosmic and interplanetary dimension â it is strategically important for our Union to have an advanced space policy.
I therefore totally support the decisions which have been taken by the European Council in Lisbon in this respect, the comments and proposals of the Commission since 1999 and the parallel decisions of the intergovernmental European Space Agency.
I also support the proposal in Article 50 which the Convention has produced in order to provide a legal basis for Community actions.
As in other sectors, Europe must have the necessary ambition and impetus, reflected in its budgets, to be able to play a leading role on the international stage.
It must have independent access to space and develop suitable technologies.
And it must do so within a system of international cooperation, particularly with the United States and with Russia, who are pioneers in terms of space, and also with others such as Japan, China, etc. But that cooperation cannot be subordinate.
Under no circumstances must it be subordinate.
In this regard, I am happy with the progress made in one area of our space policy, the Galileo project, and the agreements which ensure its interoperability with the American GPS system, and I hope that we will soon reach agreements with the Russian Glonass system as well.
I trust that those agreements do not subordinate the civilian use of our Galileo system to military priorities which cause occasional shadowing of the signal and which are not subject to the control of the people responsible for European security and certainly do not require the consent of these decision-makers.
Mutual collaboration, yes, but subordination, no.
I would like to end by congratulating Mr Bodrato on the fine report he has presented to us on European space policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, space is essential for European competitiveness.
It is vital that our continent should also be able to develop and produce new technology.
European innovations and different components cannot be left out of the market in any possible competitive situation because of trade and other barriers.
The rapid development of telecommunications means Europe must have adequate capacity under its own control by means of satellites.
As the levels of investment required in this sector are enormous we should support European initiatives to develop space technology through the industryâs umbrella organisation.
We do not necessarily need European hero-movie astronauts for this in Europe.
The European Space Agencyâs satellites will instead observe the important matter of the state of the environment, help in issues of transport and map the Earthâs inner space.
Information on this should definitely be allowed to become more widespread in Europe.
The European Unionâs goal is a knowledge-based economy.
That cannot work in any harmonious way without the space factor being involved.
In fact it is important that Europe also integrates at the level of the space issue and is able to function properly as seen from space.
So many of the problems we have today can be partially solved if we have viable and effective technology in space.
Â Â  â Mr President, the way todayâs debate has been organised would be laughable if it were not such an expensive business.
First it was delayed, then, with us all here, it was delayed for another hour without any explanation being given, and the interpreters will be along later.
This is where I agree entirely with Mr Linkohr, who spoke before me, that one learns things as one gets older.
I may well not have had much to say in favour of Friedrich von Hayek in my books and other works, but what I see in this place from one day to another is such a waste of money â not yours, not Parliamentâs, but the taxpayerâs â that I have come to think of the whole thing as a hypocritical farce.
By way of contrast, I would like to know whether we would organise debates in their current form if it were your money!
That also means â and this brings me to what I wanted to talk about â that I was originally only meant to have one minute, but, the way things are organised, I still have one, so please do not regard this minute as taking us off the subject.
Now for my minute on space travel.
Are we not falling into the very trap of saying that if something makes sense in principle â be it this House or the peaceful use of space travel â then it actually works?
It does not actually work out like that.
If we look at the report, at the second part of item 17, and at item 18, then what is this dual use?
How are the two kept separate?
Where can I, as a citizen, know what I am now actually getting in return for my tax, and where I am getting it?
Do we not notice that, without military support, we might not get many of the things that would make sense in civilian terms?
How, then, are the two to be kept apart?
Is this not where we ourselves are being sucked into a new kind of military-industrial complex?
Are we in this House not the very people who are up in arms when a populist like Haider or Schwarzenegger suddenly wins elections?
What we urgently need, I believe, is transparency â in space travel and here in this House.
Thank you for allowing me the chance to speak for two minutes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to repeat my earlier thanks to MrÂ Bodrato, and also to all Members of this Parliament who have spoken in support of the idea of a European Union space policy.
I believe that we are indeed at a pivotal moment in Europe for determining whether we are going to have our own independent and proactive space policy, taking us further both in terms of technology and of scientific development.
In this regard, I believe that the support of this Parliament is crucial.
This is why I wish briefly to respond to some points.
First of all, in response to some speakers, the relationship between the European Space Agency and the European Union is clearly set out in a cooperation agreement and we have an excellent relationship, in a climate of mutual respect.
The White Paper will furthermore be produced as a result of common agreement.
I also wish to tell you that we need to give a new boost to every aspect of the telecommunications sector: GMES, environmental protection, the Galileo programme and security.
As some honourable Members, including MrÂ Linkohr, have pointed out, this is crucial for scientific and technological development.
All of these elements will be covered in the White Paper that we are in the process of drawing up and Parliament will, of course, be involved in discussions because this will be done before the end of the year.
Similarly, the GMES programme will be implemented.
I shall simply add that the debate over whether the technology used should be in military or civilian hands is sometimes a rather theoretical one, because if you look at the transmission of information, for example, it applies to many sectors.
The aim is not, of course, military, but to make the best use of our research.
Seeking to achieve this aim does not, however, mean that we have to react in a schizophrenic way by believing that there is a difference between civilian and military research.
There is only research â full stop.
This is a crucial point and I thank MrÂ Bodrato for having made it.
What we need to do today is to reach a good agreement in the International Conference to ensure that space policy is truly a Union policy and, of course, to find the appropriate funding, without which we will never achieve our aims.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0257/2003) by MrÂ DellaÂ Vedova, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings: 'The EC Merger Regulation' (COM(2002) 711 - C5-0005/2003 - 2002/0296(CNS)).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last December the Commission adopted a plan to implement an incisive reform of the system for controlling concentrations.
The reform is the result of a review process that was launched in 2000, which is the basis for the new draft regulation that I hope the Council will soon adopt so that it can come into force in time for the forthcoming enlargement.
The reform aims not to jeopardise the merits of the current system; what we are proposing is a series of significant improvements to the current system, intended, above all, to further improve the system in terms of the transparency and coherence of the control of concentrations.
At the same time, over and above the regulation, we are improving the Commissionâs decision-making process, ensuring that our inquiries into proposed mergers are more accurate, more focused and better supported by sound economic analysis and that they give full consideration to the rights of the parties involved in the concentration and of third parties; we are also aware of the fact that the Court of First Instance is asking the Commission for a high level of proof.
This has obvious implications for the way in which we work.
The package reforming the control of concentrations is made up of the proposal for a new Community merger regulation and of a draft communication that contains guidelines on assessing horizontal mergers.
In recent months, in addition to the preparation of these documents, many measures relating to the staff and internal organisation of the Competition Directorate General have been adopted, in particular the introduction of a new figureÂ âÂ the chief competition economistÂ âÂ and processes such as the peerreviewpanel to ensure greater clarity of control during analysis.
The proposal for a new merger regulation is characterised by three main elements: firstly, clarification of the substantive test for evaluating the possible effects of concentrations on competition; secondly, jurisdictional issues, where we are proposing to rationalise the system of referrals between the Commission and Member States; thirdly and lastly, numerous procedural changes are being proposed to give slightly more flexibility in timeframes for inspections and for notification of a concentration, as well as aligning the powers of fact-finding provided for in the merger regulation with those that are set down in Regulation No 1/2003, which, as you know, relates to the application of ArticlesÂ 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, over the past three years, the Commission has been involved in a thorough review of the Community antitrust system.
As you mentioned, Commissioner, the proposal for a new regulation on concentrations between undertakings before us today represents one of the key phases of that review process.
The previous regulation had become increasingly central to the EUâs competition policy. It had considerable merits, offering the undertakings involved in mergers a âone-stop shopâ and preset deadlines.
However, the growing integration of markets and the consequent increase in the number and relevance of merger cases examined by the Commission has brought the existing rules to a critical point, as demonstrated by the recent Court of Justice judgments rejecting certain decisions by the Commission, something you, yourself, also referred to, Commissioner.
Hence the need to reform the existing rules, and the Commission is to be congratulated for having reacted swiftly to this need.
The three vital points both in the Commission proposal and also in Parliament's report, points that you drew attention to yourself, Commissioner, are the substantive test, jurisdiction and procedural issues.
As regards jurisdiction, that is to say the field of application of the regulation and thus the allocation of cases between the different national authorities, there is a need to solve the problem of multiple notifications, which will become even more serious for the businesses affected following enlargement.
These multiple applications are totally at odds with the principle of the one-stop shop to which we have all referred.
In its proposal, the Commission has abandoned both the possibility of changing thresholds, presumably because of the complications involved, and the â3+â principle, although contained in the Green Paper, which was advocated by Parliament in the Berenguer Fuster report.
This positive view was confirmed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which defined an automatic test also allowing for referral to the Commission during the pre-notification stage, when a case has to be notified to several national authorities.
Parliament accordingly wishes to reiterate the line already taken in the debate on the Green Paper.
With regard to principle, the substantive test has nevertheless proved effective up to now, although this has been keenly debated.
Some people have proposed switching to a substantial lessening of competition test, a principle used in the United States and in some Member States.
In this respect, your rapporteur acted on the Commission's proposal to add a paragraph to ArticleÂ 2, which would have defined the concept of dominant position more clearly.
I, personally, suggested a rewording, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided at this stage to call on the Commission to leave things as they are, thus backing the value of the test and of its effectiveness, as demonstrated up to now.
As regards procedural issues, I would like to say a few words about powers of investigation.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed toning down some of the provisions in the proposal for a regulation, given that we believe that, on grounds of proportionality, it is absolutely unnecessary to bring the Commissionâs powers of investigation for mergers into line with the powers envisaged for cartels, since the areas concerned are completely different.
A merger essentially represents âbusiness as usualâ and we do not, therefore, believe there should be any presumption that the rules have been breached.
This gives this House all the more reason to believe that we should stand firm on this issue, given the powers that the Commission is proposing to grant itself, albeit quite legitimately.
We believe that Parliament should adopt a position offering a better guarantee here.
I would like to make two points by way of conclusion.
Firstly, there is the position of the workforce.
During the debate, some Members, in particular the Socialists, expressed their concern and a proposal to take into account the possible employment impact of merger operations, and even proposed that the acceptability of a merger should be dependent on preserving jobs.
We believe that this is not the right place to insert a clause of this kind, because there is a danger that it would conflict with the overall logic of the regulation, which is to guarantee a competitive single market precisely in order to increase employment.
As regards worker participation and information, the regulation already contains some provisions in this respect; further provisions in precisely this area are envisaged in other European legislation.
I do not believe that there is any need to include these provisions here and, in view of this, I would ask the House and, in particular, MrÂ Berenguer Fuster and Mrs van den Burg, to reconsider.
The fact that these amendments will be rejected should not be allowed to prejudice the vote on the entire legislative proposal.
I am, however, happy to support MrÂ Schmidt's amendment.
Â Â  . I have the luxury of being able to address the Parliament twice in succession.
I will only do so once, but I hope â if you do not mind â that I can combine the speaking times.
Mr President, I have, first of all, a great deal of appreciation for the Commission's proposals for the revision of the regulation on the control of concentrations and an exceptional amount of appreciation for the sterling report by Mr Della Vedova.
We support the objective of creating more clarity, legal certainty and quicker procedures.
Against this background, I should like to make a few observations.
In the first instance, Parliament welcomed the Green Paperâs proposals for a âone-stop-shopâ system in Brussels for multiple filings in more than two Member States.
As Mr Della Vedova said a moment ago, that is why we regret the Commissionâs failure to incorporate this principle in the present proposal.
With the forthcoming enlargement, the number of multiple filings will increase substantially, always assuming that policy remains unchanged.
The lack of mutual coordination among Member States has led to bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming procedures.
The coordination and harmonisation of national procedures is very much what is wanted and we would therefore urge the Commissioner to make every effort to promote this idea.
I know that this does not fall within the Commission's remit, but it can, of course, talk to the Member States and call for further harmonisation and mutual coordination.
A single procedure in Brussels will not only cost less but will also significantly improve legal certainty for businesses and ensure that the procedure can be completed more quickly.
The Commission does create some scope for promoting central processing in Brussels by means of the referral procedure, but we do not believe that this goes far enough.
If a merger clearly has a cross-border impact, it ought to be considered by the Commission wherever possible.
It should be made possible for cases to be referred to the Commission on the basis of objective criteria and at the request of the merging parties.
We have developed concrete proposals to this effect.
For the same reasons, the idea of referring concentrations to Member States needs to be treated with caution.
Concentrations that comply with the requirements of a simplified procedure ought not, in principle, to be referred to the Member States.
One of the purposes of this revision of the regulation is to increase legal certainty.
However, in our view, if the concept of the dominant economic position is broadened in the way proposed by the Commission, this is more likely to have the opposite effect.
Any merger conferring a certain advantage over competitors would fall within the new definition.
All parties concerned are used to applying the existing definition, on which there is now ample case law.
A change in the definition would obscure the situation and lead to unnecessary legal uncertainty.
Moreover, there is, in our opinion, a danger that the market would lose its dynamism if concentration processes were to be interfered with on a far bigger scale than at present.
I accordingly believe that it would be better not to expand the definition.
We agree with the proposal to leave Article 2(1) unchanged.
However, the requirements applicable to evidence of the existence of efficiencies must not become excessive.
It is future advantages that would have to be demonstrated, and these cannot possibly be guaranteed 100%.
There is a need to clarify exactly when relevant information about efficiencies would have to be provided.
The Commission calls for a substantial expansion of its powers of investigation, in line with those relating to cartel procedures under Regulation 1/2003.
However, in our view, there is an essential difference between the aim of merger control and combating violations of cartel rules.
When investigating a concentration, unlike in the case of a cartel violation, it is not assumed that the law has been broken.
We accordingly consider the Commissionâs proposal for increasing its investigative resources under this Regulation excessive, particularly if viewed in the context of the enormous fines that the Commission can impose for non-compliance with the provisions of the Regulation.
No one can be compelled to give evidence against himself.
This is an important basic principle of criminal law and should apply here too.
It is therefore well worth laying down in the Regulation that, when carrying out an investigation, the Commission should respect the rights of the parties concerned.
This particularly applies to the right to silence for company lawyers, and also indeed for other employees whom the Commission may question.
Additionally, I would draw attention to the lack of internal and external monitoring of the Commissionâs decision-making.
As things stand at present, there is no separation between the investigating authority and the authority taking the decision. This is difficult to reconcile with the requirement of legal certainty and independence.
The legitimacy of decision-making can be further promoted by setting up a specialised chamber for competition at the Court of First Instance.
This could also speed up the procedure and improve the quality of the administration of justice.
Â Â  Mr President, as the rapporteur has just pointed out, Community competition law has undergone substantial reform over recent years, which is now culminating in the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on conciliations.
It is true that, if we accept the comments of Mr Monti, it is still necessary to make proposals in the field of the public aid proposed, and I wish them every success, even though it cannot be denied that this is clearly a road strewn with dangers and difficulties.
In the field of conciliations, it is the case that the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 has not been as radical a change as the one which has taken place, for example, in the field of anti-competitive behaviour.
This is firstly due to the fact that Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 was a good regulation, it was a good legislative text, which has allowed us to carry out a suitable Community competition policy in the field of conciliations.
In September 2000, on the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission organised a seminar to discuss it and the opinions expressed by the specialists and sectors involved in it were positive, despite the criticism of certain very specific aspects.
Subsequently, the Commission produced a Green Paper containing proposals for reform, which were also partial and specific, which deserved the clear support of this Parliament.
We are now debating the report on the proposed reform; Mr Della Vedova has produced a wonderful report and I congratulate him on it.
The report contains some very significant aspects, and perhaps one of the very important aspects which should be stressed is that it differs from the Commissionâs report on a point on which, at the same time, the Commission differs from the proposal contained in its Green Paper. This is the problem of multiple notifications.
These multiple notifications increase the costs for notifiers and affect legal certainty since, in so far as various authorities have to decide on a single concentration, there is always the possibility of contradictory resolutions.
And if there was anything on which there was complete agreement it was the fact that the unnecessarily complex rule in ArticleÂ 1(3), introduced in the 1997 reform, had not contributed to resolving the problem.
Therefore, the Green Paper proposed the three-country rule, but now that rule is being forgotten in favour of a system, which is welcome, of two-way communications, either from the national authorities to the Commission, or from the Commission to the national authorities.
But maintaining the text of ArticleÂ 1(3).
The truth is that, as I have said, the improvement of these referral mechanisms deserved our applause, but we do not understand the reasons for having forgotten the three-country rule, unless it has been detected that, as happened in 1997, the majority of countries wish to keep in their hands a significant competence to implement policies with industrial content, which is not always necessary.
Mr Della Vedova has mentioned the Socialist Group's insistence on the participation of workers and says that this is not the place to deal with it.
I cannot agree with that opinion.
We must bear in mind that, regardless of whether the conditions relating to efficiencies is reformed, any competition authority, on approving a concentration, takes account of certain efficiencies and there is no question that one of the most important of these efficiencies is the maintenance or creation of jobs, and this being the case, the information the representatives of the workers can provide is important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking MrÂ DellaÂ Vedova for an excellent report that has the full support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
If I were to grade different areas of responsibility within the EU, issues of competition would be among the most important.
The work you do, Mr Monti, is of the greatest importance if the market economy is to operate, if Europe is to be able to grow, if there is to be a business-oriented EU and if all European consumers are to be given a choice in respect of low prices and high quality.
Trying to strike a balance between the interests of companies and those of the consumer is not always simple, but I respect you for the work you have done.
It is of necessity that the concentration rules are now being reviewed and modernised.
The market is changing.
Competition is increasing, and internationalisation and globalisation give rise to different basic conditions.
We are entitled to demand that the EUâs concentration rules be legally secure and predictable, that investigations and assessments be genuine and rapidly carried out and that both the Commissionâs and the national authoritiesâ rules be clear.
These are things we are entitled to demand, MrÂ President.
The DellaÂ Vedova report further strengthens the Commissionâs proposals in these respects.
We believe it would be a step in the wrong direction to enlarge what is called the concept of dominance.
Allow me to touch upon the amendments by the ELDR Group.
The Commission should be able to have a more dynamic and long-term perspective when the market basis is assessed in the case of concentrations and be able to see the common market in a global context.
That applies in purely general terms but, in particular, it is important for leading companies in smaller countries to be able to grow stronger, within their own countries as well, and to do so with a view to providing more jobs within the whole of the EU and to increasing competitiveness outside the EU too.
We are sympathetic towards the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The employeesâ viewpoints are, of course, important, but concentrations of that type should, in our view, not be regulated in this context.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the Commissionâs advocacy of the maintenance of free competition in Europe is of course something to be welcomed.
We are of course in favour of rigorous measures being taken to deal with cartel agreements, but control measures, whether at national or European level, must not be designed in such a way that free competition is hampered by red tape.
This means that the Regulation that is to be enacted must end up increasing legal certainty, and must not reduce it.
With this in mind, we will endorse the amendments that our fellow-Members have tabled.
Â Â  Mr President, it will not have escaped the attention of those involved in this issue that those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who are also members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against the final report.
I think this is very regrettable, because, as it has been stated here before, it is indeed an excellent report and the rapporteur has done a good job.
The situation was such, however, that the amendments tabled by our group had simply not received any support from other groups.
This is why it was difficult for us to vote in favour.
We have re-tabled some of those amendments in this plenary, for we have really whittled them down to what we think was really essential and necessary.
I sincerely hope that other groups, particularly the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has taken our side on issues of this kind in the past, are prepared to re-consider this carefully, so that we can vote in favour of this report wholeheartedly and without any reservations.
I will explain the kind of amendments they are, and I want to demonstrate why these, in our view, are perfectly in keeping with the Lisbon agenda.
The guiding principle underlying the Lisbon agenda is that policy must become more coherent so as to promote greater competitiveness, sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion.
This means that we have to abandon the three-pillars structure and ensure that policy adopted in the various directorates-general and in the various councils of ministers is also in line with our other objectives.
Consideration should in this respect also be given to the required cohesion of policy.
Consequently, with regard to the regulation on concentrations, we would particularly draw your attention to two aspects.
First of all, the assessment should consider aspects other than competition in the narrow sense of the word.
In our amendment, we explicitly call for considerations with regard to the contribution that concentrations can make to improved production and marketing systems, to international competitiveness, to consumer interests and to the creation of jobs and the employment situation in general.
This is thus a reasonably wide definition, and one that is capable of offering the necessary flexibility and room for manoeuvre.
Amendment No 37 contains words to this effect.
The second aspect is about a serious and fully-fledged consultation of employee representatives within the procedures.
Particularly Amendments Nos 40 and 41 concern this topic.
In current practice, employee councils or trade union representatives are heard only at their explicit request, that is, if they have at their disposal information that tells them that a concentration or merger is in progress.
Then there is the question of whether their arguments will be addressed seriously if they are consulted about the employment and social implications of the proposed merger.
This ties in with the other amendment I mentioned.
They should be called upon by the authorities not only to gain an insight into the market positions and competitive risks, but it should also be possible to have serious discussions about those other effects.
This should form a standard component of the procedure and this is what we hope our amendments will achieve.
I truly hope that this will be re-considered in the other groups.
I would already like to thank Mr Olle Schmitt for his support for part of these amendments.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs van den Burg was right to stress that the Christian Democrat group has very often joined with other groups in taking the interests of workers into account when competition policy and models of economic policy are under consideration.
We have done this because our group stands for the social market economy, because we back the Lisbon objectives, and because social cohesion is not incompatible with economic success; on the contrary, it is contingent upon it.
We will not, however, be supporting the Social Democratsâ amendments, either in committee or in plenary, as these things have to be dealt with where they belong.
Most of those who have spoken before me have pointed out that this refusal does not go against peopleâs interests, but that we must find a place for our concerns where the matter in hand requires it, and where the most good can result.
The control of mergers is meant to ensure that EU law applies to them, and it is because the Mergers Regulation works well as an instrument of European competition legislation that we are all appealing to the Commission.
It would be a mistake if amendments, albeit necessary ones, to an essentially good and workable instrument were to make it more bureaucratic, more costly and more time-consuming than it at present is in a form that has stood the test of time.
We therefore endorse the Regulationâs objectives.
It has to be said, for the benefit of those listening to this debate, that Parliament has no power of codecision on this issue, but is simply being consulted.
We want greater clarity, greater legal certainty and the introduction of speedier procedures.
That is why we also endorse the proposal for more flexible deadlines, which will bring great advantages to businesses.
It is apparent from all the interventions that there are three points on which we have had criticisms to make, and we will continue to make them in the hope that the Commission will change tack.
The first of them is that â as I see it â Parliament holds fast to the one-stop-shop principle. What this means is that, where a merger crosses more than two borders between Member States, this has to be reported directly to the Commission.
This makes for clarity, legal certainty and is the simplest way of doing things in view of EU enlargement.
I see the abandonment of the principle in the Green Book as regrettable, and urge you to return to it.
You would thereby be helping to reduce costs and bureaucracy and increase legal certainty.
A second point is the definition of the market.
We believe that your definition of the âeconomically dominant positionâ is too broad and that the old definition is potentially clearer.
The third point is one that must be faced head-on â the issue of the way in which the provisions on mergers are being brought closer to those in the Cartels Regulation.
Here, you are confusing apples with pears.
What needs to be made clear is that mergers are legal, whereas cartels are not.
This distinction must be kept and the two must not be confused with one another.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Commission has proposed a new regulation on concentrations between undertakings, as part of the broader project of updating the legislation on violations of competition rules and the effects such violations might have on the proper functioning of the single market.
This is an extremely sensitive area, in which legal certainty should be enhanced and administrative procedures made more flexible.
The transparency and monitoring of decisions, and appeals against them, should also be improved, as should the active, dynamic and appropriate participation of all the parties involved in undertakings.
Concentrations or mergers between undertakings are a fundamental economic and legal process.
They make the markets more dynamic, help undertakings to restructure and encourage economies to grow.
This process cannot and should not be perceived as leading inevitably to the abuse of a dominant position.
A very clear distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, the whole business of investigating violations of competition rules following allegedly irregular behaviour and, on the other, the normal process of monitoring a merger, which should, as a matter of principle, be accepted as legal and in accordance with the rules governing the market.
That is why the amendments already approved by the Parliamentary committee, and those to be tabled in plenary, in particular by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are of fundamental importance.
In Community legislation and its underlying political philosophy, competition is not an end in itself.
It is, rather, an instrument with which to achieve and attain the Unionâs major goals.
Extreme caution is needed, therefore, when adopting European Union legislation with a view to substantially reducing competition (such laws exist in other legislative systems, in particular in the United States).
It is only right for the final positions of the Parliamentary committee and the rapporteur to reflect this caution.
It should not be forgotten, furthermore, that the majority of those consulted in business circles expressed reservations and concerns about the adoption of new legislation, especially in view of the fact that the legislation on abuse of the dominant position has worked well up to now.
The efforts made by the Commission to table this proposal for a regulation, following the DecemberÂ 2001 Green Paper, are much to be commended, and deserve Parliamentâs support overall.
It is crucial, however, that some amendments be introduced to improve the text of this report, emphasising legal certainty and, above all, highlighting the role which workers in the merging undertakings should play.
The workers should oversee the whole process and provide not only relevant information but also guarantees that the operation in question will be an economic and social success.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is surprising that company mergers, which are one response to the challenge of globalisation, are often dealt with under the heading of âcartel lawâ, which has nothing to do with them.
Cooperation comes about quite legally, with the objective of maximising opportunities on global markets; it is an important element in the free and dynamic internal market.
It therefore follows that they still have their problems, most of which arise when widely divergent enterprise cultures are brought together.
The new structures that result make for more conflicts.
Businesses are often slimmed down, resulting in severe job losses.
If there is to be a single European internal market, it needs to be laid down in unambiguous terms precisely when mergers have to be reported.
In its Green Paper, the Commission has already stressed that they are always to fall within its own remit where mergers have been reported to the authorities in at least three Member States, and that is also the line that I take.
I am convinced that this is where costly and time-consuming procedures in the Member States can at last be done away with.
Rather than perpetuating the fragmentation that is already widespread, there may quite probably â as my colleagues have already pointed out â be some simplification and tightening-up, not to mention greater legal certainty.
While this is going on, national competition rules must continue to apply in full, although they must not conflict with Community rules.
It strikes me that the imminent enlargement of our European Union will make the one-stop-shop system ever more important.
If I may add a comment on the threshold value, our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes that the Commission should look into the merger of companies if their joint turnover in at least three Member States is greater than 10% of their overall turnover in the European Union.
There is another point, Commissioner Monti, where I cannot support the Commissionâs position.
You seek to extend the definition of companiesâ âeconomically dominant positionâ to cover markets that are oligopolies, no matter when the merger comes about.
Let me quote: âhas a tangible and lasting influence on competitionâ.
It is all too logical that mergers are meant to procure advantages over against competitors.
I warn you against over-regulation.
The markets would lose much of the dynamism that they need.
Mr Della Vedovaâs report is sound, and my Group, that of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is in absolute agreement with it.
The Socialists have tabled a number of new amendments, and, Mrs van den Burg, we will be voting on them tomorrow.
Much of what these amendments contain one can certainly live with â but not in this report and not at this juncture.
We are the party of the social market economy, and nothing will change that, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out, but introducing small amendments into these positions is like applying small amounts of cosmetics.
That is something we must formulate elsewhere; that must indeed be clearly articulated, and I believe that we can find a common mind if we do this somewhere else.
I hope that it will be possible for one or other amendment to be withdrawn; perhaps we will manage to get a broad consensus by tomorrow lunchtime.
I am firmly convinced that this report by Mr Della Vedova deserves one rather than our later being suddenly disunited.
Perhaps the Socialists will have a few new ideas by tomorrow.
That is very much to be wished.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate for their valuable contributions, and I would particularly like to thank MrÂ Della Vedova, the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and MrÂ Doorn, draftsman for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I am delighted to see that, by and large, the report supports the Commission's proposal, and that we share the same general objectives with regard to the need for reform.
The Commission is, however, I am afraid, unable to accept the various amendments tabled.
I would like to explain why, although, for, reasons of time I shall have to be brief, starting with the substantive test in the regulation on concentrations.
The Commission has come to the conclusion that the substantive test should be clarified, by adding a few words to the present textÂ - words that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to see removed.
Why do we think that this change is needed?
Many observers believe that the present test may not be adequate to cope with concentrations that raise competition problems in cases of what is known as ânon-collusive oligopolyâ.
If this is true, opting to keep the dominant position test as it is would mean failing to take advantage of an opportunity to make it clear that the substantive test for assessing concentrations will be applied without fail to all concentrations harmful to consumers' interests.
I would also like to emphasise that the prevailing view in international economic literature is that oligopoly situations arising from concentrations can have long-term anticompetitive effects and thus harm consumers' interests.
The Commission brought forward its proposal because it had become aware of the need to guarantee maximum legal certainty, an objective which it seems to me was generally shared and supported by various speakers, including MrÂ Olle Schmidt, MrÂ Ilgenfritz, MrÂ Santos and others.
The greatest legal certainty you can have here is a genuinely effective instrument for controlling concentrations.
We are convinced that the wording proposed would provide the greatest legal certainty possible.
As regards jurisdiction, a subject covered in depth in the Della Vedova and Doorn reports, and one on which various speakers commented, including MrÂ Berenguer Fuster and MrÂ Karas, I believe we all agree that it is necessary to achieve a sensible division of labour between the Commission and the Member States, thus minimising the burdens on companies and on public regulatory authorities.
This means having allocation thresholds which, as far as possible, reflect an optimum division, and applying a referral system that can, so to speak, rectify incorrect allocations as far as is possible.
We therefore propose to simplify and make more flexible the provisions for referring cases from the Commission to Member States and vice versa, thus also making it possible, as some companies have indicated would be helpful, for referral to take place even before notification.
What lies behind our position on the amendments proposed in relation to jurisdiction?
Your report, MrÂ Della Vedova, proposes a â2+â rule combined with new turnover thresholds.
I fully appreciate the intentions behind the proposed amendment, but I believe that it would introduce an additional complication, because companies would first have to find out where to notify an operation.
That is the reason, MrÂ Berenguer Fuster, why we, ourselves, dropped the idea, appealing as it is, of a â3+â system, because it would come up against the situation of non-harmonised national legislation on concentrations, for the time being at least.
This might be a longer-term objective, but it is not one for today.
As regards partial referrals to Member States, I agree that we should keep these to a minimum, but I also believe that it would not be advisable totally to rule out such referrals, because they may be appropriate in some cases.
I now wish to turn to a subject that has attracted a lot of attention and concern.
The Commission has also proposed that its own powers of enforcement, as laid down in the regulation on concentrations, should, to a large extent, be brought in line with the new regulation, Regulation 1/2003.
There are, in particular, two exceptions, namely the power to search private homes and the power to conduct investigations into sectors of the economy, which we, too, do not believe to be necessary for controlling concentrations.
