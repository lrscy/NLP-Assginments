I welcome the communication from the European Commission, which aims to remove trade-distorting subsidies from the EU sugar regime.
However, there are several areas that still need improvement.
European sugar prices currently stand at nearly three times the world price, and these artificially high prices must be reduced.
At the same time, though, a full liberalisation of the sugar market would have an adverse effect, not only on the European sugar industry but also on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and less-developed countries.
A large price cut would place ACP and LDC countries at a competitive disadvantage in relation to countries that can produce sugar at a very low world price, notably Brazil.
Oxfam has claimed that unfettered liberalisation will harm the most vulnerable.
Brazilian expansion would also be at the cost of thousands of acres of rainforest and savannah that contain precious biodiversity and wild life.
It is necessary to bring the sugar regime into line with CAP reforms, and we must abandon C quota, which I believe will be ruled illegal by the WTO.
Also, when we make quota cuts, it is B quota that should be targeted first, because it is this quota that is being exported onto the world markets, thereby distorting trade.
We must follow the CAP principles we have established.
In order to establish competitive sugar production in the EU there must be cross-border quota transfers to allow more efficient areas of the EU to be ...
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to chip in with my own, somewhat different angle.
I disagree with the gist of the resolution, and in principle, I support the Commission proposals, beginning with what it says about C-dumping and C sugar. Dumping does indeed cost us EUR 800 million per annum, and is completely at odds with what is supposed to be done according to the world trade agreements.
We will be forced to stop this practice without delay and we should not think that we could eke it out for a few years.
The Commission proposal still maintains a world price, or market price in Europe, which is double â or, nowadays, three times â the world price.
Those who argue in favour of wholesale liberalisation and contend that everything should be freed up, have not, in my view, read the Commission proposal properly.
I consider the proposal to be sensible, although there is room for improvement on a number of points. I would particularly refer to the action plan for the poor countries.
It is, of course, true that a number of those countries must invest in industries in order to become more competitive.
I do not think it is realistic for the money for this to come from the European Development Fund.
This is where the funds that we ourselves save in this sector of agriculture could be used, not only for the European agricultural sector, but also for the ACP countries.
I would also like to say a few words about the quotas.
Trade is, of course, the best way of helping countries.
At present, the least-developed countries can increase their levels from 120Â 000 tonnes to 209Â 000 tonnes.
What is stopping us from doubling this 1% of the European market?
That would be an excellent compensation for the countries involved for the period up to 2009, and it could really mean that they have an income.
Commissioner, you were right in saying that we should steer clear of âEverything but Armsâ.
Let this Parliament not bring shame on itself by turning this soon into âEverything but Arms and sugarâ.
That would take the cornerstone out of a fair world trade policy and it would mean that we would promptly fail at Doha.
That should not happen.
I wholeheartedly support the proposals, and I hope that you want to improve and strengthen them.
Â Â  Mr President, when Commissioner Fischler tabled his three proposals about a year ago, it was evident that only one of them was reasonable.
We must change the sugar market; there is no escaping that.
We have to acknowledge that this will have serious implications for many parts of Europe.
What is essential to the whole sugar policy is the issue of what the future price of sugar in Europe will be.
The Commission thinks it can control that price by introducing a reference price.
Perhaps the Commission could explain this again, as we have hitherto always had an intervention price for the most important products.
How can the reference price really guarantee a price on the European markets?
As regards the least-developed countries and the âanything but armsâ initiative, the Commission insists â and this is also related to the future price â that a quota system for those countries would not be realistic.
How confident is the Commission in the light of its experiences in the Balkans where, initially, sugar imports were also unrestricted?
The Commission was subsequently forced to backtrack and introduce a quota system.
Why would this not apply to the least-developed countries?
I share the view of many that the Commission should give more attention to the peripheral regions.
Finally, I should like to say something about Mr van den Bergâs amendments.
I think it is an extremely bad idea for the compensation intended for the least-developed countries to be paid out of the agricultural budget.
Development aid is not only for farmers, it is intended for all sections of society.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the MEP who honourably declared his interests.
Today, the Commission is my ally, in spite of the fact that the reform does not go far enough.
Sugar policy is governed by big business and the self-centredness of the big farmers.
Small farmers, consumers and poor countries are hit.
Current sugar policy in the EU has some thousands of winners and 450Â million losers.
If we take account of the effects upon literally millions of people around the world, current policy is scandalous.
It is good that my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture are going to Mali in April where they are to defend todayâs report before the ACP-EU Assembly.
The Committee on Development and the Committee on Agriculture should share the responsibility.
A weakened reform will lead literally to famine and destitution.
It is hypocritical to use todayâs proposal to defend subsidy-dependent sugar production in every corner of the EU and, at the same time, demand thoroughgoing reform in all the poor countries.
Everyone must play his or her part.
Finally, the criticism of the âEverything but Armsâ initiative is unjustified.
The problem is not that the âEverything but Armsâ initiative exists but that it is not supplemented by social and environmental considerations and by guarantees for small farmers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a matter for regret that the Commissionâs current position is exactly the same as it was last year.
We would be faced with a relocation of sugar beet production from the present production areas to more competitive areas, accompanied by a drastic reduction in prices, which would seriously affect the development of the numerous less-developed regions of the European Union, including Portugal.
That would undermine sugar beet production, the sugar industry in general and the only factory we have in Europe; the quota allocated to it is so small that it could not be reduced without making its operation untenable.
Equally worrying, however, is the impact of this reform on production in the autonomous region of the Azores, given the need to maintain this activity in that outermost region.
There is also a need to maintain stability, safeguard refinery supplies and preserve the balance between the refining and processing of sugar beet, if we are to avoid the disaster that this reform would entail on the basis of the proposal before us.
Â Â  Mr President, the European industrial beet producing sector has said a unanimous "no" to the European Commissionâs proposal and has spoken out against a reduction in institutional prices, a cut in production quotas and the possibility of transferring quotas, a measure that would clearly benefit the most competitive countries at the expense of others, such as Spain.
Spanish beet producers alone will suffer losses that could amount to as much as EUR 60 million per year.
The possibility of transferring quotas from one country to another would lead to a concentration of European production in a few regions and the impoverishment of rural life in many areas in which sugar beet production plays a very important social and economic role.
In its communication, the European Commission itself acknowledges that this reform will also lead to the closure of sugar production plants.
In other words, it accepts that its reform will have damaging consequences.
The Commission does not take account of the situation of countries such as Spain, whose production of sugar has always been in deficit.
In my view, the draft resolution of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development must be seen as a document of minimums, which should provide the basis for the negotiations within the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
The Commission should not once again ignore the concerns of the sector and should take careful note of what I hope will be this Parliament's rejection of its proposal in the vote that will take place today.
I also hope that this European Parliament will reject the package of measures presented by certain Socialist Members, whose approach runs counter to the negotiations that have already taken place amongst various political groups.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the two authors, Mr Fruteau and Mr Daul, who had an extremely difficult and complicated duty to perform.
It was their task to temper the exaggerated radicalism of the European Commission and find a satisfactory compromise.
There is no doubt that a real reform of the sugar sector needs to be implemented, but it is essential to avoid any kind of shock treatment.
We must avoid causing thousands of producers to stop producing sugar in Europe.
The reform ought to guarantee appropriate compensation for producers following price and quota cuts.
From the point of view of the new Member States, of which Hungary is one, the transferability of quotas will have catastrophic consequences.
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment No 38, which seeks to freeze isoglucose quotas, would have very serious consequences for both Poland and Hungary.
In this area we support the Commissionâs position.
I am asking for solidarity among my fellow MEPs in this respect, and I would ask the European Commission to take very serious account of the proposals contained in Parliamentâs resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, the present European sugar regime is untenable at world level; it is unaffordable and it distorts the market.
Europe alone still spends more than EUR 3 billion annually on export subsidies for agricultural products, including sugar.
In the current WTO Doha negotiations, the rich countries promised to reduce those subsidies drastically.
The success of this important trade round will partly be dictated by the willingness to deliver on this promise.
In the sugar reforms, we cannot, of course, overlook our commitments to the ACP countries.
The sugar protocol to the Cotonou Agreement accords them preferential treatment for their exports to Europe, which they can sell at the same, subsidised price as the European producers.
If this support is cut back, this will also be at the expense of the many sugar farmers from the South for whom sugar is often the only source of income.
Temporary compensation and transitional measures such as those for the European sugar producers are not available to them.
It can surely never be the intention for tens of thousands of farmers in the South to be plunged into even greater poverty as a result of our sugar reform.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the Commissioner on addressing the issues raised by this debate.
One can have a different opinion about the direction and manner in which reforms are being carried out, but this is something I greatly value .
I would also like to congratulate Mr Fruteau and MrÂ Daul, who have done excellent work and have tabled a resolution that has the ring of excellence about it.
Why is this resolution so good?
In any event, it shows understanding for the need for reforms, as well as understanding for the fact that this touches upon many social aspects.
Moreover, the resolution illustrates that sometimes pure liberalisation in agricultural policy has the opposite effect and it is better to reach sound agreements worldwide.
I am therefore surprised that there are still many in this discussion who still believe that the liberalisation of the world food trade is the perfect solution to resolve all evils in development cooperation and the fight against poverty.
Sometimes, one wonders what this unshakeable belief is based on.
Over the past ten years, world trade in food has been further liberalised, and Europe now accounts for 85% of exports from Africa to the developed word.
What does this add up to?
Hunger and poverty have increased, 40% of children in the world are starving and the European consumer enjoys anything but lower prices.
It will not come as a surprise that in that respect, I also have major objections to the amendments, including those tabled by my Dutch fellow MEP, Mr Van den Berg.
I sometimes wonder â and I think it is positive to highlight this in the debate â how it is possible that he should first want complete freedom and then believes that the solution will materialise from the chaos on the world food market.
I do not share this belief.
I believe in agreements, worldwide and in Europe, in order to achieve responsible reform.
His idea that the agricultural budget should fund development aid amounts, in my view, to nothing more or less than doing your shopping using someone elseâs wallet .
No one can go without food for a day, and I hope that that will be the for the further debate about the sugar reform in the course of this year.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their report.
I think they have done an excellent job of work, bearing in mind the angle from which they approached it and their representation of farmersâ interests.
It is rather unfortunate that this resolution takes no account of the points of view of the trade or development committees, and I hope we will be able to do that when the House comes to debate and consider the Regulation.
We should certainly ensure that we are in line with our obligations to the WTO, and that we comply with its Appellate Bodyâs decision, and I very much endorse the Commissionerâs proposal.
Although, as many Members have indicated, changes are needed, it generally tends in the right direction.
I have tabled Amendment No 37, which I hope will be supported.
It explicitly reiterates our support for the âEverything but Armsâ initiative, and, in that context, for the reforms to which reference has been made.
Perhaps I might also be permitted to respond in a small way to Mr Sturdyâs interesting comment that he intends to abstain, or refrain from voting, on the grounds that he, while being a member of the Agriculture Committee, is also a producer for the sugar market.
Whilst I see this as cause for rejoicing, I do find it remarkable, as he is also a coordinator on the Committee on International Trade.
Perhaps he should reconsider his position and, in that capacity, perhaps reflect more the position of the trade committee than that of the agriculture committee.
It could be that this would help the House as a whole to evaluate what is before it now.
Please allow me, by way of conclusion, to again ask the Commissioner when and how she plans to actually submit her actual proposal for the trading of quotas in the Member States.
I got the impression from what you said that you have some doubts, and was myself not entirely sure what line you took on the suggestion made in the resolution that this should be abandoned and replaced by a fund.
Perhaps you could say something more on the subject.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
Commissioner, I would like to take a slightly different tack.
The present sugar regime has been in force, unchanged, for 40Â years.
At the same time, the European Union is no longer the same as it was 40Â years ago.
The main shortcomings of the present sugar regime are the lack of competition, market distortions and high prices.
The lowering of the sugar price is an issue of key importance for the new Member States, including Estonia.
Since Estonia is not a sugar producer or a sugar beet grower, the whole burden of the higher sugar price is shouldered by the consumer.
At the same time, there are no producers in Estonia who would benefit from the higher price.
Today Estonia is one of the Member States with the lowest average income, and the price of sugar will affect the quality of life of people with a lower income in particular.
Sugar is a significant component in the consumerâs average shopping basket.
The price of sugar in European Union countries is up to three times higher than the world market price.
Knowing this, people in our country rushed to buy sugar just before accession, and we are now in a situation where our sugar reserves are larger than those permitted in the EU.
We are threatened with a sugar fine.
According to data held by competent State bodies, 2/3 of this reserve is in the hands of the general public and was not bought for speculative purposes.
We ask you to take into consideration your own Directive No 6âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, today we are debating the difference between reform and destruction, between helping the developing world and enriching the powerful forces in the global sugar market.
This House and the Commission have a huge responsibility to get the balance right.
Reform of the sugar market is required, but destruction of the sugar market to the detriment of workers and farmers here in the European Union is not acceptable.
Yet that is the inevitable outcome of the proposed reforms.
These reforms are too drastic in terms of price and quota cuts.
The inevitable consequence is the closure of the sugar industry in some Member States.
The proposal to trade quotas across borders is a new departure and one which will assist in the winding down of the sugar industry, especially in peripheral regions.
It must also have implications for milk quotas.
Alongside this threat, we do not have clarity as to who actually owns the sugar quota; I think it is essential that the quota be vested in growers of beet.
But let us look beyond the borders of the European Union.
The ACP countries, which already enjoy preferential access to the EU market, have expressed their concerns that the reforms will hinder and not help their economies.
Further afield, Brazil is waiting in the wings to increase massively its sugar production.
There are some who lick their lips in anticipation, mainly the dozen or so sugar beet barons in that country.
However, for the poor, the landless, the workers in the sugar mills, there is no such eager anticipation, because they will not benefit.
In reality their lives will be made even more miserable, as the barons grab land and destroy the environment in pursuit of profit.
For us sugar is sweet, yet in Brazil the landless speak of sugar with the taste of blood.
We must be fully aware of the consequences of what is proposed.
We have a chance to get it right for the developing world and the EU sugar industry, but the current proposals are not the solution to this dilemma.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, it is hardly surprising that there should be such strong feelings about the proposed reform of the sugar market.
Firstly, it affects sectors crucial to the further development of the food industry, for which sugar is one of the main raw materials.
The three-fold increase in its price makes it difficult for this industry to develop and compete on the world market.
A second important aspect of this reform is the need to regulate one of the most prized European Union initiatives, namely assistance to the poorest countries, for whom sugar is a major export and source of income.
The Everything But Arms programme is a relevant example.
The third and most important aspect of the proposed reform is its impact on agriculture within the Union.
This is particularly true in the case of my country, Poland, which is the third largest sugar producer.
Implementation of the reform and an unrestricted transfer of quotas is likely to lead to production being concentrated in plants in countries that benefited from Union support in the past.
This could well mean the end of sugar production in Poland, with the loss of several hundred thousand jobs.
It would also make it necessary to import two million tonnes of sugar a year.
MrÂ Daulâs and MrÂ Fruteauâs motion for a resolution contains many good ideas.
It also points out to the Commission the need to achieve a compromise between the three factors mentioned, yet the Commission, by issuing the document in its present form, seems to wish to impact on the social structure of our electorate, including farmers, consumers and producers.
Disputes are bound to ensue, and this at a time when the whole of Europe is engaged in debating the European Constitution and voting on it.
The Commission must draft a new document to help both Brazilian farmers and farmers in the new Member States.
The latter might well be feeling cheated, because the goalposts are being moved in the course of the game, as was the case for the budget.
Alternative solutions such as the production of biofuels or cereals are needed for those likely to lose out.
It is time for all interested parties, politicians included, to sit down together at the negotiating table.
In particular, politicians need to explain to their electorate why they are proposing to deprive them of something they had spent so many years getting them used to.
Â Â  MEPs representing the new Member States can now for the first time take part in the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy.
Reform of the sugar market is, for us Hungarians, especially important.
In Hungary, the cultivation and processing of sugar beet go back more than a hundred years.
However, Hungarian growers and processors now say that for us the European Commissionâs Recommendation brings the danger that the sugar beet industry will be completely wiped out.
We find this unacceptable not only from the social and economic point of view, but also because in Hungary farmers cultivate sugar beet on the best quality land, and if cultivation of sugar beet stops, then it will be replaced by wheat, thus further increasing the wheat surplus.
The proposal approved by the European Parliament agricultural committee would benefit both European and Hungarian producers.
This proposal abolishes the quota trade between Member States and makes the future of the sector less predictable, because the new rules enforce longer deadlines.
It prevents the abuse of trade discounts set up by the EU, as is happening for example in the case of the western Balkan countries, because this illegal trade does not benefit producers in other countries for whom the preferences were originally intended, but the exporters of third countries, such as the Brazilians.
A point of decisive significance is the recommendation to make the quotas the property of producers, stopping sugar beet processors from moving sugar production to third countries from the European Union.
Although on this question we have no legislative powers, and can only voice our opinion, I nevertheless trust that the Commission and the Council will take this opinion into account.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst I admire the way my colleagues have pursued the interests of farmers and share their anxiety about the future of farming, I cannot agree with the approach they outline in the resolution.
I much prefer the approach outlined by the Commissioner this morning.
A 33% reduction in price support for sugar, a reduction in the quota and an end to export subsidies for sugar would all send a powerful signal to the Doha Development Round.
If the Commissioner's timing can be adhered to and we can adopt our final proposal in November, this would create a very good environment in advance of the December Hong Kong meeting.
It would help to obtain a settlement at that meeting and any settlement would benefit both the developing and the developed world.
That would be good news.
My colleagues are also wrong about farmers, because their proposal would not provide certainty for farmers and would give them false expectations of the support they can expect in the future.
Finally, the 60% compensation scheme is equivalent to full compensation and the Commissioner should keep reiterating that.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been confronted with the necessity and challenge of reforming its sugar policy, and indeed its agricultural policy as a whole.
The current high sugar prices are having a negative impact on both European consumers and the poorest developing countries.
The previous reform proposal and quota distribution, however, were a good example of what not to do.
This proposal discriminated against the new Member States, which had already had to adapt to the quotas imposed upon them during the accession process.
I can illustrate this with the example of the Czech Republic, which during the 1990s cut annual production from over one million tonnes of sugar to 435Â 000 tonnes.
Manufacturing capacities were rationalised at the same time as these cuts were made, which means that production is now efficient and competitive.
Yet no such process has taken place in the old Member States, and this should not be forgotten when drafting the new reform proposal.
If quotas are to be reduced, then it is the turn of the old Member States to bear the brunt of these reductions.
What must not happen is a situation whereby the proposed quota for the Czech Republic, for example, is so low that the country cannot even produce enough sugar for domestic consumption.
This would not be because we would not be able to produce it efficiently; it would be so that other European producers could export their sugar to us, thus solving the problem of WTO restrictions at our expense.
Such a solution is not only uneconomical; it violates the basic principles of European integration.
I believe that those who draft the reform proposal will realise this and put forward a solution that does not discriminate against anyone.
I thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must surely be possible to take the multifarious statements that have been made today and make of some of them a legislative proposal for making sugar production sustainable both here and in what we call the developing world.
To those, however, who believe that a global market price must be imposed, I would like to say that nowhere in the world could anyone produce at such prices in a way that does not harm the environment, is socially just, and is also rational.
That is utterly out of the question.
As Brazil is on everyoneâs lips, let me say that, until a few years ago, the overwhelming majority did not care what happened to the plantation workers and the landless there.
I would warn against shedding crocodile tears, as Mr DeÃ has done, and many others to a lesser extent.
We are dealing here with a good measure of protectionism.
The Brazilian Government is endeavouring to introduce social and ecological standards in this area, and we should be supporting it in that.
If it succeeds in doing so, prices will rise in response to that, but let me remind you that they will still be only half what they are in the European Union.
I do believe, though, that we will come up with proper solutions.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner has heard many speeches today, as well as my remarks at the beginning of the debate this morning.
I believe that one country has caused this whole problem.
MadamÂ Commissioner, when we go to the Hong Kong Round, in my view you are slightly mistaken to think that reforming the sugar industry will give us a strong position in Europe.
I was present at CancÃºn, and if my memory serves me correctly, Mr Fischler had done a pretty good job of reforming the common agricultural policy.
But it was quite clear that no-one actually understood what had been done.
The Americans, in particular, seemed to draw the line and say âwe are not going to do anything except protect our agriculture and our businessâ.
It is clear that the sugar industry needs reforming: we have been dumping sugar on the world market and destroying it.
But have we actually destroyed the world market or, is it Brazil, as Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has just said?
MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned ACP and LDC countries.
Let us be absolutely clear that the LDC and ACP countries want access to our market, at market prices; that means keeping prices reasonably high in the European Union, so that they can have access at the prices they believe are safe for them.
I say to Mr Martin that I was surprised that the PSE Group tabled so many amendments, particularly to the resolution.
I did not realise its members felt they had the right to be spokesmen for the LDC and ACP countries, which have a slightly different view from what is proposed in their amendments.
I leave you with one last thought.
It is clear that the reform of the sugar industry will only benefit multinational companies, not the LDC and ACP countries.
Â Â  Mr President, answering all these very important questions within two-and-a-half minutes is not very easy, but I will do my best.
It is up to you to stop me when you think I have spoken long enough.
I have been listening with great interest to all the various statements.
I believe that we need an ambitious reform, a reform that actually brings the sugar regime into line with the 2003 CAP reform, allowing farmers to take decisions that are market-driven and not based on political decisions.
It must also be a reform that will enable the necessary restructuring of the sugar sector, to secure its long-term viability within the European Union.
As regards prices, let me be quite clear.
Maintaining prices at levels three times as high as world market prices is becoming increasingly difficult to justify and will certainly not lead to a sustainable European sugar sector.
We also need a reform in order to live up to our international commitments.
As for employment, the current regime does not guarantee the maintenance of jobs.
Over the last decade, 17Â 000 jobs have been lost as a result of continuous gains in productivity.
If the current regime remains unchanged, it is estimated that there would be around 15Â 000 fewer jobs in 2012, a loss of more than 75%.
The goal is therefore to achieve a competitive sugar sector in the Community, so that the remaining jobs in the sector enjoy long-term sustainability.
There were quite a few questions on impact assessment.
The Commission has carried out an impact analysis that gives a clear answer to the main questions relating to the reform proposal, including its regional effects.
I am convinced that more studies will not provide us with facts that we do not already know.
Further analyses will just lead to a further delay in the decisions that we really have to take.
On the point raised about ownership of quotas, under the current system the quotas for each Member State are fixed by a Council regulation.
The Member State then fixes the quantities each sugar producer is allowed to produce under the national quota, and the sugar producers themselves may then distribute sugar directly to the farmer on the basis of delivery rights.
Under the quota transfer system, as laid down in the Commission communication of last July, quotas may be transferred between sugar-producing companies, against payment, across national borders.
This would mean that companies have access to valuable quota rights, which can be transferred and then paid for.
The normal way to achieve this would be to allocate quotas to companies.
However, in the case of the transfer of a quota, the company concerned would not only have to use the money paid for the quota for its own restructuring, but also for compensating the sugar beet farmers for the devaluation of their delivery rights.
As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, I can envisage a restructuring fund system. Such a system could even leave the question of ownership of quotas untouched.
The payments out of the fund could take the form of compensatory payments to farmers who suffered from the abandonment of sugar production in a given area.
Many Members have criticised the transfer of quotas.
I am willing to explore further the suggestion of a European restructuring fund, which could facilitate a quick exit from the sector by operators who might be interested in going out of business.
This is an idea with tremendous legal, budgetary and political implications.
However, provided it could be implemented in a safe and equitable way, a restructuring fund could be another tool that might be of great importance to our sugar restructuring objectives.
It is clear that the reform will force farmers and producers to take important and sometimes difficult decisions about their future in the sector.
We must offer them a clear outlook and, therefore, I consider predictability to be a key issue.
I have taken note that this is a concern shared by Parliament.
I do not, therefore, intend to include the idea of a mid-term review in two or three years in the legislative proposals.
Instead, a long-term perspective should be offered.
Finally, let me summarise the main intentions of this reform.
It is important to pursue the principles and objectives set out in the July communication.
It is also important to have a long-term perspective, to bring prices and European production to a sustainable level and to reopen the EBA negotiations.
Then, with the help of the European Parliament, we must reach a final political agreement before this summer.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.15 p.m.
Â Â  I support the motion for a resolution, but at this stage I reject those amendments that run counter to the spirit of the motion, in particular those tabled by Mr van den Berg, Mrs Kinnock, MrsÂ SegelstrÃ¶m, Mr Andersson, Mrs Westlund, MrsÂ Hedh, and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, because on the pretext of on the one hand helping European consumers and on the other hand of helping the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the least-developed countries, it poses a threat to EU sugar beet and sugar cane producers, and in particular, to producers in the European Unionâs outermost regions, as it does not take the specific circumstances of those regions properly into consideration.
Â Â  The sugar-cane sector is of vital importance to the French Overseas DÃ©partements (DOMs) in terms of social, economic and environmental equilibrium.
This sector no longer has any room to manoeuvre when it comes to industrial restructuring, and it is unrealistic to envisage any overall conversion, given the current state of international competition in the market for tropical agricultural products.
The Commission must indicate what measures it has in mind in order to avoid the most remote regionsâ being doubly penalised by the reform in question.
In actual fact, those areas run the risk of suffering as a result of the proportionately more favourable treatment given to the ACP countries with which they are in direct competition, and as a result of the restrictions on their development capacity, whilst at the same time they do not play a part in the Community sugar surplus production.
It is absolutely essential that the Commission, in its next proposals for the reform of the sugar COM, should translate the promised âspecial treatmentâ for the extremely remote areas into specific technical measures accompanied by financial resources which correspond to the real needs of the sector and to the development objectives of those areas.
I am counting on your support, Commissioner, to ensure that the legislative proposals for reform which the Commission will shortly be submitting will show a better understanding of the situation in our most remote regions.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0039/2005) by MrsÂ Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the European action plan for organic food and farming [2004/2202(INI)].
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about organic farming there is a real paradox.
Everyone â including you, Commissioner, and the European Commission as a whole â recognises the undeniable benefits of organic farming, in terms of the environment, biodiversity and health, but also in terms of employment and rural development.
However, despite a growing demand on the part of consumers for products originating from organic farming, the organically farmed areas and organic production are not increasing, and still represent a very marginal share of overall production of agricultural products.
It was with great astonishment that we learned of the Commissionâs action plan in favour of organic farming, which we had been hoping would be particularly ambitious and accompanied by the appropriate resources.
This is not how it has turned out, however, even though we note, with evident satisfaction, some welcome proposals, such as the public awareness and information campaigns, or the emphasis placed on public canteens and school meals in particular.
Moreover, when it comes to organic products we could make a start with the catering facilities at the European Parliament itself.
You do not identify any specific resources, i.e. additional resources, and nor are there any proactive â let alone mandatory â measures with regard to Member States, even though the need to harmonise the different policies of Member States on organic farming would appear to be obvious to everybody if we really want to contribute to the development of organic farming and reduce the disparities that exist.
Nor do we find any progress on the nonetheless crucial question of genetically modified organisms, the coexistence of conventional crops alongside organic crops, or the issue of liability in cases of contamination.
We are waiting for your proposals on these matters, without which Member States will finally be left entirely to their own devices on issues which are, after all, essential to organic farming.
This is why the Members of the European Parliament wanted to see a much firmer commitment to organic farming, much firmer than information campaigns which, useful though they may be, seem to us to be an inadequate response to the issues at stake.
Consequently, we believe that major investments need to be made, in particular to make the specifications for different products in different Member States more consistent and more precise, and to make better use of rural development funds by defining much more clearly the share which is assigned to organic farming.
We hope that the FEADER programme, which is devoted to rural development, will make it possible to reply to these questions.
These rural development funds also need to be strengthened.
There are substantial threats hanging over these funds, and we cannot accept the plans to reduce the European Unionâs overall budget, which would be likely to damage them badly.
We would also like to make organic farming the subject of priority research within the framework of the European research programmes.
We want increased aid to be granted to the economic structuring of the organic sector, from production and processing to distribution and marketing.
Unless this sector is strengthened, we shall not achieve any real progress.
It is also necessary to settle the issue of genetically modified organisms, and to improve significantly the inspection and fraud control systems in this area.
All this must be done in collaboration with the people involved in the sector, the producer associations, consumers, cooperatives and all those who have been committed, for many years, to organic farming, unfortunately without much support.
The European Parliament must also be fully associated with these policies, and I would draw your attention to the fact that any amendment to the regulation on organic farming should also be the subject of consultations with the Members of the European Parliament.
Finally, we really must move away from the idea of a ânicheâ as far as organic farming is concerned.
It is not a small, separate sector destined for a sympathetic clientele which is well motivated with regard to environmental issues, and with a high disposable income which will enable it to have access to this type of food.
On the contrary, we believe that organic farming can be the spearhead of a truly sustainable agricultural industry.
As part of any future reforms of the common agricultural policy, which are, as we all know, inevitable, we believe that organic farming can serve as a model. Obviously, it is not a model that is 100% reproducible everywhere, but we believe that this type of farming, the merits and benefits of which are recognised by everyone, should be strongly supported and encouraged so that it can achieve much higher percentages of overall agricultural production.
We are therefore counting on action on the part of the Members of the European Parliament, and we hope that the Commission will listen to this desire to declare support for organic farming in much stronger terms.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Members for their comments.
The action plan gave me an opportunity to listen carefully to the stakeholders and to make use of their practical experiences in the further development of the agricultural sector.
Let me just mention the main points that we have to keep in mind.
Firstly, this is an initial attempt to build a comprehensive policy for organic farming within the European Union.
Secondly, organic farming plays an essential role in the reform of the CAP.
Thirdly, it is difficult to see a credible future for organic farming without sufficient market demand.
I hope to return to give you my final comments and to listen to those of the Members of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Thank you very much, especially for being so concise.
I anticipate that the Commissioner will have a further opportunity to comment on the various interventions at the end of proceedings.
As the time allowed has elapsed, I shall now suspend the debate.
The debate will resume at approximately 12.15 p.m., after the formal part of our sitting, and it will be followed by the concluding remarks.
Thank you.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Ambassadors, a year ago, on the initiative of the European Parliament, our Union decided that 11 March would become European Day for the Victims of Terrorism.
And we did so because, a year ago, Madrid awoke to the blasts of the bombs that cost the lives of 192 citizens of various countries.
Spain has unfortunately become accustomed to the threat of terrorism.
For many years we endured it.
Many people were killed.
But, even during the toughest times in the fight against the terrorist group ETA, Spanish society never gave up its freedom.
Nevertheless, on that 11 March, that new and even more horrific attack added to the dynamic created by another attack, 11Â SeptemberÂ 2001 in New York and in Washington, which had woken the western world from its confident tranquillity and changed the worldâs geopolitical pattern.
On that 11 September, we said that we were all Americans.
Then, in March, in Madrid, we said that we were all passengers on the Atocha trains.
Today, in the Plaza de Atocha, the candles which turned it into a shrine of commemoration are no longer there, but the memory is still there, the memory of the victims who, as a sign of our respect, must become the symbol of our unity and not the banners of our political confrontation.
Our first tribute to the victims must be to make them the symbol of unity amongst democrats, the symbol of the unity amongst those of us who believe in the rule of law and human rights.
On that 11 March, the Europeans came face-to-face with a global view of the problem of terrorism.
Until then, each country had had its own terrorists, but after 11Â September, firstly, and then 11 March, terrorism took on a global dimension that required a global response.
We Europeans came to realise that our values, and not just our lives, were threatened, and we therefore reacted together without forgetting that the fight for democracy was and would remain at the heart of our European political project.
Let us remember that democracy has never succumbed to terrorism, but that military resources alone do not create it.
Firstly, we must look back and assess how we were able to respond to those events.
The first conclusion we should draw is that, perhaps, the deaths in Madrid were not in vain because, shortly afterwards, Europe reached an agreement that unblocked the drafting of its Constitution, which is now subject to ratification.
They were perhaps a wake-up call that allowed us to overcome many of our differences.
Secondly, we must ascertain whether we have really applied the commitments we made then, whether we have fulfilled all the agreements we reached amongst ourselves and whether we have really applied the measures we promised to apply.
In this regard, perhaps we should acknowledge that we have not applied everything that our emotions at that time inspired us to agree.
Many of the measures provided for in the action plan adopted by the Council following 11 March have yet to be fully applied, which must remind us that in order to combat terrorism we also need more Europe, because we are now aware that the traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation are not enough.
The European Parliament has always been in the vanguard in the fight against terrorism, despite the limited role attributed to it by the Treaties in this area.
This is clearly not the time to present a long list of everything Parliament has done, but I would like to express our profound conviction that the greater the Member Statesâ capacity to exchange police and security information is, the more effective policing will be, and we must therefore ask ourselves the question now, at a time when we are remembering the victims: what are the remaining fundamental problems preventing Europol from being fully operative?
When will we have a European Prosecutor?
When will we have European legislation to prevent the laundering of capital...
... which is a fundamental element in the fight against organised crime and its links with terrorism?
There has been positive progress in these fields, but some of the decisions adopted â and I am simply talking about what was decided following 11 September â have yet to see the light.
I do not understand your indignation, because many political leaders from all over the world are discussing this very thing today in Madrid.
That is what is being discussed today in Madrid at the International Conference, which is being attended by many dignitaries and experts from all over the world, and which I will attend following this formal sitting, together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Anan, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who will present an action plan drawn up by the Commission for combating terrorism, which refers to some of the measures I have just mentioned.

Yes, there in Madrid, and the day before yesterday here in Brussels and in Strasbourg, the need to combat terrorism from a global and complete point of view is being discussed, starting with full respect for the rule of law and not forgetting to look into the causes of terrorism and the instruments allowing it to grow and spread around the world.
Let us not forget that, in order to guarantee our security, it is essential to promote dialogue and integration between cultures and religions, without forgetting development cooperation.
This is not a comfortable or easy debate, but we cannot avoid it.
There can be no explanation or justification for terrorism, but there are reasons why it arises and our analysis must take them into account.
This analysis must take account of the need not just to respect the values and fundamental rights which form the basis of our Community, but also to apply preventive measures which not only prevent us from having to show regret every time, but which prevent us from ever having to do so.
I am not of course just talking about prevention through war.
I am talking about prevention in the broadest sense of the word.
Internal and external prevention, within our societies, in order to ensure the integration of migrants, tolerance, religious and cultural pluralism, the fight against discrimination, cooperation between intelligence services and judicial systems...
... and also external action on many fronts: war, poverty, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; a world framework for combating terrorism, without forgetting, ladies and gentlemen â representatives of the citizens of Europe â that the most effective way and the basis for all forms of combating terrorism, is respect for the values upon which our Union is founded.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ambassadors, in memory of those victims, who, as I said, must be the symbol of our democratic Union, I would invite you to observe a minuteâs silence.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we shall resume the debate on the Aubert Report for about a quarter of an hour, so that we can close it and vote on it during this morningâs voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is an important topic for us to be dealing with, and consumers will be becoming ever more aware of it in the future.
Our group has examined the issue of organic farming in very great depth, and regards it as very important.
Indispensable though traditional agriculture is, we also have to consider its organic counterpart, and not only as a small sectoral niche with limited aims, but as something that will in future be a truly complementary source of supplies.
For this reason, and also speaking for my group, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her particular concern for this issue, which she has again underlined in her brief statement today.
We must redouble our efforts.
We have to stimulate demand, and we can do that only if we are able to iron out or resolve the problems in production, processing and operation.
Although I do not, right now, want to go into details, for which I lack both the time and the capacity for attention, I do believe that a great deal of effort and quite a bit of imagination has gone into the 21Â actions and three priority areas; what we need, though, is a bit more courage, including when it comes to setting aside the financial means needed to acquire human resources.
That this must involve a timetable and the necessary controls is self-evident.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Aubert on her report, which was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and by expressing the Socialist Groupâs satisfaction with the final result of the report.
At committee stage, all of our amendments have been incorporated, and this has substantially improved the Commission's initial proposal, which began with 21Â measures which were not very concrete, not at all ambitious and in no way binding.
One of the objectives of the reform of the CAP is to combine the production of quality products with respect for the environment, and this type of agriculture is precisely the fundamental pillar required in order to achieve that twin objective.
In certain European regions, such as Andalusia, over the last decade we have increased the area dedicated to these crops from 2Â 000 to 300Â 000 hectares as a result of the regional government being the first in Europe to have a serious and budgeted action plan for ecological crops.
In general terms, the sector is increasing by an average of 30% per year.
We will all agree, therefore, that, if the CAP acknowledges the importance of ecological agriculture, which is increasing, as has been pointed out, we cannot and must not leave the farmers and the Member States on their own at the end of the day.
Neither is leaving it to the States to decide whether or not to promote this type of production the best solution.
We in my group essentially believe that the Commission is being inconsistent.
The qualities and virtues of this very important sector are stressed but at the same time it is not given clear and decisive support.
Gestures are not enough.
We also need real action and budgets.
Ecological agriculture must become an integral part of a production system that supports the environment.
We are working on the basis of a reality on which, furthermore, there is unanimity: farmers, consumers and all political bodies have shown a renewed interest in the phenomenon of ecological agriculture.
It therefore falls to us in the European Parliament to insist on and encourage clear and decisive support for this type of agriculture.
We believe that the action plan that we are voting on today is a first step and an opportunity for debate, but it is a weak and unambitious step.
We shall not pretend that we did not want to go further.
For example, the committee would have considered it appropriate to establish specific aid for the sector.
More support is needed for marketing, certification, control, etc.
Having said that, however, we believe that the Commission should go ahead with this plan.
But what we must ask, particularly while the Commissioner is present, is that it be a genuine action plan and not simply a suggestion plan, and that Parliament show decisive support for this very important sector and this pioneering action plan that the sector needed so much.
Â Â  , Ladies and gentlemen, authorising genetically modified organisms in agriculture, animal husbandry and on the Unionâs market represents a major threat to organic farming, and above all to consumer health.
It makes no sense to resort to GMOs in the event of overproduction of natural crops.
The introduction of GMOs will result in the devastation of the natural environment.
There may well be unexpected consequences for future generations, for example serious allergies, and also increased resistance of pests and weeds, increased resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and the disappearance of beneficial insects.
Authorising GMOs will result in disputes amongst farmers.
Those who decide to use GMOs in their production will be burdened with costs because of large claims.
They will become dependent on the biotech companies.
Potential controls on GMOs do not guarantee effectiveness.
Dutch research confirms that it is almost impossible to produce meat without GMOs.
Facts such as these undermine consumer confidence in organic farming.
The laws of biology mean it is impossible for traditional farming to coexist with GMO farming.
The Union is demonstrating its own kind of legal schizophrenia by authorising GMOs on the market whilst banning the use of GMOs in agriculture and cattle raising in organic farming.
In view of the major dangers posed by GMOs, which are not yet fully understood, the European Parliament and the Commission are taking on an enormous moral responsibility by legislating in a way that runs counter to nature and the good of mankind.
The future of European farming lies in organic agriculture and animal husbandry based on traditional and natural methods.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this debate because, following the reform of the CAP, farmers need to look at alternative methods of increasing farm incomes.
For some farmers this could be organic farming.
In Northern Ireland we have a small but determined organic sector.
Local supply and local branding are keys to success.
There is little point in the farmers in the United Kingdom diversifying into organic production only to be undermined by products from South America coming in at a lower cost.
Products from outside the United Kingdom may be organically produced, though in truth little is known as to whether environmental damage is done in producing some of those goods.
The number of air miles involved in transporting the products is also a consumer concern.
Those issues need to be factored into the WTO negotiations.
I am also concerned about United Kingdom organic farmers being undermined by products from Eastern European countries.
Again, short food miles and local branding are essential.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the production of organic products cannot be seen as a utopian economic and social policy.
On the contrary, it is a strategic policy which safeguards a new qualitative consumer standard, a new environmental standard and a new dimension to rural development.
It is a framework which guarantees the protection of public health and a new way of safeguarding the competitiveness of agriculture.
I should like to highlight two issues which are important to the further development and promotion of organic products as a dynamic sector in forthcoming years.
First, the Member States must, when planning the application of the reformed common agricultural policy at national level, encourage young farmers to become active in the production of organic products, as well as granting rights from their national reserves for the promotion of organic farming in designated areas.
The second issue â and this relates to the first â is the problem of the coexistence of organic crops and genetically modified products.
Organic farming and the production of agricultural products with integrated management will be destroyed.
They will be contaminated by the production of modified crops which, in addition, will also contaminate public health, in other words our health.
The Commission and certain Member States must understand this and must renounce modified products, because the repercussions for our health are more dangerous than the repercussions from mad cow disease.
The European Union cannot be hypocritical by promoting crops which respect public health and the environment, on the one hand, while allowing products such as modified products, on the other.
It is time we made an honest decision for the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, organic farming means nature governing food, but the EU wants a law of nature written in Brussels.
The EU wishes to harmonise organic products and production, with more EU regulations and more EU snoopers.
It is âstraight bananaâ time again!
Organic products come in all shapes and sizes, but the EU cannot accept that.
The EU believes that nothing should escape manic control.
People are selling food in pounds and ounces. When they are caught they are treated as criminals.
Why?
Because this is EU control for the sake of it.
The report praises the common agricultural policy, which was one of the worst EU mistakes ever.
The CAP destroyed areas of British agriculture, and now the EU wants to destroy British organic agriculture.
UKIP wants to see organic farming flourishing, not buried under tonnes of EU manure.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time people used nitrates, pesticides and herbicides, and they were driven out of agricultural paradise.
Now we cannot even eat Golden Delicious apples any more.
Before, thanks to the good old organic pig, we could have tapeworms and other parasites, and with grannyâs delicious home-made jams we could die of botulism.
Now, thanks to industrial farming, we are living 25Â years longer!
We shall therefore have to change all that, and go back to the age of Cro-Magnon man, to a landscape of biodiversity where the 130 000 organic farmers can frisk about, and where the 230 000 organic cows, the 400Â 000Â organic sheep and the 230 000 organic pigs can all live happily.
It is only one per cent of agriculture, but it is one per cent that changes everything.
It is like the parting of the Red Sea, like Mahomet on his mare, or like Jesus returning at Easter. Organic farming is like that: it is of no earthly use, but it makes life bearable.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to emphasise one recommendation of this report: the need for clarity in GMOs.
I want it to be clarified that GMOs will never be allowed to contaminate an organic farm.
This kind of clarity cannot be given on the basis of coexistence and promises of compensation after contamination: after contamination it is too late, it is no good to an organic farmer or to people who value their produce.
GM crops are an experiment, by any definition.
A good scientific experiment needs a control.
I do not support the experiment, but if it is to go ahead I recommend Ireland as the perfect control.
It is an island with predominantly westerly winds and therefore significantly protected from contamination by GMOs from neighbouring countries.
With the control, we will be able properly to assess GM crops for 5, 10 or 50Â years; if GM bellies up, there will be somewhere to get safe food and seed stocks.
Today the European Council is deciding whether to write the public out of the GMO process.
Will the Council today, with the support of my own country, Ireland, make GMOs exempt from the Aarhus Convention?
This must not happen.
It is an issue of vital importance to organic farmers and their customers and to all stakeholders.
We must insist on the right to take part in all decisions made about our environment.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report on organic food and farming.
The growth of this industry in some Member States is to be applauded, but it must be acknowledged that some Member States have provided less financial support than others.
These include the United Kingdom, where nothing more than lip service has been paid to the development of organic farming.
I realise that you cannot force people either to grow or to eat organic food.
However, I strongly believe that you should encourage both, and that if the will is there the desire will be there too.
We now have an opportunity to encourage diversification.
Following the mid-term review, farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business.
Unfortunately, I believe that leaving this to Member States would be a total disaster.
Many will do nothing to either encourage demand or improve marketing for organic farming, which faces the same challenges as other branches of the industry, with the growing power of multinationals squeezing profit margins and dictating standards.
Organic production is no longer a niche market.
It is the long-term future of agriculture.
The support provided to organic farming should be used to help open up new opportunities for the sector and to create an alternative to so-called conventional farming.
Both sectors have a future, side-by-side.
Both must be mutual and complementary.
The one thing I now see clearly is that there are no real level playing fields in agricultural production, be this organic or conventional, and I firmly believe you can only achieve this from the centre and with positive encouragement.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make a few comments on the report.
First, with regard to public support for sustainable agriculture, the action plan acknowledges the role of organic farming in society.
In delivering public goods, organic farmers incur high production costs.
They should be entitled to be compensated for income foregone and costs incurred when delivering those public goods.
That is exactly what we recommend that Member States do within their own development programmes.
On the other hand, as stated in the report, the successful development of organic farming depends crucially on customersâ willingness to pay a higher price to have organic food.
That brings me to the next point: promotion and marketing.
Consumers must be given the correct information in order to stimulate demand.
The Commission has already contributed to organic food information and promotion campaigns.
I am fully aware that we need to make use of the best expertise available when taking the further steps set out in the plan.
I have a great deal of sympathy for your call to promote organic food for children and school canteens, but want to have advice on this from specialists.
We need to be sure that we reach our target groups, and must therefore use the right channels in our marketing campaigns.
Regarding the internal market, I share your concerns about the obstacles that might hamper trade.
Organic food that has been produced in accordance with all the requirements of EU legislation should have access to all EU organic markets.
The European logo can play an important role in making this happen.
At the same time, I see no contradiction in organic producers underlining the region of origin of their own products if they wish to.
Innovation in organic farming and food processing relies, to a great extent, on research.
We have already seen an increase in organic research and there is more to come.
However, it is not up to the Commission to prescribe in detail the different research subjects.
With regard to coexistence, the action plan is not the right place to address this issue, since organic farming is not the only area concerned.
At the end of the year the Commission will issue a report on the national coexistence measures which will show what further steps need to be taken.
The action plan recommends that Member States make full use of the rural development policy possibilities available; not only agri-environmental measures, but also investment, extension services, quality schemes and all the other rural development elements that can be used to help organic farmers extend their production.
I appreciate the comments you have made and look forward to working with you on this important issue in the future.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during voting time, which will begin now.
Â Â  Mr President, a few minutes ago we were called in this Parliament to observe a moment of silence in memory of those who died in the terrorism events in Spain and to remember all those of our constituents who have died from terrorism.
It was a solemn moment; it was a special moment; it was a potent moment.
Every Member of this House was silent, all our visitors in the gallery were silent, but that silence was wrecked by the noise of a camera clicking away persistently.
Mr President, I ask that when we have a moment of solemn silence it should mean silence for the cameramen and everybody in this Chamber and not just for those on the ground floor.
Â Â  Mr Bowis, your comment will be passed on.
Moreover, I should also like to have silence during debates here in the House, particularly when the Commissioner is speaking, because I can assure you that that does not always happen.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not wish to delay this House too much longer, but I would like to make one trenchant point.
We were summoned here to vote, originally at 12.00, then at 12.15 and now here we are voting at nearly 12.40.
You will be aware that there is a strike on today and travelling is excessively difficult.
A number of colleagues are having to leave at unearthly hours because they have to make different travel arrangements and, consequently, will not be able to participate in all the votes.
It is a constant disgrace that business is chopped and changed in this Parliament without consulting those who really count: the Members sitting here.
Â Â  Very well, I shall pass on your comment to the session staff, but I would remind Members that we also have votes following this afternoonâs debates.
Nevertheless, I shall do my best to make up for the delay, without going too fast.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, paragraph 7, in the English version, presents a linguistic problem.
I would therefore ask that the word ââ be replaced by ââ and that the word ââ be added, so that the second part of paragraph 7 would read: âThis really is just about the English version and this linguistic difficulty.
Â Â  I have an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to add, after âbusiness and industryâ, âe.g. by involving the technology platformsâ.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this addition?
Â Â  Mr President, there is something I just wanted to ask Mr RÃŒbig.
I apologise for intervening, but last night, we agreed, indirectly and informally, that, on the last part, the European Peopleâs Party and the Liberals would not vote for the deletion of the whole paragraph, and that we, in return, would vote in favour of the Conservativesâ and Liberalsâ amendment.
Perhaps Mr RÃŒbig would say something about that?
Â Â  Mrs Mann, you are certainly not inconveniencing the President. On the contrary, I was expecting this to happen because I had heard rumours to that effect.
I was therefore waiting for someone from the benches of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to stand up and ask for the final part of their amendment, which seeks the deletion of the last part of Paragraph 21, to be abandoned.
Is there a member of the PPE-DE who would like to speak on this subject?
Â Â  Mr President, we agree with Mrs Erika Mann and her group.
Â Â  To sum up then, Amendment No 5 by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats adds the words âin addition to representatives of the world of business and industryâ, no longer asks for the deletion of the end of Paragraph 21, and is supplemented by Mr Prodiâs oral amendment.
Â Â  I voted in favour of Mrs Jensenâs report on Parliament's estimates for an amending budget of the European Union for the financial year 2005 (salary adjustment), as I believe it is important to consider a reduction in personnel costs in the 2005 budget.
Parliamentâs 2005 budget earmarked appropriations for the implementation of the equipment purchasing policy.
I believe that those appropriations should be used to finance priorities for which there is at present no financial provision in the budget, such as preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Lastly, I would like to emphasise that as the necessary funding for the development of the activities of the Community institutions has already been earmarked, we need to be strict about the prudent and judicious management of public monies, which come from the pockets of our taxpayers.
Â Â  This motion for a resolution arises from the identification of a surplus in the 2005 budget because the 2004 salary adjustment, which was approved by the Council at the end of 2004, was just 0.7% instead of the 2.6% envisaged when the budgets of the institutions were being drawn up.
These surpluses will make it possible both to free up some of the appropriations included in the 2005 budget in relation to fixed assets policy, making it possible for the Parliament to purchase buildings that are currently leased, and, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out, to finance areas for which funding is not at present provided in the budget, such as preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
I voted in favour, of course.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo (A6-0047/2005) on draft amending budget No 1/2005 of the European Union for the financial year 2005, because I accept the modifications made to the organisational structure of the Commissionâs services following the appointment of the new Commission and the distribution of portfolios amongst the new Commissioners, which made changes essential.
That being the case, these changes should be incorporated into the amending budget in the most transparent and efficient way possible.
I welcome the neutral impact of these changes on the budget.
Â Â  The aim of this first draft amending budget is to make the necessary budget-neutral technical changes to the 2005 budget as a consequence of the revision of the servicesâ organisational structure in connection with the appointment of the new Commission and the distribution of portfolios amongst the Commissioners.
It is important to remember that although it is an administrative body, the new Commission undertook to make this the âcompetitiveness and cohesionâ budget.
Furthermore, the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy that we voted on yesterday calls for greater determination and creativity in pursuing its objectives.
The Commission has been given the appropriate cooperation by Parliament.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I am convinced that the Commission will make good use of this instrument and that it will deploy its resources to achieve those objectives, thus justifying the very firm support it received in the relevant committee.
Â Â  At a time when the damage both to the environment and to public health caused by conventional methods of food production indicates that it is vital to look for alternatives, and that there is a need to guarantee access to safe and sustainably produced food, it is important for the European Parliament to adopt a position on this.
Support is needed for organic production methods, in view of their respect for environmental balance.
This support may be in the form of incentives for producers or in the form of measures to protect organic crops from the risks involved in the use of GMOs.
The risks to the environment caused by GMOs are not yet known, and there is no way to guarantee their containment, and there is therefore a danger that they will contaminate the species alongside which they are grown.
Â Â  I voted in favour of Mrs Aubertâs report on the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming, because I believe that it raises fundamental questions about the very future of organic farming.
We need to be aware that this type of agriculture now accounts for an important share of the food market and of agricultural production in the European Union.
The Action Plan sets out to address three key priorities: information-led development of the organic food market by providing the public with more information and increasing consumer awareness; making public support for organic farming more effective; and improving and reinforcing the Communityâs organic farming standards and import and inspection requirements.
These priorities should consequently be aimed above all at endeavouring to effectively overcome the specific difficulties inherent in the special nature of organic farming, throughout the whole industry, from production through to distribution.
A European action plan for organic farming should be ambitious, given that organic farming is not just limited to the production of food, but also has a far wider environmental and social role.
Â Â  Organic issues are of great importance in todayâs world.
Since 1985, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of agricultural holdings and acreage devoted to organic farming.
Yet there has been a major slowdown in this growth in recent years because of problems relating to the production, processing and distribution of these products.
The report before us advocates the introduction of additional and enhanced measures with a view to eliminating these obstacles.
The main objective is to raise everyoneâs awareness, and not just that of an urban minority, of the advantages of organic produce for the environment.
An improvement in Community legislation, including the common agricultural policy, and an increase in public aid, are essential if we are to make organic farming a more dynamic aspect of sustainable agriculture.
At a time when the environment should be a priority, this issue should be high on the agenda.
Given that I am certain that the high price of organic products is the main obstacle to their consumption, I am convinced that developing support for organic farming will result in a reduction in the price of organic produce and consequently in an increase in the consumption of organic products by the public at large.
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of Mrs Aubert's report which encourages the development of organic food and agriculture.
These practices have been developing constantly in Europe for several years now and meet a demand from European consumers for a healthy and varied diet.
To reassure both farmers and the public, it is also vital to establish rigorous controls to prevent the risk of contamination in the event of the coexistence of organic and transgenic crops.
This is also the Belgian position: the assessment of controls and risks linked to GMOs must be based on independent scientific reports.
Additionally, it is urgent to provide solutions for the specific problems being encountered by organic farmers: in Belgium, consumer demand for organic produce is far from consistent and often varies in line with food scares.
Farmers suffer from these fluctuations whereas, instead, they should be seeing the reward for all their efforts and investment.
It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which certain farmers are forced to sell at a loss.
Defending organic farming means taking a stand for quality and safety, not forgetting freedom of choice for consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, if I had been given the chance to speak in the debate on International Womenâs Day and Beijing + 10, I would have said that it was actually a shame that violence against women is a long-running issue in this House, although thankfully it is less prevalent than other important problems that affect far more women â untold millions of them, in fact, who have for years been waiting for solutions called for, I might add, by overwhelming majorities in this House.
Let me take as an example the splitting of pensions entitlements acquired during marriage, so that a woman who wholly or partly gave up work in order to devote herself to her family duties is not left without social security after divorce.
We therefore need a framework directive to put a stop to divorce tourism in the EU.
I also recall our 1996 report on the status of spouses who help out in small businesses and in agriculture.
Ten years ago, we were demanding the lifting of directive 86 on the equal treatment of self-employed men and women and the spouses who help them out.
Nothing has happened!
If I may now turn to the battered wives, let me add that men get beaten up too.
Since 2003, Luxembourg has had a law that has already helped a great deal; its law on domestic violence bars violent men from the home, so that, if the man turns violent, it is he who has to leave the shared home, rather than the woman and her children having to flee to a refuge for battered women or to her family.
It would be appropriate if the Commission were to recommend to all the Member States that they adopt a law along those lines if they have not already done so.
There would then be no need for Beijing + 10!
Â Â  . Despite voting against the resolution on the World Conference on Women, the Christian Union/SGP is not at all opposed to the women being treated normally in this society.
We unreservedly support the fight against the abuse of women, their genital mutilation, trafficking in them, the custom of giving women away in marriage and honour killings.
In addition, equal access to good education and good health care is important to everyone.
There are, however, a number of ideas that we are unable to back.
We do not reject participation by women in the labour process, but an enforced gender distribution according to numbers does not do justice to reality.
Capacities and aptitudes are the criteria according to which job applicants must be selected; whether they are men or women is less relevant in this context.
Individuals and organisations should both have freedom of choice.
It is up to the people and organisations themselves to make choices with regard to their personal privacy or their internal structure and external representation, provided no improper means or methods are used in the process.
Finally, situations in the medical-ethical field must be treated with the utmost care.
Man is not the last link in an evolutionary process, but is a being who was given life by his Creator.
He should treat his own life, that of others, as well as existing and unborn life, with due responsibility.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has voted in favour of the resolution but wishes to emphasise certain problems we see with the wording.
The resolution regards the worldâs women as a homogeneous group, a fact we regard as very unfortunate, because the position of women varies very dramatically indeed from one country to the next.
The situation of women in the developing countries is confused with the situation of women in Europe, as if they were comparable problems.
Problems such as rape in war, honour killings and genital mutilation cannot, as has been done in the resolution, be compared with issues relating to lifelong learning, the allocation of quotas and the number of monthsâ paternity leave.
The resolution confuses issues that belong at EU level with those that are quite clearly national issues or, quite simply, matters to be decided by individuals.
We should have preferred it if the focus had been upon women in the developing countries, where they are in a very vulnerable situation.
The wordings concerning the developing countries relate, to a large degree, to issues to which the EU should call attention in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in aid policy.
We should have liked the resolution to have stood up for menâs and womenâs equal rights and the defence of human rights throughout the world.
Â Â  On 10Â MarchÂ 2005, I voted against the resolution on the Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women â Platform for Action (Beijing +10).
This was because the resolution was particularly short-sighted and poorly thought out.
It contained many appropriate proposals but also many quite inappropriate ones, some of which were simply ridiculous.
An example of the latter is paragraphÂ 12, the measure providing for gender equality to be incorporated into the Structural Funds.
There is also the call for women to constitute 40% of the staff of peacekeeping or conflict prevention missions.
I wish to register a particular protest against paragraphÂ 13, which contains a reference to female reproductive health.
In the final analysis, it was because of that wording that I was unable to vote in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on the resolution concerning the 4th World Conference on Women because we do not believe that it deals with the most vital issues appropriately or in a truly practical way.
The over-prescriptive references to 'gender mainstreaming', 'gender-based budgeting' and the call for rigid enforcement of quota systems are examples of this.
The Conservative Party leads the way in championing respect and rights for women.
Human trafficking, prostitution and genital mutilation are just some of the horrors facing girls and women in developing countries.
But they cannot be dealt with only through financial aid, though aid is clearly needed; nor can they be dealt with by legislation, although legislation can of course help in appropriate cases.
Womens' freedom will only be guaranteed if there is a proper programme of education extending to both sexes and vigorously pursued.
Â Â  . On this World Womenâs Day 2005, I would like to focus attention on all women who go about performing their duties in a perfectly normal way.
I would like to make their primary concerns â provision for families, for children, and also for older people â matters of political interest.
We talk a lot about gender mainstreaming; I would ask that we also give thought to family mainstreaming when taking policy decisions that affect society.
In future, when taking policy decisions, we have to examine the effect they will have on families; state programmes for encouraging women to return to work, in particular, must in future be guided by the principle of family mainstreaming.
Work and society must fit the family rather than the other way round.
Agricultural statistics, for example, still take insufficient account of the work done by farmersâ wives.
On commercial farms, women work for around 63 hours a week.
Agricultural statistics first deduct around 50% under the heading of provision for the family.
Farmersâ wives do unpaid work at home, on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job, but statistics take no account of what they do; it is still not taken seriously by society, and is not recognised as an economic factor.
Generally speaking, the services performed by women must be fully taken into account in calculating the gross national product.
Â Â  At last, the European Parliament is including among its priority aims in the defence of the dignity of women, the serious issue of female genital mutilation.
All too often, Europe has announced its good intentions of defending the dignity of the individual, of women or children, without being able to translate that into concrete and genuinely effective action.
We hope that todayâs initiative is a turning point in tackling seriously the phenomenon of female genital mutilation, a phenomenon which has nothing whatsoever to do with the respect for the traditions and cultures of other nations, since barbarity is not culture.
We therefore propose that a directive should be issued prohibiting the practice of female sexual mutilation, that steps should be taken to provide proper education on the problem, and, in particular, to provide support to immigrants from countries in which these customs are tolerated and even considered legitimate.
Additionally, we believe it is necessary that a public awareness campaign should be promoted on the phenomenon of violence against women, that proper information should be made available on respect for womenâs health and physical safety and that the criminal law of European Union Member States should treat the practice of sexual mutilation of women as an aggravating factor in the crime of assault and battery.
Â Â  Taking advantage of the fact that the plenary is meeting on International Womenâs Day, Parliament has decided, by means of this motion for a resolution, to highlight some well-known aspects of the situation of women which are to be deplored and which we should combat.
Anyone who is opposed to a gender war or to a quota policy or to confusing what is it to be in a minority with what it is to be a woman, is all the more duty-bound to fight for full respect for womenâs unique role in society, in the family and as individuals, and for legal provisions to apply which give them genuine equality, while respecting the natural differences between all of us and in particular fully respecting something that is vital regardless of gender: individual liberty, and each personâs inalienable right to individual happiness.
Â Â  This week we are celebrating International Womenâs Day, which gives us an opportunity to take stock of the progress made at world level as regards womenâs equality, liberty, development, recognition and participation in civic life.
I believe that collective awareness raising about the enormous amount that remains to be done is very important, and that the EU should remain at the forefront of a just battle, which, while favouring women, is not exclusively a womenâs issue, but one for humankind as a whole.
The innumerable afflictions and dangers faced by many millions of women all over the world are extremely serious, and deserve a prompt, full and unreserved response.
At the same time, I feel bound to say that I regret the fact that on the pretext of these fine-sounding but vague principles and concepts, attempts are being made to treat certain practices that fly in the face of such rights as rights in themselves â for example abortion, which is conveniently disguised and played down under the disingenuously employed banner of âsexual and reproductive healthâ.
Â Â  â Violence against women comes in many different forms: physical or psychological violence, rape, domestic slavery, the sex trade and prostitution, etc. They are ubiquitous and constantly on the increase.
In our so-called âcivilisedâ countries which pride themselves on their respect for human rights and the rights of citizens, did you know that in France, six women die every month as a result of domestic violence, with almost no public reaction?
Did you know that, in 2002, this violence was covered by an amnesty, while there is no amnesty for the mistreatment of animals?
Surely women are not considered as being less worthy of protection.
Only a few days ago, police violently beat women who were demonstrating peacefully in Istanbul.
That has to stop.
We need to tackle the factors which, as in the case of women in Islam, contribute directly or indirectly to their subjugation.
It is intolerable that, in our countries and throughout the world, archaic and inhumane practices such as excision, honour crimes, stoning and decapitation should be accepted.
This day devoted to women must not just be a symbolic event; it must be an opportunity for true awareness of women's rights in France and throughout the world.
Â Â  I welcome the fact that, as part of the celebration of International Womenâs Day, the European Parliament decided to hold a debate to mark the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and, in particular, to focus on domestic violence.
Given the worrying scale of this blight on society, I support the idea of 2006 being designated European Year against Violence against Women.
However, in addition to symbolic gestures, I also consider that the EU should play a leading role in taking practical steps to establish gender equality.
I firmly believe that we should move on from mere political recognition to practical application in our day-to-day lives.
In the area that I follow most closely, social policy, there is a need to strengthen all those measures that help to combat all aspects of inequality between men and women in the workplace, be it wage levels, career progression or access to the labour market.
The Nordic countries have very low levels of unemployment, and one of the reasons for this is that they have encouraged greater employability amongst women.
By the same token, given that the labour market is becoming ever more demanding, it is important for flexible working conditions to take into account key values such as the balance between family and professional life âŠ
Â Â  â MrÂ President, of course I am against the trade in both organs and eggs.
It is a despicable practice.
However, I cannot agree with the text of the resolution, because it places the donation of eggs on the same footing as the donation of organs or cells.
While the latter is undertaken in order to save life, the donation of gametes, and therefore also of egg cells, must be considered as part of a parental project.
The child born from such a donation cannot be considered as an object but as a person, with the right to know the identity of his or her biological parents later in life should he or she so desire.
The resolution should have referred to this fundamental difference, and I regret that the text was not amended.
Â Â  We Moderates do not believe that the issue of trading in human eggs should be dealt with in the manner of the current resolution.
The resolution we are voting on today has not been thoroughly prepared.
Nor does it weigh up the ethical pros and cons in such a way as to shed light upon the whole of this complex issue.
It does not make sense categorically to call for a ban on trading in egg cells and embryos.
Women who are unable to have children of their own will always be able to come to agreements with other women who are willing to donate eggs.
For many, childlessness is very painful and traumatic.
It would be a mistake to criminalise such agreements.
The issue of egg donations entails many complex moral considerations.
More clarification than is provided by the current resolution is needed in connection with the issues both of what interventions in reproduction should be permitted and of what the consequences are both for those women who donate eggs and for the childless women who desire help.
The reason why, in spite of everything, we choose to vote in favour of the resolution has to do with the situation that gave rise to it, that is to say the exploitation of poor women in Romania, which is something we view seriously, without having a detailed knowledge of all the facts.
Â Â  â I voted against the joint resolution on the planned egg trade, which is little more than a flight of fancy.
On the basis of a rumour circulated by the gutter press, disproved by an official report of the competent authorities in the UK, Parliament has cloaked itself in the lofty principles of human dignity, while at the same time refusing to deal with the underlying issue, namely that of whether we should or should not encourage well-supervised scientific research into embryonic stem cells.
I believe this research is essential for the fight against genetic disorders and against the scourges of modern life such as Alzheimerâs or Parkinsonâs disease.
Regenerative medicine in Europe is beginning to lag behind the US and Asia.
Parliament makes itself look foolish by tackling the subject of egg cell donations solely from the standpoint of the much-needed protection of women against involuntary exploitation.
Â Â  We need to respond to the news that has reached our ears about trade in womenâs ova with firm condemnation, sincere concern and an effective reaction by international bodies, in addition to that by the Romanian and British authorities.
The mere possibility that women may be forced to use their bodies as part of an obscene new trade should be enough to make us all commit ourselves to combating this practice by acting without delay.
It is at times such as this, much more than on commemorative dates, that we can and indeed should demonstrate our willingness to live up to the values that we advocate.
Â Â  The news we have heard about the United Kingdom importing human somatic cells from Romania, if it is true, indicates behaviour that demonstrates contempt for the most basic human rights.
If British clinics are indeed offering high cash prices to Romanian women for their ova, not only are they encouraging people to turn the human body into a source of profit, which is prohibited and condemned under ArticleÂ 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, they are also indulging in sordid exploitation of the donorsâ weakness and poverty.
In the light of these reports, the European Parliament should apply itself to urgently adopting measures with a view to protecting the dignity of human beings, amongst which I wish to highlight strict controls on the donation of ova, tissue or organs as a whole, so as to provide protection against this uncivilised exploitation of one human being by another.
Lastly, I consider that the practices that have been reported should be the subject of a vehement protest by this House, and deserve to be treated with the utmost repugnance.
I also welcome the adoption in this resolution of extremely important principles opposing cloning and advocating the protection of human embryos.
Europe should unite in defending the dignity of all human life, from the moment of conception until death.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  â On behalf of the liberal members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, I condemn this afternoon's vote on the joint âegg cell tradeâ resolution, a vote which, on the pretext of combating the exploitation of women and supporting the inalienability of the human body, really has a totally different purpose: to ban, directly or indirectly, research into embryonic stem cells and therapeutic cloningâŠ
It is a moralistic, retrograde and obscurantist vote which rejects and calls into question the âyesâ vote of this very same Parliament, on 19 November 2003, for the financing of research into embryonic stem cells, and this within the context of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development.
It is a disastrous signal from 307 Members to couples waiting for the gift of life, but also to the hundreds of thousands of patients in Europe who are placing all their hopes for a cure on research â diabetics and sufferers from Parkinsonâs, Alzheimerâs and many other diseases.
There are 199 of us in this Parliament whose ambition is still undiminished, namely to respond to these hopes, not merely by a vote for progress and solidarity, but above all by supporting modern and humanistic medical research in the interests of patients awaiting treatment.
Â Â  â At puberty, a young woman only has a limited number of egg cells â approximately 500 â which are released one by one at each menstrual cycle.
By the time of the menopause, the egg cell stock is exhausted and the woman is no longer able to conceive children.
The hyper-stimulation of a young womanâs ovaries, involving an increased risk of ovarian cancer, is not a trivial public health issue.
In a country where the resources of the healthcare system are limited, what guarantees will be offered to these young women?
Why would a young woman wish to run a risk of this type, except under financial pressure?
To remove and damage tens or even hundreds of egg cells from a young woman of 18 is tantamount to inducing a premature menopause, and to making it quite impossible for that woman ever to have children.
Who can be certain that a young woman of 18 is ready to make such a decision?
How can we be certain that it is not the result of financial and economic pressures?
Given these circumstances, it is clear that this issue goes far beyond Directive 2004/23/EC; it is impossible to call for demand to be met while at the same time stating that the donation of egg cells should be voluntary and free.
This is a major infringement of a womanâs most fundamental rights.
Â Â  Nuclear weapons constitute a serious threat to our global security, and not only in countries such as North Korea and Iran.
The June Listâs MEPs support the call to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, something that, in the long term, should lead to a phasing-out of all nuclear weapons.
With its experience, knowledge and global reach, the United Nations (UN) is the best organisation for guaranteeing the success of the Non-Proliferation Treaty 2005.
The UN must therefore be given priority in the work on global disarmament.
The resolution contains, however, proposals that would gradually strengthen the role of the EUâs foreign and defence policy, something that would be in danger of weakening the UNâs position.
Â Â  Hiroshima was devastated by an atomic bomb sixty years ago this summer.
Including the effects of radiation poisoning, the five-year death total was over two hundred thousand, almost two thirds of the city's population.
In May the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) comes up for another five-year review by those countries that are party to it.
The treaty regime is weaker than it has been since its entry into force in 1970.
If this vital security instrument is to continue to be effective, it is highly important that the central bargain be revived by the NPT nuclear weapon states, led by Washington, at the review conference.
1962 saw predictions of as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons states with such weapons integrated into their arsenals by the end of the 1970s.
This could have resulted in over forty such nations today, leaving nuclear weapons vulnerable to the hands of terrorists.
But it did not happen.
Today there are only two more states with nuclear weapon programmes than there were in 1970...
Â Â  .â The motion for a resolution on nuclear weapons may well describe the situation, but it focuses solely on the problem of non-proliferation, rather than on the problem of the existence and use of nuclear weapons.
Only the United States have used nuclear weapons, committing a huge crime against humanity in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Depleted uranium was also used by NATO forces in the wars against Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, with devastating consequences.
No mention is made of these issues.
Interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is hypocritical, unless it is linked to a demand for immediate specific action to destroy them, starting with the European nuclear powers (France, Britain), and unless a clear request is made for US nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe.
From this point of view, with the situation as it stands and taking account of the fact that the United States have reversed their commitment not to use nuclear weapons and strike first, the reference to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons directs people's attention away from the real dangers arising from the imperialist nuclear powers.
We support general nuclear disarmament and that is why we shall abstain from the vote.
Â Â  In the context of the long-standing and more far-reaching objective of securing total compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty, if we are to be realistic, some concerns are more urgent and serious than others.
The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups cannot be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations, and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable.
Against that background, the situation both in North Korea and Iran gives us cause for concern.
In the case of Iran, the hopes we are pinning on the work done as part of the negotiations conducted by the EU should not blind us to the fact that the indications of any real commitment by Iran to the proposals are very slight.
In the case of North Korea, however, there are more than indications, there are clear statements and instances of behaviour on the part of the leaders of that country that should give the international community pause for thought about what actions it may have to take in due course.
World security calls for careful reflection, respect for the law and courage when the time comes for a decision.
Â Â  In developing their nuclear arms programmes, North Korea and Iran have adopted an approach that obviously indicates contempt for international law and for the agreements they have signed, the consequences of which are clearly damaging for world peace and political stability.
Such behaviour, which borders on belligerence in some cases, calls for a firm and united response on the part of the European Union.
This does not just involve condemning the attitude displayed by those who breach agreements, but also making every effort, as a matter of urgency, to get the North Korean and Iranian Governments to return to the negotiating table, failing which they will be subject to economic and political sanctions.
The EU should also carry out a prior analysis of the consequences for Europe â particularly in political and economic terms â of the possibility of Iran and North Korea possessing nuclear arms.
Lastly, I believe that the EU and its Member States should put up a common front at the 2005 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and exhort the international community to strengthen programmes designed to prevent the spread of nuclear materials, technology and know-how, and to adopt additional measures to avoid terrorists or those that harbour them having access to weapons of mass destruction and their components.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  While we support a robust NPT and steps to curtail the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran, we have abstained on this resolution because we are not in agreement with the following paragraphs in particular:
paragraphs 10 and 19 - we believe that conventional forces alone cannot ensure credible deterrence, that nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the UK and its allies incalculable and unacceptable and consequently that they remain essential to preserving peace;
paragraph 15 - we do not agree that the EU has a role in coordinating intelligence;
paragraph 17 - we believe that the presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remain vital to the security of the continent and consequently it would be wrong to call on "the USA to clarify the situation of the quantity and strategic objectives of its tactical nuclear arsenals stationed on European bases";
paragraph 18 - Israel has not declared that it possesses nuclear weapons and therefore it is in appropriate to include Israel in this context;
paragraph 31 - the United States has not declared that it would "not engage in preventive military action against Iran", and it would be wrong to rule out any option at this stage.
Â Â  We welcome the development of a peaceful and democratic Lebanon as an important part of a peaceful and democratic Middle East.
We are happy to see individual European countries accepting their responsibility and contributing to the peace process, but we object to the constant attempts to increase the role of the EUâs foreign and defence policy.
Such a development would involve the EU taking resources that would have been better administered by the United Nations, and it would weaken the world community in the longer term.
Â Â  The recent developments in the situation in Lebanon need to be viewed in the light of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, where there has been an escalation in interference and military intervention and occupation by the United States and its allies, in an attempt to secure domination of the region and its vital resources, thus putting into action its âGreater Middle East Initiativeâ.
Furthermore, it is against the background of the growing pressures and threats directed by the United States at countries in this region such as Syria and Iran â for which the US sought to secure the support of France and Germany at the recent EU and NATO summits â that attempts are being made to justify dangerous ventures and an escalation of destabilisation of the region, in particular in Lebanon, and to undermine that countryâs national unity and the implementation of the Taif Agreement.
This could have serious consequences.
This resolution obscures the fundamental issue, the âcause of causesâ, that is to say the role of the United states and of Israel, which is in military occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and even Lebanese territory, in aggravating the situation in the Middle East.
We accordingly disagree with the overall approach of the resolution.
Â Â  The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the resolution on the situation in Lebanon, in particular its focus on the importance of free, democratic and transparent parliamentary elections, the need for a complete and rapid withdrawal of Syrian forces and intelligence, and hopes for reform to spread across the wider Middle East.
However it is important to clarify that the military wing of Hezbollah is already listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Kingdom, whereas the political wing is under constant review.
Hezbollah represents significant public support in Lebanon, and our hope should be that Hezbollah rejects terrorism and embraces the political process.
Â Â  â Parliament has just passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
That is a positive step, but it does not go far enough.
The re-establishment of Lebanese independence also requires that those Lebanese who were forced to leave their country should be able to return and that all political prisoners, prominent among whom is Samir Geagea, should be set free.
However, the majority of Members who voted in favour of a text defending the sovereignty of Lebanon are the same ones who are striving to dismantle the sovereignty of our own nations within the Europe of Brussels; a Europe without borders, open to immigration from anywhere in the world.
Lebanon lost its sovereignty as a result of massive immigration.
The arrival, in the early 1970s, of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians shattered the demographic equilibrium between Moslems and Christians â to the detriment of the latter, who became a minority in their own country.
The resulting civil war served as a pretext for Syria to occupy Lebanon and put an end to its sovereignty.
Today, the presence of 500Â 000 Syrian immigrants is a serious obstacle to the restoration of independence to the country.
The disaster of Lebanon is proof: woe betide a country which loses its identity and sovereignty.
Â Â  â We voted against â and emphatically against the second part of paragraph 6.
Our position is that we refuse to draw a distinction between the political and military wings of a terrorist movement, namely Hezbollah.
We also bitterly regret that the amendment calling on the Union to place it on its list of terrorist organisations was withdrawn.
This Party of God, whose fundamental charter calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic Republic in Lebanon; this Hezbollah, whose emblem is a machine gun and whose motto calls for the sole victory of the congregation of Allah.
Could this movement, responsible for atrocities, the hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping, torture and assassinations too numerous to mention, be anything other than a terrorist organisation?
Of course it is a terrorist organisation, and we are all perfectly aware of the fact.
The real issue which is dividing the Council is whether or not it is expedient to say so.
We believe that the planned text was sufficiently clear to avoid severing links.
The European Parliament is not the Councilâs echo chamber. It has just deprived itself of the opportunity to send a clear political signal to all those throughout the world who are fighting against our values of freedom and democracy.
Â Â  The most recent events in the Middle East and the way the situation in that part of the world has been developing â partly, it must be said, because of military intervention in Iraq â today give us some, albeit modest, grounds for hope.
Alongside tragic events such as the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister or the repeated attacks in Iraq, there are in fact signs that new solutions to the problems of the Middle East are emerging, solutions that point towards the possibility of stability, peace and democratisation in the region in the future.
In this context, and against the background of the groundswell of protest against that assassination, the time has come for us to demand that Syria should comply with the wishes of the international community and totally withdraw from Lebanon, thus allowing normal elections to be held in that country.
Furthermore, it is time that the European Union recognised what has been obvious for a long time and include Hezbollah in the list of terrorist groups.
Â Â  Lebanon has long been the stage for a clash between the main powers in the Middle East, and its entire social fabric has suffered because of its geographical location.
The most recent in a long list of acts of violence that stretches back to antiquity was the deplorable assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, demonstrating just how far there is to go before Lebanon achieves stability and also the degree of uncertainty hanging over the current elections.
I consider it essential, if this state of affairs is to be brought to an end, for the international community not to prevaricate in the face of those who subsidise, promote and incite terrorism.
Simply tolerating terrorism is not a good policy.
I am therefore pleased to see the withdrawal of Syriaâs troops, but I feel bound to condemn the relationship that this country has maintained with Hezbollah and the way in which it has interfered, directly or surreptitiously, in the internal affairs of Lebanon, a sovereign state.
Until we have irrefutable proof that this behaviour, this interference, has ceased, and that human rights and fundamental freedoms are being respected, I believe that the European Union will have very little to gain from forging closer links with Syria.
I also believe that Hezbollah should be included in the European list of terrorist organisations, with all that that implies.
Â Â  I abstained in the vote on Hezbollah because âall necessary measuresâ against terrorist activities would involve Hezbollah being added to the list of terrorist organisations.
Swedenâs Green Party is opposed to this list because it is not based upon objective criteria, the decisions cannot be appealed against and no rights are granted to those whose names are added to the list.
Hezbollah has many parliamentarians and civil activists, and an across-the-board fight against all parts of the organisation will not solve the complex situation involving its status in Lebanon.
Â Â  We abstained from voting on asking the Commission to defend the proposal that the EU budget should amount to significantly more than one per cent of GDP.
We wish to prioritise the Lisbon Strategy, of which research is an important part.
It is, however, too early in the current situation to commit ourselves to a particular level for the EU budget.
Â Â  This report addresses a topic that is very important for the future of research, knowledge and innovation in the various Member States of the European Union, which can be summed up by focussing on three aspects:
- If we are to increase the level of research, we need an increase in funding.
The budget of the Sixth Framework Programme amounts to only 5.4% of total public research spending in Europe, which means that it is not viable to create any kind of European Research Area.
Financing for the future programme is essential, but the final amount of the Unionâs financial perspective is not yet known.
The rapporteur calls for a doubling of the budget, which seems logical.
- The content of the next Framework Programme needs to be changed in various ways as compared with the present programme, but not quite as proposed in the report.
Research must support innovation, but it should not be totally redirected solely towards increasing competitiveness, as is the case with the Commissionâs guidelines, following Wim Kokâs report.
- Greater attention needs to be paid to the working conditions of all those engaged in research.
The rapporteur states that the EU needs 700Â 000 new researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in research and development is to be reached.
This implies adequate investment in human resources in order to produce more researchers.
Â Â  Research is a vital area for the long-term success of the European Union as regards innovation and competitiveness.
I accordingly voted in favour of this report on guidelines for future European Union policy to support research.
It will only be possible to create the European Research Area by increasing the EUâs financial support for research, in the context of improved coordination between European, national and regional research policies.
For this reason, I wholeheartedly approve of the proposal to double the budget for the Seventh Framework Programme.
The EU needs 700Â 000 new adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in technological research and development is to be reached.
To achieve this objective, it is essential to make Europe more attractive for researchers and scientists, to stir up fresh enthusiasm for science among young people, to foster the participation of women and to promote scientific careers and the mobility of researchers.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that those Member States that are eligible for the Structural Funds should devote a significant proportion of these resources to eliminating their disadvantages in the field of research.
Â Â  I welcome this report's emphasis on achieving the Lisbon objectives through various means.
It is vital to improve framework conditions for private research, since in it is estimated that the EU needs 700Â 000 new, adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in Research and Development (R[amp]D) is to be reached.
Furthermore, to reach this target, two thirds of the investment in research should come from the business sector.
The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy has also identified âincreasing Europe's attractiveness for researchers and scientistsâ and âmaking R[amp]D a top priorityâ among the policy areas requiring urgent action.
I agree with the report that making Europe more competitive requires appropriate financial means.
There should be sufficient coupling at European and national level to ensure a uniform quality of funded projects.
I also welcome the call to increase support for R[amp]D and innovation in renewable energies following The International Conference for Renewable Energies (Bonn, June 2004).
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Locatelli (A6-0046/2005) on Science and technology â Guidelines for future European Union policy to support research, because I advocate strong and effective research policies for Europe.
I am very much aware of the difficulty of achieving the objectives set out in the Lisbon Strategy, and I accordingly continue to support a European Union research and development policy as one of the main instruments for promoting Europeâs growth and competitiveness.
Establishing the European Research Area (ERA) is key here, as is achieving continuity in the planning of research programmes.
The objective of making Europe more competitive requires funding for research.
Accordingly, the new strategies aimed at creating companies that will cooperate both with regional institutions and universities are something that we need to develop for the future.
It is important for universities to take on an entrepreneurial role, thus facilitating interaction between research and industry.
Lastly, I welcome the proposals that Structural Funds should be used to support R[amp]D actions at regional level and a âEuropean excellence labelâ.
Â Â  I welcome the courage of the rapporteur, who prefaces her explanatory statement with the sentence, âEurope deserves better: Stop with the âLisbon lamentââ.
As I said yesterday, just as there is agreement about the Lisbon objectives, there is also general recognition that we urgently need a new, strong and courageous attitude.
I would like to add another epithet: creative.
The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy stated that it is necessary to increase the attractiveness of Europe for researchers and scientists.
In fact there are a great many sources of information and statistics showing that Europe has been suffering from a massive haemorrhage of its best scientists and researchers.
It is important to halt that haemorrhage.
It is also important to pursue the objective of the European Research Area by means of practical actions, such as greater technology transfer, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises; full and efficient use of the Structural Funds to support research and development at regional level; placing special emphasis on interdisciplinarity in the training chapter; strengthening the role and responsibility of universities in the Europe of knowledge; promoting the mobility of researchers by encouraging and facilitating family unity; achieving the objective of 3% for R[amp]D; funding and disseminating centres of innovation, such as the proposed European Institute of Technology; providing primary and secondary education with technological instruments to encourage research; and promoting information campaigns about success stories.
Putting it simply, to âstop the lamentsâ.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  â European Union support for research must be in step with the objectives set out in the Lisbon Strategy.
It is for this reason that I gave my wholehearted support to this ambitious report.
A country such as Belgium has a duty to follow the example of certain of its European neighbours who have had the courage to invest in scientific research.
In this context, Finland is a good role model.
With 3.5% of GDP devoted to research, it has already exceeded the EUâs 3% objective for 2010.
The results in Finland speak for themselves.
The annual number of new PhD students has doubled in ten years and the country has added an extra 26Â 000 researchers over the same period (+50%).
We also need to bring about a change in mentality.
On average, a young European researcher working in the USA has a research grant 2.5 times higher than in Europe.
To stem the brain drain, we need to make Europe more attractive for the top researchers, and also encourage our young people to follow scientific careers.
There is still much to be done in the fields of public health, the environment or high technology.
Â Â  With reference to Paragraph 44; the worldâs most important environmental problem is global warming.
The EU has signed up to the Kyoto Protocol, the main aim of which is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The expansion of nuclear power constitutes one of the most important means of reducing these.
I therefore wish to support EU research into nuclear power in all its aspects.
I do not, however, support the EUâs defence research.
This is something about which countries must decide individually or about which they must reach agreements with each other.
Â Â  I and my British Conservative colleagues are voting for this report but with one important proviso.
Nothing in any of our votes should be taken to mean that we support an increase in the overall EU budget.
We do support the creation of a budget entry sufficient to support LIFE funding for nature protection and biodiversity which we do not feel will be adequately protected or financed under the Commission's present plans.
It is vital that, now we have created the Natura 2000 network, we are prepared to find the money to continue to finance it where necessary.
Â Â  â I voted against the Auken report as I believe we cannot compromise future financial prospects by determining the expenditure for a single area of environmental policy in advance.
Â Â  The preservation of biodiversity and the reversal of desertification are essential in ensuring sustainable development.
Healthy ecosystems provide important social and economic resources.
The Natura 2000 network, based on sites protected under the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, is contributing towards achieving this objective.
In its proposal for the financial perspective for 2007-2013, the Commission intends that the annual cost of managing the Natura 2000 network, EUR 6.1 billion per year, should be financed from existing funds.
Although the objective of reversing the loss of biodiversity is being pursued, no attempt is being made to combat its causes: we need a change in the production model based on profit maximisation, of which one example is the release of GMOs into the environment.
Similarly, the necessary financing is not provided for, as this objective has to âcompeteâ with other economic and social objectives.
We therefore consider that the appropriations for rural development, which are intended to compensate farmersâ additional costs, and those for the Structural Funds should be proportionately increased if the costs of managing Natura 2000 are to be found from these funds.
It is also essential to increase funding for the LIFE programme and/or to establish a programme dedicated to this network so as to ensure that its objectives are met.
Â Â  .
Protection of our natural environment can be achieved only by a real partnership between nature protection agencies and farmers, and so the Commissionâs financial proposal must not jeopardise cooperation between them.
It is farmers, across the length and breadth of Europe, who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food.
Our farmers are in no doubt about what is required of them; they farm in accordance with best practice.
It is for that reason that there must be certainty about the additional requirements prescribed for FFH areas by the European Union, also being adequately funded by it: âhe who places the order pays the bill!â
It is not acceptable that the funding of Natura 2000 should be to the detriment of other agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes.
Many issues have yet to be resolved.
Precisely what actions are ultimately to be taken in the certified areas is to be decided at regional level in the first instance.
It is important that funding for these actions should be in place.
Those resources intended only for the management and organisation of the Natura 2000 areas must be kept to a minimum.
We have to take care that there is no build-up of additional bureaucracy.
Rather than putting money into management, bureaucracy and administration, the projects that are funded must be efficient, must help the environment and achieve tangible results.
Â Â  In an increasingly urbanised society in which rural areas are being abandoned and in which industrialisation and construction are taking over space traditionally regarded as ânaturalâ, the European Unionâs desire to ensure that biodiversity is maintained is both justified and beneficial.
A society that abandons its fields, its forests and its rural space is not only reducing biodiversity, it is also reducing its capacity to take proper advantage of natural resources, and is instead encouraging urban concentration and the predominance of the main cities, while lowering the overall quality of life.
Our key objective should not be to advocate biodiversity as an end in itself, but to protect a development model that enables people to enjoy the highest possible quality of life, which is only possible if ânaturalâ space is preserved and maintained.
Â Â  The environment deserves to be treated as a priority at world level, especially so given the growth witnessed over recent decades and the negative impact this has had on the world, combined with the need for sustainable development.
More specifically, the issue before us today is biological diversity throughout the world, which has progressively declined over recent decades.
Aiming as it does to protect nature and in particular animal life and its habitats, the Natura 2000 network gives us a unique opportunity to combat this impoverishment of biological diversity in Europe.
That is something for which we are directly responsible.
I attach great importance to the availability of appropriate levels of funding, together with an increase in support and special treatment, if the key objective is to be attained.
The EU has of course already made a commitment with the Cardiff Process principle of integrating environmental considerations in all key policy areas and the EU's own Sustainable Development Strategy.
The report before us advocates joint responsibility between the Community and Member States.
EU funds should therefore cover both sites and their management activities.
Above all, this strategy, by virtue of the activities associated with it, will help to boost the rural economy and enhance our citizensâ quality of life.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The Labour members voted against this resolution for a number of reasons.
Firstly, we think it is bad for the World Trade talks because it undermines the seriousness of our commitment to a genuine reform of the world system.
We voted against it because we think it is bad for farmers: farmers need certainty above all and this resolution would not provide that.
We voted against it because we think it is bad for the European food industry: half a million European jobs depend on industries that use sugar and they will be facing higher sugar prices than the rest of their competitors throughout the world.
And we voted against it because we think it is bad for the developing world.
We will still be taking badly needed markets from developing countries.
We hope that Parliament will think again and that when the Commission brings forward its draft legislative resolution we can have a different debate and a different approach to this issue, because the resolution we are adopting today simply does not solve the problems of the European sugar market.
Â Â  . Today, this House is voting on the sugar sectorâs market organisation, sugar subsidies and access to the market by the least-developed countries.
In the debate between agriculture and development cooperation, two aspects were not given sufficient attention.
The first one was sugar and public health.
Diabetes has now become public disease Number One.
It is a disease with debilitating symptoms and effects, and is also very expensive socially and economically.
In addition, the consumption of sugar is a major factor in obesity, which is also an increasing public health problem.
The EU was right to announce that â in cooperation with the WHO â it would fight obesity and diabetes.
The consumption of sugar must be reduced, and the decline in the consumption of fruit and vegetables must be reversed, and so it is inconceivable that this House should commit to low sugar prices and that not one cent of subsidy should be available for fruit and vegetables.
If we want to grant agricultural subsidies and keep prices down at all, we should do this for healthy products.
The second aspect is Lisbon.
The EU aspires to be the most dynamic and innovative economy in five yearsâ time.
Everything should be geared towards that goal and sufficient means should also be freed up for this purpose.
This House had fine things to say on this very subject only this week.
It is difficult to see what contribution the sugar subsidies make to achieving the Lisbon objectives.
Europe must grant farmers from developing countries full access to the market.
I wholeheartedly support amendments to this effect.
Needless to say, a sound scheme must be put in place for the European sugar farmers and for the workers in the sugar sector, but the long-term continuation of support for an unhealthy product and a sector that is somewhat resistant to innovation is inconsistent with this.
We must stop this absurdity as quickly as possible.
That in itself is sufficient reason to vote against the draft resolution.
Â Â  We are aware of allegations that the present arrangements for the sugar sector have distorted the market, leading to high prices for the consumer and a negative impact on the world market, particularly for developing countries.
It was because of these allegations that in July 2004 the Commission brought forward a proposal for reforming the COM for sugar, based on a two-stage price reduction phased over three years of 37% in the guarantee price and 33% in the institutional price; on the abolition of the intervention price, which is currently three times the world market price; and on eliminating public intervention, which will be replaced by a system of private stocks.
The intervention price is to be replaced by the reference price.
Furthermore, sugar production quotas and subsidised exports are also to be reduced.
The only support envisaged is the introduction of income aid in the form of a decoupled payment to sugar beet producers to partially compensate them â for 60% of the total â for the loss of income resulting from the reduction in prices, together with the introduction of possible transfers of quotas between operators in different Member States.
We cannot accept these proposals and we therefore tabled various amendments.
Unfortunately, not all of these were adopted.
Â Â  We support a radical reform of the sugar market within the EU with a view as soon as possible to liberalising this market and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the ability to compete on fair conditions.
Given that all the amendments to Parliamentâs draft resolution tabled by Mr van den Berg and others with this aim in view were defeated, the resolution will not take the issue of the EUâs sugar market down this route.
We have therefore voted against the draft resolution.
Â Â  I believe it is of the greatest importance for EU agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market in sugar, to be reformed.
The present system costs a lot of money.
Moreover, todayâs high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market, something that has serious consequences for the developing countries.
Today, the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by MrÂ Daul and MrÂ Fruteau.
I chose to vote against the resolution as a whole since it is mainly oriented towards maintaining the status quo.
Sugar producers in certain developing countries too will be affected by the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar.
The current system is not entirely to their disadvantage.
Their situation should not, however, be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market.
Instead, these countries should be supported through other measures such as increased development cooperation and technical trade support.
Â Â  The British Conservatives support the oral question and resolution on the common organisations of the markets in sugar.
It is necessary to reform the sugar market in order bring it in line with CAP reform.
However, time must be allowed for sugar production in the EU, ACP and LDCs to adapt to an open market situation.
We are disappointed that the report does not support the cross border quota transfer within the EU which would allow sugar producers in Europe to become more efficient and competitive.
Â Â  The motion for a resolution before us on the common organisation of the market in sugar was ultimately the result of a compromise which guarantees key national interests pending, in particular, the reduction in the size of the sugar beet market now underway in Portugal.
What is even more serious here is that, if this were not the case, the damage would be felt by an outermost region like the Azores, which is already suffering from various constraints on its economic development.
Â Â  My main reservation about the reform of the sugar sector relates principally to the swingeing cut in sugar beet production quotas envisaged in the Commission proposal.
In common with the producersâ associations and some European governments, I believe that a measure of this kind will lead to concentration of sugar beet production in just a few Member States.
I believe that production should continue to be spread throughout the entire Community, not just for environmental and economic reasons, but also because otherwise there is a risk that thousands of jobs will be lost, jobs that will be hard to replace, thus leading to unavoidable social costs.
To my mind it is essential for the planned reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar to guarantee price levels ensuring adequate remuneration both for Community producers and for suppliers in developing countries, while avoiding the temptation to disrupt the equilibrium prevailing in the sugar sector.
Failing this, I believe that serious damage will be done not just to Community producers, who will suffer from a drastic fall in income, but also to Community consumers, who, as at the time of previous reforms, will not even benefit from a reduction in the price of sugar, which will be entirely lost through market mechanisms.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  Today, the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by MrÂ Daul and MrÂ Fruteau.
I chose to vote against the resolution as a whole since it is mainly oriented towards maintaining the status quo.
It is of the greatest importance for EU agricultural policy â including the organisation of the market in sugar â to be reformed.
This is partly because the present system costs EU taxpayers a lot of money to maintain and partly because todayâs high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market, something that has serious consequences for the developing countriesâ ability to export and produce.
The reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar will not only affect European sugar producers, but also producers in certain developing countries whom the current system does not at present entirely place at a disadvantage.
Their situation should not, however, be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market.
Instead, these countries should be supported through increased development cooperation and technical trade support, derived perhaps from the resources released in connection with the reform of the sugar market.
Finally, it is important for these countries to be given an adequate transitional period in which to adapt to the new situation.
Â Â  On behalf of the EPLP I would like to outline why we will not be voting in favour of the Fruteau/Daul resolution.
This resolution follows an oral question from the Agriculture committee, ands aims to give a de facto EP position on sugar ahead of the Commission's legislative proposals.
The Development, Trade, Budgets, Consumers and the Environment Committees are all concerned by this complex issue.
We need reform in the sugar sector not only due to WTO pressures but also because we need a competitive EU food industry, to maintain jobs and a viable industry.
We need a proper single market in sugar which this resolution does not address.
We need to help the least-developed countries by allowing them access to EU markets, but this needs to be discussed fully not determined by an oral resolution.
We need to support the Commission in their efforts to bring this complex sector into line with other CAP reforms not argue to retain the status quo.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the situation in Tibet.
Â Â  Mr President, the situation in Tibet remains high on the political and human rights agenda of the European Union's relations with China.
The EU is concerned about the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people, and more particularly about the restrictive conditions imposed by the central authorities on the exercise of religious freedom in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Recently, some Tibetan monks were sentenced, allegedly for possessing portraits of the Dalai Lama.
We heard that some were detained and beaten.
We are also still waiting, in spite of continuous requests, for information on the whereabouts of the Dalai Lamaâs choice of the eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima.
We have seized every opportunity regularly to raise these concerns with our Chinese interlocutors.
We have done so at the highest political level, for example at the seventh bilateral summit held in the Hague on 8Â DecemberÂ 2004, as we have done regularly within the framework of the ongoing bilateral dialogue on human rights.
During the last session of this dialogue, held in Luxembourg on 24/25 February 2005, the issue was again extensively addressed.
We have also brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities the situation of Tibetan individuals, together with individuals from all over China, who have been sentenced for freely expressing their opinion or belief.
The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche has become emblematic.
We fully share the view that the European Parliament expressed in January in a resolution on Tibet and we will continue urging the Chinese authorities to release this monk at the earliest possible date.
We hope that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon.
In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative to a peaceful process based on dialogue.
We have called for years, and will continue to call, for such a dialogue.
We, therefore, fully support the consultations that have taken place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
We welcome the fact that the two Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama were able to visit China last September for the third time since the resumption of contacts in September 2002.
We met - as we often have in the past - Kelsang Gyaltsen, one of the two Dalai Lamaâs Special Envoys, on his return from China, and we felt encouraged by his positive assessment of the visit.
We understand that progress has been made to narrow the gap between the existing respective positions.
We hope that those developments will encourage the start of a meaningful and direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, which will lead to the recognition of genuine autonomy for the Tibetan region.
We firmly believe that only such direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue.
In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be subject to any precondition.
On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any steps that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence, which appears indispensable if a solution is to be reached.
In all circumstances, we would condemn violence from any quarter as a solution to the problem of Tibet.
The Commission would certainly be prepared to become more involved in finding a solution if it were the wish of the parties most concerned.
We will, no doubt, continue to pay the greatest attention to the situation in Tibet and to press for conditions that allow the Tibetans to fully exercise their basic political, religious and cultural rights and permit the cultural identity of Tibet to be preserved.
Â Â  . Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to thank all those â including you, Commissioner Kallas â who have supported our request for a debate on a country whose citizens need us alongside them more than ever.
Forty-six years ago today, in Lhasa, Chinese troops crushed the Tibetansâ peaceful protests against the armed occupation of their country, killing 87Â 000 of them, and arresting thousands of others.
To date, over a million Tibetans have died as a result of hunger, torture and execution, and over three-quarters of their shrines, temples and monasteries have been systematically destroyed.
While 10 March is a day of mourning, it is also a day of resistance to enforced silence, to the violation of human rights, to the suppression of cultural, religious and human identity.
Today, as every year, Tibetan flags are being hoisted all around the world, in 2Â 000 cities and municipalities in the European Union, over 650 of them in Germany â my own country â alone.
The day after tomorrow, in Berlin, we will be joining thousands of campaigners for human rights, including an increasing number of young people and political office-holders, remembering the victims before the Brandenburg Gate.
This House has adopted significant resolutions that have given the Tibetans courage, among them the outstanding Romeva Report on arms exports, in which the Council was urged to maintain the embargo on the sale of armaments to China â an appeal backed up by our joint resolution on the Geneva Human Rights Convention.
The day after tomorrow, the 3Â 000 delegates to the Chinese Peopleâs Congress will be assembling in Beijing.
They will be adopting an anti-secession law, intended to back up a possible military strike against Taiwan.
To endorse such a confrontation, even if only indirectly, is a fatal and irreparable error, as we, Commissioner, have pointed out time and time again, calling at the same time for the continuation of dialogue between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities.
It is not enough to announce, immediately before important state visits, that talks are in progress, only for them, again and again, to prove fruitless.
In his message on the occasion of the anniversary of the popular uprising, His Holiness the Dalai Lama declares his determination to find a solution that both takes account of Chinese interests and enables the Tibetan people to live in peace, freedom and dignity.
Our Parliamentâs Tibet Intergroup, composed of representatives from all the political families, will continue to campaign for human rights campaigners, NGOs, members of other national parliaments to be heard in this House again and again.
In terms of our solidarity with the Tibetan people and their justified claims, there is no more appropriate day than today, 10Â March.
And so, to those of us who join in showing our colours in cities, towns and parliaments, âTashi delekâ â good fortune.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, European policy towards China is based on political dialogue and genuine two-way communication.
It is only thanks to this communication that we can help our Chinese friends in their transition towards an open society and one more respectful of human rights and the rule of law.
This two-way communication must also be the cornerstone of our discussions on Tibet.
The recent case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche gave us the opportunity to appeal to the Chinese Government to improve the conditions of prisoners.
If China wishes to play a wider global role, it must comply with international standards on imprisonment, including in Tibet.
In particular, everyone is entitled to a fair and equitable trial, internationally recognised as such.
For this reason, we are delighted whenever prisoners of conscience are freed in Tibet.
We again ask them to abolish the death penalty.
The European Union has managed to eradicate capital punishment from its territory.
This was a great victory for humanity, and we hope China will follow in these footsteps.
We should like to see an ongoing improvement in the human rights situation in Tibet.
We invite China to ratify the UN International Pact on Civil and Political Rights.
Everyone must be able to express his or her political opinions freely and without the threat of imprisonment.
The European Union/China inter-parliamentary delegation was able to travel to Tibet two years ago.
The visit taught us a great deal.
We looked at European programmes and were able to grasp the importance of our relations with China and with the autonomous province of Tibet.
Tibet needs electricity, running water and hospitals.
I should also like the European Union to share its experience in terms of minority rights.
We could share best practice on the rights of minorities to maintain their heritage and traditions, something which is sorely needed when we see the disfigured state of Lhasa.
Finally, we would encourage China to maintain a dialogue with representatives of the Dalai Lama.
This dialogue must be undertaken with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution to the question of Tibet as quickly as possible.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is clear that China has been acting in an expansionist manner for decades.
It has also been aiming to strengthen its position at the expense of other countries and peoples.
I can provide abundant evidence of this.
Allow me to recall the annexation of part of Kashmir by China, the war in the Himalayas between China and India and Chinaâs attack on Vietnam in 1979.
The most appalling and shameful action of this type happened earlier and has already been mentioned in the House.
I refer to the subjugation of Tibet.
