I am able fully to endorse Mr Davies's observation.
Compliance with the current directives has not been sufficiently well monitored, and this has inflicted quite unnecessary suffering upon millions of animals used in experiments.
There has most definitely been an acceptance of laxity in developing alternative methods, and that laxity must cease with this directive.
The second major result concerned ourselves as consumers.
First and foremost, we are obtaining a ban on the use of a range of carcinogenic substances and on the use of substances that impair our reproductive ability.
We are to have special safety requirements in relation to children; allergy-producing ingredients are to be labelled; and details are to be provided of the shelf-life of individual products.
I believe that, overall, there has been a breakthrough in relation to unnecessary animal experiments and that there has also been a breakthrough in terms of public health and consumer protection in the cosmetics area.
Overall, this is a constructive outcome, and I would once again call upon the Commission to be consistent in following up this matter. I also believe that it is necessary for ourselves in Parliament to monitor such follow-up from the sidelines.
Madam President, I would add my voice to those praising Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I think you are an excellent and outstanding example, not only of an accomplished parliamentarian but also of what we are so much in need of, namely energetic women in politics.
Thank you for your work, your efforts and the character you show.
You are needed.
It only remains to observe that a compromise is a compromise.
I can fully understand the animal protection organisations' concern about the fact that it will take such a long time for the ban to be introduced and about the fact that so very many thousands of animals will be destroyed for the sake of our vanity.
In spite of that, I am pleased that we nonetheless arrived at some sort of milestone, or something to grasp and hold on to.
I am also very pleased that consumer protection has been taken seriously, that we are to obtain indications of contents and that there are to be bans on certain substances that are clearly unsuitable, above all perhaps when they form part of preparations we use on children and young people who are more vulnerable than ourselves.
On the subject of animal protection, I should like to look ahead and broaden the debate a little.
We keep seeing these appalling films of animal transportation and slaughter, revealing how we in Europe treat our animals.
Imagine if Parliament had influence and the right of codecision on issues relating to agricultural policy.
Imagine the situation, given the attitude and views on animal protection of an incredibly large majority in Parliament.
Just think how much progress we might have made, even though we know that the democratic form of decision-making is compromise - a democratic compromise whose only promise to us is that we shall never get exactly what we want.
Madam President, there were three goals that were important to the Greens.
Firstly the abolition of animal testing in cosmetics.
That has succeeded; congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt who negotiated so excellently.
The second point, which was given less of a chance, relates to dangerous substances.
Dangerous substances must not be allowed to be used in cosmetics.
We also won on that point, so compliments are due to Mrs Roth-Behrendt in that regard too.
The third point concerns allergens.
Some cosmetics still contain allergens.
Originally the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted a complete ban on these substances, but we are quite happy with the labelling that has now been decided upon, because we think that it will mean the same thing in practice.
There are already signs that quite a few big companies will be removing these allergens from their cosmetics.
So we have also won on that point.
There is one thing I would like to get off my chest, though: I really cannot understand the criticism from the animal protectionists.
We have achieved the most we could achieve, and we commend the rapporteur and the whole negotiation delegation.
Madam President, current policy whereby industry has been given time to develop alternative methods of experimentation has not produced results.
It is essential to impose bans on experiments and marketing.
Animals should not suffer through its being possible to develop new vanity products.
I should therefore like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the outcome of what will soon have been a long fight.
Even if the conciliation text turned out not to be as restrictive as Parliament had wished, it contains the right principles.
It is still a puzzle to me that the Council does not consider that dangerous substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic should, in accordance with the precautionary principle, be completely excluded from being used in cosmetics.
All substances, including those in category 3, must be covered.
Children too use products, such as shampoo and shower soap, containing these substances, and no type of risk should be taken.
The conciliation text is along the right lines, however, so I would once again congratulate you on your worthwhile struggle, Dagmar.
The June Movement will of course vote in favour of the conciliation text.
Madam President, I would like to add my own congratulations to those addressed to our colleague Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt for all the energy and good will she has expended to get her report adopted.
I remember the lively debates we have had in our Assembly, debates often full of emotion, whenever the question of animal welfare and public health has arisen.
I would nevertheless like to point out that not all cosmetics are luxuries; a good many of them are household products used in daily hygiene, and their frequent use means that their safety must be assessed.
While it is right to want to restrict experiments on animals, we must never forget that our prime objective is to guarantee the health of our fellow citizens.
That is where we need the wisdom to be able to strike a balance between the need to find alternatives to tests on animals and the need to give priority to public health.
We do not want to put the cosmetics industry in difficulties either, however, since it is an important part of our economy.
The industry has been in the picture for a long time and has been able to plan the necessary investments for developing alternative methods.
Our rapporteur has clearly explained that we have been discussing all this for at least 10 years.
We should also stress the many efforts that have already been made and the encouraging results that have been obtained.
But we cannot exactly take for granted the advances that science will make.
Scientific results do not come to order, neither can they be programmed for a precise date, but they can be encouraged.
It is in this spirit that I see the need to set cut-off dates with possible extensions for methods that today are still at the initial planning stage.
We must have faith in our manufacturers, but sometimes our role is to encourage them to do more, to think about the future differently, to develop an awareness of our society's expectations.
Cosmetics have proved their safety.
What is needed is for the information for the consumer to be made more accurate and relevant.
Labelling must therefore be perfect and not have the opposite of the intended effect.
For example, to take the example of various allergens, the information that has to be communicated must not frighten the consumer.
It must be simple and enable them, if they are particularly sensitive to a product, to make the best choice.
Finally, I will end by saying that this third reading is a good example of the quality of the parliamentary work that has been done under the responsibility of our rapporteur.
When viewed solely from the point of view of cosmetics, the outcome of the conciliation can be described as good.
The industrial lobby has once again triumphed over the interests of animals who suffer unnecessarily.
Europeans will only allow animal testing if it is absolutely necessary.
This necessity does not apply to beauty products, so this directive should have implemented an unconditional ban on the sale and testing of these cosmetics.
There is no such ban, however.
The standpoint taken by our Parliament was already a compromise, but the outcome that has now been achieved makes things even worse.
A partial prohibition will not enter into force until 2009, and three tests will be allowed to continue until as late as 2013 and perhaps even after that.
It is not the Parliamentary delegation in the conciliation committee who is to blame for this flawed compromise but the Commission and the Council who have unilaterally bowed to pressure from the cosmetics industry.
Better information for the consumer will hopefully result in consumers not wanting to become more beautiful by buying 'ugly' cosmetics.
It is of the greatest importance that governments, science and industry invest in alternative methods.
There is nothing at all wrong with a constant stream of new cosmetics coming on to the market; it must just not be at the expense of animals suffering unnecessarily.
There are already very many products on the market which contain very many safe ingredients that have been tested on animals, and as far as I am concerned, that is enough now.
This directive makes Europe look ugly, so I will not be supporting it.
Madam President, we have been on a long journey.
This third reading stage it is not the end of the journey, but it is a very significant point on that road towards the protection of human health and the enhancement of animal welfare.
That is why the rapporteur has rightly received the plaudits today because she has taken us along that road.
When we hear the phrase 'long gestation periods' we have tended hitherto to think of elephants.
In future we will think of European legislation.
It has been a long gestation period.
We then had a long period in labour from 4 p.m. in the afternoon until 4 a.m. in the morning, and at the end we gave birth to a programme which will stand the test, which is why we welcome this point on the debate today.
The Commission originally came forward with a proposal to end tests.
However, that would have done no more than the proposal which went through in the United Kingdom, which ended testing on animals, but which simply resulted in the tests on animals being exported.
We were in danger of doing just that and putting the testing into countries where the welfare of animals was a much lower priority than it is within the Member States.
It was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the European Union.
We reminded ourselves, and we do so again, that on 1 July the sixth amendment came into force.
Technically that would have brought any research using animals to a standstill.
There would have been no further progress on the production of new items, not just in the makeup field, but in areas such as medicated shampoos and dental hygiene.
We looked beyond that and we see the seventh amendment as the last chance.
It sets the target dates to end that marketing.
We decided that a blanket target date was not sustainable and so we looked for a timetable, and as a validated alternative becomes available for each test, that test on animals will be banned.
All such tests will be banned within the six years with the exception of the three to which the rapporteur has drawn attention, for which there will be a ten-year permitted timetable and a possibility of an extension of two years if, and only if, this Parliament endorses that extension through codecision.
Now the challenge is not only to the Commission, other colleagues have said that, but it is to the industry.
It is up to the industry to accelerate that search for validated alternatives.
The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive.
It has helped to convince firstly the Commission, and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this.
This minority too came into line and that is why we are at the point we are today, in optimistic mode.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the compromise reached by the Council and Parliament after much deliberation represents progress for animal welfare, as it will mean a ban on animal testing in cosmetics - as long as there are alternative methods available, of course.
Congratulations are in order for that.
I am wholly in favour of it.
I am also extremely pleased about the transitional period of six years to allow alternatives to be found, as there are only three categories of tests that are particularly difficult to replace and the industry has until 2013 to develop alternative methods for these.
After all, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest, which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances?
The widespread criticism about this transitional period, which argues that permitting animal testing to continue is a loophole in the law, is therefore unjustified.
As long as people do not volunteer for testing themselves, other ways of testing certain bulk products must be permitted.
After all, these bulk products are also used in the pharmaceutical industry, and the standards we apply to medicines are naturally different from those we apply to lipstick.
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this compromise.
Madam President, Commissioner, today is an immensely important day for the European cosmetics industry, ushering in a completely new era for cosmetic products, one for which a very large number of women have waited for a very long time.
I hope that products will come on to the market that will make beautiful young girls even more beautiful, but these are also very important to older women, who of course want to be attractive grandmothers to their grandchildren - and you try and find a grandmother who would dare tell her grandchildren that the cream she has just used, or that she uses on the children, has caused suffering to an immense number of animals.
Such a grandmother would be done for!
You see, celebrated and truly beautiful women have for a long time used products made without experimentation on animals.
Julia Roberts is one such; she loves natural cosmetics, preferring to use a rose cream from a German firm - and, ladies and gentlemen, as she is a celebrated American actress, perhaps that is sending an important message to the American cosmetics industry.
Do American actresses really have to resort to European products simply because they are not tested on animals here?
That attests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry.
I love cosmetics.
I owe my hair colour to l'OrÃ©al, my perfume is by Dior, and my face cream comes from Great Britain - Englishwomen have such wonderful complexions.
In future, though, I will use far more cosmetics, and will be proposing Mrs Roth-Behrendt for honorary membership of all animal welfare organisations.
Today, though, I really would like to thank Europe's cosmetics industry most warmly for its cooperation, and I wish you a turnover of staggering dimensions.
May these new products earn you masses and masses of money.
Madam President, I must admit to being rather moved, for not even in this House is this amount of praise and appreciation to be reckoned with.
I admit to enjoying it, for politicians do not often come in for praise, at any rate not with such frequency and regularity.
It has made me feel good, but I have already tried to pass this praise back.
Thank you for the debate, which I hope will turn out to be the last on this topic in this House; you have heard, Mr Liikanen, that it will be your future task to monitor how progress is made.
It will be your task to see to it, along with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, that the European Community's Joint Research Centre has sufficient resources to evaluate the alternatives that will then come into existence.
Your mission is to drive industry onward, support it and, in tandem with it, to ensure that alternatives are developed quickly and equally quickly accepted.
This is something we must do together.
Commissioner, you have heard today a message that will surely get through to the cosmetics industry and the Member States too: we will be very vigilant as regards how the timetable is kept to, and that this time there really will be the cut-off point of which Mr Florenz and others spoke earlier.
I would rather not hear anything further said on this subject in this House.
My wish is that there should now be a timetable, one that might even now be complied with even more promptly, and that that should draw a line under the subject.
Please let me conclude by again saying 'thank you' - that is why I wanted to say a final word.
Not to you, though, ladies and gentlemen, for I have thanked you already.
I would like to thank those without whom I could not have carried on this work - first and foremost my assistant Mrs Annika Nowak, who is probably sitting listening to this in my office, and who knows this dossier better than I do, but also especially the Secretariat of the Conciliation Committee.
Parliament has good staff; some of them are more than just good, and the Conciliation Committee Secretariat, sitting over there today, has certainly had the most work to do, far more than I have had myself.
Let me now - yes, this really is the end! - say 'thank you' to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite, one of my group's staff, who, throughout the last few years has advised me and been of use to me in my capacity as group leader and rapporteur, and without whom I would not have been able to keep my feet on the ground.
Today is probably the last time she will sit here in the plenary, as she is soon to take up other duties, and, whilst I am saddened by this, I know she will be doing something new that she will like and that will be a joy to her.
I have no idea how the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I are supposed to work without her. Anyway, we will give it a try.
She is here working on one of her briefs for the last time, and so my final and especial thanks must go to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite.
Thank you for the debate, and I hope that the vote, which is about to take place, will go well.
Thank you, rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The sitting is suspended until 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended 11.49 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
The next item is the vote.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0027/2003) tabled by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on immigration and asylum policy
(Parliament rejected the motion for resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, I rise on a brief point of order.
I have two short comments to make: firstly, to express my regret and to apologise, because I am the author of an alternative motion for a resolution which, as a result of the appalling time constraints, could not be included in Monday evening's debate on this report.
I wish to apologise for this and have my apology recorded in the House; secondly, I wish to ask the Bureau to draw attention to the fact that the first vote we will be holding on Amendment No 49 is not an ordinary vote; it is not a common vote on the amendment.
It is instead the first time that we shall be using one of Parliament's new rules - Rule 140(4) and, consequently, the possibility of adopting an alternative overall text.
In accordance with the new Rule 140(4) of the Rules of Procedure, we will take your amendment to replace the whole motion for a resolution by a new text first.
Before the vote on Amendment No 23:
Mr President, our voting list does not seem to be following the same order as yours.
That may be our problem rather than yours, but could we just take a moment to clarify?
We did not have Amendment 6 or Amendment 30, so we are a bit lost at the moment.
Could my colleagues help me here?
I think we have lost the page.
We have lost a whole page.
It is OK.
We will catch up.
(Laughter and applause)
The Liberals have been saying that for a hundred years.
(Laughter and applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 24:
Mr President, I would simply like to point out a translation error in the French version.
I have checked in the other versions.
This leads me to say to my PPE-DE friends that we should vote for this amendment and, of course, correct the French version.
We will ensure that all language versions are compatible.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It is my pleasure to welcome to the public gallery representatives of the Egyptian Parliament, led by Dr Mustafa El-Feki.
This is the first visit by representatives from the Egyptian Parliament since 1987.
It occurs at a very important time, in terms of the Middle East.
We particularly wish the delegation success under the current circumstances.
Mr President, the oral amendment consists of a social measure.
In paragraph 14, letter s, where it refers to attention to the care needs of those in rural communities, I would add ''and mountain communities''.
This is also in honour of the International Year of Mountains and the many mountains we have in Europe.
Mr President, I nevertheless deplore the way in which this vote has proceeded.
I regret that our colleagues were not serious to the end and showed no respect for the efforts of our fellow Members who worked on this resolution.
I agree with you entirely.
That concludes the vote
.
(FR) We voted against the European Parliament's resolution on immigration and asylum policy in particular because it attacks the Council several times, accusing it of ''obstructing progress'' in the adoption of the texts.
In reality, what we have here is a struggle between two concepts of immigration policy: the States meeting in the Council are trying to push through a (relatively) restrictive concept, whereas the Commission is constantly putting much more open proposals on the table, which might be said to be based on the idea that the rights of immigrants and refugees take precedence over the right of the citizens of the countries of Europe to security.
The European Parliament is clearly showing here whose side it is on.
Moreover, it is explicitly calling for the speedy adoption of the Commission's lax proposals on allowing immigrants' families to join them and the rights of long term resident immigrants, even going so far as to say that those rights must be 'as close as possible to those of European citizens'.
Unfortunately, the Treaty of Nice (which the governments of the States wanted) provides that these questions will soon be settled by qualified majority in the Council: that will be another factor in the Commission's favour, to get its proposals adopted.
- (DA) Overall, we are voting against the joint resolution on immigration and asylum policy tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
We are against the EU's having influence in this area, since it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide on these matters.
We are, however, able to support those parts of the resolution that take account of the social and humanitarian situation of refugees and immigrants and that try to improve it.
. (FR) We voted for the GUE/NGL Group's motion for a resolution and against the joint resolution, whose signatories once again show that they are concerned only with the free movement of goods but not with the freedom and rights of human beings.
We are against a fortress Europe surrounded with barbed wire, whether it is intended to keep out those fleeing oppressive regimes and seeking asylum or those who are simply fleeing poverty.
As for the references to sustainable development that is suggested as a way of preventing thousands of men and women from trying to flee their countries in order to flee poverty, they are humbug.
From sustainable development to sustainable development, the gap between the plundering imperialist countries and the poor countries never ceases to grow.
Our answer to the refrain repeated by most resolutions on 'preventing illegal immigration' is the need to regularise the situation of all so-called illegal immigrants.
We also reaffirm our demand that all who live and work in the European Union should have the same rights, including electoral rights, and the same freedoms, including the freedom of movement, as the citizens of the Member States of the Union.
British Conservatives have consistently opposed a Common Asylum and Immigration Policy and believe that these policies should be determined by Member States.
The British Conservatives will therefore vote against this resolution.
- (DA) We have, today in the European Parliament, voted in favour of the joint resolution (B5-0031/2003) on immigration and asylum policy. The proposal contains quite a number of useful features for improving immigration and asylum policy in the EU.
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position.
. (FR) Although the European Council defined the elements of a common asylum and immigration policy in Tampere in October 1999, we are obliged to note that little progress has been made and that it is essential that we take the necessary measures, in particular to put a stop to illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
We must improve the welcome we give to refugees so that potential immigrants are no longer tempted to use illegal means.
In June 2002 in Seville the European Council committed itself to speeding up the implementation of the programme adopted in Tampere; we therefore call on the Council to abide by its commitments and stop obstructing the expected progress.
We therefore call for a speedy and effective implementation of the conclusions of Seville and we regret that a common immigration policy has not yet been put in place.
We must respond quickly because we cannot close our eyes to the dramas currently being played out in our Member States.
Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I voted for the report against the experimentation of cosmetics on animals, tabled by Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt.
Why did I vote for the report?
I must say that fish, which I have helped and supported for a long time with regard to reports concerning them, have spread the word that Mr Fatuzzo helps and listens to animals, and consequently the news has spread from them to many other animal species.
So many of these creatures have asked me to ensure - in my own small way with my vote - that these experiments, which they do not look on kindly, are ended.
They also asked me to try my best to stop fur coats being made from their pelts: another important achievement which I hope will come about soon.
In the meantime, we have obtained what I voted for, contained in the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee in the Roth-Behrendt report.
. (FR) This seventh amendment to Directive 76/768/EEC on cosmetic products is essential because, apart from the fact that it seeks to approximate the various laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products, its main objective is to put in place a lasting and definitive ban on the performance of animal experiments for finished cosmetic products in the European Union.
This objective might have remained a pious hope if Parliament had not demanded the simultaneous imposition of an immediate ban on animal experiments for finished products and for ingredients in cases where alternative methods of experimentation have been validated by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods and of a ban on the marketing of cosmetic ingredients tested on animals.
In fact, I think the concomitance of these two bans is the only really effective way of stimulating the development of alternative methods of experimentation.
Finally, with reference to the precautionary principle, I think that carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductively toxic substances, classed in categories 1, 2 and 3 depending on their risk potential, should be banned from use in cosmetics.
.
(PT) The European Parliament has fought for the Directive on Cosmetics to be extended and deepened, especially in the field of testing on animals.
Parliament was therefore calling for: a ban on animal testing from 2004; a ban on the marketing of products that have been tested on animals five years after the adoption of this directive and the promotion of alternative testing methods that do not involve experiments on animals.
Unfortunately, the original position of the European Commission was to advocate a ban on animal testing in the European area rather than a ban on the marketing of such products.
I welcome the fact that, in the conciliation process, both the Council and the Commission moved towards the position maintained by the European Parliament. I am also pleased that an agreement was reached, stipulating a ban on experimenting and marketing for most testing methods within six years and, with regard to tests for which alternative methods have not yet been tested, a ten-year transposition period for this ban.
Mr President, the final two lines of paragraph 55 of the Swiebel report, which has been adopted by the House, calls for steps to be taken as soon as possible, on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to issue a directive abolishing all the other kinds of discrimination not yet regulated, which are set out in Article 13, including the prohibition of discrimination against citizens on the grounds of age and disability.
In Italy, we still have a law which does not grant a disability pension to elderly citizens, whereas it does grant it to its younger citizens.
I think that, when someone falls ill, the age that this occurs is unimportant: people fall ill to the same degree; if people have no income, they are the same, whether young or old.
In particular, I feel that not giving a disability pension to European citizens just because they are over 65, whereas one would be granted before, is discrimination, and that is why I gladly approved this report.
Mr President, today, a fortuitous left-wing majority of five votes has done damage to the cause of human rights.
I take the view that one can have the most divergent views on all issues of policy, but I regard a polarisation of this sort on human rights as being intrinsically malignant.
We should be consistent in concerning ourselves with real violations of human rights and real discrimination, and doing so consensually and on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rather than letting this House be divided into two equal and mutually antagonistic ideological camps.
In my view, the cause of human rights is too important for a community founded on law and human rights to allow that to be done to it.
That is why I voted against this report.
Not everything that has human rights on the cover is actually about human rights, and if we want to lay down how the monks on Mount Athos organise access to their monasteries, regulate religious communities, and force Member States to accept certain definitions of marriage and the family that many of us - myself included - fundamentally repudiate, then that has nothing to do with human rights, but rather with ideology, and it is ideology that has not been neglected in this report.
Mr President, as has already been said, by just five votes Parliament has provided the news reports with one of the most disappointing and shameful pages on our work in this forum: a report entitled 'on the human rights situation in the European Union' and which, on the contrary, has violated, or is violating, many of the rights which most affect citizens.
Let us consider one of many: the institution of the family, which is, to say the least, distorted by this report; a family model which proposes the free union between men or women of the same sex and liberalised single-parent or, precisely, homosexual, adoption laws.
And furthermore, a country is put forward as a model - the Netherlands to be exact - which, in addition to these things, has official euthanasia and liberalised drug policies.
Well, if this is the social model which is now coming out of Parliament, I dissociate myself from it and - here lies the weak spot - the majority of Member States dissociate themselves from it too: only two or three indirectly follow the Dutch model.
There will now be an institutional deadlock, because neither the Commission nor the Council - they have already announced this - are willing to accept this trend.
We have missed an opportunity to be clearer and more coherent.
The British Labour members and I have voted in favour of the Swiebel report, which as a whole serves a valuable purpose.
All Member States must, by their very nature, be strong and confident enough to accept criticism.
This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid.
The report is based on second-hand information from NGOs and other organisations.
A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in.
The UK takes very seriously all allegations of violence and racism by public servants.
Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought.
The detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism is a very serious matter.
However, exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security.
The 1951 Geneva Convention was surely never intended to give protection to terrorists; it is therefore right that they should be excluded.
Whilst not perfect, UK legislation seeks to promote the rights of workers and encourages employers to treat employees with due consideration at all times.
They also have access to legal redress if appropriate.
With respect to maternity rights in the UK, all pregnant women are entitled to 18 weeks leave, which may begin up to 11 weeks before the birth of the child.
So we have reservations about the accuracy of the report but we welcome it and have voted in favour.
?he motion on fundamental rights in the European Union is, generally speaking, a good motion.
However, there are several problem paragraphs, such as paragraph 78 on the ban on women entering Mount Athos.
I do not think it is against this criterion that women's rights will be measured; they will be measured in terms of employment, equal pay, domestic violence and the fight against trafficking in human beings.
We can hardly talk about freedom of movement on this tiny strip of land which has its own sense of time and observes customs and traditions which date back thousands of years.
Soon we will be calling for freedom of establishment and freedom of business activity and the monasteries will be overrun with Coca-Cola stands.
In an increasingly plastic and homogenised world, we should respect the cultural wealth which comes down from the past, without affecting modern society, and leave Mount Athos to travel through time at its own pace.
It is because of paragraph 78 that I am forced to vote against the report as a whole.
We Swedish Social Democrats present this explanation of vote concerning the following points:
Item 23:
We are against using the expression, 'forced prostitution'.
Our view is that prostitution is always forced.
Behind prostitution, there is always compulsion, dependency and exploitation.
There can be no talk of voluntary prostitution and therefore no talk of forced prostitution either.
Item 67:
We believe that Sweden should sign ILO Convention No 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples.
Signing up to the convention requires adjustments to Swedish law, however.
For example, the extent of the land that the Lapps have traditionally used or been in possession of has to be clearly identified.
The task of establishing the extent of these areas has been entrusted by the government to a special commission that exists for the purpose of setting the limits of the reindeer breeding area.
The inquiry must be completed by the end of 2004 and will then have to be referred for consultation.
It means that it will be some years before Swedish ratification is possible.
Item 133:
In the justification of item 133, Sweden is singled out in connection with two deaths that have attracted attention and in connection with which the police's, the prosecution service's and the coroner's actions have been sharply criticised.
We wish to make it clear that the Swedish Government responded to the criticism and set up an inquiry that was completed last year.
The inquiry was conducted expressly from the point of view of citizens' rights and is critical of a variety of aspects of the criminal inquiry.
- (IT) The defence of fundamental rights cannot and must not become the ideological flag of any particular group, but must be the joint heritage of all citizens.
Reading the pages of the Swiebel Report, however, it can be inferred that this important commitment to everybody's rights is being transformed into an accusation against some quarters: in particular Italy and those who, in Italy, took the liberty of voting against the rapporteur's wishes.
Also with regard to defence of the family and related values, the report takes a one-sided, prejudiced view, which is certainly legitimate for a political group, but which cannot and must not become a common position of the European Union.
Apart from religious aspects - which, nevertheless, cannot be completely overlooked, given the importance attached to Christian culture in Europe - the report completely ignores the great social and educational value undeniably inherent in the traditional couple, intended as a basic cell in the connective tissue of society.
Defence of the right of individuals to conduct their relationships in their preferred manner is sacrosanct, but the European institutions cannot, in my view, equate these relationships with the social institution of the family in its traditional meaning.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The Moderate delegation to the European Parliament considers it incredibly important that a parliamentary report be written each year on the ways in which the EU Member States are complying with human rights.
Human rights are the most important foundation stone of European cooperation.
It is self-evident that we should make just as tough demands upon our own countries as upon the candidate countries and other non-EU countries.
It is, however, unfortunate that the report does not simply focus upon fundamental rights but also expresses certain political aspirations.
Irrespective of whether or not one shares these political visions, this method is in danger of devaluing the importance of fundamental rights.
That is why we cannot vote for the report in its entirety.
We are also voting against item 43, because it is wrongly worded.
Naturally, the principle that it should not be possible to convict someone twice for the same crime is fundamental.
That does not, however, mean that imprisonment and deportation should be excluded as punishments for serious crimes.
We are also opposed to the EU's interfering in issues concerning forms of family relationship, because we believe that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, family policy is a matter for the individual nations.
. (FR) The annual report on the human rights situation in the European Union presented today is an interminable document that very often steps beyond the competences of our Assembly and tends to blame the Member States, as if they were dangerous delinquents and recidivists in this field, whereas we are on the contrary a part of the world where these rights are well protected.
We therefore voted in favour of Amendment No 49, which proposed an alternative resolution drawn up by our colleague Mr Ribeiro e Castro, a shorter text denouncing the expansionism of the European Parliament and concentrating our thoughts on the real problems of the day, first and foremost among which are terrorism, trafficking in human beings, child sex abuse, contempt for the family and other ills that are all too real.
As was to be feared, our Assembly has persisted with its initial resolution, adding to its previous errors calls for homosexual married couples to be granted equal rights with those of families, for the total abolition of double jeopardy and for various measures further relaxing asylum policy while at the same time restricting the possibilities for expulsion.
We therefore voted against.
- (DA) We have today voted in favour of paragraph 41 of Mrs Swiebel's report for, if the common EU asylum policy should unfortunately be adopted, we want it to be based upon humanitarianism and respect for international conventions. Moreover, respect for human rights must be, and remain, its indispensable point of departure.
On principle, we do not however believe that this is best achieved by developing a common European refugee policy based on the supranational first pillar.
The June Movement is also voting in favour of the whole report, because human rights within the EU must naturally be respected, if not improved. We are doing this in spite of the fact that we do not wish to see a common asylum policy, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the development of an EU human rights agency.
The June Movement endeavours to support and improve the human rights situation both within and outside the EU.
We support the right of everyone to a life of dignity, but we do not believe that this is necessarily best achieved within the framework of the EU.
. (FR) In her speech, Mrs Arlette Laguiller condemned the narrow limits of this report and some of the unacceptable stances taken, in particular where it speaks of combating illegal immigration.
If, in spite of everything, we voted in favour of this report, it is because the few recommendations that go in the right direction, that defend basic rights, that condemn racism and xenophobia or that oppose the death penalty, so much annoy the most reactionary parties in this Assembly.
And we do not want our votes to be associated, either directly or indirectly, with those people's votes.
The Member States and the EU have got into the habit of giving lessons in democracy and defence of human rights all over the world.
This generally accompanies demands for freedom of the market and competition.
Reading the Swiebel report, you would think the Member States also needed to put their houses in order.
The report does in fact reveal many violations of human rights in the EU.
No country is spared!
Sexual discrimination or discrimination against minorities like the Roma, police violence, deplorable conditions of detention in prisons and police stations, racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic acts and violence, challenges to basic rights in the name of combating terrorism, the replacement of security policies and crackdowns on immigration and asylum, not to mention violations of social rights and frequent attacks on trade union rights.
The report of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is based on a large number of examples and is not content with levying criticism; it questions governments and puts forward precise proposals and recommendations in many fields.
I and my group are glad that the majority of our Assembly has adopted the report, which was further enriched by the adoption of my group's amendments.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(PT) The report both criticises and praises the human rights situation in Portugal, in a way that we feel is accurate and balanced.
It would not be acceptable for the Portuguese institutions not to take account of them on the pretext that the integrity of the State takes precedence over citizens' rights and this is the factor that won my vote.
The report's explanatory statement also contains less rigorous information which did not, however, influence my vote, because I do not feel they are important in determining the report's content, since they are not being voted on or published.
Like local, regional or national institutions, the European institutions must also be free to adopt a position, criticise or praise the practices of institutions other than their own.
Nevertheless, a report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU that makes no assessment of the legislation and activities of the European institutions is not a report on the European Union - it is merely a report on Member States.
This report on the Member States must therefore be followed up with another, more important report, assessing the practices of the European institutions in the field of human rights.
. (FR) Fundamental rights are at the heart of our political commitment: we therefore were unable to vote for this report.
Last year, Parliament adopted a method comprising the adoption of the Charter, the establishment of means, including the network of experts, and a joint effort by three rapporteurs, in order to achieve a consensus.
This method has not been followed and this report, furthermore, reflects the opinion of the rapporteur rather than an in-depth analysis: the whole Charter and nothing but the Charter, and therefore an article-by-article, State-by-State analysis.
This was an opportunity for Parliament to gain control over the Member States.
Nothing but the Charter, in other words, the articles as they are and not as one might like them to be.
This report will not affect the Charter at all, since only a new Convention has the power to change its articles.
I regret that the recommendations made in the report go beyond the Charter, and can only lament the fact that the search for a consensus has perversely been replaced by the provocative and exaggerated nature of certain proposals.
Moreover, it is completely pointless to overstate the situation.
This report could have been awaited by the press and feared by the Member States.
Having failed to achieve a unanimous vote, however, it will be buried alongside other pointless reports.
. (FR) Citizenship is inextricably linked to participation in the political life of a Member State.
It is the sign of belonging to a particular group, not only in a strictly legal sense, but also on a very practical level.
The right to vote at local level is one way of participating.
Third country nationals can already participate in many ways in local life within the European Union.
Granting them the right to vote at local level means recognising an additional right, but this recognition is not without its associated duties.
Third country nationals who can prove that they have lived in the European Union for at least five years must therefore show a voluntary commitment if they are to be granted the right to vote in local elections.
This commitment must confirm compliance with democratic values and human rights as laid down, amongst others, by the Constitutions and national legislation, as well as by the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950, which protects in particular freedom of conscience and religion, and prohibits any form of discrimination on the grounds of religion, sex or race.
Citizenship must be defined by certain civic behaviour as much as by active and daily participation in society.
We think the report is very good and are therefore voting in favour of it.
We do not, however, share the rapporteur's absolute conviction that, basically, the only way of bringing about sustained compliance with human rights in the European Union is to introduce the Charter of Fundamental Rights into future treaties.
.
(PT) We wish to distance ourselves clearly from the approach contained in the motion for a resolution which seeks to give the Charter of Fundamental Rights a 'constitutional' value that it does not have and we would recall the criticism we made of any such intention and of the motion's retrograde content in the field of rights at the time it was adopted at the Nice Summit, whereas others have supported it and continue to do so.
We wish to distance ourselves clearly from a vision of control and of interference in the domestic affairs of the Member States, which is reinforced in the Treaties and which we criticised at the time, whereas others have supported it and continue to do so.
At the same time, we must not forget the methodological aspects that occur throughout the process, and we feel that the motion that has been tabled lists a set of recommendations - and we should emphasise here that these are only recommendations - which, in general terms, will protect fundamental rights. These include personal freedoms, immigrants' rights, freedom of movement, the right to privacy, non-discrimination, gender equality, children's rights, the rights of people with disabilities and the protection of social rights.
These recommendations will protect social rights - particularly by making optimal use of the revised European Social Charter and the ILO conventions - and access to justice.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
. (EL) The PASOK political group's vote on the motion in Mrs Joke Swiebel's report is a clear vote against, as far as Greece is concerned.
On most points criticising Greece or urging it to make improvements, either the relevant articles of Greek law have already been amended and the called-for improvement already introduced or the first steps toward legislative reform have already been taken.
For example:
1.
We are urged (paragraph 17) to abolish the death penalty.
However, the three facts are omitted:
a) the death penalty has been abolished, except in the military penal code, and then only for crimes in times of war;
b) the bill to abolish the death penalty in the military penal code has already been drafted;
c) no death penalty imposed is ever carried out.
2.
Conscientious objectors:
a) the new arrangements allowing exemption from military service are now included in a constitutional decree;
b) Greek legislation no longer limits these favourable arrangements to religious objection; they now extend to conscientious objection in general.
British Conservatives believe that this report is an outrageous intrusion into the domestic affairs of the UK and other Member States.
The unwarranted attacks on valuable public servants such as policemen and prison guards are completely unacceptable and cannot be substantiated.
The reality is that we live in a dangerous world in which our liberty is threatened by terrorists, dictators and violent crimes.
The British public is entitled to expect its elected representatives to defend and protect it, not to leave it vulnerable in these vital areas.
The report shows the European union in a very bad light.
In her report Miss Swiebel expresses her own personal views on human rights.
British Conservative MEPs urge the parliamentary authorities to ensure that future reports of this kind are under the stewardship of someone who will take a less personal and more objective approach.
. (FR) Here we are again, just like every year at the same time considering the traditional report by the European Parliament on the situation of fundamental rights within the European Union.
Apart from the usual list, the report proposed today once again joins in the obsession of the pro-immigration, human-rights, liberal, anti-national, colonialist lobbies.
It contains an anthology of aberrations: from the recognition of the right to vote and eligibility of foreigners, to the application of quotas for foreigners' access to the job market, to the extension of homosexual marriage, to the abolition of the current minimum age for marriage in France - which is currently 15 for girls and 18 for boys - or the extension of the interpretation of the concept of national minority to all ethnic minorities.
This report would be sadly mediocre, however, if the scattergun approach that has produced all these recitals had not also produced the request to lift the ban introduced in 1045 on women entering Mount Athos, the Greek orthodox sanctuary for monks.
The rapporteur considers this ban to be counter to the principle of non-discrimination and gender equality!
When will monasteries and convents be forced to be mixed?
Anyone establishing fundamental rights in the European Union must know whether these rights are being observed seriously by the governments concerned.
It is to Mrs Swiebel's credit that she has documented so well how much is wrong in Europe in the area of human rights.
She correctly focuses attention on police misconduct, abuses in prisons, discrimination against ethnic minorities, failings in criminal proceedings and the vestiges of inequalities between men and women.
This also applies to child labour, the access of non-EU citizens to the labour market, the difficulties people have in obtaining the nationality of the country in which they are now living, and the lack of the right to vote for those who have not yet obtained this nationality.
EU Member States are apparently failing to ratify international treaties on national minorities, cross-border television, the revised European Social Charter and the status of adopted or illegitimate children.
Minors are being used as child soldiers.
Excessively authoritarian security measures that are now being justified with reference to the current threat of terrorism are threatening to become permanent.
We are very much in need of this inventory so that we can put an end to abuses more effectively.
It is striking that this report, which speaks for itself, was only adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs by 25 votes to 20.
Evidently there is a large minority in this Parliament that does not want to tackle the existing violations of fundamental rights.
. (FR) I cannot remember ever, in all my years as a parliamentarian, seeing as abhorrent a text as that presented to us today by Mrs Swiebel.
It naturally contains all the federalists' traditional pet theories on the restrictive nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its possible transformation into the preamble to a utopian European Constitution.
Aside from this aspect, however, which is in itself unacceptable on principle, the main cause for indignation is the instrumentalisation of the Charter against the Member States.
The rapporteur admits that her goal is to hijack the Charter of Fundamental Rights to instigate legal proceedings against the Member States and, ultimately, to impose practices, habits and sometimes even deviances that are radically different from our Judaeo-Christian common heritage, on national legal systems.
The legitimate fight for respect for human rights must not be confused with unhealthy fantasies to the detriment of the common good.
In tabling an alternative resolution, my group had only one objective: to save the honour of a Parliament which has already discredited itself enough by adopting this abhorrent Swiebel report in committee. This report is truly a compact version of the most sickening aspects of the ideology of human-rights activists.
.
(PT) There is nothing like a good political fight.
From the democratic point of view, I congratulate Mrs Swiebel on her ultimate success.
The narrow margin between votes, however, which meant that my own motion for a resolution was not adopted in plenary (by only 23 votes) and the extremely slim majority (of only five votes) that has just adopted the final resolution, clearly show that the wrong course has been taken.
This adds nothing positive to European integration on which, being an issue so bound up in the tradition, history and consensus of the European peoples, we have been so profoundly divided, heading towards radical confrontations.
In fact, anyone reading the motion that has been adopted might believe themselves to be living in a terrible atmosphere of persecution, under one of the murkiest dictatorships of the twentieth century!
The methodological shift employed by the rapporteur (and by the narrow majority) has led to exaggerated views that show utter contempt for the fact that the European Union is one of the few privileged regions in the entire world where human rights and respect and guarantees for these are concerned.
Lastly, we have heaped scorn on the reality of a situation with which we are all familiar and we have ended up looking ridiculous, for having given in to a left-wing and sectarian political agenda.
This does no favours, either for Europe or for human rights.
Finally, I welcome the initiative of tabling an overall alternative motion: since the UEN Group has only 22 Members, the 246 votes obtained in plenary by the alternative motion clearly demonstrate the relative success achieved, as an instrument for political clarification and for affirming our difference.
I have voted against the report.
It is probably the first time in the history of the European Parliament that a rapporteur has presented a report on human rights which, for good reasons, has been so fiercely criticised and has attracted such a strikingly narrow majority of votes (274 in favour, 269 against and 14 abstentions).
The report reflects options selected on a party political basis and misuses the concept of human rights.
This is due to the fact that the rapporteur (by discussing, for example, family legislation and the rights of Greek monks in relation to their properties in Mount Athos) ranges far and wide beyond the original remit and parameters of the report, which are constituted by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In this way, the concept of human rights is diluted, watered down and devalued, which is pretty serious.
I have grave doubts as to how secure a basis there is for the far-reaching assertion in item133 to the effect that in seven EU Member States, including Sweden, a 'climate of impunity' prevails in relation to misconduct and violence by police and prison staff.
Since the issue in question is not an EU matter, we European and Christian Democrats were, however, successful in removing item83 (279 votes in favour, 259 against and 9 abstentions), with its invitation to the Member States 'to open up marriage to same-sex couples'.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Swiebel on her outstanding work.
I also find it disappointing that 13 of the 15 Member States appear not to have honoured their obligation to report periodically on the human rights situation in their countries to the international supervisory committees set up for this purpose.
As the European Union, we have to set an example, otherwise our credibility with third countries will be in jeopardy.
As the chairman of the Intergroup for Regional and Minority Languages, I would like to emphasise how important the use of regional and minority languages is to people.
Language forms part of our personal and cultural identity and is thus one of our fundamental rights.
It is the most important means of communication between people.
Encouraging the use of minority languages reinforces social cohesion at regional level.
I have therefore voted in favour of paragraphs 66 and 68.
It is the first step.
According to Article 149 of the Treaty on European Union, the European Union's task is to support linguistic diversity.
This is not enough: we urgently need a legal basis for regional and minority languages in the Treaty.
Language is an important part of our cultural heritage, and it would be a sin if regional and minority languages were to be lost on account of neglect and suppression.
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent here, strongly approves of this report on the European Union's management of the external borders of our 15 Member States, soon to become 25, and shortly thereafter, 27.
In my opinion, it is important to immediately give economic strength and, in particular, the European Union's support, to all these new candidate countries which, in two or four years' time, will constitute the external borders of the Union.
In fact, it is clear that this is where the weakness of the borders lies, and the first months following the entry of these States, in law and in fact, into the European Union, is when there will be the greatest danger of a violation of the new external borders of Europe.
Mr President, I have been happy to vote for Mr Pirker's report, seeing that it carries on work that I did in 1998, when we adopted the report - in my name at the time - on eastward enlargement and internal security, which for the first time elaborated the idea of a European Corps of Border Guards.
Since then, substantial progress has been made on the part of the Member States by way of the Italian feasibility study, and on the part of the Commission by way of this communication, for which I thank Commissioner Vitorino.
This, though, is only the first step in the right direction, and I would like to make it abundantly clear that I am putting the case for our pressing for a truly European border protection force, for a European Corps of Border Guards with a basis in Community law and financed on a Community basis, for anything else would be nothing more than a hotchpotch.
As far as the proposed educational institution is concerned, I suggest that resources should be combined and duplication of work avoided by using the Police Academy, also proposed in the 1998 report and already up and running.
I believe this would get us on the right track.
Crime is organised internationally, and we have to, at long last, organise the combating of crime on a Community and cross-border basis.
. (FR) Whereas the Commission, in its communication of 7 May 2002, aimed to lead the Member States in the unrealistic direction of supranational, or so-called 'integrated' management of external borders, the governments have brought it back to reality by adopting a 'plan for the management of the external borders' containing useful practical measures such as exchange of positive experience, operational coordination, continuous common training, compatible equipment, common risk analysis, amongst others.
The European Parliament's Pirker report is more along these lines, and we also agree, as we have already said at the Seville European Council in June 2002.
The report, however - and this is the reason behind our abstention from the vote - regrets the fact that the Council challenged the idea of an 'integrated' European border-control body.
This 'supranationalisation' of external border control would in fact be highly counterproductive, as it would take responsibility away from the Member States.
It is vital for each Member State to remain in control of its borders.
It would be useful, however, for the Member States that, by virtue of their geographical position, bear significant costs in this regard, which benefit their neighbours in the Union, to receive appropriate technical and financial support from these neighbours.
This would be a useful outlet for European solidarity.
. (FR) In accordance with the Commission and the Council, the rapporteur would like the European Union to establish 'integrated management of the external borders' - which is not about to happen, given the rivalry between the Member States within the Union itself.
But why?
Against whom and against what?
You do not specify this because that would mean recognising that this integrated management of the external borders would not be in order to protect the people of Europe, but, without saying so openly, would be designed to turn the European Union into a fortress to which access for migrants, the poor, and refugees would be even more difficult.
Naturally, we voted against this report.
. (FR) This communication from the European Commission on the integrated management of the external borders of the EU is designed to ensure that we have an area of freedom, security and justice.
We can only approve the establishment of coordination between the Member States over external border control.
In order to guarantee security within the EU, in particular following enlargement, we need to:
ensure mutual trust between the Member States with regard to border control,
combat all kinds of internal and external threats created by terrorism and
combat illegal immigration.
Having said that, I cannot support the repressive, security-obsessed thinking behind some of these proposals, even if, and in particular if, it is currently popular at European level, and particularly in France.
We are too inclined to combat the symptoms rather than the true causes of the problems of poverty and unemployment, not forgetting the absence of genuine policies in favour of immigrants.
Nobody can deny that the right to security is a fundamental right.
We must all be aware, however, that we cannot sacrifice the other fundamental rights in order to achieve it.
- (DA) We have, today in the European Parliament, voted neither in favour of, nor against, Mr Pirker's report (A5-0449/2002) on integrated management of the external borders.
The proposal includes quite a few useful features, but we do not believe that the time is ripe for setting up a joint Corps of Border Guards.
At the same time, we would draw attention to the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position.
Schengen cooperation has enabled people to travel more freely in the Member States without having to show their passports at the internal borders.
Obviously, such a reform requires more effective patrolling of the shared external borders.
In that context, it is of the utmost importance that present and future Member States cooperate closely in order to guarantee border controls of the same standard along the whole of the external border, especially through training and joint guidelines.
We are, however, doubtful about the idea of an EU-financed Corps of Border Guards.
The national police forces' monopoly on crime fighting and border patrols within the territories of the Member States is fundamental and should be retained.
Police from other countries should not have the power to act in other Member States except under very special circumstances, as is also stated in the Schengen Convention.
As far as possible, these rules should also apply to border controls.
Individual Member States' provisions and traditions when it comes to police work, especially procedures relating to ID checks and arrests, differ from one another in many respects.
With a joint Corps of Border Guards, there might be a danger of these provisions' not being fully respected.
Financial aid for the border authorities of relevant Member States should instead make it possible to meet the increased need for personnel able to ensure effective patrols of the EU's external border.
.
(PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Pirker on the excellent report he has produced on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union' which I fully support, in particular with regard to the aptness of creating a European Corps of Border Guards. Whilst not replacing the national authorities responsible for managing their external borders, this would enable them to work together to ensure the internal security of the Union and the implementation of the principle of freedom of movement.
I would also stress my conviction that the efficiency of border management will probably be improved by the adoption of common measures in the field of external border management.
. (FR) Europe has abolished internal borders.
As well as the common market, we have the great Schengen agreement.
We can move freely.
In exchange for removing all the doors from the 15 apartments in the European building, the 380 million tenants were entitled to have an effective doorman at the common entrance.
This doorman at the external borders, however, is not doing his job.
In Almeria, Brindisi and, as of June 2004, in Poland, Cyprus and the Baltic States, drugs, pimps, immigration, human trafficking, criminals and terrorists all move freely.
Security is no longer guaranteed.
The rapporteur asks for radars, satellites, a common monitoring policy, continuous training with a type of 'Frontalis', following the 'Fiscalis' model of integrated tax control, and naturally the inevitable European body.
In this case, a border-control corps, just as others want coastguards.
There is even the traditional European agency to heal all woes going by the name of SCIFA+, a body responsible for coordinating border protection.
In the meantime, the external borders are like leaky sieves, letting everything through.
Which at the end of the day is the only effective solution.
Once Europe has been swamped from the East and from the South, it will no longer be necessary to monitor entry through the borders since everyone will already be inside.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The collective training of officials, the collective development of radar equipment, the purchase of mobile surveillance installations and a collective border surveillance service belong to a different sort of Europe than the one the European Union has up to now professed to be.
If the EU develops into one single superstate, it goes without saying that there must be one single minister of foreign affairs with one single embassy in every country abroad and one single collective seat in the United Nations.
The remarkable thing is that nobody is openly advocating a superstate such as this.
The Member States want to keep their embassies and their seats in the UN and the ministers of foreign affairs would rather coordinate their work through a common secretariat than through the European Commission.
Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence, we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states.
It would therefore only be logical to opt for a standard access procedure for migrants and visitors from abroad and a standard border surveillance service if we really wanted to be one single superstate.
What is remarkable is that we are now making a decision to screen off 'Fortress Europe' against the poor parts of the outside world without having reached agreement about a common future inside this fortress.
I therefore reject this proposal.
.
(PT) Illegal immigration networks, trafficking in human beings, organised crime and the fight against terrorism are situations that certainly warrant widespread and priority concern and, as defined in Laeken, call for cooperation mechanisms between the current services responsible for controlling our external borders.
Nevertheless, it is clear that in the Schengen acquis, structures with competences and powers to define 'common standards' and processes for police cooperation are already in place.
This proposal, however, goes further and the aim behind it is to create a European Corps of Border Guards, with duties that fall within the strict competence of the national authorities and to which, therefore, we cannot agree.
Its activities would involve, in particular, the inspection of documents, the questioning of foreign citizens and the notification of admission or refusal of entry into our territory.
Clearly, a European police corps of this nature raises questions, primarily with regard to its questionable and highly dubious effectiveness.
Essentially, however, and as affirmed in the Commission Communication, it would pose delicate constitutional problems in various Member States.
It is therefore a priority to make national police forces with these powers more effective and to ensure appropriate cooperation between them in order to provide a satisfactory response to such situations.
.
(PT) This report focuses on the Commission communication on better management of external borders, which links the action of the Member States with measures of a European nature, which are crucial given the threat, posed in particular by organised crime, terrorism, illegal immigration, and the imminent entry of new countries into the EU.
In light of the experience gained from applying the Schengen acquis, we feel it would be appropriate to implement a common policy in the field of managing current and future external borders, incorporating into this policy the best practices established by the Member States.
Nevertheless, European border management still falls within the sphere of national competence and must be applied at national level and, on this point, I am in full agreement with the rapporteur's position.
In this context, the programmes for the training and re-training of staff and senior officials, updating the design and installation of equipment and the drawing up of an integrated risk analysis model are absolutely crucial.
Despite the rapporteur's suggestion to create a European corps of border guards composed of special units, to be made available on a temporary basis to the national authorities in high-risk sectors at external borders, when needed and requested by the Member States, which is controversial, my opinion on the report as a whole is positive and I have therefore voted for it.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report for the following reasons, which are quite brief. Firstly, the importance of the Commission communication which, in discussing the better management of the EU's external borders, links the action of the Member States to measures of a European nature, which are actually crucial, given the threats posed in particular by organised crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, as well as the imminent entry into the EU of new countries.
Secondly, the positive approach of the rapporteur, who continually emphasises that the management of our borders is still a national competence and must be applied at the national level. This must not, however, in light of the experience gained from applying the Schengen acquis, prevent the development of a coordinated policy for the management of current and future external borders, incorporating into this policy the best practices established by the Member States.
For this reason I too support the proposal to adopt, at Community level, programmes for the training, including re-training, of staff and senior officials and the drawing up of an integrated risk analysis model.
I am also in favour of creating a European corps of border guards, composed of special units and to be made available on a temporary basis to the national authorities in high-risk sectors at external borders, when needed and requested by the Member States.
I would, as a matter of fact, draw attention to the fact that Portugal has precisely one of the most important and sensitive external borders of the EU - in this case, a maritime border - to which no one has paid particular attention.
Mr President, many pensioners purchase securities in an attempt to be better off in their later life.
The document by Mr Generoso Andria which we have adopted, helps these small investors, citizens who do not have much money but for whom it is even more important to have fewer expenses when they invest the little money they have available in securities.
I therefore applaud the initiative and content of this report which my friend, Mr Generoso Andria, tabled to the House and which the House, myself included, voted for today.
. (FR) Even from the perspective of the operation of the financial markets and the capitalist economy, the national fragmentation of the European Union is a handicap.
Its entire history over past decades shows that it can only be overcome with great effort and difficulty.
In financial terms, you would like to emulate the system currently in use in the United States.
In order to create this system, however, we would need to apply restrictive regulatory measures to the Member States, which they refuse to accept.
The funniest thing is seeing the rapporteur - a banker by trade - explaining that we would need to create a genuine, non-profit-making public service, which would make cross-border transactions easier and less costly!
At a time when both the European institutions and the Member States are dismantling public services that are of use to the people, advocating a public service for the use of financiers and bankers is like vice praising virtue.
We are for the enlargement of public services that are of use to the people. We could not care less, however, about the state of mind of financiers facing problems due to the very nature of their own system.
By all means, try to solve your own problems, but, since they do not concern us, we abstained from this vote.
.
(PT) This report should be seen against the backdrop of the action plan for financial services planned under what is known as the Lisbon strategy, which aims to integrate markets and financial services by 2005 and to achieve greater liberalisation of movements of capital, to which we are opposed.
On the basis of a recent Commission communication, which seeks to regulate the clearing and settlement of securities transactions, in other words, the functioning of the integrated securities markets, especially in crossborder transactions, and in the aim of liberalising movements of capital and of creating a single market for financial services, it also seeks to harmonise the rules, legislation and methods of clearing and settlement in the various Member States, taking account of the considerable national differences that exist in this field.
Hence the desire to create a common European infrastructure and the proposals to follow the American example, exerting pressure on the Commission to study a similar approach for the European Union, also calling on the Member States, in the forthcoming revision of Directive 93/22/EEC, on investment services, to give investment companies from other States the right of access to national clearing and settlement systems. This is something with which we disagree.
Mr President, the proposals contained in the document tabled by Mr Mario Mantovani on the future of health care and care for the elderly that we have adopted, is perfect, and we should approve every single line, as I did.
I would like to stress how important it is, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Pensioners' Party which I represent in the European Parliament, for more substantial European funds to be granted to the development of remote surgical operation techniques.
Nowadays, a surgeon in Rome can operate on an ill patient - usually an elderly patient - in Finland or Belgium and vice versa.
This is what living without borders is all about, and we have to provide as much help as Europe can give to all citizens in this field, in particular those who are ill.
The issue of health care and care for the elderly is an important one and of concern to us all.
The report is thoughtful and well-considered.
I would underline the point made early in the report that the provision of health and health care services is a Member State competence.
It is important that this should continue to be the case.
But all Member States can learn from each other, and in particular they need to learn in the key areas covered by this report.
I was pleased that my amendments were accepted by the rapporteur as well as the full House today.
The specific needs of the elderly regarding health care need much more attention, especially in rural areas.
In my own country, projections are that more and more elderly people are moving to rural areas to retire.
They put down roots in such communities.
Long, active and fulfilled lives depend more on socialising than exercising, and it is important that as many as possible of the needs of the elderly are addressed within their local communities rather than addressed at a distance in the towns and cities.
This is a challenge, but it is a challenge which must be met.
We have our reservations about the content of Mr Mantovani's report.
We support the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, advocating a method of cooperation instead of the open coordination method.
We are opposed to devising common standards for the monitoring of health and health care strategies and to devising common development strategies for health and health care services within the area concerned.
As Swedish Liberals, we view European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems, such as those relating to the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, whereby decisions are to be made as close as possible to those they affect.
It needs to be clear to everyone that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to deal with, namely cross-border issues.
All other issues should be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.
Health care and care for the elderly are examples of areas in which the EU should only have limited competence.
Each Member State should have full responsibility for deciding for itself about these issues, as well as the right to do so, for these are clear examples of areas not of an obviously cross-border nature.
Health care and care for the elderly are issues that have traditionally occupied prominent places on our Liberal agenda.
Having brought upon itself severe demographic reductions as serious as during the two world wars, but this time in the name of freedom, fundamental rights and birth control, in other words birth restriction, Europe has now found that its population is ageing.
This population now includes the third, and in particular, the fourth age, those over the age of 85, with loss of autonomy, motor and cerebral handicaps and extreme ageing.
Furthermore, as the resolution notes that mental illness in the elderly primarily affects women, they have gone from mastering sterility in the 1980s to senile dementia between 2010 and 2020.
In the face of this clinical, budgetary, economic and social situation, the rapporteur asks the right questions and then gets bogged down in a mire of vague solutions.
The questions are financial.
Where will we find the finances, a sum that varies between 4 and 8% of GDP, for the constant care and medical interventions needed by millions of Europeans who have lost their autonomy?
The questions are also professional.
Where are the specialists in geriatrics, the carers, the specialist care centres, the training required for this segment of the population?
The answer to these challenges lies in the new economy of ageing, in inventing a new human planning sector with new diplomas for geriatric assistants and new branches of medicine and associated professions.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Useful and essential community services cost money.
Without the input of community money, people who are old, sick or unemployed will not be able to exist.
We would have no decent healthcare for the vast majority of people, no education, no public transport, no environmental protection and no services for the aged.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants a combination of best practices, access, high quality and accessibility.
It makes little sense to formulate such nice objectives without providing sufficient resources to enable these objectives to actually be achieved.
By constantly striving to cut taxes, we make it impossible to provide good services and the solidarity required for these.
People constantly maintain that the cost of services can be cut without compromising on quality.
That would have to be achieved by calling in private profit-oriented businesses, by reducing the number of services, by having the work done by fewer people and by increasing contributions from users.
In the Netherlands, years of cut-backs have resulted in the closure of small hospitals, waiting lists for healthcare, a shortage of new teachers and a severe reduction in services in what used to be a good public transport system.
At the end of the day, this report is based on a model such as this.
As it is ultimately the weakest who pay, I reject this model.
.
(PT) As a result of the Member States' policies, the EU is benefiting from clearly exceptional health systems compared to the rest of the world.
This does not mean, however, that the ongoing need to protect those who are particularly vulnerable or who have serious financial difficulties due to the high cost of treatment should be overlooked.
Against this backdrop, the proposals contained in the Commission Communication are of strategic importance to guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability with regard to healthcare for the elderly.
The fact that the organisation of healthcare systems, their funding and planning are the responsibility of the Member States is not a barrier to Community cooperation in policies on issues of ageing, in particular in the field of health.
Instead, the sharing of experiences and solutions could help to achieve the social cohesion that we wish to see.
I have fully supported this report, which has, in fact, incorporated valuable contributions from the opinion delivered by Mr Mussa of the UEN Group, not least with regard to: recognising the important role of healthcare providers, the proposal for Community funding for various training projects and the issue of ill treatment of the elderly.
Lastly, we should emphasise the need for a 'New Attitude' with respect to the elderly, seeing them as an important new resource that should be cherished - not as a burden on society.
Life expectancy has almost doubled in the last fifty years, which has created a completely different world.
Through better levels of protection, Europe and the Europeans will benefit enormously from the huge wealth of wisdom, experience and knowledge that is the valuable capital of the elderly.
Mr President, I have the pleasure of having a nephew, Silvio Nardini, my sister's son - he does not know that I am mentioning him in the European Parliament - whom I am very proud of because he is part of the European Force involved in a peace mission in Afghanistan: he is a 'top gun', as they say in films, but has his feet firmly on the ground.
He said to me: 'I have been and am in the United Arab Emirates controlling air traffic from Italy to Afghanistan.
I am very happy and proud of what I am doing, and it is very satisfying.
This is not war; it is about bringing peace and building on it where there is need'.
This is why I voted, even more enthusiastically, for this report on Afghanistan.
We Swedish Social Democrats present the following explanation of vote.
We support the resolution but wish to point out that it makes no mention of women or their human rights.
Nor does it mention women's priorities, supported by Parliament in December 2001, but, rather, those of the Afghan Government.
We believe there needs to be a requirement for all aid projects to be informed by the dimension of equality and for women to be represented in the government.
Women were victims under both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban.
Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace.
A policy for Afghanistan must be a policy also aimed at the majority of the Afghan people, namely women and children.
. (FR) One year after the war against Afghanistan, although the Taliban regime is over, the country is still under the control of the warlords, with a new regime that nobody has elected.
The situation for women is no better than before, children have just as little access to education as in the past, not to mention the tremendous poverty of most of the inhabitants of this country, which is still aggravated by the death and destruction sown by Western planes.
The United States, with the support of European Member States, has spent vast sums on flooding the country with bombs.
There is no question, however, of the world powers spending even a fraction of these sums on improving the life of the people.
The various resolutions themselves reflect a rose-tinted view of the disastrous situation in Afghanistan.
As always, however, we are content to welcome, request and invite.
We did not join in with this ineffective whimpering, when, a year ago, most of the Members making these noises today supported the brutal policy of the world powers.
British Conservatives voted in favour of the resolution on Afghanistan, which contains many useful elements, but we do not accept the implied criticism of US actions in Recital I, and in the new paragraph 15a; the desire for the EU as such to create a political role for itself; the suggestion in paragraph 15 that the Council should reconsider its proposals for return of refugees; or indeed the proposal in the new paragraph 10a that ISAF military forces should be employed to investigate human rights abuses, notwithstanding our earnest desire for improvement in the human rights situation, particularly in relation to the situation of women.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.29 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
I should like to give you the results of the second ballot in the vote of the election of the Ombudsman:
Members voting - 535;
Blank or spoiled ballots - 26;
Votes cast - 509
Absolute majority - 255.
The votes cast were as follows: Mr Diamandouros, 294 votes, Mr Perry, 215 votes.
Mr Diamandouros has obtained the majority of the votes cast. I therefore declare him to be the European Ombudsman.
I congratulate him on his appointment and invite him, in due course, to take an oath before the Court of Justice, pursuant to our Rules of Procedure.
I should like not only to congratulate our new Ombudsman, but to take the opportunity to place on record our thanks for and appreciation of the work of the first Ombudsman of the European Union, Mr SÃ¶derman.
Mr President, may I take this opportunity to be the first Member to congratulate Professor Diamandouros on his election as European Ombudsman.
It has been my pleasure over the last few years to work with Jacob SÃ¶derman, who has been an outstanding Ombudsman for Europe, but I am very happy to see that the position of Ombudsman will continue in the safe hands of Professor Diamandouros.
The post of Ombudsman is a crucial post for European democracy.
It is important that it is in competent hands and we now see that it will be.
One point I would like to make is this. All the candidates for Ombudsman - and they should all be thanked for their contribution to the debate - have upheld the code of good administrative behaviour proposed and endorsed by this Parliament and proposed by Mr SÃ¶derman.
We should very firmly say to the institutions of Europe, particularly the Commission, that they should also now seize the opportunity without any further delay to endorse that code, so that we can be quite sure that Europe has the good administration it needs and deserves and which all the servants of the institutions wish to provide.
I offer Professor Diamandouros all my congratulations.
Thank you for your comments, Mr Perry.
I should like to thank you, along with the other candidates, for offering us the vitality of democratic choice.
Mr President, as President-in-Office, may I offer the European Parliament my warmest congratulations on its selection.
I know that the candidates, especially those remaining in the final round, were both highly qualified and extremely able.
I think the European Parliament has made an excellent choice and, as a result, Mr Diamandouros will, I think, be able to contribute to European affairs and make even more improvements to the office of the Ombudsman.
As Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Mr Diamandouros's colleague at the University of Athens and as a long-standing friend, may I say that I am delighted and excited by his election to this post.
I would like to congratulate him and, at the same time, say how sorry I am that Greece will be losing him for a while.
He is so valuable that this will be a real loss to us.
However, we look forward to winning him back, even more experienced and able than when he left us.
President, on behalf of the Commission, on behalf of the College and on behalf of all who work in the Commission, I would like most warmly to congratulate Professor Diamandouros on his election.
It is a great day for him and a great day for Greece, though I recognise Europe's gain is Greece's loss.
The Professor comes to these onerous responsibilities with extraordinary credentials, not least that he is a friend of Commissioner Diamontopoulou, so there are many reasons to recognise that he has all the qualities and all the experience and knowledge which are required for this demanding job.
I would also like to pay a tribute to the work done by Mr SÃ¶derman over the last few years.
I am sure that Professor Diamandouros will undertake his responsibilities in a way which will enjoy the confidence of this Parliament and which will overwhelmingly earn the confidence of Europe's citizens as well.
We wish him the best on this journey and we assure him that on this occasion, arriving and landing in Ithaca is even more exciting than travelling there.
I would also like, if I may - having myself lost almost as many elections as I have won - to pay a tribute to Mr Perry who has, I know, enjoyed the esteem of the whole House, and his graceful remarks a few moments ago will, I know only serve to enhance his reputation.
All our best wishes go to the Professor who I am sure will do this job outstandingly well.
?he Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, on behalf of myself and my fellow MEPs, I wish to thank Mr Perry for having been a good candidate in this election.
As you observed, Mr Perry is one of the foremost champions of good administration.
I should also like to see added to the minutes the fact, which I also want above all to express to those present here, that, in our future ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, we have acquired a worthy successor to Mr SÃ¶derman.
Mr Diamandouros really is someone who can continue in Mr SÃ¶derman's footsteps, and I think I can say, on behalf of MEPs, that we shall look forward to constructive cooperation with him.
We must also be grateful that we had a good supply of professional candidates.
The fact that, during the current term of office, we have elected a new ombudsman also means, I believe, that my fellow MEPs are now still more familiar with the work of the ombudsman and that we are in agreement about what is to be done.
Finally, a small fly in the ointment: just over half an hour ago, the Finnish press agency sent a text message about the outcome of the election.
I would ask our esteemed Vice-President and everyone else to ensure that candidates and others do not become aware of important news such as this in the corridors or through text messages from press agencies, but that we, as far as possible, be able to save such news for the solemn meetings we hold in this Chamber.
Thank you, Mrs Thors.
Your comments have been noted.
Mr President, I would like to point out that in the provisional Minutes for yesterday which have been distributed, it is recorded that I voted in favour of the final Resolution of the Napolitano report.
This is a mistake.
The final version should reflect the fact that I abstained on that report.
Thank you, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, for your comment.
I can assure you that Parliament's services have already taken note of it and will correct the Minutes accordingly.
(The Minutes were approved)
The next item is the joint debate on the recommendation (?5-0410/2002) by Mr Galeote Quecedo and questions (?5-0508/2002, ?5-0509/2002) to the Council and the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Lebanon, of the other part.
Mr President, one of the consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11 September has undoubtedly been to draw attention to the Middle East and, even if it were only in our own interests, the European Union should contribute to calming the turbulent waters in that region, creating political and economic cooperation and, in general, stimulating the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
In this regard, the work to create a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly would be a valuable contribution, and I would encourage our Lebanese colleagues to join in with this task together with the European Parliament and the Parliaments of the region.
The country with which tomorrow, by means of our vote, the European Parliament will open the doors to privileged cooperation, Lebanon, is unquestionably a key player in the region.
Today, after 16 long years of war on its territory, Lebanon can be a travelling companion of the European Union in its enthusiastic attempt to find a solution to the regional conflict.
Let us be Mediterranean partners for peace!
The association agreements such as the one we are discussing today are an essential element of the European Union's external action, which go further than mere commercial considerations, since they are intended to establish a framework for political dialogue.
It is my hope, and I am sure the whole of Parliament agrees with me, that the exception of Syria will be resolved as soon as possible.
With regard to this agreement, I would like to comment on certain issues which have been raised during the debate in committee.
Firstly, although we were undoubtedly delighted by the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000, the issue of stable borders with Israel has still not been finally resolved, and we therefore urge the parties to reach an agreement on this.
Secondly, since October of that same year, 2000, the Hezbollah group has been holding four Israeli citizens as hostages and, in this specific case, and with regard to the people captive or disappeared in the various countries of the region in general - it is calculated that there are 17 000 Lebanese citizens - we must get involved - I would like to ask the Greek Presidency whether it is going to do anything to mediate on this regrettable issue of the disappeared.
In our committee, we have also expressed the need to complete the withdrawal of Syrian troops based in Lebanon, in application of Security Council Resolution 520, in order to guarantee the sovereignty and integrity of that country.
We therefore appeal to the Lebanese Government to submit this issue to the consideration of our colleagues in that country's parliament, so that a debate can be opened to allow progress to be made on this crucial issue.
I would like to support and acknowledge the efforts the Lebanese authorities are making in the fight against terrorism, particularly in application of United Nations Resolution 1373.
These and other matters will form part of the political dialogue which will be opened up between the European Union and Lebanon, particularly in application of the clause contained in Article 2 of this agreement.
And, in the presence of the Council and the Commission, I would like to ask that an in-depth debate be held on the effectiveness of the application of this clause and on the possible mechanisms for its parliamentary monitoring and evaluation.
Within this context, the issue of respect for human rights and democratic principles is essential to this Parliament.
I am convinced that this is unquestionably a fundamental instrument which will be extremely useful in terms of supporting the enormous efforts the current government of Minister Hariri is making to improve the economic situation of Lebanon.
Mr President, we are very keen to make the conclusion and adoption of this Agreement dependent on the quest for solutions as to how this area can be stabilised.
Lebanon, which was once known as the 'Switzerland of the Middle East', has for many years sustained great blows, both internally and externally.
As a European Union, we should be making a proportionate contribution to restoring stability to this country and hence to the achievement of stability in general, and I believe this Agreement to be a means towards that end.
That this should be done in relation to agriculture and agricultural products, to free trade in industrially produced goods, to legislation on trade, and also in relation to issues concerning the rules on the determination of origin, constitutes important progress, and we also welcome the way in which it has proved possible, by means of a separate exchange of letters, to incorporate cooperation in counter-terrorism in this project as a whole.
As my predecessors on the floor have said, however, there are a number of points to which we are keen to give further attention, such as the issue of the Syrian military presence.
There is no doubt that this problem has to be resolved, both in order to promote stability by making full use of the country's authorities' capacity for change, and also in order to help bring peace to the region as a whole.
I believe that it is also important that we who belong to the European Parliament, being desirous of building up still further our cooperation with the Lebanese Parliament, should indicate that the abolition of the death penalty, the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Torture, as well as the signing of the ICC's Rome Statute, will have a major part to play in moving this development further forward.
As it will do again tomorrow, this Parliament has expressly welcomed Lebanon's efforts at participation in the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1373 by freezing the assets of terrorist groups.
We would request the Council and the Commission to cause an anti-terrorist clause with similar content to be included in all future agreements, as decided at the Seville European Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, we see the position of the Palestinian refugees as being a most particularly serious problem.
We have to be clear in our own minds about how great a burden they are on Lebanon.
I believe that this is where we have to work closely with Lebanon in order to enable this problem - which is not just about their living conditions, but also has to do with the possibilities for bringing peace to the whole area - to be resolved in a reasonable way, in order to establish proper relations between Palestine and Israel and to secure a lasting peace between them.
There are also many other associated problems.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is our wish that the transitional period of twelve years should not be exceeded until we have established a free trade area with Lebanon, and we hope that this Agreement can be implemented accordingly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any debate on Lebanon refers us directly to discussions on the Middle East, both about issues relating to Israel and about discussions on Iraq over the last 24 hours.
The situation in Lebanon is still extremely complicated, mainly because so many different communities live there, meaning that problems require a multiethnic, multilingual, multi-religious approach, not forgetting that Lebanon offers shelter to a great many - about 370 000 - Palestinian refugees.
These communities are represented at institutional level.
The application of the arrangements in the Charter of National Reconciliation of 22 October 1989 allowing Syrian forces to be stationed in certain areas of Lebanon, basically comes within the framework of relations between Lebanon and Syria.
The Council is closely monitoring internal political dialogue in Lebanon.
The first step was the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000, followed by a partial withdrawal of the Lebanese-Syrian army in June 2001.
At the same time, there is a risk that the presence of Hezbollah forces in the south of the country will become a destabilising factor in Israeli-Lebanese relations.
The free parliamentary elections held on 3 September 2000 indicate that things are moving in the right direction, towards the normalisation of the situation in Lebanon, and we must not therefore underestimate the destabilising effect on Lebanon of the conflict in the Middle East.
The Council has stated on several occasions that the fight against terrorism is a priority and the recent terrorist attack in Bali highlighted once again the need for close international cooperation on the fight against terrorism.
Implementation of the action plan adopted by the European Council in September 2001 is progressing well.
As far as its foreign dimension is concerned, the Council has decided to include the fight against terrorism in the agreement between the European Union and third countries.
The fact that Lebanon was one of the first countries that agreed to sign the agreement with the European Union on this issue demonstrates that it is prepared to cooperate actively with the European Union, including in the field of information exchanges.
The link between the Cooperation Agreement and the Association Agreement with regard to the fight against terrorism is emphasised by the fact that both agreements were signed on the same day, in Luxembourg on 17 June 2002 to be precise, and will enter into force simultaneously - and soon I hope.
As far as respect for human rights is concerned, the Council is monitoring this issue closely.
The Council expressed its concern about action by the Lebanese army against Christian activists in August 2001 and about the closure of the independent television station ??F last September.
The Association Agreement will also strengthen the potential for monitoring this issue and will encourage the authorities in Lebanon to have greater respect for human rights.
As you know, the agreement requires respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be a basic element in both sides' domestic and foreign policy.
In addition, regular political dialogue will be established at various levels, mainly in the Association Agreement, on all matters of interest.
I should like, if I may, to make a number of comments on the Association Agreement, to which the European Parliament is being invited to give its assent.
The signing of the Association Agreement is an important development and marks the start of a new chapter in our relations with Lebanon.
Although it refers mainly to intergovernmental relations, the agreement also offers an operational framework for the business community and civil society.
This agreement is vital to the European Union's entire Mediterranean policy and is yet another step towards the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone.
I should point out that Lebanon has just ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement which comes into force on 1 March 2003.
Good communications channels between politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean are an important factor in building constructive relations between the ?U and its Mediterranean partners.
At bilateral level, the Association Agreement makes provision for an EU-Lebanon Association Council, to facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and parliamentary institutions in Lebanon.
The Members of Parliament involved will have to set the framework for this dialogue which, as far as the Council is concerned, will supplement Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in general.
I welcome the results of the last meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, which highlighted the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean.
We are currently examining cooperation mechanisms in order to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
The European Parliament has started working on just such an assembly, which will include members of the 27 national parliaments and the European Parliament.
The Euro-Mediterranean summit in Valencia proposed strengthening the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean dialogue by creating a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
I welcome the recent meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari on 17-18 June 2002, which supported the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and decided to form a working party to set up this new assembly.
For their part, the senior officials responsible for the Barcelona process also agreed to set up a group to coordinate with the Bari working party.
One of the objectives of the Greek Presidency is to use the dynamics of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in order to strengthen its parliamentary dimension.
One of our presidency's priorities is to achieve new levels of integration and boost the credibility of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is why we are currently examining the cooperation mechanisms and measures needed in order to create this assembly.
What we want, not to say need, is for the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum to decide at its next meeting in Crete on 27 March 2003 to evolve into a parliamentary assembly.
If it does, the summit of Foreign Ministers meeting in Crete on 26 and 27 May 2003 would be able to welcome their decision and this new institution could be set up.
Mr President, the House is considering today a very important resolution on the adoption of the Association Agreement signed with Lebanon in June last year.
This agreement is not only important for our relations with Lebanon - it is also crucial in the overall European Union-Mediterranean Partnership since it represents another step towards the completion of the grid of Association Agreements within the Barcelona Process (the only agreement still being negotiated is the one with Syria and I am hoping to have the opportunity next month of trying to persuade the Syrians to go ahead themselves more seriously to negotiate an agreement).
Lebanon is a key partner in the Euro-Mediterranean structure.
When Prime Minister Hariri was elected to office in September 2000, he set his government an ambitious deadline - to conclude the negotiations with the European Commission by the end of 2001.
I am very pleased that he has delivered on this promise and I call upon Members of the House to vote favourably on the resolution, and to endorse the Agreement.
Parliament has before it, in my judgment, the means to provide Lebanon with a firm foundation for building its future.
The country has experienced a terrible civil war. It has been the victim of outside interference, it still remains vulnerable.
Lebanon is now grappling with recovery and with modernisation under difficult economic circumstances, faced with poor immediate prospects for peace in the Middle East, smouldering tensions along the border with Israel and the unsettling possibility of a military conflict in Iraq.
There is broad support in Lebanon for this new strengthened relationship with Europe.
The Lebanese Parliament ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement in December.
The interim agreement allows both sides to start the 12-year transition period from March 2003, leading to the gradual introduction of free trade.
This is a clear sign that Lebanon is serious in meeting at an early stage its commitments to opening up large areas of its trade and approximating its legislation to that of the European Union.
It will also be bound by its engagements on respect for the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy from this date and I want to return to that in a moment.
The free-trade area will bring about profound changes to Lebanese commerce.
Lebanon is rightly prized for the entrepreneurial skills of its work force.
Its economic strategy is already liberal.
World Trade Organisation membership has been requested.
The opening of markets and economies will bring benefits through economic liberalisation and increased competitiveness.
Lebanon will benefit immediately from market access for its agricultural and processed agricultural products.
And the Union will gain from improved access to service sector industries in Lebanon, once these arrangements have been concluded.
By signalling Lebanon's commitment to economic and social reform, this Agreement will send a clear and positive message to the international and European investment community of the opportunities for direct foreign investment in Lebanon.
The successful outcome of the Paris II donor conference in November last year, organised with great commitment and success by President Chirac, suggests that this message has already struck home.
Of the 18 governments participating, six were Member States and the Commission was also represented at its highest level.
There is a clear interest in seeing that Lebanon weathers the economic storm of post-war recovery, and reduces its debt.
The amount pledged to assist in debt relief matched expectations (about $ 4.3 billion were pledged in all).
But, the Association Agreement is first and foremost a political agreement, which is why it devotes so much importance to political dialogue.
The Agreement is a potent expression of shared values and common objectives.
It is through dialogue that members of this partnership can pursue the shared commitment to achieving peace in the Middle East.
Our dialogue, and this was a point which Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to, will embrace the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy with an honesty and appreciation born, I hope, out of close partnership.
Lebanon's pluralist society, embracing numerous sectarian and religious groups, has functioned most effectively when there is consensus, tolerance and open debate - a unique feature in the region.
We are, however, conscious of the concerns expressed by the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on specific points of the human rights situation in Lebanon.
The agreement provides an additional forum for tackling these concerns.
By ratifying the Association Agreement, the European Union will trigger the important commitments from Lebanon concerning human rights and democracy, migration and re-admission, money laundering, the fight against organised crime and illicit drugs, and judicial cooperation.
And I know too the concerns which have been expressed about freedom of the media.
I can reassure you that the Commission will continue to monitor and follow these concerns wherever and whenever possible.
The Agreement will also, as the Minister pointed out, trigger Lebanon's undertakings on cooperation in counter-terrorism, set out in the exchange of letters to which he referred.
Our partnership will extend well beyond trade and politics, and will be wide-ranging, covering areas as diverse as cooperation in the fields of science, education, energy, tourism, the environment and industry.
Social and cultural cooperation is also central to the Agreement, in terms of rights of workers, and social dialogue.
Our partnership will be sustained by contributions under the MEDA programme which I hope will be focused, as far as possible, on implementation of the Agreement.
So we are moving towards our overall ambitions in the southern Mediterranean with the agreement that we have put before Parliament with the Lebanon and I very much hope that we can move on from this to completing the grid of association agreements by successful negotiations with Syria.
I commend this agreement most warmly to Parliament.
Mr President, this morning, in this Chamber, we discussed the plight of the Afghan people, suffering the after-effects of decades of war and in-fighting, and it would be impossible to forget this when taking the floor in this new debate.
I have not forgotten that the Lebanese people have suffered the same hardships and I welcome the fact that at the end of these troubles they have been able to find the necessary resources to begin to rebuild the model of multicultural, multiethnic cooperation you told us about, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and which the whole world admired before the disease that is the fear of otherness, the fear of being dominated, spread there, as it was to spread later on in the Balkans, where I personally was able to observe the devastation.
I have not forgotten this 'Balkanisation' of Lebanese territory, which was as destructive as the 'Lebanonisation' of the former Yugoslavia was later to be.
That is why I can only rejoice in the progress accomplished, which has allowed this association agreement to be concluded with the Republic of Lebanon, about which you rightly said, Commissioner, that it would be political first and foremost.
I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow, by a strong majority of Parliament, following the proposal of Mr Galeote.
I am aware, however, of the remaining difficulties which both you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and the Commissioner and Mr Brok and Mr Galeote have raised in this debate.
Personally, I would say that the Lebanese model - where everyone, whatever their culture and religion, is enriched by contact with otherness - has begun to be built, but only begun.
I would like to say that I do not believe it will be completed until the Lebanese people have, as they would like to have, their total independence, which they are still deprived of by the presence of foreign troops on their soil. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly asked for them to be withdrawn.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you told us that a first step had been taken by withdrawing some of these troops.
In my eyes, that is not enough.
That is why I unreservedly support the request made by our rapporteur, namely for Resolution No 520 of the United Nations Security Council to be taken into account and the matter of the presence of Syrian troops on Lebanese territory to be subject to the judgment of the Lebanese Parliament, which, as we know, is in favour of complete respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and the political independence of their country.
Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Patten, the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement marks a step forward in our long-standing relations.
It has already been pointed out several times that Lebanon is a country which has seen 16 years of civil war and which has now managed once again to turn its ethnic, cultural and religious pluralism into the basis for a peace process: it is a country both complex and important, owing to its history and geopolitical position.
We hope that the closer relations which this Agreement formally marks, will help make this process irreversible and represent further progress in the respect for human rights and the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law.
It is precisely for this reason that the article in the Agreement which refers to human rights must be taken seriously by the Lebanese authorities and the European institutions.
Parliament is persevering on this point since the economy and trade must be able to advance at the same pace as advances in freedom, democracy, the role of women and freedom of information.
We are pleased to note that Lebanon has signed the International Convention on Women's Rights and the Convention against Torture.
We hope that ratification will follow these signatures and that by continuing along this path, we will see the abolition of the death penalty, Lebanon's participation in the International Criminal Court, the truth about missing persons and a revised legal system which specifies the limits and role of military jurisdiction.
This process should be supported by the MEDA programme, with clear support for the autonomous development of civil society.
Another crucial issue is an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and pacification of the region, where a lasting solution can only be found by creating a Palestinian state.
The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon was an extremely important event, but peace was not a consequence.
But it is precisely because peace is never automatic but requires great political will that it is important to state the desire to achieve it, starting with the countries in the region.
To this end, the tension on the Lebanon-Israel border must cease, Syria should withdraw its military presence from Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees should be given prospects for the future, starting with the provision of better living conditions; I would point out that responsibility for this does not only fall to the host country, but to the whole international community.
In pursuing this aim, it is therefore essential for the refugees to be able to benefit from the MEDA programme and for Europe, taking all of this into account, to be especially generous.
Lastly, we hope that the Agreement will support economic reforms and trade, which were already important issues.
Today's opportunity is, however, also a chance for us to make a more general appraisal of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership - as the President-in-Office of the Council did - following completion of the enlargement process, in the context of the reform process which started with the Convention.
We must now redefine the enlarged Union's external relations and we must give Europe a more significant role in the world.
The Partnership, launched in Barcelona in 1995, was created with 12 countries.
We now have a broader, more systematic view of this process which encompasses the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Gulf states.
Secondly we must ask: which policies?
President Prodi has often stated: 'Everything but institutions'.
The European Parliament, for its part, came out in favour some time ago of a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which includes all the policies which we subscribed to with the candidate countries.
I would therefore urge us to go further than the - albeit important - decisions of the last Interministerial Conference in Valencia.
Lastly the institutions: in Valencia - as you, Mr President, pointed out - it was decided to grant the Parliamentary Forum the status of a real parliamentary assembly.
This change could be truly significant, and to be a success it must take into account the remarks already made on the geopolitical dimension and policies.
By becoming a true institution, the parliamentary assembly should acquire real powers concerning the decisions which this process involves and should be an active participant in the great meeting of cultures.
The most important thing is for it to have instruments in order to make real progress in the field of rights, democracy and freedom.
Mr President, quite a few problems affecting Lebanon have been mentioned in this Chamber, in spite of there also being many positive signs in that country.
We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wish to highlight a number of these problems.
The situation in Lebanon is very uncertain and complicated, and the Syrian presence in the country means that the question may sometimes arise as to whether Lebanon is a completely independent state.
There are extensive infringements of human rights.
I only have to mention the 17 000 missing Lebanese, the restricted freedom of expression, the violence against demonstrating students, the death penalty and, of course, the situation concerning the Palestinian refugees, referred to by quite a few fellow MEPs.
These refugees too must come to enjoy the positive advantages that the association agreement can provide.
The ELDR Group has tabled a number of amendments concerning, for example, the 200 Lebanese held prisoner in Syria.
There are also a dozen in Israel.
The situation concerning these refugees must be clarified.
Lebanon must also ratify the Geneva Convention.
We are very concerned about the situation of the refugees.
Trade and the exchange of goods are nonetheless to be welcomed.
In the long term, they promote democracy and development - political, economic and social.
The association agreements are also an important part of the Barcelona Process.
We are therefore voting in favour of this association agreement in the hope that it will lead to development in Lebanon.
We nonetheless feel a certain hesitation in doing so because Lebanon is far from being a democracy, and there are flagrant breaches of human rights.
We also feel a certain unease, or frustration rather, at the fact that there is always talk about human rights clauses that can be applied if a country infringes an association agreement with the EU.
These clauses are nothing other than a resounding shot in the dark.
I really want to appeal to Commissioner Patten to ensure that mechanisms can be developed whereby, in the event of breaches of human rights that we know are being committed, Article 2 of the association agreement can be invoked and applied in a meaningful way.
First of all, at a time when the enlargement of the European Union is underway, I would like the Euro-Lebanese rapprochement to contribute to creating an outline for genuine joint Mediterranean construction.
This must take place through a dialogue between equals.
It is even more urgent as the risk of war in Iraq weighs upon relations with the Arab world as a whole.
Next, as has already been said, we need to use all available means to escape the spiral of violence in the Middle East.
Europe and Lebanon could play a more active part with regard to compliance with the United Nations resolutions, the creation of a Palestinian State and Israel's full, and universal recognition in the region.
I am thinking in particular of the serious basis constituted by the offer of peace adopted by the Arab countries in Beirut.
Although the war in Lebanon is fortunately in the past, the absence of peace throughout the region is a barrier to genuine reconstruction and development in the country as a whole.
This is especially true in southern Lebanon, where problems of borders with Israel have not been solved.
Almost three years after the Israeli withdrawal, needs are still great: for example, rehabilitation of infrastructures, rebuilding homes and irrigation projects.
The same is true of the Syrian presence: although it does not explain everything, it probably prevents the Lebanese from effectively erasing all the scars of war.
Lebanon exists in the mind of the Lebanese, but many would like to see a stronger affirmation of their State, which would take place in particular through a truly independent, democratic State, in order to establish and develop coexistence between the Lebanese.
I am thinking in particular of respect for freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, the rights of asylum seekers, those who have disappeared, and the death penalty.
This is also true of the situation of Palestinian refugees.
Although Lebanon is still, fortunately, a country of refuge for Palestinians, the absence of a foreseeable fair, sustainable solution aggravates the situation of great social distress in which hundreds of thousands of refugees find themselves.
The right to return should be recognised as legitimate, but the discrimination that actually affects Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is unjustifiable.
Access to work or social protection should be guaranteed more effectively, with our help.
Lastly, we cannot ignore the social and economic aspects.
While the period immediately following the war required the implementation of an ambitious reconstruction programme, the current situation is bleak.
Some would say that the Lebanese economy is somewhere between the developing world and the City.
The debt is USD 30 billion.
There is glaring inequality.
The high consumption of the wealthy goes side by side with raging poverty, intensified by an extremely high cost of living and widespread low income.
The Lebanese Prime Minister did obtain aid of over EUR 4 billion in Paris last November from some European and Arab countries as well as from international financial institutions.
I remain more than sceptical, however, as to the positive effects of creating a free-trade zone.
The loss of customs taxes could have significant consequences for useful public spending.
European aid should therefore be given through active support for the organisations operating in humanitarian and social fields.
I still think that modernity and social progress consist of making the focus of Euro-Mediterranean relations human factors rather than goods and capital.
The Euromed civil forum considers the social and economic assessment of the partnership to be negative overall: we should heed the critics!
Mr President, as other Members have pointed out: 17 000 families have no news of their loved ones, parts of the media have been banned, censored by the authorities, journalists have been arrested, the courts have been used for political ends, the intelligence services are ubiquitous, discriminatory measures have been taken against thousands of refugees, and Palestinians in particular, torture has been used despite the fact that Lebanon is a signatory to the Convention against torture, Syria has constantly interfered in the life of a third country, there has been discrimination against women; there is a long list of infringements of human rights as reported, in particular at the hearing held within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
All the organisations fighting for democracy in this country, however, support the idea of this association agreement.
This, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and President-in-Office of the Council, goes to show the tremendous hope generated by this agreement, as well as the scale of the challenges we must accept in order to respond to these numerous expectations.
The resolution submitted to us on which we shall vote at the same time as the association agreement is a relatively comprehensive text - and I would congratulate the rapporteur on that, moreover - which addresses numerous problems that Lebanon must now face in order to play the role we expect it to play to ensure the stabilisation of the situation throughout the region.
The Verts/ALE Group has duly contributed to this and we, together with other Members, in fact, would like to add a few points that we feel are important today.
First of all, we would like to invite, to call on the Lebanese Government to ensure respect for the rights of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, who are present on Lebanese soil, and to cease all kinds of discriminatory measures in particular against Palestinian refugees.
We would also like the Commission and the Council to ask Syria and Israel officially for information on Lebanese nationals who are being held in these states.
According to the information provided to us by Solidar, whose spokesman, moreover, was invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Israel is allegedly holding 12 Lebanese nationals and 200 nationals of other countries are allegedly being held secretly in Syria.
I believe the European institutions can help to shed light on this matter, which weighs heavily on relations within the region.
The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament would also like to draw the attention of the House to the pressure exerted on the Lebanese press.
We call for strict respect for the freedom of the press, in all its forms, moreover, in particular for journalists or other media that criticise government policy.
We call for this country to respect the right of the opposition, which we all know receives extremely poor treatment.
Lastly, we call for the Members of the Lebanese Parliament to be associated with and play an active part in the work of the fora of the future Euro-Mediterranean assembly.
That is clearly a condition if we understand that this agreement with Lebanon is even more important in stabilising the region and finding a solution to the problems in the Middle East.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this association agreement constitutes a challenge, which we must meet.
I believe that its effect would be greater if we were in possession of all the instruments necessary to monitor, follow, propose and assess, regularly and seriously, in particular the implementation of Article 2 of this association agreement.
Mr President, I should like to begin by welcoming the Greek Presidency, which is embarking on its duties here and also the election of a European Ombudsman, who is also Greek.
This is all happening at a time when plenary is being led by a colleague of same nationality, which is making this sitting a veritable Greek political Olympiad, which I am delighted to share in.
Mr President, the European Parliament today has the task of delivering its opinion on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Republic of Lebanon on the other.
This agreement clearly forms part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched by the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, whose progress we have a duty to promote, despite the uncertainties in the political situation in that region with regard to peace and security.
One of the most noteworthy aspects of the process opened in Barcelona is that it enables complementarity to be established between the dimension of bilateral cooperation involving the Member States with Mediterranean connections, including Spain, France, Italy and Portugal - although Portugal borders the Atlantic, it has significant economic and geographical links with the Mediterranean countries of the Maghreb - and the multilateral dimension taken on by the European Community, which can and must mutually strengthen one another.
There is no doubt, Mr President, that, to a large extent, the stability of the Mediterranean region, and in particular of the Middle East, depends on appropriate partnerships for economic, political, social and cultural development, for which the Union is particularly suited.
Other types of problem remain, however, which are today entirely undeniable, especially concerning security and the fight against terrorism, but also concerning the fight against corruption and money-laundering as well as promoting democracy and human rights which, in the particular case of Lebanon, are a cause for concern.
This is why we believe the questions raised by Mr Brok, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to be of the greatest relevance and to require tangible and consistent answers from both the Council and the Commission.
We cannot ignore the fact that the political leanings of the Lebanese authorities are still dominated by Syria and that Damascus has a decisive influence over the position of the Lebanese Government in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, despite the Israeli army's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000.
Unlike Lebanon, whose government has fortunately been moving towards democracy and the separation of powers, despite its obvious institutional weaknesses and intricate political and religious imbalances, Syria is a dictatorship, with a singularly Monarchist bias, which has remained technically at war with Israel since the Six-Day War, with all the dangers that this situation entails for the Middle East peace process.
Even worse, it maintains a significant military force in Lebanon, of around 30 000 men, in addition to the 300 000 immigrants there, who work mainly in farming and construction.
If we add to this presence - or perhaps we should call it an 'occupation' several more Palestinian refugees, who are by and large poor and poorly integrated into Lebanese society, constituting around 3.5 million people, and the presence in the country's parliament of Hezbullah, the extremist movement - since it cannot be called anything else - it is easy to understand Lebanon's delicate situation, to which the Union must be attentive and in which it must play a moderating role in order to achieve peace, security and development.
This Euro-Mediterranean partnership is all the more important at a time when the Union is enlarging into Central and Eastern Europe and will be focusing the lion's share of its financial resources there.
We must not forget that Europe is or should be polycentric: it is Nordic, Mediterranean, and Atlantic; it is also ultraperipheral and certainly continental.
It is, however, by balancing its components and respect for its diversity that it will become a Europe that is more democratic, safer, more developed and definitely more respected on the international scene.
With the conclusion of an Association Agreement with the Republic of Lebanon, the EU is putting its own political credibility on the line, both internally and externally.
As recently as at the last European Council, the Council of Copenhagen, the Council again acknowledged Israel's legitimate concerns about her security.
The Council also committed itself to the fight against international terrorism.
The two central points of the foreign policy of EU Member States are not compatible with the power base that Hezbollah is forming in Lebanese politics.
It is not for nothing that Southern Lebanon is known as 'Hezbollahland' these days.
The party of Allah has been lord and master ever since Israel's military withdrawal from the border area in May 2000.
This Shiite terror organisation has built up an impressive military presence thanks to the combined cooperation of Syria and Iran.
Including a large arsenal of missiles within range of the whole of the north of the Jewish state.
All within easy reach of Lebanese Islamicists who unremittingly and openly advocate the physical destruction of Israel.
The attention being paid to the depressing situation on Israel's northern border in the present resolution of this Parliament deals with the cause and effects and ignores the political reality in situ.
This European unease will not upset Hezbollah.
The party of Allah is simply not mentioned.
How does the Council view that?
I would like to ask the Greek Presidency what steps it intends to take against Hezbollah in Beirut, Damascus and Teheran.
Diplomatic inactivity gives the EU absolutely no credibility as a peace broker in the Middle East.
Hezbollah is just as unlikely to be intimidated when it comes to direct and indirect involvement in terrorist activities against the state of Israel, including forming terrorist cells amongst Israeli Arabs and complete identification with the second Palestinian intifada.
Or, as the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, puts it: the intifada in Palestine now forms their front line.
In short, if the common fight against terrorism is to have real credibility, the EU must immediately place Hezbollah on its list of terrorist organisations - hence my amendment - and the Lebanese authorities must assert their authority over the whole country.
Only these measures will have the effect of stabilising the whole region and promoting peace in it, as they simultaneously send a signal to the destabilising regimes.
A powerful stance such as this would also set the right tone for the negotiations on the EU's future relationship with Damascus and Teheran.
Otherwise the European institutions would only be paying lip service to the bare fact of Israel's existence and the global fight against terrorism.
Until such time as the EU shows that it is taking these points very seriously in its relations with these countries, I will vote against an Association Agreement with Lebanon.
What makes me even more resolute in my stance is that the European institutions are demanding virtually no genuine guarantees from Beirut regarding the observance of human rights.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have just returned from Lebanon where I went before Christmas with Jean-Marie Le Pen.
We were made as welcome by the Lebanese press as by such well-known figures as the Maronite patriarch Monsignor Sfeir, or the former Head of State Mr Amin Gemayel.
How can we fail to feel considerable affection for this refined, friendly people that has overcome with great courage the suffering of almost twenty years of frequently horrific foreign and civil war?
It should encourage us to consider the dangers of removing borders when, in Lebanon, the refugees have begun to speak as if they were running the country.
Consider also the risks posed by many aspects of the multicultural society that some would like to see developing at all costs in Europe, where it did not exist until now.
In principle we are in favour of developing relations with this country of great culture and ancient traditions, that is so close to Europe in general, and in particular the French-speaking tradition that I, amongst others, represent here.
We can only deal, however, with a sovereign State, a peaceful, honest and impartial State.
A sovereign State naturally means the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, whose presence is no longer justified, as almost all the previous speakers have said, since the Israeli occupation ended in southern Lebanon.
The resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, in particular, should be followed by practical action and this withdrawal should be complete, just as Syrian pressure on Lebanese domestic policy should cease.
A peaceful State means an end to the repression, also mentioned by other speakers, practised against students, political dissidents, and Christians in particular.
That means that certain post-war procedures or processes, which could legitimately be described as Stalinist, should cease; that the general amnesty should be extended to all.
Saying this, I am thinking in particular of the terrible fate of the former leader of the Lebanese forces, Samir Geagea, the only leader of a faction to have taken part in these conflicts who has now been in prison, on military premises, in a building with no light, for eight years.
Nobody there understands, or rather everyone understands only too well, why Samir Geagea is in prison, while the leader Walid Jumblatt, whose excesses were every bit as bad as the worst offenders in this conflict, occupies a quasi-official post.
Lastly, an honest, impartial State means an end to the political racketeering that results all too often from reconstruction in this country ravaged by war.
These are the three conditions for the agreement that we want with all our hearts to reach optimum effectiveness.
Mr President, I was privileged to visit Lebanon for the first time some 20 years ago as a journalist, and have followed the unhappy events in that country over the years.
It was the occasion when the Palestinians were expelled from Jordan by King Hussein and swept into the Lebanon, destroying what had been up till then a haven of relative peace and civilisation in the Middle East.
It had, from the point of view of the visitor, whether a journalist or a tourist, three great advantages: the charm of the Lebanese people, the fact that the electricity and water had been put in by the British and that the cuisine had been installed largely by the French.
On my most recent visit there I was encouraged to see that those three great traditions are reasserting themselves in the rebuilding of that country.
It is, as the Commissioner has said, undergoing this process of rebuilding in possibly the most difficult times, especially from the economic point of view.
But I am confident, as are many other Members of this House who know the Lebanon well, that the energy and the determination of the Lebanese people will win through.
They have survived the past in an extraordinary fashion and remained civilised and perennially charming.
It is very important that we maintain the closest links, as the previous speaker mentioned.
The francophone connection is only one of many which we have between the members of the European Union and the rest of the Middle East.
The Lebanon is a focal point from which we can operate and through which we can operate.
I look forward in the not too distant future to returning to Beirut, a city of which I have the fondest memories, but also to welcoming more people from the Lebanon, especially parliamentarians, here.
We can do so much by example that it is important for this House to maintain these links.
Finally, I would point out that it was always through the Lebanon that many of the contacts were made with the other Middle Eastern countries.
With the tensions that we have in the Middle East at the moment, it is essential for us to maintain those links, especially for the Commissioner who, no doubt, has fallen in love with the Lebanon in the same way as many of us have, and for the Commissioner to be able to use the Lebanon as a bridge through which he can talk to sensible, democratically-minded people in the other countries of the Middle East.
Mr President, I also have first-hand experience of Lebanon and to continue using the images used by the previous speaker, I would say that it is possible to be in love with Lebanon but that love, in this case, does not mean turning a blind eye.
I feel that the European Union has negotiated with an official Lebanon, a somewhat theoretical Lebanon, not to say mythical, that the situation in Lebanon today is sadly still a long way from the idyllic visions that some wish to use in order to justify the agreement, and that, fortunately, our debate re-establishes the harsh reality.
Lebanon is a State whose independence still poses problems today.
More than ten years after the TaÃ¯f agreements, the Israelis have withdrawn but the Syrians remain and are still very present in a country over which they maintain a protectorate and whose independence they have never really recognised.
The warlords remain, there is still no Rule of Law or free media, as we saw again just recently at the last summit of French-speaking countries, drug-trafficking and corruption remain, and terrorist bases, in particular, as has been pointed out, Hezbollah bases, still remain.
Mr President, we are therefore in a paradoxical situation, because an assessment of the Lebanese situation gives rise to a whole string of reasons that would be cause to suspend the agreement if it existed and was still operational.
That is the paradox we face today.
Is there a need for an association?
An association, Mr President, can only exist between two parties.
Does the European Union currently have a fully credible partner?
Unfortunately that is still in doubt.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement goes beyond relations with the Lebanese Government and takes on an extraordinary importance within the network of relations based on dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, especially at times like these when the threat of war looms so large and risks undermining the development of cooperation between our peoples and harming the still vulnerable Lebanese Government.
There have been many years of war with Syria but also with Israel, with external interference and invasions, which have not yet been definitively settled; also a civil war which has devastated social and family relationships, though the International Community's neglect has done damage too.
Lebanon's rebirth could lie in that strength which previously was its weakness: the intertwining of cultures and religions, rooted in the country but different from each other.
The Lebanese Government should be acknowledged for having managed to maintain a balance between the parties and for wishing to rebuild a sovereign country in a difficult democratic process, because there are still clear violations of freedom of expression, human rights, social inequality and corruption.
In particular, I am referring to the situation of the Palestinian refugees, who have been prohibited by law from having any opportunity to work, for healthcare or for travel and it is hypocritical of the Lebanese to assert that this is because the refugees have to return to Palestine.
In this connection, when developing relations and projects with Lebanon, we have to persevere and find means to ensure compliance with the agreements and commitments which are made, even if the example of the EU-Israel Agreement and Israel's blatant violation of Article 2, certainly do not provide a guarantee that this will be respected.
I nevertheless consider it extremely important for this step to be taken, in the clear and certain knowledge that it is essential to help rebuild this country; but it is essential that this country is rebuilt on the clear basis of freedom of expression and human rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lebanese civil society is following closely the signature of this association agreement.
Although Europe is Lebanon's main trading partner and one of the important backers supporting its economic modernisation programme, it also guarantees respect for fundamental rights on the road to establishing democratic freedoms.
Freedom of expression has once more been seriously attacked, as shown by the enforced closure of the television channel MTV last September for having allowed the opposition to speak at the time of the by-elections.
The confirmation of this decision by the courts only serves to increase concerns over this situation.
The deregulations of the legal system do not encourage respect for freedom of expression as the courts are increasingly instrumentalised in order to act as means of applying pressure.
More than 17 000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the Lebanese war.
Ten years after the end of the conflict, no serious enquiry has been carried out to discover what happened to them.
Some were probably executed in Lebanon, but no search has been undertaken for the bodies.
It also seems that the victims of kidnapping were handed over to Syria and then transferred to Syrian prisons.
The association of families was recently received by the Syrian authorities, who promised them an enquiry but have done nothing as yet.
The Lebanese authorities, for their part, remain silent.
Public opinion is increasingly calling for the total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
Their presence, in addition to corruption within the Lebanese political class, contributes to maintaining a climate of instability dominated by a catastrophic economic situation.
In order to prevent the democratic clause from being nothing more than a dead letter, it is vital to establish mechanisms for the regular monitoring and assessment of its implementation, from the very entry into force of the agreement, in partnership with the NGOs that are close to daily reality.
In this country where fundamental rights and democratic freedoms are often ignored, Lebanon's people are placing great hope in these agreements as they represent an essential means of pressure for the citizens.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, may I take this opportunity of welcoming you to this plenary session of the European Parliament.
The signing of the Euro-Mediterranean Accession Agreement with Lebanon is, without doubt, an important move in furthering our strategy to create a free trade zone in the Mediterranean and a zone of peace, security and sustainable development for all its citizens.
I think we can take an optimistic approach to cooperation with Lebanon.
Lebanon is a country with a history of being open to the outside world, a country which looks to Europe and European culture; it has cooperated with the European Union since 1978, even though the Union went by another name at that time.
However, we must bear in mind that Lebanon is in the middle of reconstruction, both economic and social and ideological reconstruction, following the civil war.
Anyone visiting Lebanon has the distinct impression that it is still in search of cohesion and an identity.
At the same time, it is an interesting experiment in the coexistence of different cultures and religious communities and we need to back this experiment if it is to succeed.
I think that the Accession Agreement will help Lebanon consolidate the rules of the burgeoning free market, democracy and economic and social development.
At the level of the European institutions and Member States, we need to make full use of the potential of this agreement and give Lebanon the chance to participate in cultural exchange programmes and galvanise its civil society. At the same time, we need to start improving the human rights situation, as numerous previous speakers have said, and the situation of the 350 000 Palestinian refugees there.
I am therefore all in favour of the references in the draft agreement to promoting the role of women in economic and social development through education and vocational training and facilitating economic investment.
Unfortunately, these references alone are not enough to bring about real progress in respect for women's rights and I am sorry that neither the President-in-Office nor the Commissioner made any reference to this issue.
May I remind you that the European Parliament called in a resolution on respect for women's rights within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation for an express provision on the protection of women's rights, together with a policy for monitoring that protection, similar to the provision applied to the candidate countries which are now about to join the Union.
On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we urge the European Commission to introduce progress monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and to call on the Lebanese Government - and this should apply in all association agreements - to demonstrate the political will needed to carry out the legislative, administrative and other reforms needed to anchor equality between men and women in the law and to mainstream gender equality in all its policies, thereby paving the way for the development we all wish on Lebanon and good cooperative relations with the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a number of very brief comments.
First, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for adding some very detailed and useful comments on aspects of the situation on the ground in Lebanon and the policies of the European Union and the Commission's efforts in this direction.
My second comment is that Lebanon was hit by tragedy about twenty years ago.
Today we have a very different country which is struggling hard to overcome huge structural problems.
Lebanon forms part of the whole puzzle of the Middle East and part of European policy on Mediterranean countries.
It is on our very doorstep and obviously we have a keen interest.
Because of these two aspects, the European Union and the Council are keeping a very close eye on it and supporting its new policies.
I have made careful note of what was said about human rights, and disappearances in particular, and I shall inform the Council accordingly.
However, I would point out that we are trying to include neighbouring countries, such as Syria, in efforts on the human rights front, precisely so that we can deal with these issues more efficiently and influence developments in the area.
As far as Hezbollah are concerned, may I say that the Council pays a great deal of attention to terrorist issues at its regular meetings and discussions on the Middle East.
As you know, a great many measures and a great many decisions have been taken.
The Council weighs all the factors very carefully and I am sure that, as and when it judges that it is expedient and necessary to do so, it will take stronger action.
It has already made a number of moves.
I should like to finish by saying that an association agreement is an important tool.
It can have a significant impact, but only under certain conditions. These conditions are that there must be a functioning economy, there must be a strong productive sector, there must be employment, there must be confidence and there must be the potential for cooperation.
Where there are armed conflicts and insecurity, it obviously will not have the same results.
However, what we are trying and aiming to do is precisely to use multiple means of cooperation, of which the association agreement is one, to do our best to support developments in the area, prosperity and better prospects for the area and relations with a country which belongs to the Mediterranean, which belongs to an area on our very doorstep.
Mr President, the temporary confusion that may have reigned in Lebanon from time to time has obviously led to confusion in Parliament.
I wish to inform you that Amendments Nos 10 to 15 have not - contrary to what is stated - been tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but by Mr Belder, and that they should therefore be dealt with accordingly.
Thank you for your comment, Mr Brok.
It is my duty to tell you that plenary's services are already preparing a new list of amendments with this correction and this will be announced tomorrow before the vote on the recommendation and motion in question.
I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure on the subject of the debate1
In accordance with the agenda - and I would also go as far as to say in homage to the Greek Presidency - we will proceed to the Commission Statement on the Northern Dimension.
I understand, Mr Patten, that we all have problems with the timetable and I would therefore be grateful if the honourable Members could be as brief as possible, since there are problems with flight connections which affect the Commissioner himself.
Mr President, I will try to live up to that request.
We turn now from one end of Europe, as it were, to another.
The Northern Dimension continues to occupy an extremely important place on the Commission's external relations agenda.
