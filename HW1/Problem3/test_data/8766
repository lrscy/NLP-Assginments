I think, Mr President, that we need to retaliate against the indifference of the 34 pharmaceutical companies and affirm the principle of exemption for reasons of health.
If this principle is not applied, we shall call on the Commission to suspend the investment aid granted to all the European companies until such time as they withdraw their complaint against South Africa.
And then we should push for a World Solidarity Fund to be set up and cofinanced by the pharmaceutical industry.
Because, faced with their indifference and given the huge profits which they make, we should force them to invest in research and invent a vaccination as a matter of absolute priority.
Mr President, the case brought by 39 pharmaceutical companies against the South African government on the sale of cheap drugs against AIDS is a tragedy as well as a dilemma.
A tragedy because the scale of the problem in South Africa, where millions of people suffer from AIDS, is almost impossible to grasp.
South Africa is one of many countries contending with this problem.
Ninety-five per cent of those infected with HIV live in developing countries.
Africa has over 25 million AIDS patients, and South Africa 4 million.
By 2010, life expectancy in Africa will fall by 20 years.
In South Africa, half of all young people already run the risk of dying from this disease.
It is a tragedy that all these countries have to cope with.
Then there is the dilemma of the pharmaceutical industry, which has meanwhile developed drugs that have reduced the number of deaths from AIDS in Europe and the US by 75%.
But those drugs are so expensive - in Dutch terms, NLG 30 000 a year per patient - that they are out of reach and unaffordable for African AIDS patients.
Hence it is understandable that these African countries should look for solutions, for instance imitation drugs and parallel imports.
After all, the lives of millions of people are at stake.
The price varies from NLG 30 000 to NLG 450.
In our view a court case is not the right way of solving problems.
Solutions must be sought through discussion, as has happened meanwhile in Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Uganda, where five pharmaceutical companies are working with three governments on considerably cheaper drugs.
For that matter, the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates its costs: after all huge profits are also made in this sector, especially on cosmetics and on products like tranquillisers and vitamins.
AIDS drugs constitute only a fraction of sales.
We therefore advocate the dropping of the court cases in South Africa and the finding of an acceptable solution, and therefore ask the Commission to retract its previous letter to the South African government in which the case brought by the pharmaceutical industry is supported, and to do its utmost to ensure the application of the TRIPS scheme in the WTO.
Europe must opt for solidarity with the AIDS patients and not for the rights of the strongest and wealthiest.
Mr President, combating AIDS is not just a matter of the price of the drugs.
You need funding for infrastructure, to test the patient, to diagnose and to monitor his progress.
Then you have the access to medication.
Of course price is important.
The pharmaceutical companies have brought their prices down.
But what is important, even if it is USD 10 for medication, do we have the will to fund the procurement?
We are getting too emotional about this.
Let us be sure that we have a strategy for funding the purchase.
Governments in these poor countries do not have the funds, even if it is only USD 10 for treating a patient.
The good news is that the prices have come down and they can come down even further if we get the pharmaceutical companies on our side.
The bad news is that we need the funding to be organised.
I hope, as rapporteur, to devise a package that is deliverable and will benefit the poorest who are suffering, without being emotive, without recommending a solution that requires billions in funds, which I know will not be forthcoming.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS is one of the gravest tragedies in the world.
The fight against AIDS in Africa must therefore be given the highest priority.
Essential drugs for AIDS and other serious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must be made available in developing countries free or at very low, and hence affordable, prices.
For that reason I wholeheartedly support the resolution.
Consequently, we must lend our urgent and unambiguous support to the South African government in its battle for cheap drugs.
But we cannot combat AIDS with cheap medicines alone, I agree completely with the previous speaker on that point.
Medical infrastructure is required, so that drugs can be dispensed in controlled conditions.
Many more laboratories with competent staff must be set up.
In addition, simple things like refrigerators are needed.
But that is still not enough.
The social infrastructure must also be called upon: women' s organisations, trade unions, schools; we must involve these much more in the battle against life-threatening diseases.
So a great deal of money is needed, and also a new initiative.
I propose the setting up of a European partnership, financed with European and national funds made up of public and private contributions, a combination of research money and funds for development aid.
The research money must be used for scientific research, the development aid money on the construction of social and medical infrastructure.
This concerted effort will make it possible to take decisive steps forward.
This topic will remain on our agenda for some months to come.
I look forward to broadly based cooperation in this Parliament.
Mr President, I should like to make the following comments on access to HIV/AIDS medicines in developing countries, or what we prefer to call the affordability of the key pharmaceuticals debate.
I am basically referring to what my colleagues, Commissioners Nielson and Lamy, have already said at previous sessions.
For more than a year now the Commission has been strongly committed to addressing the urgent need for action on communicable diseases which have a dramatic effect on the lives of so many, in particular those most vulnerable living in the poorest countries or regions of the world.
The Commission agreed one communication on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of accelerated reaction in September last year and recently adopted the subsequent programme for action.
The new Community policy framework is being discussed in many international fora and also at national and regional level with the developing countries, civil society, industry, the European Parliament, Member States, UN agencies, the US government, G8 and many others.
This process of consultation will continue for some time until the Commission formulates specific work plans with all the partners involved.
In these discussions the issue of affordability of key pharmaceuticals often takes the most prominent position. This may be at the cost of the urgent attention still needed for prevention, for strengthening the health systems in developing countries and for long-term solutions to the problems, which means the development of an AIDS or malaria vaccine.
In our new policy framework we tried to combine the different levels of intervention needs in terms of both prevention and care, and even cure in the cases of malaria and tuberculosis, and in terms of country, regional, international or global level.
Addressing the issue of affordability of medicines should never exclude the focus on prevention efforts, nor negatively affect the debate on research and development.
All these areas are complementary and we will continue to address them in a complementary, comprehensive manner, not allowing one to be played off against the other.
We strongly support the international commitment to tier pricing as the most efficient way in the short term to increase affordability of medicines.
The Community will support, through its technical and development assistance programmes, the reinforcement of pharmaceutical policies and global production capacities in developing countries as a medium-term means of increasing affordability.
We would insist on keeping the debate on a broader level, including targeted action in favour of those millions who suffer and die from malaria and tuberculosis, and who, like those infected by HIV or living with AIDS, simply cannot afford to pay for medicines.
As you know, treatment for malaria and tuberculosis - however problematic - exists.
It costs between USD 10 to 25 to treat a malaria patient and USD 11 to treat a patient suffering from tuberculosis.
HIV/AIDS involves medicines which are priced way above the potential of the poorest and most vulnerable.
Finally, I would urge Parliament not to lose sight of the need for the development of an AIDS and malaria vaccine.
The crisis will continue to prevail and become even worse if prevention efforts are not sustained.
It will take some time before vaccines are developed and available.
However, we are on the right track and we urgently need to make progress.
Afghanistan
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0184/2001 by Mr van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Afghanistan and the destruction of the cultural heritage;
B5-0194/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the situation in Afghanistan and the destruction of the cultural heritage;
B5-0196/2001 by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the destruction of antique statues in Afghanistan;
B5-0203/2001 by Mr Vander Taelen and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Afghanistan, including the destruction of the world cultural and artistic heritage;
B5-0213/2001 by Mrs Fraisse and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Afghanistan, including the destruction of the cultural heritage;
B5-0219/2001 by Mrs Muscardini and others, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Afghanistan and the destruction of the cultural heritage;
B5-0222/2001 by Mrs Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Afghanistan.
Mr President, Commissioner, the sad point that I have to make at the outset is that the statues have now been destroyed and so we have been overtaken by events.
Nevertheless, as a funereal action and as a warning to the world, our resolution holds considerable resonance.
Certainly the suppression of women's rights in Afghanistan continues apace.
I come from a different cultural and religious tradition to those who created the Bamiyan Buddha statues in the 2nd century, but I feel that all of us share a common ownership of our heritage and the right to free movement, education and employment regardless of gender.
Coming particularly to the statues, this destruction was much more than just a mindless act of violence by a regime that apparently intends to catapult us back into the Middle Ages.
All of us, whatever our creed, nationality, or political viewpoint, lost an irreplaceable piece of the common heritage that binds us together on this earth.
A founding principle of the European Union is that religious and cultural tolerance is integral to a democratic and civilised society.
This debate therefore not only registers our disgust with the Taliban, it is also a reminder that there are forces we need to guard against.
The Taliban may see the destruction of the Buddhas simply as the shattering of stones. But we in Europe know better.
We know that the burning of books meant much more than the burning of books.
It signified something else entirely.
In commending my resolution to the House, I hope therefore that we in the Union will continue to work with all the governments and other agencies which sought to prevent this action and that together we can prevent any further catastrophes of this kind.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that, as Mrs Garaud said, we need to clarify straight away that this is not predominantly a resolution on the statues, it is a resolution on the situation in Afghanistan.
As you know, the whole population is being held to ransom by fanatical clerics and the episode with the statues is just the umpteenth example of the fanatical nature of this regime, a regime which lives and thrives within these madrasas, these so-called schools which, at the end of the day, only teach one thing: intolerance.
The second thing which I think is important is that we have to dispel the widespread view that nothing much can be done about Afghanistan.
I think the contrary is true.
I think there are some very specific things which can be done.
I can name three.
The first is probably the most important: Commissioner, the European Union, i.e. the Commission, should take an extremely firm stance vis-Ã -vis Pakistan because, without Pakistan, there would be no Taliban.
That is an absolute basic.
The Union must therefore make clear that, if Pakistan persists, as it is doing, in helping and supporting the Taliban, there will be no prospect of developing relations between the European Union and Pakistan.
A second possible line of action, for which we can, I think, thank a forerunner in our Parliament, General Morillon, consists of giving firm support to General Massoud over and above any hypocrisy.
We cannot keep hiding behind alibis.
It is, I think, the only organised resistance against the regime in place and we need to give it teeth.
The third line of action, which will perhaps seem a little more indirect, but which is just as basic, concerns aid given by the United Nations - fairly indirectly but not as indirectly as all that Â­ via the UNDCP, the United Nations Drug Control Programme headed by Mr Arlacchi.
The UN has given the Taliban substantial aid through programmes which profess to eradicate crops but which, in fact, do no more than shift them a few hundred metres or a few kilometres, to the point that the Taliban have had access both to UN subsidies and to the profit generated by cultivating banned substances.
So we need to get the UNDCP with its back against the wall.
I think that we also need to campaign to prevent Pino Arlacchi from being re-elected in June.
This man needs to go home and study sociology and relieve us of his presence in an organisation of such importance.
The UN and the European Union, which is funding this programme, and the Member States, which fund the UNDCP, should therefore insist that all aid programmes to Afghanistan to eradicate drug crops be abolished.
We should also persuade the Russians who have infiltrated Mr Arlacchi' s entourage and who have a certain number of dubious connections to say the least - and I shall not say more - to go home and let us clean up the management of this specialised United Nations programme and, in doing so, stop helping the regime in place.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what good are our resolutions, conventions, treaties and rights for the protection of our cultural heritage, the slogan 'women' s rights are human rights' , when a group of people blindly destroys cultural heritage in the name of an extremist religion, when women are forced day in day out to deny themselves, to hide behind heavy robes with a mesh covering in front of their eyes?
Women who almost float along, who are kept apart by curtains on public transport, who are obliged to give up their jobs ... time and time again they are kept apart, and time and time again they are humiliated, abused and sold short.
This is why people are actually forced to move home, to emigrate in the face of the inhuman conditions prevailing in Afghanistan.
What must be done to get the Taliban to reconsider?
In practical terms it is too late for many statues.
That is a very tragic fact and in my view it is to be greatly welcomed that the international community protested against this iconoclastic fury of 2001.
This protest came not only from the West or from the Dalai Lama, but also from their own fellow-Muslims, who realised that this was a matter of cultural heritage and not purely religious symbols.
The protest was vociferous.
It is to be welcomed that at the same time the discriminatory and inhuman treatment of women in Afghanistan is receiving the attention it has long deserved: there should be worldwide protest against this too.
This regime discriminates not only against its own women: the local correspondent of the BBC, herself a woman, has just been deported.
Her criticism of the iconoclasm was too stinging and so the press bureau, which had existed since 1950, had to close.
I am not very optimistic, not to say pessimistic about the Taliban heeding these resolutions.
Hopefully no one will take it into his head to support them financially or by supplying weapons.
It just shows you what can happen when dogma becomes law.
It is to be welcomed that we, as the European Parliament, are responding.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports this resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are these two issues, the destruction of a heritage and the systematic oppression of women, really unrelated?
I would like to highlight these two points in our joint resolution.
'Heritage' is not the right word to use because of its significance.
I would prefer to take up the distinction made two days ago in a daily newspaper by a French philosopher, Jean Luc Nancy, between the symbol and the idol.
The symbol represents the human being, whose capacity for truth will never be extinguished.
The nature of the symbol in this case are statues which also serve as idols.
The idol is the total yet limited presence of the symbol itself.
It is perhaps the inverse representation of the symbol.
But, in both cases, the symbol and the idol merge into the image and the ability of the human being to transcend itself.
In terms of both nature and symbol, women in Afghanistan are totally deprived.
Let me explain what I mean by deprivation.
Rather than describe it, I will talk about it in the appropriate terms.
The word 'discrimination' in our joint resolution, as in the Council joint declaration of January and the texts of the UN and of the international institutions, disturbs me because discrimination operates in a space where a common minimum is allowed for there to be discrimination.
Discrimination is a natural corollary of exclusion.
Here we have women who are denied access to employment and education and who are excluded from public life.
This is called rejection.
These are the words we must use.
I find it hard to believe that hanging and public beatings are the result of discrimination.
I should like to point out that I believe we have become mired in a form of language, which I do not find very suitable and, as Members of the European Parliament, we must be very careful about this.
This is because behind all this, all these words, behind this international language, which uses the same words to describe democracy in the West and for our Western democracies as it does to describe what is happening in Afghanistan, lies our capacity for doing anything at all.
Who is protecting the Taliban?
Who is supporting them?
Pakistan.
Who is protecting them?
Do I have to answer?
Can you answer with me?
Why did we go to fight against Saddam Hussein?
Why have we imposed sanctions against Iraq?
Why do we not take sanctions against Afghanistan?
Mr President, what goes on in the minds of terrorists?
On the orders of Taliban chief Mohammad Omar, the two world-famous Bamiyan Buddha statues have been completely destroyed regardless of all international protests.
These millennia-old treasures that are part of our common cultural heritage are irreplaceable.
Not even the promise of further aid for this totally impoverished country could deter the self-styled warriors of God from their scandalous acts.
They control Afghanistan, drive out dissenters, exploit the country, human rights are trampled under foot, women are denied the opportunity to go to school, as my fellow Members have pointed out, and they are not allowed to appear in public.
It is like living in the Middle Ages.
The Koran says that freedom of religion and conscience together with justice are central elements of Islamic social order.
These commandments have been misinterpreted by the mullahs, an abuse that is unpardonable.
The Taliban' s closest ally, Pakistan, intervened without success.
Commissioner, the European Union must act here.
We in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats want the international community to outlaw such fanaticism and vandalism!
Mr President, I would like to explain our position on this issue by making four simple points.
Firstly, it is unacceptable for us to support what I would call a lawless area, where there is no recognition of the basic aspects of human welfare.
I do not think that Europe will ever be able to allow this situation and I believe that each and every one of us, whatever their attachment, can sympathise with it, given the two examples that Mrs Fraisse already mentioned.
Secondly, it is clear that the abolition of many symbols, representing what men and women might believe in, is crucially significant, but what is even more serious is the fact that denying any dignity for women' s rights must stir us into action. This is obviously a serious point and it certainly needs to be made.
My third point relates to Islam.
I believe we must have the courage to say that some people, who have a good understanding of Islam, have denounced the current situation in Afghanistan. By invoking Western values we must not deny this truth, which is that a certain number of men and women who are devoted to Islam oppose the events which are unfolding today in Afghanistan.
Therefore, the message that ideas and convictions can peacefully coexist, which must be adopted by Europe, must be disseminated far and wide.
So, there must be no demonisation, simply the desire to take action.
Fourthly and finally, point 12 of our resolution calls on the United Nations to rapidly establish an independent committee of inquiry.
We must arrange a meeting.
If the United Nations does not have either the determination or the courage to establish this committee of inquiry, it may fall to the European Parliament to take the initiative on behalf of our shared values and set up such a committee.
That is what is expected of Europe: it has its values; it is tolerant; it must demonstrate its determination, perhaps such a meeting has already been arranged.
If the United Nations does not act, it is up to us to do so. However, we are sending a very clear message to the Taliban and I hope I have succeeded in obtaining your support.
Mr President, the people of Europe had every reason to be shocked by the prospect, first of all, then the confirmation that the giant statues in Bamiyan were to be destroyed.
The observers concerned were quick to point out that this indignation was rather late in coming and that it could have been voiced when the Taliban took power because of the archaic and barbaric regime which they established in defiance of the most basic rights of the Afghan people.
This criticism cannot be levelled at the European Parliament which has taken action several times over, the last occasion being on 30 November 2000, when it condemned the regime as forcefully as it could and set alarm bells ringing regarding the tragic humanitarian situation experienced by the entire population.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, our Parliament welcomes the common positions adopted on 22 January, and particularly those adopted on 21 February this year, but we think the time has now come to openly give all the necessary political aid to the very forces on the ground that continue to fight under Commander Massoud. I would very much welcome a clear response on this issue.
Commissioner, as you know, we are also concerned about the tragic situation which, according to the Under-Secretary General responsible for humanitarian affairs at the UN, is threatening one million people in Afghanistan with famine.
I also asked you about this during the previous debate in this House.
May I ask you what the current situation is with regard to the aid that the European Union can give to all the populations under threat, including those of the North and the more isolated populations?
Do you not think that parachuting food into these areas could and should be considered?
Mr President, the civilised world has been shocked by the recent edict of the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, that the two statues of the Buddha in Bamiyan should be destroyed because they were idolatrous and unislamic.
It now appears from the press reports, that in defiance of appeals from world leaders, the UN General Assembly and international organisations including the EU, the statues have indeed been destroyed.
The international community despite its unanimity on this issue has been helpless to intervene, other than through direct appeals to Mullah Omar to reconsider.
He has been unwilling even to meet the representative of UNESCO, who travelled to Kandahar to see him.
The EU Troika has also sought a meeting from Islamabad without success.
The Taliban faction is isolated by UN sanctions and has been consistently informed by the international community that military victory will not bring diplomatic recognition for the Taliban organisation in Afghanistan.
Only a peace settlement involving all the parties to the current conflict can be the basis for lasting solutions to the tragedy of Afghanistan and its people.
Certainly acts of cultural vandalism of the kind that appeared to have been carried out in Bamiyan this week are no encouragement to the international community to engage in dialogue with this group.
Meanwhile human tragedy in Afghanistan continues, thanks to the effects of the worst drought in the country in 30 years and of course the ongoing conflict which has continued throughout the winter.
It is now estimated that there are at least half a million displaced persons inside Afghanistan.
In recent months, 170 000 have left Afghanistan for refugee camps in Pakistan and there are estimates that 1 000 people a day are crossing the borders from Afghanistan to Iran.
On the ground, the Commission, through ECHO and through its budget to aid for uprooted people, continues to provide humanitarian assistance via UN agencies and NGOs both inside Afghanistan and in Iran and Pakistan, including for demining.
This totalled more than EUR 400 million over the past ten years.
ECHO has already committed EUR 2.5 million for assistance to IDPs in Afghanistan and refugees in Pakistan this year.
Further support for drought and conflict affected areas is planned.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

Situation in Zimbabwe
Mr President, we have in Europe fought for Zimbabwe' s independence for many years, where freedom and democracy are said to prevail, despite the colour of people' s skin.
This democracy was to lead to an independent judicial system and separation of political and judicial powers.
Twenty years after Zimbabwe' s independence, we can only establish that the Mugabe government has not achieved a great deal.
The economy is in decline and, as for human rights, it is questionable whether the present situation is so much better than twenty years ago.
But what is most surprising, is the fact that the rest of Africa, especially South Africa, is looking on in silence.
My group is of the opinion that the European Commission must come down as hard on this regime as it did on any other regimes in southern Africa which rode roughshod over people' s rights.
If not, this problem might well contaminate the rest of Africa, which could have disastrous consequences.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since Zimbabwe decided to take part in the war in Congo, its economic situation has deteriorated by the day.
It simply cannot afford a war, but instead of withdrawing from it, it seems that the Zimbabwean government has chosen to create new problems for itself and look for scapegoats.
The way in which the land reform has been handled has made the economic and social situation even worse, and now that the success of the opposition parties, despite all intimidation attempts which we have witnessed with our own eyes, has become apparent, Mr Mugabe is resorting to human rights violations.
Zimbabwe is not only in chaos, it is under a reign of terror.
A Head of State who plunges his own country into chaos, and persecutes his own people does not really deserve our respect.
The dialogue between the European Union and Zimbabwe must, therefore, in the context of the ACP, be employed to reverse this situation.
We therefore understand that any official contact with Mr Mugabe is only acceptable to the extent that it is aimed at reinstating the rule of law and human rights, and takes place within the framework of the peace negotiations in Central Africa.
In that sense, we distance ourselves from Paragraph 16 of the compromise resolution, because we make allowances for the Belgian government, the French President and Commissioner Nielson who received President Mugabe in the framework of those peace negotiations.
We will therefore support the amendment from the liberal group, but our population and the people of Zimbabwe do expect to see results very soon.
We expect the pressure to be stepped up in such a way that the cynical stance of Mr Mugabe, who is indeed still receiving support from his old companions, will be brought to an end and the rule of law restored instead.
Mr President, as initiator of this resolution, this morning I met members of the Zimbabwean opposition - The Movement for Democratic Change.
They told me that Zimbabwe is going through hell.
Europe's efforts at quiet diplomacy just have negative results.
Mugabe presides over a state that day in and day out subjects innocent Zimbabweans to untold misery, murder, brutality and intimidation.
They pleaded for the same standards of democracy, the rule of law and human rights to be applied in Africa, as would be expected in Europe.
They told me that they do not want some second-class status in these matters. They would like to see Mugabe arrested as soon as he sets foot in a European state.
Instead, it seems there is one standard in Europe for handling right-wing dictators and another for socialist tyrants and terrorists, such as Mugabe.
Instead of handcuffs he gets champagne in Brussels and Paris.
In our strong resolution, thoroughly approved by the MDC representatives we have seen today, we condemn Mugabe and his regime and call for suspension of EU assistance directed through Zimbabwe government channels, identification of Mugabe's extensive overseas assets, invocation of the Cotonou Article 96 procedures and insistence that the Zimbabwean government respect its own laws.
Our message is clear.
I commend the resolution unamended to the House.
Mr President, two Zimbabwean politicians are listening to our debate today.
They have been tortured in the past and their colleagues have been killed.
At lunch they told me very calmly: 'We are here but when we go back we are going to be arrested and killed.
We have passed our sell-by date: we were supposed to have been killed two weeks ago.'
We are sitting here, wringing our hands, writing resolutions, talking about human rights but, at the same time, we seem to have double standards.
If black people kill other black people, we avert our eyes and let them get on with it.
It is all right for a right-wing dictator like Pinochet to be arrested for human rights violations in Chile.
Why do we treat people with a different skin colour in a different way?
We are supposed to have one standard for all.
We are supposed to be not only a global economy but a one-world family.
But is that the way we react?
No!
We need to do something about it.
Mr President, I share the view of Mrs Maes.
I shall continue in French in order to show that indeed we must have a common stance.
What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos.
Human rights there are being trampled underfoot.
Do we now need to erect a cordon sanitaire, which effectively means there will be no dialogue?
No.
We do need a cordon sanitaire but one which clearly expresses what we want to achieve when we meet with these interlocutors.
I would like to say to the last speaker that there was no champagne in Brussels. There was a reminder of resoluteness and there was a reminder of values, because if we want to safeguard the interests of the people of Zimbabwe, we must continue to get our position across to everyone, including the authorities.
Therefore, what I am asking is that the amendment we have tabled and which highlights the fact that we must invoke the law each time and we must specify what actually the scope of human rights is.
This is an important element.
So, let us not condemn those who defend this point of view, but let us call on the entire European Community - be it the Commission, the European Parliament or the Member States - to reiterate just how important human rights, and the law itself, are in this very sensitive area.
That is why I sincerely hope that the European Parliament will vote in favour of the amendment we have tabled.
Mr President, the clear language of the Zimbabwe resolution leaves no doubt that we hold President Mugabe personally responsible for conditions in that country.
Unfortunately, he is unwilling to listen to advice, whether it comes from his own country or from abroad, unless it is accompanied by concrete measures.
That is why we are urging the EU to suspend all cooperation directed through government channels.
It is also important to send Mr Mugabe the message that Europe no longer has a relevant political camp to act as his political sponsor.
But I would also like to hear the Commission and the Council speak the same clear language.
It is true that bilateral cooperation for development has been greatly scaled down, but I would ask the Council presidency to make the necessity of joint action clear to the Jospin Government in particular.
If France wants more influence in the region, it must back the forces of the future.
In this part of Africa civil society sometimes manages to overcome autocratic structures unaided, and then they remember who in Europe backed the wrong horse.
Please do not let us wait for everything to fall apart down there.
Mr President, this is one of the few times I have actually spoken on a topical or urgent matter in this House.
I am motivated to do so because the shock waves and repercussions of what is happening in Zimbabwe have reached even my constituency in the in Yorkshire in the North of England in a number of ways in the last couple of weeks.
It started with a visit from a young Zimbabwean with our local asylum seekers' organisation.
He was an active member of the MDC.
He and his fiancÃ©e had fled in fear of their lives, first to South Africa and, finding that not safe, they had come to the UK, but unfortunately his fiancÃ©e is likely to be returned.
We do not know to what, but we can suspect.
Then last week in Ripon in Yorkshire, I was asked to share a platform with a Member of the Zimbabwean Parliament, a shadow minister.
Quietly spoken, he told of his aspirations for his country, a country of great potential but where, as we have heard, democracy and human rights are now denied and the rule of the law flouted.
He told how he had been beaten, how he feared daily for his wife and his family and, just as we have also heard, he feared what would happen to him when he returns on 17 March.
When people are fleeing for their lives across the world and when democratically elected politicians are in fear of their lives, Europe needs to make a response that this is not acceptable.
I believe our resolution is clear and I hope it gets the support it deserves.
Children abducted by one of their parents
Mr President, one of the items of today' s topical debate is that of parental abduction, more specifically the case of the Limet children, who, despite court rulings and diplomatic steps, have not visited their father for many years.
The reason why this topic is on the list of urgent questions today is because, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian government and pledges of President Arap Moi from Kenya, there is a chance of breaking the deadlock in this case in the short term. All it needs now is a little nudge from this European Parliament to guide it onto the right track.
But the fact that we are discussing this case here today should not make us oblivious to the fact that the Limet case is only the tip of the iceberg.
Many of us are involved in cases of parental abduction, sometimes even as a country' s go-between.
I myself know of many dozens of cases of parents in Belgium whose children have been kidnapped and taken to Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon and even to America, and also in the European Union many children are denied the right to one of their parents.
Only recently, I was reading a report which stated that, in 1999 alone, cases were recorded under the Convention of The Hague involving more than 1 800 children.
And that is only covering the 47 countries which have ratified the Convention and excluding the cases which are being considered under the Convention of Luxembourg.
All these children are entitled to both their parents, and the European Parliament has ensured that this is clearly spelled out in the EU' s Fundamental Rights Charter, promulgated in Nice, even more clearly than in the Convention of New York.
And that is another reason for making sure that this Charter is included in our Treaty.
I hope that approval of this resolution will help guarantee the Limet children their right to both parents, but I am just as much convinced that the European Parliament, and the Commission too, I hope, will need to take many more initiatives in order to restore the rights of all these other children and parents.
I am convinced that this House has the political will to carry this through.
Mr President, on behalf of Mrs Ries, I should like to underline the importance of this resolution. Although it only deals with one case, it still reflects the issue which has a European and even international dimension.
These are facts that are, unfortunately, increasingly common and which constitute a violation of the international treaties.
It has a devastating effect on the life of a father or mother, of children and of an environment.
Mr Limet has now been fighting for his children for more than two years. He had been given custody over his children, but they were abducted by his ex-wife and taken to Kenya.
The mother of the children was recently found guilty of abduction and given a one year unconditional sentence, but despite the legal steps and mediation by both the Belgian and European political authorities, especially Mr Prodi, the chances of Mr Limet seeing his children again are as good as non-existent.
A solution is therefore needed and, where this particular case is concerned, I would ask the Commission and the Council to call on the Kenyan government to ensure that justice ultimately prevails.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two observations to make regarding the disturbing problem which is the subject of this resolution, namely parental abduction.
We are all familiar with the many conventions, Article 24 of the EU' s Fundamental Rights Charter, the treaties of The Hague, and the many real-life cases, as Mrs Van Lancker mentioned a moment ago.
I can foresee two large obstacles which will stand in the way of finding solutions.
First of all, many of the existing agreements between countries, and even within the European Union, are different and not harmonised, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach a solution.
This is therefore something we need to work on.
Secondly, if a parent who kidnaps a child is domiciled in Germany, for example, but actually lives in Greece, then a solution is often ruled out.
That means that the professional NGOs, of which Belgium has many, have to start their own investigations and try to track down children and bring them home.
That is why the Group of the Greens/Free European Alliance hopes that this resolution will not be swept under the carpet but may signify the necessary step forward.
Mr President, as the Parliament's mediator for transnationally abducted children, I have been involved in the de Brouwer-Limet case for some time.
First I wish to reassure other victim parents, some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case, that their tragedies too are just as important to me.
My primary concern today is to ensure that the channels of communication, which seem to be opening for the first time since the onset of the Limet tragedy, are strengthened and that progress can be made to return the children to their home as soon as possible.
This is the primary aim of this resolution.
All too often in Member States, the abduction of a child is treated by the police and other authorities simply as a domestic rather than a criminal matter.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kenyan authorities, and in particular President Moi, for any assistance they can provide to ensure a positive outcome.
It is my firm belief that the children have the right to know both parents and this right was scrupulously respected until the failure to return the children to their father in Belgium in August 1998.
However, since then the children have been denied access to one parent, in this case their father.
He has given undertakings that once the children are returned to his custody their mother will continue to have visiting rights as before, thus restoring the children's right to have a relationship with both parents.
Next week, I will be travelling to the Hague conference, where the special commission will meet to review the practical operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
We have a big task ahead of us, but I would like to take this opportunity to remind all the signatories of the Hague convention that they signed up not just to protect their own nationals who may become victims of child abduction, but also to use the convention to assist those who are victims of child abduction by their own nationals.
It is not a one-way process.
For the convention to succeed, full cooperation by all the signatories is essential.
Mr President, this issue of Cabinda, which is troubling public opinion in Portugal, Angola and other countries, is quite intolerable, and all of the Portuguese Members from the various political groups in this Parliament have agreed to table a motion for a resolution, which I recommend should be voted for.
This is a moderate motion, which is designed to condemn the unacceptable fact that innocent people have been kidnapped for political ends.
The motion does not discuss the basis of the issue, simply whether it is legitimate for a so-called revolutionary organisation to kidnap innocent people from other countries and to use these kidnappings to put pressure on the political powers of other States in order to achieve some form of recognition.
This is unacceptable.
What is even less acceptable, however, is the fact that people who are political refugees - and I have a great deal of respect for political exiles, because I myself spent many years in exile - take advantage of the countries in which they now live, particularly France, for example, and make threats to exact reprisals on the interests of other countries, such as, for example, Portugal, in order to achieve a political end.
This is totally unacceptable.
I therefore call on this organisation - the LFEC, to accept that, by using these terrorist-style methods, it is discrediting itself and will certainly fail to achieve its ends.
I also call upon Parliament and upon the Council and the Commission to adopt a position of total condemnation of these methods, which could encourage others to act in the same way.
Many countries are undergoing major conflicts and it is crucial that people' s rights are always safeguarded.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are keen to endorse this resolution.
On humanitarian grounds, we have no choice but unequivocally to condemn the kidnapping of citizens.
We therefore lend our support to the resolution in the hope that the people involved will be released at the earliest opportunity and can return to their families.
In this connection, we should not, however, forget that the entire Angolan population has been held hostage for years by a civil war for which there is no end in sight.
The fact that both the armed government troops and armed rebel movements repeatedly take revenge upon the civilian population is a scandal which has lasted for too long.
I therefore hope that the pressure which the European Union can bring to bear in aid of the peace process will also put an end to the inhuman conditions in Angola.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my concern at the precarious and difficult situation of the eight Portuguese people who are being held hostage by various factions of the LFEC.
I also wish to express my sympathy for their families and to state my heartfelt desire that these hostages are unconditionally released as quickly as possible, and I therefore believe that the Portuguese Government must make every possible effort to achieve this.
As a matter of fact, this was precisely the thrust of a letter that I sent to the Swedish Presidency, in due time and with the utmost discretion, asking it about the possibility of the various Member States adopting measures in conjunction with the Portuguese and Angolan Governments which would facilitate or improve the likelihood of the immediate release of the hostages.
In any case, I feel that it is appropriate to emphasise that these actions by the LFEC must be explicitly and roundly condemned.
These are criminal acts that are designed to aggravate the political and military situation in Angola and which are also intended to give an international profile to a group that has no compunction about resorting to such actions in order to achieve separatist objectives, which are also completely unrealistic.
In fact, it is worth pointing out that Angola' s territorial integrity must be scrupulously respected, also because no legitimacy has been conferred on this type of separatist objective by the international community, specifically either by the Organisation of African Unity or the United Nations.
Lastly, I must express my profound surprise at the ease with which representatives of organisations that carry out such acts and which threaten to continue with them if they succeed, and are given total freedom to make statements and express themselves with complete impunity, which is, in fact, what has happened today.
I wish, by the way, to thank our President, Mrs Fontaine, and her staff, for their rapid and determined action, compelling the three representatives of the LFEC who were present this morning to leave Parliament' s buildings.
Mr President, since May 2000, eight Portuguese citizens have been held prisoner in the territory of Cabinda.
These people are workers who were forced by necessity to leave their country and they are also citizens of the European Union to whom all the governments of the Union have responsibilities.
The fact that, on our initiative, Parliament is discussing this issue is therefore to be warmly welcomed.
We feel that a very clear position of principle is involved: it is unacceptable to imprison peaceful citizens in order to make political demands.
I therefore call on all those who are detaining these Portuguese citizens to release them immediately, in a gesture of humanitarian good will, which is the only thing that can help their captors' cause.
The situation of our fellow citizens is obviously close to our hearts and, in order to ensure their release, we will do whatever is necessary, in accordance with our principles.
This does not mean, however, that we are unaware that there are many conflicts, including the conflict in Cabinda, that do not reach the public' s attention as a result of the way we ignore Africa.
We know that the current situation in Cabinda is extremely harsh for the Cabindese.
Although they coexist with powerful international interests, in a territory that produces hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, they endure the most extreme poverty.
Let no-one be under any illusions, because these ghettos of prosperity in which huge international companies set up on the coastline, protected by mercenaries and government troops, are an echo and a portrait of a colonial-style situation.
We also know that there is no real political freedom, freedom of expression or free opportunity for the people of Cabinda to develop fully their cultural and religious identity which would allow them to argue for all that they want in a legal and peaceful way.
We know that war is raging in most of the territory, together with human rights violations against the people of Cabinda, which have been condemned in all international reports.
There is no need to look any further than the reports by Amnesty International, which detail the extrajudicial executions, the systematic use of torture, the murder of civilians and the destruction of villages all suffered in Cabinda.
These are facts that it would be hypocritical to ignore and that it suits many people to conceal.
I shall not do this!
Just as I call on those who are holding our fellow citizens to release them immediately, given the possibility of their release, I urge the Angolan authorities not to initiate or intensify military operations that could put the lives of the Portuguese who are being held at risk.
They share responsibility for the situation that has arisen and we will be watching events closely.
The adoption of a constructive position by the Angolan Government would obviously be welcomed by the international community.
As a matter of fact, in the recent past, contacts have been established and direct negotiations have taken place between the Angolan Government and those fighting for independence in Cabinda, and the international community can only support this approach.
Whatever reasons the men and women of Cabinda may have, making these Portuguese workers suffer will not help their cause.
This is a unique opportunity to release these people in full view of the international community.
We call once again for this to be done.
Mr President, our declaration of support for the European Parliament resolution on the kidnapping of eight Portuguese citizens in Cabinda is motivated by a single concern: to do everything to obtain their release as quickly as possible.
Bearing this in mind, those who wish to see this initiative as an attempt to use the media to take advantage of a situation that is of legitimate concern to the whole Portuguese and, of course, international community, or to exacerbate political or party-political quarrels, which have no place at all in this context, are deluding themselves.
We are acting on principle here and in order to achieve a result.
Let us clearly state the principles that are guiding us: we consider the use of kidnapping to express political opinions in any part of the world and for whatever reason to be unacceptable.
This means that we cannot associate ourselves with any attempt to raise the profile of Cabinda' s political situation unless the Portuguese citizens are released.
The result that we wish to see forces us to make a sincere appeal that is not tainted by any party-political affiliations with the parties involved in the conflict in Cabinda.
From this rostrum I appeal urgently to the sense of humanity of the leaders of the LFEC, so that they free our fellow citizens, some of whom have been detained for around nine months in extremely harsh living conditions.
If I may put it like this, the LFEC must not be in any doubt as to the appreciation of the Portuguese and international communities of the historical aspirations that motivate their struggle.
The simple release of the hostages, of their Portuguese brethren, from the very country with which the LFEC wishes to reopen relations that were cut off more than 25 years ago, will encourage a positive reaction and closer attention to the LFEC' s historical and political aims by these two communities.
When the hostages are released, for our part, we shall not forget what we am now stating, particularly because we are aware of the difficult conditions in which the citizens of Cabinda are living.
The release of the Portuguese citizens is, in this sense, also an act of political clarity and affirmation of humanitarian principles that we all need in order to bring about the resolution of this unfortunate episode.
Mr President, I welcome all the efforts, both public and those behind the scenes, that have been made, from the moment the first Portuguese citizen was kidnapped, particularly the efforts made by the Portuguese Government, with a view to ensuring the release of the hostages.
I also wish to add my voice to the appeal made to the LFEC by all the Portuguese Members here in Strasbourg, for it immediately and unconditionally to release the eight Portuguese citizens that it is holding hostage, to respect human rights, to think of these people' s families, who are undergoing considerable anguish and worry, and to return the hostages to normal life so that they can move freely within the country in which they have decided to exercise their professions.
I also wish to make it quite clear to the LFEC that there is no political cause, whether one agrees with it or not, that justifies using kidnapping as a form of defence.
Situation in Kalimantan
Mr President, in the current climate of restlessness and uncertainty in Indonesia, the tiniest detail is enough to spark an eruption of ethnic or religious violence.
The riots in Kalimantan are no exception.
Virtually every community in Indonesia with social or ethnic differences is a potential hotbed, now that the sub-districts, districts and provincial boundaries are being re-established or contested.
In addition, local disputes regarding natural resources are increasingly fierce.
A moratorium on every administrative change of boundaries or local administrative restructuring would be welcome, certainly until such time as law and order are restored in a credible manner and the situation in Jakarta becomes more stable.
Military intervention is not the answer.
General Suharto's implicit suggestion that a military coup against the current civilian government is under way to restore order in the country must therefore be condemned most emphatically.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was with utter disgust that we witnessed the massacres in Kalimantan, which are unprecedented in their brutality.
This is a clear case of ethnic tensions having got out of hand, as is evident in various places in Indonesia: Timor, Aceh, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya.
In West Kalimantan, the riots broke out as early as 1997 and 1999 and, across the country, these are, in actual fact, the result of the imposed transmigration programme of 1960.
But under the expert, dictatorial rod of iron, all these tensions remained under the surface, and they are now all of a sudden erupting with a vengeance.
In my opinion, the international community has to take great care and must make sure that it is ready to grant the lawful government the necessary aid, for the poor are fighting the poor and, at the end of the day, this is an issue of poverty.
Mr President, the violence in Indonesia is unremitting.
For a number of years, there have been problems in Timor, mainly concentrated in West Timor at the moment, as well as in the Moluccas, in Aceh, in Irian Jaya and now again in Kalimantan.
The old Suharto regime has in the past forced more than 8 million Indonesians to move from overpopulated regions to regions with a low population rate.
For example, a few hundred thousand people moved from the island of Madura to Kalimantan, formerly Borneo.
The migrants are often given a considerable degree of preferential treatment. For example they receive land and living facilities, sometimes at the expense of the indigenous population.
That is the case in Irian Jaya and the Moluccas, as well as for the people from Madura in Kalimantan.
It is therefore understandable that difficulties should arise, and neither is it all that difficult to let the tensions between population groups escalate.
Unfortunately, there are quite a few people and groups in Indonesia who stand to gain from an escalation in tension between regional population groups, causing the government in Jakarta to become destabilised.
This whole situation has now led to hundreds of killings, and tens of thousands of refugees, in addition to more than a million internal refugees which Indonesia was already grappling with.
It is a huge problem, which is threatening to get the better of the Indonesian government.
In our resolution, we call on the European Commission to address the Indonesian government in a bid to halt these brutalities, and we urge the Commission to implement this resolution.
Mr President, 240 million people live in an archipelago that would stretch from London to Baghdad.
Indonesia is massive in geography and population.
It is the world's largest Muslim country.
It is a mega-player in its region and has enormous potential.
Were it to disintegrate, the implications for its neighbours would be catastrophic.
I was there two weeks ago.
It is a young democracy emerging from the oppressive years of Suharto.
Habibi gave it press freedom, which is surviving, Wahid came in as symbol of the drive against fraud and corruption and there are still high hopes of his policy of devolution.
He is under pressure from Parliament and street demonstrators and those ambitious to replace him.
One of the benefits of dictatorship, of course, is often that the lid is kept on social, religious and racial tensions.
Sadly the end of dictatorship so often opens the box and releases these ills.
Timor, Moluccas, Aceh, Papua and now Borneo-Kalimantan all show this.
The situation in parts of Kalimantan is intolerable and I back this motion totally.
But what Indonesia most needs is our support for their efforts to find and fund solutions and any criticism from us must be constructive.
Situation in Turkmenistan
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this sitting is almost a prayer-session for democratic life, and, even though the echo and the consequences of our protests may be limited, they will nevertheless give hope to someone deprived of his or her liberty and will be a thorn in the side of tyrants such as the current president of Turkmenistan, who forced his Parliament to vote him in unanimously as President for life.
The legislative elections in Turkmenistan have not even been recognised by the OSCE.
European diplomacy must be active in this country, which has 4.5 million inhabitants, and which is already experiencing religious persecution, media censorship and the ongoing breach of human rights.
This country is located in a part of the world where great strategic and energy interests meet, as it borders the Caspian Sea and has huge reserves of gas.
The European Union cannot turn its back on this region for, as classical humanism dictates, we cannot ignore any aspect of the human condition.
Mr President, it is best not to think about how this country is being run, because then, everything is under control.
If you do start to think about it, then you make a mistake.
These are revealing words, with a double meaning, spoken by a German businessman working for the regime of President Saparmurat Niyazov, the Leader of the Turkmen people.
Turkmenistan, a republic in Central Asia, is blessed with generous oil and gas reserves.
No wonder that the Head of State, Mr Niyazov, has promised his people an 'Altyn Asyr' , a golden era.
However, Turkmenbashi, the pet name for the country' s great leader, has no intention of keeping his promise.
Quite the reverse, in fact!
President Niyazov has spared neither cost nor effort to glorify his own persona in the form of prestigious constructions.
For example, word has it that every street corner in the capital, Ashgabat is adorned with a bust of Turkmenbashi in gold and bronze, while the ordinary citizen is somehow having to survive in a society overrun by corruption.
What is also shocking is the complete neglect of the national health care system and of education by Niyazov's regime.
Examples of this are the decisions by the powers that be to close down hospitals in the provinces, and the imminent resignation of thousands of teachers, despite overcrowded classrooms.
Turkmenbashi' s megalomania and mismanagement have instilled a general climate of fear in the country.
Whoever dares to speak up is immediately imprisoned for years.
It is the frank belief of a Turkmen lecturer, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain anonymous, that human rights count for nothing at all in that country.
Most of his fellow-sufferers avoid frank discussions about the abject conditions in their home country.
In the final analysis, Turkmenistan' s political leaders are just as much at the mercy of Turkmenbashi Niyazov.
In front of running cameras, the President brings shame on ministers in public, and sacks them at will.
As a former communist, President Niyazov has a great affinity with Sunni Muslims - he has already completed the pilgrimage to Mecca - and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
Members of other religious communities in the country, on the other hand, are liable to downright persecution, which is completely at odds with their constitutional right to freedom of religion.
The present joint resolution asks, in this connection, for special attention to be given to the position of the condemned Baptist minister Shagildy Atakov.
According to the latest reports, this prisoner is said, because of his faith, to be in a prison hospital in the town of Mary, where he is being administered highly infectious and tranquillising injections.
I therefore also call on the Commission to obtain information about Shagildy Atakov and to intervene with the Turkmen authorities on his behalf.
In the Netherlands, the Protestant churches held a prayer day yesterday.
There is no doubt that the Turkmen Christians, as well as the entire Turkmen population, were placed before God on that occasion.
In that spirit, due to Man being a Creation of God, we would ask the Council and Commission to employ all diplomatic means in order to improve the situation in Turkmenistan.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as Chairman of the delegation of the European Parliament with the Central Asian countries, which covers Turkmenistan, I receive weekly reports on the continuous violation of human rights in Turkmenistan.
It is one of the reasons why our delegation decided a couple of months ago not to travel to Turkmenistan in mid-June to set up the parliamentary cooperation committee.
I fully subscribe to the requirement not to implement the Interim Agreement as long as the human rights situation in Turkmenistan does not improve.
Commissioner Liikanen, I would urge you to pass the content of this resolution, and especially the paragraph relating to the TACIS programme, on to your colleagues, and to Mr Patten in particular.
I call on the Commission to employ all available means to reinforce mainstream society, to strengthen a true multiparty system and to promote free and independent media.
Mr President, as rapporteur for a new Interim Agreement between the European Union and Turkmenistan, and having consulted the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I have delayed the parliamentary discussion, despite the hesitant go-ahead received from our Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
The reasons for my action were that democracy is increasingly becoming a sham, and that there is even a president who has had himself appointed for life.
There is no political will for reform in Turkmenistan, as that country is riding roughshod over human rights, especially the rights of religious minorities, both Islam and Christian.
Additionally, the proper implementation of European-funded TACIS projects is being frustrated by poor management and by a lack of adequate information and sound financial accountability.
Mr President, it is only natural that all fledgling democracies will struggle at first, but riding roughshod over human rights cannot be tolerated and cannot be reconciled with a new Interim Agreement between the European Union and Turkmenistan.
As MEP and rapporteur, I warmly recommend the urgency declaration to my fellow MEPs.
Mr President, I shall start with Zimbabwe.
In 1999, the Commission took steps to re-orientate its cooperation with Zimbabwe in favour of social sector actions - health, education and AIDS, democracy and support to civil society.
The Commission and the Member States have opted for confidential political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement in order to influence the Zimbabwean government and to seek improvements in respect for the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
Sanctions are not considered appropriate at this stage.
The Commission believes that sanctions should be kept as a last resort to discourage major setbacks such as the suspension of the constitution or the cancellation of the 2002 presidential elections.
While President Mugabe is closely associated with these undesirable events, his public demonisation is counterproductive since it encourages support for him by dissenting factions in Zimbabwe African National Union/Patriotic Front and by neighbouring states.
Overemphasis on the plight of whites risks encouraging a revival of the independence theme supported by many blacks in Zimbabwe and in southern Africa.
It neglects the plight of many very poor black people in Zimbabwe.
Secondly, on trans-nationally abducted children: the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members in the case of international child abductions, often by one of the child's parents.
Within the Community the Brussels II regulation entered into force on 1 March this year.
This regulation sets out rules on jurisdiction, automatic recognition and simplified enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses.
Therefore custodial decisions at the time of divorce taken in the Member States in accordance with Brussels II can now be enforced throughout the Community.
Admittedly the regulation does not go far enough in that it is limited to custodial decisions for the children of both spouses taken at the time of divorce.
Later this month, the Commission plans to present a working document on the mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility, to be followed by a proposal for a regulation extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation to cover all children and situations.
As far as cases that transcend the borders of the Community are concerned, the Commission also supports the ratification, or the correct application, of the 1980 Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, which is indeed a very valuable instrument.
On Cabinda: the Commission agrees and deplores the situation of the eight European citizens who have been kidnapped in Cabinda.
The Commission hopes that a solution can be rapidly found to allow them to regain their freedom.
On Kalimantan in Indonesia: the Commission shares the honourable Members' concerns about the conflict in Kalimantan, which resulted in injury and serious loss of life.
Clearly several factors have influenced the outbreak of violence and massacre: a decade-old and badly implemented policy of trans-migration, genuine poverty in some parts of the area, misadministration and provocateurs who, for reasons we may only speculate about, create the violence.
To address the poverty in this region, the Commission has in place development projects in southern and eastern Kalimantan, which include support for sustainable management of tropical forests.
The Indonesian leadership currently faces some extremely difficult policy choices.
They must establish temporary shelter for the refugees in Kalimantan.
However, they also need to consider whether to assist those who want to leave Kalimantan permanently and return to Madura.
They must also show determination to restore law and order and pursue the perpetrators. Failure to do so would send bad signals about the commitment of the Indonesian leadership to the rule of law.
The Commission is closely following the situation and would stand ready to assist if the situation justified it.
However, our current assessment is that most of the 50 000 refugees intend to return to their place of origin - Madura - where they have families who will be able to support them.
On Turkmenistan: the Commission is fully aware of the case of Mr Atakov, a Baptist pastor, who was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.
It supported the EU dÃ©marche in Ashgabat by the EU Presidency and the Member States in February this year, asking for the release of Mr Atakov.
The Commission has expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan.
It supported the EU presidency dÃ©marche earlier this year in order to release Mr Primukuli Tanrykuliev and Mr Nurberdy Nurmamedov.
The release of these two prisoners was ordered by President Niyazov later in an amnesty allowing the release of 12 000 prisoners.
The Commission fully supports Parliament's resolutions.
External pressure has to be maintained to achieve results in the fight for human rights and freedom of religion in Turkmenistan.
In response to Mr Staes' s question about assistance through TACIS, I would add that EU assistance provided through the TACIS programme is mainly oriented towards agricultural development, which directly benefits the population.
In addition, the Commission develops TACIS democracy projects mostly through local NGOs in order to enhance civil society.
As requested, I will refer this to Mr Nielson and Mr Patten for further action.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Uncontrolled trade in light weapons
The next item is the joint debate on five motions for resolutions on the uncontrolled trade in light weapons:
B5-0189/2001 by Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group: uncontrolled trade in small and light weapons;
B5-0201/2001 by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group: uncontrolled trade in small and light weapons;
B5-0209/2001 by Mrs McKenna, Mrs Maes, Mrs Schroedter and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group: UN Conference to be held in July 2001 on the illegal trade in small and light weapons and all aspects thereof;
B5-0218/2001 by Mrs Morgantini, Mr Schmid, Mr Alavanos and Mr Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group: UN Conference to be held in July 2001 on the illegal trade in small and light weapons and all aspects thereof;
B5-0227/2001 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group: small and light weapons.
Mr President, Commissioner, throughout almost 6 000 years of human history and 10 000 wars, we have always encouraged the production of weapons.
A certain degree of conscience, however, now seems to be dawning upon us.
In 1972, we banned biological weapons. In 1993, we banned chemical weapons, and in 1997, we banned land mines.
Nuclear proliferation is more or less under control, although we have been going through a very difficult phase since the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, which then came into force in 1970.
Nowadays, however, the weapons that take most lives are light weapons.
There are estimated to be five hundred thousand million light weapons on this planet.
They kill 200 000 people a year, which is twenty times more than land mines. More than half of victims are in Africa.
So it comes as no surprise that the Secretary General of the United Nations, who is himself a great African, has put on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, which is due to meet next July in New York, the debate on a convention to try to limit this dangerous and terrible proliferation.
The idea is to identify weapons so that they can be monitored, to keep a register of weapons, to encourage all States to strengthen their controls and their domestic legislation on exporting and re-exporting weapons, to organise the prosecution and punishment of traffickers and, finally, to finance and push forward national weapons' collection and destruction programmes.
Against such a backdrop, the European Union, which adopted a moratorium on the sale of weapons three years ago at the behest of Great Britain, would do itself credit by having an effective common policy and playing its full part.
I welcome the fact that six political groups were able to table a motion for a resolution which is an excellent and timely compromise.
I will not say any more.
We must support it. It is totally in keeping with our code of conduct and with what has already been decided by the OSCE, and falls fairly and squarely within the scope of the next UN Convention.
During voting time, Mr President, I will ask to table two oral amendments, which I know have already received general approval.
The first is in the recitals. When the time comes, I will say where to add a citation to the Bamako Declaration of last month - a great historical first - in which 52 African nations took up a single position which was in perfect harmony with our code of conduct.
The second addition would simply be a reference to the marking of weapons in the proposals of our compromise resolution.
I know they have your backing and I will support them at the appropriate time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this plenary week is the week of conflict prevention.
A lot of wise things have been said, but the most important action in this context is this EU initiative for the UN conference on the illicit trade in small arms.
We know that this very trade is a major reason for the aggravation of conflicts and that the innocent civilian population suffers the most casualties.
The positive thing about the EU proposal is that it involves both sides, users and producers, and that the EU is striving for more binding commitments.
This conference must be the first step towards stopping arms exports.
But there will have to be a permanent commission to check that it is enforced.
It would be good if the EU would not only call for this but be the first to enforce it in its own ranks.
Mr President, on various occasions Parliament has talked about the code of conduct for the export and transfer of arms.
First of all in order to arrive at this code of conduct, then in order that it should be effective.
Today, our resolution has a fundamental objective: to help the next United Nations Conference in July to be successful.
In order to do this we propose various points in the resolution.
Taking into account the time that I have, I am only going to explain three.
In the first place, preventing arms from being exported or transferred to groups or countries that violate human rights.
Secondly, an international agreement on the trade and transport of arms that is binding for all countries.
Thirdly, transparency and parliamentary control over this trade which causes low- and medium-intensity conflicts, something which you only have to be here for an afternoon of topical and urgent debate to see.
Of course, without these arms, those conflicts would not happen.
Parliament must therefore wish the United Nations Conference in July to be a success.
Mr President, since the end of the Cold War, the distribution of light weapons has become a worldwide issue; this is a phenomenon which is fomenting both street crime in our part of the world and civil wars in the Third World.
The UN Conference is therefore more overdue than premature.
I am of the opinion that the European Union must take the lead in New York.
The 1998 European code of conduct can serve as a template for a worldwide agreement on the export and transfer of weapons.
This code has proved its usefulness but is deficient in two important areas.
First of all, it is not legally binding.
Europe must press for an international agreement which is binding.
Secondly, no provisions have been made for monitoring the end users of exported weapons.
In Africa, for example, Togo and Burkina are officially known as end users of weapons from Bulgaria while, in reality, these weapons are being channelled to Liberia and to the rebels in Sierra Leone.
Europe must call for the stricter monitoring and penalisation of transfer countries of this kind.
The distribution of light weapons is, in fact, not only a problem in the Third World.
In Europe and North-America too, the possession of weapons is on the increase.
Half of all American families possess a firearm.
Although these are often legal weapons, they cause just as much damage, as was once again demonstrated last week in California.
That is why the UN Conference must also pluck up the courage to broach the subject of legal small weapons, and Europe must be able to argue for a total ban on the advertising of firearms.
Mr President, the UN Member States are facing a difficult dilemma: either they opt for the arms industry and economic interests, or they choose human safety, stability and peace.
We are very much counting on the Swedish Presidency to set the right tone at the preparatory meeting, and on the Belgian Presidency to make the right choices during the conference.
Mr President, the EU is committed to combating the destabilising accumulations of small arms in many parts of the world.
The EU joint action on small arms and light weapons proposes the adoption of a series of confidence-building measures including measures to promote increased transparency and openness.
The Union also pledges to provide financial and technical assistance to countries, international organisations and NGOs, requesting support for these measures.
A number of projects emanating from the joint action are currently under way or under consideration.
The financial execution of these projects is carried out by the European Commission.
The EU attaches great importance to the upcoming UN Conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
Some progress was achieved during this second preparatory committee but many important questions remain to be settled.
We welcome the revised draft programme of action submitted by the chairman of the preparatory committee which serves as a good basis for further discussions.
We will continue to consult closely with our partners during the preparatory process and work together towards the adoption of politically and legally binding instruments as well as comprehensive international programmes for action on small arms.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Disasters

Floods in Mozambique
Mr President, once again, and in a similar situation to the one we saw last year, we are witnessing serious floods in Mozambique, which have claimed a considerable number of victims and caused enormous material damage.
Once again, we wish to express our solidarity with the people of Mozambique and to ask the Community and the Member States to increase their emergency aid to that country.
I wish to take this opportunity to mention Commissioner Nielson' s willingness to make statements on this subject to the Commission on Development and Cooperation and, particularly, his announcement here of extraordinary aid for Mozambique.
I wish, nevertheless, to emphasise the need to find more rapid ways of achieving greater coordination and more effective mobilisation of resources, especially by the Member States, in order to address emergency situations such as this and with a view, in particular, to guaranteeing the evacuation of communities that are affected or at risk.
Lastly, I should like to draw your attention to the urgent need for special consideration of the possibility of cancelling Mozambique' s foreign debt.
Mr President, the initiatives adopted by some Portuguese Members, including myself, in order to see this joint resolution carried, have already had some positive effects.
Firstly, there is the joint resolution itself, which expresses Parliament' s will to show solidarity; and secondly, there is the financial support that has already been announced and promised by the Commission.
Unfortunately, Mr President, we are speaking once again about a disaster recurring in Mozambique, a new democracy.
Following a civil war that decimated a large part of the population and left the country in the most abject poverty, we are now helplessly witnessing the swings of nature which appear determined to sacrifice the people of Mozambique.
The country is facing a very worrying situation.
It is true that the Zambezi river has stopped rising, but the situation could change at any time as a result of the rainfall levels that have occurred or that are forecast to occur.
The Cabora Bassa dam is reaching maximum saturation point and discharges from it could make the situation worse.
Maintaining the minimum survival threshold requires emergency measures, both for food aid and shelter, for rescue and reconstruction measures and for the supply of medicines.
It is extremely important that we send health specialists because the first symptoms of diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea have already been diagnosed in the population.
Nevertheless, various problems have arisen in addressing the basic needs of those affected, due to the fact that bridges and railway lines have been flooded.
Helicopters need to be used but, although these are resources that Mozambique does have, it does not have anywhere near a satisfactory number.
The European Union and, particularly, the Commission, must play a very important role in adopting humanitarian aid programmes, which are, in fact, a distinguishing feature of the European Union' s external policy.
The EUR 2 million - ESC 400 thousand million - which have already been made available are a good indication of the Commission' s cooperative approach, but are clearly insufficient to meet the shortages and the problems Mozambique is facing.
Ultimately, Mr President, what we are asking is for the Commission and the Council to take the broadest and most sympathetic view possible of our joint resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is enough to give you nightmares.
A country such as Mozambique, which has had so much bad luck, is once again struck by heavy flooding.
Once again, emergency aid turns out not to have arrived on time, and it proves not to have been possible to evacuate many people in time. Moreover, we must ask ourselves how such a desperately poor country is to survive another disaster like this.
A few years ago, we were able to delight in the prompt economic recovery in some parts of Mozambique, but the inland regions are so extremely poor - people have absolutely nothing - that I find it disgraceful that some countries have still not released Mozambique from its debts.
Europe should lead the way in this respect.
That country should not have to repay its debts.
It is already paying such a heavy toll to nature that what we need here is the highest level of solidarity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we seem to have been here before.
Tomorrow, it will be exactly a year since, we were discussing and voting on a resolution in this Parliament on this very subject: floods in Mozambique.
We have once again focussed on the communities that have been affected, which this time are mainly in the provinces of Tete, Sofala and Zambezi. Dozens of people have died or disappeared, around half a million people have been affected and almost one hundred thousand have lost their homes.
The suffering of these people, many of whom are in an extremely weak condition, has been enormous and the problems they face are serious: there is a shortage of drinking water and food, a shortage of fuel and the threat of disease.
The European Union must therefore express its solidarity with Mozambique, translate its words into action and not forget the efforts of the people of Mozambique, who have tried, at great cost, to consolidate their process of transition to democracy, which is still a long way from being achieved.
In this context, I wish to highlight the content of the final part of paragraph 5 of the joint resolution that we shall be voting on and which is ultimately designed to safeguard all the security and operational conditions needed to ensure that aid reaches its intended destination.
We all have an obligation to ensure that this requirement is met - it is the right of everyone who needs help.
Our intention must be to show solidarity and we must demonstrate our commitment to helping effectively.
Mr President, once again the people of Mozambique are the victims of terrible floods: half a million people have been affected, with 80 thousand people displaced, dozens of people dead or disappeared and considerable material damage, particularly in the provinces of Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezi.
In addition to destroying infrastructures, these floods are causing a shortage of drinking water and food as well as a real danger of epidemics as serious and deadly as the floods themselves.
The tragedy and the scale of this disaster are such that the Mozambican authorities cannot act efficiently or in isolation to resolve their serious economic, social and public health problems, particularly because Mozambique is a very poor country.
The European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament, cannot turn their backs upon this tragedy, nor must we limit ourselves to simply expressing our sympathy.
We therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to increase emergency aid to Mozambique, and to coordinate their aid in conjunction with third countries and multilateral organisations.
We call upon the Member States to define a structural aid programme for Mozambique, within the Council and together with the Commission. We also urge the international community to be unstinting in its efforts to allocate human and material resources, to mobilise the emergency aid which is so necessary, to adopt economic and financial measures to contribute to the reconstruction of the regions that have been affected and to revive Mozambique' s economy, which has been so badly hit.
Humanitarian disaster in Mongolia
Mr President, images of Mongolia, this distant country, which has only 2.7 million inhabitants, spread across an immense territory of 1.5 million square kilometres, swept by icy winds, with its population of nomadic shepherds who have lost hope and who expect the worst, and with its flocks dying of cold and hunger, these images that we see on television are striking and moving.
It is crucial and pressing that we support and help this slightly mythical country that has achieved the miracle of establishing democratic life in an environment which is seen to be so hostile.
In addition to the intrinsic value of development aid and of immediate assistance to Mongolia, both to its human and animal populations, we must cherish an extraordinary democratic experiment which proves that democracy knows no boundaries, be they physical, geographical, religious, cultural or of lifestyle, given that many of Mongolia' s inhabitants live a nomadic existence.
This is a good cause, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Commission and the European Union to adopt.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Lage has just said, Mongolia is certainly the country of the former Soviet Union which has made the most progress in establishing democracy and the rule of law. Unfortunately, it is also a country that seems to have been completely abandoned by the gods.
During the winter of 1999-2000, it experienced extremely harsh conditions with temperatures falling to -50Âº centigrade. It experienced the same conditions this year after an intervening drought last summer.
All this has led to the death of millions of head of livestock.
Livestock is Mongolia' s chief resource. No doubt you read in yesterday afternoon' s edition of the newspaper, Le Monde, that, in addition to these scourges, Mongolia has been hit by foot-and-mouth disease.
It is easy to imagine the damage that may cause in a country whose economy is based primarily on the rearing of livestock.
In point 8 of its legislative programme last year, the Commission pledged substantial emergency aid to Mongolia.
So far, it has only allocated a small amount of this aid.
It has sent just a few hundred thousand dollars to add to the few hundred thousand dollars from other donor countries, which include Israel and the People' s Republic of China.
Mongolia needs USD eight million.
It is therefore crucial that the Commission' s pledges match the scale of the catastrophe that has now struck Mongolia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at one time, the Mongolian nomadic armies under the command of Genghis Khan instilled fear across the world.
Today, the remote descendants of these feared hordes are condemned to abject poverty.
Two harsh winters in succession will probably spell the end of a nation of shepherds and of economic developments in Mongolia.
I hope that this debate will break through the indifference of the international community.
In mid-January, I, together with Mr Maat, received the Prime Minister of Mongolia.
We were taken with the openness and determination he displayed in approaching our Parliament.
I would remind the Commission of the wish Parliament expressed last year to grant Mongolia the necessary emergency aid.
Commissioner, I beg you, please grant Mongolia more structural aid and economic assistance through ECHO and TACIS.
I will be much obliged to you.
Mr President, Mongolia is developing into the democratic pearl of Central Asia.
Without oil or other minerals, it is trying to gain a foothold in the new globalising economy.
The country is making a name for itself in the world of sports, as was evident recently in the skating event in my own country, and it deals with political landslides well, as was apparent from the most recent elections.
In the tough fight for a place in the world, the country is, for the second year running, afflicted by extreme cold after a summer which was too dry.
One hundred thousand families and twelve million cattle are on the brink of starvation.
That problem is made still worse by the fact that, in the past, Mongolia used to supply countries like Russia and Finland with large amounts of beef.
The accession of Finland to the European Union closed off the Finnish market to a large degree, and massive European food aid to Russia meant that Mongolia was sidelined on that market too.
The European Union thus owes Mongolia something.
The ECHO funds are appropriate here, and it would be to the European Union' s credit if more TACIS funds were to be spent on stimulating this democratic rarity in Central Asia.
Democratically speaking, too, a good example will be keenly followed.
I would also like to find out from the Commission what concrete steps it intends to take in terms of ECHO funding, extra funding and emergency aid, but also - and mainly - by way of democratic encouragement of that country through making extra funding available to it through the TACIS programme, possibly in advance of the 2002 budget.
I feel I am in good company with Mr Staes, but also with our Vice-President, Mr Wiebenga, who is also committed to this region.
Commissioner, as far as this matter is concerned, you could make many people a lot happier this afternoon.
I can vouch for the fact that I too was impressed with the determination and democratic outlook of Mongolia' s Vice-Premier, whom I received on behalf of Mrs Fontaine.
Mr President, first on the Mozambique flood situation, the Commission is following the current flood situation in Mozambique closely and is deeply concerned by the numbers of displaced people and by the loss of life which has already occurred.
I agree with what many of you have said: that this country has really suffered more than his reasonable in recent decades.
The Commission's humanitarian aid office, ECHO, is in close contact with the Commission's delegation in Mozambique and also with governmental and non-governmental organisations in the country.
The Commission's assessment confirms the need for new humanitarian aid intervention in Mozambique.
Initial funding to the tune of EUR 2 million is currently being prepared.
The evolution of the situation is being closely monitored.
The Commission intervenes most appropriately from the relief phase onwards as search-and-rescue at such a distance is most effectively done by the South African and Mozambican air forces.
The Commission's role can then be complementary after the initial phase.
The neighbouring countries of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe are also affected by the abnormally heavy rainfall.
The situation in Mozambique is likely to persist for several weeks as water continues to be discharged from the Kariba and Cabora Bassa dams.
Food shortages are likely to continue until at least autumn this year even if there is no more heavy rain.
WFP estimates they are already feeding 80 000 people and are preparing to feed up to 150 000.
The Commission pledged a package of aid totalling EUR 73.5 million to the reconstruction programme after the year 2000 floods including a total of EUR 10 million from ECHO funds.
EUR 63.5 million has been committed, of which EUR 23 million has actually been disbursed.
As to Mongolia, ECHO, in line with its mandate, is providing humanitarian relief to the people affected by the extreme weather conditions in Mongolia since last year.
Last year, ECHO allocated almost EUR 2 million of emergency relief to address the basic food needs of the most vulnerable families affected by the severe 1999-2000 winter and the subsequent summer drought in Mongolia.
In 2001, in response to the appeal for international assistance by the Mongolian government and based on the humanitarian needs assessment by FAO and Red Cross Family, ECHO has launched an emergency funding decision of EUR 1 million.
This decision, currently in the pipeline for adoption, foresees the distribution of food, agriculture inputs and medical items to the most vulnerable strata of society in the affected provinces.
The aid will be provided by the International Federation of the Red Cross and two ECHO partners, Save the Children from the UK and Premier Urgence of France.
ECHO is closely monitoring the general situation in the country to identify potential further needs for humanitarian aid.
I now give the floor to Mr Maat.
Mr President, I do not wish to re-open the debate, but a number of delegates have explicitly raised some questions regarding structural investments using more TACIS funding, also in the light of the special democratisation process which is unfolding in Mongolia.
The Commissioner has not commented on this at all.
I believe that justice would be done to Parliament if he were to devote a few words to this topic.
I am having a quick look in the direction of the Commissioner, since we are not really short of time.
I notice the Commissioner would like to briefly go into this point.
Mr President, I am not in a hurry at all.
I am here the whole evening.
But on the questions, which are totally pertinent, I am not in a position to give, let us say, improvised replies, I will transmit all your questions to my colleagues who are responsible for these matters and they will then inform the honourable Members of Parliament.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended until 5.30 p.m.)
Assistants' statute
The next item is the oral question (B5-0010/2001) by Mr Rocard to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the Commission' s proposal for an Assistants' Statute.
I call on the author of this question, Mr Rocard, to introduce the subject.
Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is competent 'to protect the conditions of life and work, including the work environment' . This fine definition authorises us, therefore, to examine the situation of our assistants.
Indeed it obliges us to do so. It would be odd if the committee I have the honour of chairing were responsible for all workers in Europe, the sole exception being the assistants in the European Parliament.
That has, in fact, been the strange situation up to the present time.
Far be it from me, however, to trespass on the competencies of the specific bodies of the European Parliament!
That is why, Commissioner, when we heard the representatives of the assistants, we did it in the presence and with the cooperation of Vice-President Onesta, who was instructed by the Bureau of our Parliament to deal with these problems.
Now the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to make its contribution to the quest for innovative solutions.
Most of our colleagues are fully familiar with the problems faced by the assistants, which range from job insecurity to the difficulties of legal establishment on Belgian territory, where many of them live.
The Bureau of the European Parliament has already taken a crucial internal decision designed to improve transparency in the management of secretarial allowances, which was mentioned in Mr Onesta' s report.
I welcome this decision.
It will enable assistants to have an employment contract in the prescribed form, social security cover, which not all of them have, and occupational accident insurance.
There are, however, other problems that have not been resolved.
These relate essentially to the specific situation of assistants, who are de facto cross-border workers, without their rights as such being recognised.
That is why the expert study commissioned by the European Commission contemplated using existing European legislation on the free circulation of workers and to incorporate into it the specific situation of parliamentary assistants.
This solution appears both realistic and reasonable.
It is realistic because much vaunted Regulation No1408/71, which all my parliamentary colleagues are familiar with and which governs the free circulation of workers, students and pensioners, etc, is not a text which has been set in stone.
For more than five years it has been subjected by the Council to a process of simplification, dusting-down and improvement, which is to be wound up under the Belgian Presidency. At least that is what the European Parliament hopes.
This year we are being presented with amendments to the text.
During the last part-session I think I understood correctly that a large number of my fellow Members wanted a general overhaul of the text rather than just technical improvements.
Nonetheless, in February we approved the last amendment that both the Council and the Commission asked us to approve.
In other words this text could easily be modified and adapted to the situation of the assistants and it could enable them to choose the country of establishment when it comes to matters of social security payments and it could guarantee their other rights to social protection.
This realistic solution is also reasonable.
The Council wanted the European Parliament to reform its relations with its assistants in the name of transparency.
This first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which I have referred.
It does not wish to tackle tax issues.
Recourse to Regulation No 1408/71 does not make this necessary.
Fine!
The Council does not want to give assistants the status of officials.
This is not what we are asking - it is very different. What we want is simply to guarantee their fundamental rights to social protection.
In other words, all the conditions have now been met and we can now make real headway in this area. That is the reason, Commissioner, for our question to the Commission, which has always expressed its determination to make headway in this area hand-in-hand with the European Parliament.
The Commission has the political initiative, but we now ask it to make use of it and to formally present a proposal to amend Regulation No 1408/71 by adding a simple subparagraph covering the situation of the assistants.
It is then up to the Council to shoulder its responsibilities and to decide whether or not to keep our assistants and ourselves in a state of legal and social uncertainty.
The European Parliament has already embarked on internal work to set the ball rolling.
The way forward depends on the normal legislative process.
It is up to the Commission to put forward a proposal now and Parliament will then be able to complete its work to issue internal regulations to deal with the question of the assistants.
That is the thinking behind our question to the Commission.
Within what timeframe, Commissioner, will this crucial text be proposed?
The best solution would be before the start of the Belgian Presidency, since our assistants work in Belgium.
It is a pressing matter, Commissioner, and it also affects the ethics and image of our Parliament.
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the matter of assistants to Members of the European Parliament.
In 1998 the Commission, with Parliament's agreement, drew up a proposal to amend the conditions of employment for other staff so that Parliamentary assistants would become auxiliary staff.
I happened to be the Commissioner responsible at the time.
This would have ensured equal treatment for assistants in terms of their salary, employment conditions and tax, with a choice of a social security system.
As you know, however, this proposal was not accepted by the Council.
By agreement with the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission then commissioned an expert study with various solutions that would be compatible with Community law and the interests of the assistants and the Members of Parliament.
The experts suggested that one aspect of the assistants' legal status could be dealt with by another Community instrument, namely Regulation No 1408/71, which coordinates the social security schemes of the Member States.
The assistants are already covered by this regulation and it brings them, in principle, under the social security system of the Member State where they work.
Vice-President Onesta has contacted my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, suggesting that the Commission puts forward a proposal to the Council and Parliament for an amendment to this regulation, allowing assistants to chose between the Member State where they work, the Member State where they were last insured or the Member State of which they are a national.
A similar option is already available to auxiliary staff of the institutions.
Such an amendment would only resolve a very specific and small part of the assistants' legal position and would not exonerate them from the obligations of national law in regard to labour conditions, tax and social security.
However, the Commission has committed itself to finding solutions which are in the interests of both assistants and Members of Parliament.
The suggested amendment can indeed clarify the legal position of the assistants as far as their social security rights are concerned.
It seems that the application of Regulation No 1408/71 to this category of workers still gives rise to uncertainty, which can be removed by the amendment.
Once they have made a choice there should be no further misunderstanding as to which Member State 's system they are subject to.
Moreover, it seems justified to derogate from the general rules of the regulation for persons working on a temporary basis for members of Community institutions, such as auxiliary staff.
My draft then reads as follows: 'Therefore the Commission intends to propose shortly to Parliament and Council the suggested amendment to Regulation No 1408/71' .
If asked what 'shortly' means, I can say that it will be before the summer.
That means that this issue can be decided during the Belgian Presidency.
Mr President, since the first direct elections in 1979 I have taken part in all part-sessions of our European Parliament here in Strasbourg from Mondays to Fridays, fifteen of those years as assistant to our unforgotten colleague Otto von Habsburg and now for seven years as a Member of Parliament.
Before this, I dealt with this subject as a journalist for a daily newspaper, so I think I know the subject from all three sides that are particularly involved here.
I would therefore like to say that I welcome the fact that with our provisional arrangement we have found something that both preserves flexibility and affords security and that the Court of Auditors has also accepted as a sensible and workable system, although I do have a problem with changing the contract basis in mid-period.
I think that should really always be settled at the start of the period.
Now we are looking at the final assistants' statute, and we naturally welcome such an assistants' statute.
But I would like to sound a warning against excessive bureaucracy and inflexibility.
There are rumoured to be plans for all assistants to be subject to Belgian law.
That would not only be a problem for the many staff we maintain in our constituencies, because the very purpose of that is to strengthen feedback to the constituency, but it would also fail to take account of the structure of our Parliament' s work, because following the Council' s decision this House has its seat in Strasbourg and holds its plenary sessions here.
As a result, it is often more sensible for Members from southern Germany and from France, for example, to employ an assistant for Strasbourg and for their constituency than to bring the Brussels assistant to Strasbourg.
Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament.
There is therefore no point in making assistants who work here, for example, subject to Belgian law.
Brussels is an important place of work, but it is just a place of work, like Luxembourg.
I therefore believe the system must be flexible, that there must be a freedom of choice here that does justice both to Parliament' s three places of work, to the seat in Strasbourg and to the need for constituency work.
I therefore believe that the Council, Commission and Parliament must find an arrangement that gives our assistants security but which, as I said, takes account of this Parliament' s specific working conditions, which it did not set for itself, and which enables Members to make arrangements under the laws of the Member State where they were elected or to use an arrangement that does equal justice to their manner, structure and style of work and to the legitimate social interests of our assistants.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I think we can congratulate ourselves on having brought a question before this House today which has been pending for far too long.
It is impossible not to be surprised at this inability to resolve a precarious situation which affects the parliamentary assistants, people who assist us on a daily basis, whilst we are competent to legislate on certain aspects of the conditions of life and work of all the citizens of the fifteen Member States?
It is in fact a question of finding solutions to crucial and fundamental issues concerning social protection, the employment statute, occupational accidents and all the issues of social cover with which we are so familiar, so that we can deal with them in relation to all the workers in the fifteen Member States.
It is also a question of making an effort to clarify the definition of their working conditions, which, I admit, are rather the preserve of internal meetings.
This issue has been raised over a very long period of time by our group and, as we have just been reminded, by other groups as well.
During the previous legislative period of the European Parliament, proposals to formalise the statute came up against the reluctance of the Council to turn assistants into officials and to include the tax dimension of the problem in the equation.
I think that today, however, we should be clear about what our objectives are.
These demands are now no longer written in this way in the agenda.
It is clear that we do not want to turn our assistants into Community officials, just as it would be out of place to want to link the issue of the assistants' statute to that of Members of Parliament.
Why, as was expressed so well by Mr Rocard, do you vie with each other to complicate an issue where the stakes are so clear and so legitimate, and which may find solutions in procedures that are perfectly ordinary, accessible and simple?
The real issue today is to see how the Commission is going to follow up the work, which it asked an expert to carry out on this matter.
It is true that the recent developments introduced by the Bureau of the European Parliament - the provision of contracts in the prescribed form and documents testifying to membership of a social security system and of an occupation accident insurance scheme - are good decisions, but the matter does not end there. It would be extremely important, for instance, to be able to check the information which is gathered.
However, the proposal put forward to regard our assistants as genuine cross-border workers so that they can consequently have recourse to Regulation No 1408/71, to which we just have to add a subparagraph in order to cover them, seems entirely appropriate.
Commissioner, our assistants expect the Commission to take the initiative.
The Belgian Presidency would be doing itself credit by bringing this affair to a successful conclusion. However, Commissioner, you have just told us that proposals will be forthcoming before the summer.
Thank you. We look forward to them.
We thank you above all on behalf of all the assistants who work in this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, if I may begin on a personal note it is now nearly two years since I was campaigning on an election platform that stressed the need for proper statutes for Members and their assistants.
It is extremely embarrassing to have to admit to the public at home just how slow progress has been where both statutes are concerned.
Of the two, I am more embarrassed in respect of the assistants' statute because this is a case where as MEPs we are directly responsible in matters affecting the lives of others.
My group is grateful to the Commission for its approach to Professor Vandersanden and for the proposals that he has made.
We have not yet discussed in detail his substantive suggestions as to what should be done within the Parliament's own rules of procedure.
We may therefore find ourselves disagreeing with these suggestions in various respects.
We do however believe that his methodology which distinguishes between what might be achieved under these rules and what actually requires legislation are a promising route forward.
We are very glad to hear of the outcome of the trialogue and the Commission's statement today promising proposals for the revision of Regulation No 1408/71.
We would add however that whatever scheme is ultimately adopted, and by whatever means, it must have certain characteristics.
First, it must be simple.
It must be simple both in terms of clarity and in terms of its administration.
Second, it must provide the legal certainty.
This means that it must be comprehensive in its coverage of the employment relationship.
This need not mean rigidity and uniformity.
It means only that, for example, all assistants must be properly covered for any accidents occurring to them in the course of their work.
Third, it must be transparent.
In my own personal view we should be trying to move towards a system where there is equal pay for work of equal value.
Given though that assistants may be employed in a number of different locations and have different tasks to perform, this may be difficult to achieve.
We should at least however seek to ensure that no one is allowed to fall below a certain minimum and that the reasons for any differentials are clear.
I believe that in the long term there can be no substitute for a proper statute but we do at least now have an initial path to follow.
I hope that we move down it as rapidly as we can.
In case you are not already aware, may I inform you that the presidency has charged Vice-President Onesta with the task of carrying the assistants' statute forward on behalf of the presidency.
Without wishing to pre-empt him, I would like to say that we are all very pleased with his personal commitment to the matter.
We are therefore especially looking forward to what Mr Onesta will say to us.
Mr President, thank you. Thank you too Mr Rocard, in your role as chairman of the specialist committee, for speaking to you, Commissioner, on behalf of the European Parliament, because it is clear that, as concerns this statute, we are moving very slowly.
Our Parliament has been in existence for so many years yet we are still trying to settle this issue, which should have been taken off the agenda years ago.
You have given us some good news.
The pace is to be speeded up.
We can all rejoice at that.
What is the current state of play?
The Council asked us to abandon the route towards turning our assistants into officials.
We complied.
We withdrew this document, which had caused the Council so many problems, from the negotiating table.
The Council asked Parliament to get rid of any reference to taxation.
We complied, and the assistants themselves acknowledge that they are prepared to relinquish any reference to taxation as long as they get a proper statute.
The Council also asked us to take all the necessary measures to ensure transparency and, as our fellow Members have reminded us, everything is in hand.
In a few weeks' time, no Member of Parliament we will be able to have access to their budget line to pay their assistants if they have not first made an appropriate declaration to the parliamentary services - and I did my duty as an employer this afternoon. They will therefore not have access to their budget line until they have handed in a copy of all their contracts, in the prescribed form, together with proof that their assistants have full social cover and are well protected in the event of an occupational accident.
Finally, in a few weeks' time, the whole of Europe will know the names of our assistants.
We are really going to come out into the open, because, at present, no Member of Parliament is able to provide the list of all those people who work so hard to ensure that the European Community functions properly.
So, here we are.
We have taken the steps we were asked to take.
We would not understand it if, now, the Commission did not do what it always said it would do in the many varied contacts we have had, that it was ready, when the time came, to take the decisive step to finally enable us to have a legal basis to take us forward.
We would not understand it if, once this step had been taken by the Commission, the Council, which has always told us, whether it be under the Finnish Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency, the French Presidency and now the Swedish Presidency, that it too was ready to do its bit, did nothing.
Parliament has done its bit. It is now up to the other institutions to do theirs.
What can be done?
I believe that the report by Mr Vandersanden, which you, Commissioner, masterminded and circulated, is a good working base.
Modifying Regulation No 1408/71 is the right thing to do because then we will have something simple and consistent and we will finally be able to give our assistants a statute which does not suffer from any legal debate.
It is not a question of seeking to harmonise social protection systems, but simply to coordinate policies, which amending this regulation will allow.
Let no one tell us that this is complicated, even though unanimity is required in Council. Since 1997, it has been possible to make no fewer than five amendments to this regulation and always unanimously.
Give us a legal basis.
In the working group I lead, in which all the political groups are represented, Parliament is finally debating this issue with a united voice.
All the political groups are united in asking you to take this decisive step.
Of course, once you have taken this decisive step and, we hope, the Council has followed your example, we will not have a real assistants' statute.
There will still not be a code of ethics, a collective agreement and a system of equalisation to ensure fairness amongst all assistants, as my colleague from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party said, where there is equal pay for work of equal value.
This system of fairness can be introduced in the form of an equalisation fund at the level of the European Parliament.
Give us this legal basis and we will do the rest.
We need you to take this decisive step.
Our fellow Members have said so.
Legality, simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection are called for.
If you give us legality, we will guarantee simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection.
Mr President, Commissioner, I fully agree with what Mr Onesta has just said.
For too long now our parliamentary assistants have worked without being protected by a statute.
Although the vast majority of Members of Parliament have guaranteed them correct working and salary conditions, it must be acknowledged that the practices of a number of our colleagues has somewhat tarnished the image of the European Parliament.
The lack of control and transparency in the management of secretarial allowances paved the way for abuse.
And, as Jacques Loyau, President of the Association of Assistants, deplored at the time, in the absence of a safeguard, everything was possible and there were considerable disparities.
A survey carried out by the Association of Assistants more than a year ago highlighted a worrying situation.
Fourteen per cent did not have a contract of employment; 12% had only external consultant contracts, even though they worked full time, and 53% did not have any social cover or accident insurance.
This survey served as the basis for the action taken by the parliamentary assistants and their Association, which our group supported from its beginnings.
Some initial results were obtained within the European Parliament with the adoption, by the Bureau, of the amendment to Article 14 of the rules on the costs and allowances of Members of Parliament.
As our President, Nicole Fontaine, stressed at the time that the matter of the assistants had made significant and concrete headway and that the transitory measures which had been adopted reflected the will and determination of the European Parliament to move towards greater transparency and fairness in this area..
These measures, which came into force on 1 January this year, have indeed enabled us to strengthen our control over the use of the secretarial allowance and to guarantee each assistant a contract of employment, health insurance and occupation accident insurance.
This progress, which has been made thanks to the perseverance of the Association of Assistants and to the efficient work of our Vice-President, GÃ©rard Onesta, served as a base for our negations with the Council.
However, as we have heard, for months now, despite our best efforts, this matter seems to have been deadlocked.
I am therefore very interested to hear that an agreement has been reached in principle between the Commission and the European Parliament to amend the free movement of workers regulation along the lines the assistants would like to see.
I welcome this.
It seems that the way is now clear for us to be able to move forwards very soon towards a European statute whereby, in the words Parliament chose in its opinion of 11 March 1999, assistants are treated equally and in accordance with the work they carry out.
Mr President, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Liikanen, Mr Rocard and Vice-President Onesta for their input today and for all the hard work they have done to date.
Naturally, that does not mean that Members are not first and foremost responsible for their assistants' having sound labour contracts, including social security, good working conditions and insurance policies.
It is primarily up to us to put proper arrangements in place. Unfortunately, we have now discovered that we have failed in this respect, and that there is now an extra need for a sound statute for our assistants.
The EDD Group is lending its unqualified support to the assistants' legitimate wishes.
I would like to make one final remark in this connection.
Vast discrepancies between the EP permanent staff, the temporary staff of the groups and the assistants are not justified, particularly as they, to a large extent, do the same type of work.
The Council should perhaps reconsider precisely what now constitute unjustified discrepancies.
Indeed, we must repudiate discrimination at all times.
The freedom of assistants to choose the social system under which they want to work is of great importance, in my view.
I would, however, like to concur with Mr Posselt who has warned against too much red tape.
It is already very complex and time-consuming to act in the correct manner.
Members should also have the freedom to employ assistants in their own Member States or in Brussels, and we should not be restricted in this choice in future.
Mr President, I have some speaking time left, but Commissioner Liikanen has managed to reassure me to a great extent.
I wish him a lot of success and hope that the activities will indeed be completed before the summer.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt thanks go to Mr Rocard for bringing up the issue of the assistants' statute again in his oral question.
He was right to raise the matter again, authoritatively, clearly and incontrovertibly, since Parliament has repeatedly made commitments on the issue.
I would also stress, in addition to the indisputable nature of these commitments, the role of the socialists who, particularly within the Committee on Budgets, have fought on the front line every year to ensure that these commitments are included in the budget lines, and they will do so on this occasion with regard to this operation too.
This evening, the Bureau and the Vice-President and Commissioner Liikanen have made somewhat significant commitments.
These commitments are a step in the right direction although they are still not a full response.
We need to provide a definitive, comprehensive response dealing with national insurance contributions, tax and salaries, and the rights and responsibilities associated with an - albeit temporary - position.
There is a need for swift action, for it is our duty to ensure the greatest possible transparency and total legality of a relationship, certain aspects of which still make a mockery of respect for workers' rights and the principles which we desire to uphold for all and which we must protect, especially for those who work with us.
It is our duty to guarantee respect for the dignity of these professionals who, moreover, make a valuable, high-quality contribution to our work.
Mr President, I believe that this is the first time that the debate on assistants to Members of the European Parliament has had the honour of being discussed in the open, in other words, in a plenary sitting.
I therefore wish to begin by welcoming in particular the initiative presented here by our colleague, Mr Rocard, to bring into the open a debate which must be conducted with the utmost transparency.
Ladies and gentlemen, from a personal point of view, I would even argue for a common statute for parliamentary assistants based on the categories currently laid down in the Staff Regulations.
The revision proposed as a joke by Commissioner Kinnock might even be a good opportunity to lay down a decision of this type.
In any event, I suspect that we are a long way from that point.
We must therefore do the best with what we have and with solutions which may be enshrined in European instruments, such as the Staff Regulations, but which represent only one possible approach towards a future European statute.
We all know that the new rules adopted by Parliament on the situation of parliamentary assistants are nothing more than internal regulations.
We must ensure the transparency of the contracts, public recruitment procedures, the requirement for an effective system of social protection and the payment of tax in each of the Member States.
These rules are an expression of our political will but they also reveal the weakness of Parliament' s powers to regulate an entire statute for parliamentary assistants, which involves, of course, much more than just these issues.
In any event, now that these rules have been agreed on, I am sure that there is a broad majority in this House, and this can be seen in the Bureau, in the Contact Group and in the speeches that have been made here, that wishes the Council to frame in law what is already being practised, affecting only our institutions, through an amendment to Regulation No 1408/71, which is a general rule covering migrant workers.
Ultimately, by means of the amended base Regulation which applies to all the Member States, we want parliamentary assistants to be given the right, as migrant workers, to be able to choose to be governed by the legislation of the country that is most relevant to their work, which is divided between Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the country of origin of the Member of the European Parliament for whom they work.
We have been informed today, by Commissioner Liikanen, that the Commission is, at last, going to get the ball rolling on this dossier.
We will then begin to emerge from the tunnel in which we are stuck if the Belgian Presidency manages to close this dossier.
Later, if the Belgian Presidency is successful, we will have to conclude the work.
That, however, Mr President, is simply a matter of tidying up loose ends.
Mr President, Commissioner, everything has been said.
When the European Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took the decision to put this question to you, it had three objectives.
The first was to assure our assistants publicly that this matter was being taken on board by the European Parliament.
We have done that.
The second was to make sure that the Commission, which itself had commissioned the expert, Mr Vandersanden, was prepared to capitalise on its work and to follow it up by taking precise administrative action.
You have pledged to do this.
Our third objective was to have a timetable, which was particularly related to the fact that the Belgian Presidency was just around the corner and that the problem essentially concerned Belgian social security.
The Belgian Presidency must therefore deal with this matter, it cannot escape it, but the preparatory work must be done first.
You have just given that assurance, for which I thank you.
Just now, our fellow Member, Mr Pittella, justifiably called on us to arrive at a full and final solution to the problem of the assistants, and he was right to do so.
We all know, however, that this will take time and it will involve a number of different stages and much effort. We need the involvement of the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
We can, though, only do our work once you have done yours. The essential stage is always the next one.
Thank you for pledging to help us get through it.
I thank Parliament for this very clear message.
I will pass this on to my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou and also to President Prodi to guarantee that our internal procedures will be fast enough so that when the Belgian presidency is in office the proposal is on the table.
We normally expect the Commissioner to speak for 10 minutes, but today he has spoken for only 10 seconds.
We are therefore in a position of having to suspend the sitting until voting starts.
Mr Posselt on the rules of procedure.
Mr President, I know that speaking times can never be planned precisely, but it has quite often been the case that we have had a break after the urgent debate, and now we have one again before the vote.
In this afternoon' s urgent debate our group, the largest in the House, had only 12 minutes to share out, apart from the minutes allowed to the proposers.
It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone.
We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues.
In light of this experience, I would therefore ask that the groups in future be given a little more speaking time in urgent debates than is currently the case.
The present method of calculation is clearly not altogether realistic.
Mr President, I am sure that you would agree that one of the functions of any politician is to lead by example.
This morning I had occasion to use the tram system in Strasbourg for the first time.
I was very impressed by the system, which I suppose it is not surprising, since the trams were actually built in the United Kingdom.
But it does seem somewhat ironic to me that we have been voting in this place all week to save the planet but we still ride around Strasbourg in our chauffeur-driven Mercedes.
Could Parliament perhaps consider giving Members detailed instructions on how to use the tram system and the routes that are available, and maybe even give us a couple of complimentary tickets to get us started.
It is an excellent system and, incidentally, we could save the taxpayers some money by using it.
Ladies and gentlemen, please take the rules of procedure seriously.
Mr President, I should just like to point out that some of us are very environmentally friendly.
We actually walk in.
That is even healthier!
VOTE
According to the agenda, we shall now proceed to the vote on urgent subjects.
Before the vote on Kalimantan:
Mr President, I wish to speak very briefly in order to draw the Bureau' s attention to item 4 and to point out the contradiction between what we have just voted for, which is that our resolution should be conveyed to the leaders of the Liberation Front of the Enclave of Cabinda and of the Renewed LFEC, and the - in our view - hasty action, which could have serious humanitarian consequences, which we consider to be deplorable, of expelling certain individuals from the European Parliament buildings on the allegation that they may belong to the LFEC, to whom the Bureau has undertaken to transmit the resolution for which we voted.
I shall be writing to the President of this Parliament to express my concern at this action.
We take note of that, but it is customary in this House for the texts of resolutions to be distributed to all who are mentioned in them.
Before the vote on light weapons:
Mr President, as I said earlier in the debate, and after consulting all the groups who appear to have given their agreement - though this will have to be confirmed - I would be happy to table two oral amendments which do not add anything new but which were forgotten in the haste with which our work was carried out.
The first would come at the end of Recital E and would be to add: 'as well as the Bamako Declaration made by 52 Member States of the Organisation of African Unity on light weapons and small arms' .
The general opinion is that the declaration is important enough to be added. It was purely and simply omitted.
The second oral amendment would come under point 2, in the fourth sub-point, and consists of a reference to the marking of weapons. I owe it to the subtlety of our fellow Members in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for having taken this amendment on board and for having found a more appropriate place to insert it into the text, and I thank the group for that.
In other words, this amendment should be inserted after 'the manufacture' in the third line of the fourth sub-point of point 2.
It should therefore read: 'concerning, for example, the manufacture, marking, transfer and supply of small arms and light weapons' .
(Parliament had no objections to the oral amendments)
President.
That concludes our agenda for this week.
I wish you all a safe journey home.
The France' s borders are closed!
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 March.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, it is once again my sad duty to have to open this part-session with a condemnation of the ETA terrorist attacks in Spain.
As you know, since 15 March, there have unfortunately been two further additions to the intolerable list of Spanish people whose lives have been lost in these attacks.
During the night of 17 March, Santos SantamarÃ­a, who was a member of the Mossos d' Esquadra, the Catalan regional police force, was killed in a car bomb explosion in Rosas.
On 20 March, FroilÃ n Elespe Inciarte, a Socialist party municipal councillor in Lasarte, was shot twice in the head and killed.
In carrying out these murders, ETA has once again shown its total disregard for democracy and the recent threats made on tourists are examples of the same despicable behaviour.
As on each of these sad occasions, on behalf of the European Parliament and on my own behalf, I have sent our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims.
I have also sent a message of our support to the Spanish authorities.
I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 29 March 2001, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Relating to Thursday:
President.
With regard to Thursday, I have received two requests for amendments, both concerning the topical and urgent subjects of major importance and the item on human rights.
First of all, I have received a request from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to withdraw the first item entitled 'Iran' from the agenda.
Madam President, I should briefly like to explain our request.
The reason for it is not that we have become more tolerant of the situation in Iran, but that difficult discussions and negotiations are being held in Iran itself at the present time with a view to improving the lot of a number of Iranian citizens who work in the German Embassy.
I do not believe that we should now disrupt this process which is taking place in Iran, perhaps by adopting a resolution.
We have firm views on the violations of human rights, but in this case - and, I would stress, at this particular time - I do not believe that we should either hold a debate or adopt a resolution.
Does any Member wish to speak in favour of keeping this item?
There being no speaker, I shall put the request to the vote.
(Parliament gave its assent)
President.
The second request is from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to withdraw the third item entitled 'Violence towards Catholic nuns' .
