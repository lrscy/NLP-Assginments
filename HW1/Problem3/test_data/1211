Â Â  . President Ahtisaari has just started his work and is engaged in shuttle diplomacy in Belgrade, Pristina and with the international community.
Therefore, I would not like to jump the gun and predict the proposal of the UN envoy President Ahtisaari.
In my view it is better to let him work, let him consult with the different parties and then, when the time is right, try to achieve a solution with the necessary determination.
Therefore I do not think it wise to take a stand at this point on whether and in which format K-For should continue in Kosovo.
I want to say two things.
First of all it is necessary for there to be an international presence in the future too, as a security guarantee.
Second, we are starting our needs assessment work in regard to financing in Kosovo, so that we support the work of the international community and President Ahtisaari.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU action plan known as FLEGTÂ â Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and TradeÂ â focuses solely on questions of legality and does not address the broader and more complex issues of the sustainable development of forestry.
There is a clear difference between the two: legal timber can be harvested in an unsustainable way, for example through authorised land clearance; and illegal timber can come from sustainable sources, as in the case of timber harvested under indigenous management systems which are sustainable but do not comply with formal legal requirements.
In most countries, however, forest law is based on principles of sustainable development.
Accordingly, improved governance and better implementation of the law will lead to more sustainable forest management.
The partnership agreements to be concluded as part of the FLEGT action plan will also be a means of bringing together the parties concerned in order to address the broader aspects of governance in the forestry sector and, where applicable, to support the implementation of regulatory legislative reforms.
The Commission hopes that these procedures will help to improve the quality and fairness of the law and governance in the partner States.
In turn, I trust you will understand that, despite the importance attached to it, the issue of legality in the FLEGT action plan is not an end in itself but rather a means of working together with the partner States to improve governance in the forestry sector.
That being said, the EUâs FLEGT action plan is an initiative aimed at bringing about change through the commitment of the parties.
It is therefore not a good idea to impose strict social and environmental conditions on potential partners; conditions that are too strict would be detrimental to their commitment to the partnership agreements.
It is also true that, even though the EUâs FLEGT action plan places the emphasis on governance and legality, the Union remains determined to encourage sustainable forest management in developing countries.
In the past ten years, the EU has earmarked more than EURÂ 700Â million for sustainable forest management in Asia, Central Africa and South America.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I thank you for your response and some of your observations.
Obviously, cooperation with those partnership countries can be a good thing, but we all know that nothing will prevent possible partnership countries, including China, for example, from importing timber into Europe illegally via third countries anyway.
Greenpeace reported very recently that it has discovered illegal networks extending from Congo-Brazzaville to Italy, from Papua New Guinea to China and then on to Great Britain.
My question is therefore how the Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, intends to put a stop to practices of that kind?
Â Â  . The Commission naturally understands, for example, the desireÂ âÂ I have been questioned recently on this issueÂ â to see the application of a unilateral ban on illegally sourced timber.
However, we must accept that, in practice, this measure would not resolve the problem of the illegal exploitation of forests.
Firstly, by implementing a unilateral ban on importing illegally sourced timber into the Union, we would not be providing the customs authorities with an instrument enabling them to establish whether or not the wood is legally sourced.
In itself, this ban would not therefore be sufficient to prevent illegally sourced timber from entering the Union.
In order to distinguish between legally and illegally sourced timber âÂ and this is the enormous problem facing us âÂ we clearly need the full cooperation of the exporting countries.
Secondly, a ban at European level will not provide a means for dealing with the problem of governance in the producing countries.
This is why the Commission has proposed taking an approach based on establishing partnerships with the wood-producing countries.
This method will facilitate the required cooperation between the European Union and the producing countries with a view to tackling the problem of corruption and the deficiencies noted in the field of governance, which lead to the clandestine exploitation of forests.
Without redoubling and combining efforts to eradicate corruption in the wood sectors of the producing countries, the measures intended to halt the trade in illegally sourced timber associated with the clandestine exploitation of forests will have no impact.
Thirdly, the approach based on partnerships is targeted and proportional.
It will allow us to focus attention and resources on the countries most affected by this problem without affecting trade with the countries in which the clandestine exploitation of forests does not pose serious problems.
The majority of trade in wood-based products is not subject to presumptions of illegality.
That being the case, we must agree on how to react, when exchanges with non-partner countries are subject to presumptions of illegality.
This issue will be examined in more depth during a later evaluation exercise.
I would like to emphasise that the measures examined in the case of this evaluation exercise are not intended to replace the recommended voluntary approach, laid out in the FLEGT action plan, but to complement it where necessary.
I would also like to point out that we are talking about an evaluation exercise and that we have no intention of putting forward new legislative proposals at this point.
The Commission is committed to reviewing and analysing the feasibility of supplementary legislation to support the FLEGT action plan, as has been requested of me here.
As I promised, therefore, I have communicated the message to the Council.
Unfortunately, this work has been slowed down by the delays linked to the confirmation of the active participation of the Member States and by the decision that we have taken to focus the meagre resources on the implementation of the voluntary approach laid out in the action plan.
The assessment is under way and it is being carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, since many of the potential measures fall within national competence.
The options studied include the policy in the field of public procurement, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, as well as the feasibility of the practical aspects of the new legislation for controlling imports of illegally harvested wood.
I would like to end by telling you that, during the short time I was Commissioner for Research, I had the opportunity to visit the Commissionâs research centre near Milan, and I saw some extremely interesting work being done there.
This included satellite surveillance which makes it possible to monitor very closely both deforestation and reforestation.
I therefore believe that it would perhaps be useful also to assess whether this may be a tool that will enable us at least, in our political dialogue with the countries, to urge them to be rather more inclined to help us.
It is a technological resource that would allow us to monitor how this situation develops much more closely. I do not know whether you have been able to go and visit that centre, to go and see what it can do, but I can assure you that I was extremely impressed.
It is entirely possible to carry out relatively precise monitoring of the sometimes dramatic and sometimes rather more optimistic development of this situation.
Â Â  Commissioner, I am sure that Parliament wishes to strengthen your arm in terms of taking further action on the basis of the report which, under the Action Plan, was to be submitted by 2004.
One way in which we can strengthen your arm is to press for action under the very welcome summit agreement signed with China in September.
Can the Commissioner state how he thinks that will help stop the laundering of wood in China and that region?
Â Â  . Mr Bowis, unfortunately, all I can tell you is that I am taking a proactive approach and that this issue will be on the agenda when we hold talks with our partners.
I can only offer you my good intentions.
There are two things that I should like to see happen. I should firstly like the Member States, by which I mean the Council, to be a little more proactive on this issue.
I feel that it would help us if, for example, the examination of the requests we put together were not blocked, because I am not opposed to stronger legislation â far from it.
We shall have to go through this at some stage, in any event.
I then mentioned an approach, which I would classify as technical, that would at least enable pressure to be brought to bear on the partner States and, naturally, on the Member States.
What we actually need is a way â a scientific way, let us say â of identifying and classifying the origin of wood.
This is something we managed to do on a technical level with diamonds, for example; there are now perfectly accurate ways of certifying the origin of a diamond.
This is more or less the direction in which we should look to go.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, family-run forestry operations in Europe represent a convincing example of sustainable forestry practices that benefit the economy as a whole.
I would ask the Commissioner whether he thinks it would be possible to provide on-the-ground support to the countries we are debating in the form of technical advice, in order to avoid having to react after the event yet again.
You mentioned research, and this leads me to an obvious point, namely that in the future wood will continue to be a raw material used in the manufacture of many other products.
Â Â  . In all of our development programmes, it is clear that the action that you suggest in your question can fall under development projects. Furthermore it is perfectly eligible for similar projects, such as obtaining technical assistance, implants, and a number of other measures.
Naturally, we are very attentive to this aspect of the issue.
The question that you raise with regard to development projects is becoming an increasingly across-the-board one. Development projects affecting countries, regions or areas are perfectly eligible.
Indeed, a number are already underway.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly clear that there must be a substantial increase in financial resources for development if the Millennium Goals are to be achieved by 2015.
As you are aware, the EU takes a serious approach to the challenges related to mobilising the budgetary funds required to reduce poverty by half by 2015.
The EU accordingly set itself a first interim objective in 2002 of increasing development assistance in 2006.
The Union as a whole would like to achieve a level of aid corresponding to 0.39% of GNP for official development assistance.
Last May, the Council adopted proposals to begin a new phase with the aim of jointly reaching a level of 0.56% by 2010, and subsequently 0.7% of GNP by 2015.
I realise that these objectives are ambitious, but they are also realistic and have not been set by chance.
I welcome the fact that four of our Member States have already achieved that level of aid, and that six others have indicated that they are seeking to achieve it by 2015.
There is a more precise definition of the term âofficial development assistanceâ, established by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and recognised worldwide, according to which debt relief is deemed to be development assistance.
This is justified by the fact that debt relief releases funds for the purpose of helping poor countries develop that had previously been channelled into servicing that debt.
Since the Monterrey Conference on financing for development, there has been an increase in the flow of aid from the EU aimed at reaching the 2006 interim objective.
A sizeable proportion of that increase is due to debt relief measures.
According to the Monterrey Consensus, however, the debt relief initiative for highly indebted poor countries should, and I quote, âbe fully financed through additional resourcesâ.
Accordingly, the Commission indicated in its 2005 annual follow-up report on the Unionâs Monterrey undertakings that the impact of debt relief efforts on aid flows must be examined carefully.
We shall of course be keeping a watchful eye on this matter in future annual follow-up reports.
In this connection, I would point out that the EU is committed to mobilising around EURÂ 66 billion annually from 2010, which amounts to EURÂ 20Â billion more than the figure set for 2006.
In light of the amounts of assistance envisaged, the impact of debt relief on official development assistance will be limited in the short to medium term.
Â Â  Commissioner, I note that you take it as read that we will achieve the interim goal in 2006.
I would therefore ask when you will be able to submit a report on this issue, and what the consequences will be for those countries that do not achieve this goal, since if we do not achieve the first goal we will make only slow progress in achieving the second.
What additional projects, by which I mean EU cofinanced projects, do you intend to propose to help countries achieve these goals, and what will their main emphasis be?
Â Â  . Perhaps I did not make myself clear in my first speech.
I wanted to say that what has been promised for 2006 will not only be achieved but in fact surpassed.
We will be doing more in 2006 than we promised, or, to put it another way, we are slightly ahead of schedule.
In order not to lose that momentum, which is relative, I have proposed a new objective for 2010.
I think I made this clear â it is fairly realistic to think that the 2010 objective will be met.
Unfortunately, I do not have any stick with which to force Member States that backslide to honour their obligations.
That being said, I do feel that there is now an awareness of the fact that development policy is of central importance and that, whatever the circumstances, we no longer have any excuse not to honour our commitments.
As regards the Millennium commitments, there are also no more excuses.
If the will is there, the finances can be found, and I believe that the political will is indeed there.
All that remains is to turn it into action.
The next question â and this is the question you are asking â is how additional resources are to be found.
You are aware that some countries have already decided to operate a levy or to impose a surcharge on air tickets.
You are also aware that we have spoken, and continue to speak, about the Tobin tax on financial transactions, although no consensus has been reached to give the go-ahead.
I should personally like to say that I am of course open to any new ideas on the subject.
Some time ago I put forward the idea of a tax on the arms market.
Yet there is a minor moral question that comes into play: the legal arms market accounts for USDÂ 1Â thousand billion per year, whereas the illegal market is put at more than USDÂ 2Â thousand billion.
The problem is therefore whether to tax the legal arms trade while, unfortunately, the illegal market escapes?
As you know, in a few minutes Mr Rocard is set to ask a question on the creation of a worldwide lottery, an idea to which I am most open.
You will also know that the proceeds from fines paid to the Commission for non-compliance with competition rules is under discussion.
Why not set aside this money for development?
There is a whole range of options that we are currently assessing to see if they are technically feasible.
I should like to inform you that I have other ideas, albeit subject to the Member Statesâ acceptance before they can be put in place.
Most of these ideas will be neither useful nor genuinely effective if only three, four, five or six countries put them into practice.
This has to be done on a far more widespread basis.
In conclusion, I have the impression that we will be able to increase development assistance substantially in the years ahead.
Â Â  . Madam President, together with the whole of the international community, the Commission is monitoring the election process in the DRC and its organisation by the independent electoral commission very closely.
I personally carried out a mission to monitor the registration of voters at the end of August of this year with a view to observing the conditions in which that registration was being carried out.
Despite the poor state of the countryâs infrastructure, the number of voters registered to date has exceeded 21 million.
This figure is largely consistent with the demographic projections calculated on the basis of the last general population census, which is currently the most reliable statistical basis on which to work.
Voter registration is governed by a specific law establishing the conditions for registration on a voluntary basis.
Furthermore, the electoral commission had taken steps to guarantee that all registration centres were treated in the same way and that no region or zone suffered from the late opening of a centre.
To give you a quick idea of the great technical difficulty faced, I must tell you that it has been necessary to distribute more than 10Â 000 registration kits throughout Congolese territory, despite the fact that, in certain areas, there are no more tracks, there are no more roads, and that helicopters have had to be used.
You can perhaps imagine, therefore, what a huge job it is.
Furthermore, in order to prevent any danger of double registration or mass fraud as far as possible âÂ since the question mentions itÂ âÂ the electoral commission, with the endorsement of the international community, opted for voter registration on the basis of biometric data, the immediate issuing of the voterâs card, the daily posting of lists of registered voters in each registration office, the use of indelible ink and the cleaning up of voter lists on the basis of biometric data.
The Commission is supporting the organisation of the electoral process by means of a substantial contribution of EUR 149Â million via a trust fund managed by the United Nations development programme.
In this regard, it is participating actively in the steering committee of the project supporting the electoral process, which monitors the activities managed by the electoral commission within the framework of the project.
With a view to guaranteeing that the elections are carried out in accordance with international standards, the Commission has just decided to send a mission of electoral observers whose work will begin from the constitutional referendum of 18 December and will continue until the end of the electoral process.
At this point, there is no reason to suspect that there is mass fraud in the organisation and conduct of the elections.
Naturally, when I say âmassâ, I would point out that this must be viewed within the context of 22 million registrations.
This afternoon I have received figures that indicate that fraud has been noted, that some of it is deliberate, that in some cases it is not clear whether it is deliberate, and that mistakes have also been made.
People who work on this type of registration are generally Congolese citizens who have been trained by the company that has provided the kits and, when millions of people are being registered, we must of course expect a percentage of purely technical errors and handling errors.
When a mistake is made with a name, once the machine has registered it, it cannot be removed straight away.
Nevertheless, work can be done at central level.
It is there that any duplications among these 22 million or so people who are registered at the moment are going to be eliminated.
We may therefore assume that, once these duplications have been dealt with, there will undoubtedly be around 21 to 22Â million voters legally registered, with no duplications.
In the event that irregularities that are sufficiently serious to jeopardise the transparency, credibility and representativeness of the process are noted by the mission of electoral observers, in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is prepared to hold an enhanced political dialogue with a view to identifying corrective measures.
That is not the case at the moment, we are far from that.
I shall give you the figures.
The results of the deduplicationÂ âÂ to use that very inelegant termÂ âÂ for the operational area of Kinshasa have been presented today at the meeting of the technical committee on the electoral process.
Of a total of 2Â 963Â 101 voters registered in Kinshasa, 150Â 000 cases of duplications have been identified.
There are 18Â 587 cases of technical duplicationsÂ âÂ which is what I was just talking about, handling errorsÂ â 10Â 490 cases of fraud and 121Â 000 cases of potential fraud.
The total number of duplications therefore represents around 5% of the total number of registered voters.
With regard to the percentage of fraudulent duplications, it should be borne in mind that, once a duplication has been identified, each case does not involve one person, but at least two.
That is why, even when we add up the cases of fraud and cases of potential fraud, there will be 2% of fraud at the most amongst the total number of cases registered.
The figures relating to cases of potential fraud will be made known during next week, as well as the result of the deduplication for Lower Congo.
So everything is going to be cleaned up at central level and there should therefore be an entirely correct general electoral list, with no fraud, so that it will be possible in any event to say that this election, if it takes place, will be conducted on an entirely correct basis in terms of registered voters.
I have also been able to observe how it was working on the ground, and I must tell you that it was rather impressive.
All of those people who were registering and who wanted to register, who were very happy to do so, effectively were being given the opportunity for the first time to enjoy a legal status in relation to their State.
For the first time they received a voterâs card which, to a certain extent, also served as an identity card, which was something new for those people who had never had any real papers.
All of this was very impressive to see and the fact that more than 22 million voters have been able to register under those conditionsÂ âÂ it is not yet entirely complete, since there are a few days leftÂ â is a very great success, a success also for the international community and in particular for the European Union, which has worked very hard to support the process.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your encouraging and highly technical comments.
You are aware that development aid cannot be truly effective unless there are minimum levels of democracy and rule of law.
I would like to put a supplementary question about freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
We are aware of a number of events that demonstrate that there are considerable difficulties in this field, which involve journalists and a number of members of the opposition attempting to express their views.
Voter lists are one thing, but freedom of expression is quite another.
Could you provide us with more information about what the Commission would do in the event that abuse is observed?
Â Â  . The level of political dialogue that we have achieved with the Congolese authorities would allow us, if necessary, to intervene and certainly convince them to change course.
With regard to freedom of the press, Mrs Aubert, I do not know whether you have been following the Congolese press on the ground.
If you like, I can supply you with a number of newspapers, including all the newspapers that appear on a daily basis in Kinshasa and other towns.
I must tell you that, as a whole, the Congolese press is characterised by a degree of freedom of expression, a freedom to make accusations against anybody they likeÂ âÂ which are sometimes at my expense, by the wayÂ âÂ which is found in few democracies.
So if there is one area in which truly substantial progress has been made, it is the freedom of the press, though there is plenty to say about other issues, in particular governance.
For journalists in Kinshasa and elsewhere, there is complete freedom of expression.
I must point out that their particular positions do not matter.
The accusation is entirely unfounded and, therefore, while I am not saying that all of the press is like this, I can tell you that the press can criticise anybody, whether it be the President or anybody else.
So, with regard to freedom of the press in Congo, I believe that it is not a problem.
There are other problems, enormous problems, but, to be absolutely frank, I do not have the feeling that there are problems in relation to this particular issue.
With regard to the opposition, I must tell you that, for my part, at the moment and for quite some time, I have not heard of any member of the opposition being prevented from taking part in the elections or, for example, from creating a political party, provided that they conform to the criteria, of course.
I do not believe so.
What I am saying does not mean that everything is perfect.
We must simply bear in mind the progress made.
I have been following the Congo problem for many years, particularly in my other capacity, and I must point out that, over recent years, we have never been so close to having the opportunity to lead that country towards free and democratic elections, and to provide it with a degree of stability.
It is my fervent hope that the Constitution will be ratified at the end of December and that the election will take place from March or April, in accordance with the latest timescale set.
I have not said that I am indulging in blind optimism.
I am simply saying that we have never been so close to achieving the minimum conditions for restoring stability in Congo.
It is true that I am extremely committed to this issue because I believe that stability in the DRC would undoubtedly be an extremely powerful factor in terms of stability throughout the region.
It should be borne in mind that Central Africa practically represents a continent in itself.
When we look at the number of deaths sinceÂ 1994, when we look, I believe, at the progress made in Rwanda, the elections that have led to an unproblematic change of government in BurundiÂ âÂ which was rather unexpectedÂ âÂ when I see, for example, the initial gestures and actions of President ElÂ Nkurunziza in Burundi for example, I hope that we can see the same kind of development in Congo in a few months time.
Â Â  Questions Nos 43 to 45 will be answered in writing(1).
Â Â  . The Commission is in favour of increasing the transparency and accountability of the WTO so as to reinforce the legitimacy of this institution.
On the functioning of the WTO, the EU has put forward a number of proposals for improvements, notably relating to the preparation and management of ministerial conferences, with the aim of facilitating more efficient negotiations and decision-making amongst an ever-growing membership.
For instance, it should be possible to agree in the short term to a better definition of the role of the host of ministerial conferences.
Equally, there is a need to improve the ability of smaller and non-resident delegations to negotiate effectively both in the Geneva process and at ministerial meetings.
Regarding parliamentary control, the Commission is in favour of granting the European Parliament more powers in terms of trade policy.
It has therefore supported proposals putting the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in terms of trade policy-making in the Convention on the future of Europe.
Meanwhile, we are keeping the European Parliament fully informed of the conduct and conclusion of international negotiations by regularly taking part in formal and informal meetings of Parliament and transmitting policy documents to Parliament on a par with the Council, as well as consulting Parliament on the main trade policy orientations.
However, the Commission is bound to remain within the Treaty framework.
The 133 Committee that is composed of representatives of the governments of the Member States is not a decision-making body, but a consultative body.
Major policy decisions are taken by democratically elected ministers in the Council.
As regards transparency vis-Ã -vis the public in general, the Commission pursues a proactive policy of communication, amongst other things by putting relevant information on its website, through its regular dialogue with civil society and in replying to citizensâ requests for access to documents.
As far as sustainability impact assessments are concerned, they have already been conducted on the first batch of NAMA sectors in 2002/2003, i.e. textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals and non-ferrous metals.
The results have been available on the website of Manchester University since 2003, with suggestions for adjustment whenever imbalances have been revealed, both domestically or in third countries.
A study on forests has also been carried out and the results published in June 2005.
A second batch of studies is currently being launched on another set of NAMA sectors and will include fisheries.
The results of this second batch are likely to be published in the first half of next year.
Â Â  I welcome what the Commissioner said about keeping Parliament informed.
Will he specifically commit himself to keeping Parliamentâs delegation to the negotiations in Hong Kong fully informed as the WTO talks develop, so that it can play an active part in those talks and serve as a conduit for relaying information to the public to ensure full transparency?
Â Â  . That is very important.
Extensive arrangements have been put in place for the European Parliamentâs delegation, not only to accompany us in Hong Kong, but to meet us every day, to be regularly informed.
In fact, I have just written to the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, informing him that there will be daily briefings every morning.
It is very important to note that what we are doing in Hong Kong is not some obscure, abstract process.
It is about the daily lives and employment opportunities of billions of people.
Our job is to justify what we do so as to secure public understanding and support for what we are negotiating at that very important ministerial meeting.
Â Â  Commissioner, could I ask you to focus your attention for a moment on an aspect of substance in the WTO talks, namely the perception by many that agriculture is being made the whipping boy and the sacrifice in those talks.
CAP reform was undoubtedly sold as a means to protect agricultural tariffs from future attack.
We were then told agriculture would be safe in the WTO.
Now we find that you have, maybe somewhat precipitately, made a unilateral offer to slice those tariffs by a further massive percentage.
One really does wonder whether there is an appreciation of the dire jeopardy in which agriculture in many regions like mine, with which you are familiar, is now being placed if that is the process that is to be followed.
Â Â  . It is all too tempting to say that if you were to persuade those with whom I am negotiating in the WTO that we are slashing our agricultural tariffs, then you will have done a better job of persuading them of the weight of our agricultural offer than I have.
We have, of course, made a perfectly credible and serious offer concerning agricultural tariffs linked to proposals we have made in respect of domestic subsidies and the elimination of export subsidies.
Those are proportionate, and are rooted very firmly within the envelope of the existing CAP reforms and do not go outside it.
They are what we are required to do.
We signed up to an original Doha mandate, and we then signed up to the framework agreement last summer which invites us to introduce measures that will bring about a substantial improvement in market access in agriculture.
That is what I believe we are doing.
However, we are not taking risks and we are not jeopardising or threatening the livelihoods of European farmers or farming communities.
That is alarmist talk to which I do not subscribe.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the negotiations to be held in Hong Kong in accordance with the multilateral system break down â which is a distinct possibility, even if it is the last thing we all want â do you believe that it would then be easier or more difficult to establish a free trade area between Europe and America?
Â Â  . I cannot think of anything more difficult or perhaps more painful than negotiating a free trade area between the European Union and the United States of America!
However, I strongly believe there is scope for attacking some of the non-tariff barriers that stand in the way of growing trade and investment across the Atlantic.
As the honourable Member knows, this is something of great interest to me.
I am particularly concerned about the regulatory differences, the lack of convergence and the obstacles that are thrown up because of the differences and frequent incompatibility between the different regulatory systems in Europe and the United States.
However, both of those regulatory systems are rooted in tradition, past practice, and I suspect that we in Europe would have no greater luck in telling the Americans how to reform their regulatory systems than the Americans would have if they came over here and told us how to run our regulatory systems.
Nevertheless, through patient dialogue and, I hope in due course, negotiation, we should be able to make some necessary and important improvements that will be of benefit to our respective business communities and, therefore, to jobs and livelihoods on both sides of the Atlantic.
Â Â  . Under the current Generalised System of Preferences â GSP â the unilateral scheme of tariff concessions granted to 180Â developing countries which still applies until 1Â January 2006, imports of fishery products including shrimps and prawns into the EU from Thailandâs main competitors â Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil â are benefiting from reduced duties: from 12% to 4.2%.
Thailand has been excluded from GSP preferences for fishery products since 1Â January 1999 on the basis of its high level of competitiveness in the EU market.
The new GSP adopted by the Council on 27Â June 2005 is based on different criteria and is also more generous to all GSP beneficiaries, including, it was decided, tsunami-affected countries like Thailand.
Thus, from January 2006 onwards, Thailand will again benefit from reduced duties on its fishery products under the new GSP. This is consistent with the Commission and the Councilâs overall aim to help tsunami-affected countries.
The Commission is aware that concerns have been raised about the issue of prawn farming in south-east Asia and the effects of removing mangrove forests to create lagoons.
The Commission therefore supports the sustainable development of coastal-zone management in Asia via the transfer of best practices and environmental solutions from Europe to Asia.
The Commissionâs EuropeAid Cooperation Office has so far committed funding for three projects dealing with rehabilitation of mangrove forests in tsunami-affected areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand through the Asia Pro Eco post-tsunami programme.
This, moreover, should help safeguard shrimp production â an eligible sector under that programme â which is to address the development of environmental management in coastal areas engaging in aquaculture.
Â Â  . The Commission is aware of the recent development of imports into the Community of footwear originating in China and Vietnam.
In that context, the Commission received earlier this year complaints submitted by the EU footwear industry containing convincing data indicating that the EU footwear industry is suffering from adverse effects caused by dumped prices of imports of footwear into the Community.
The Commission has acted promptly by initiating two anti-dumping investigations.
The first concerns imports of footwear with a protective toe-cap originating in China and India.
The second concerns imports of footwear with leather uppers from China and Vietnam.
The aim of those investigations is to establish whether the imports in question are dumped and have had a negative impact on the economic situation of the Community footwear industry.
The investigations will also have to assess the impact and the possible adverse effect of any measures on the other economic operators in the Community.
The investigation has made progress.
The Commission is now analysing the question of market economy treatment of the exporters concerned, the definition of the different categories and models of the products involved, the question of whether there is dumping, the impact of these imports on the Communityâs shoe-producing industry and the position of traders, retailers and consumers.
All that is in progress.
It is not a surprise that it is a highly complicated case.
Given the enormous technical problems, with hundreds of economic operators and a product that consists of thousands of different models, it is too early to give any concrete indication about the possible outcome.
Â Â  â There are many small and medium-sized enterprises that are already closing down or on the brink of doing so. The effect of this is to exacerbate the unemployment problem in the areas in question â as in my country, for example, and in a number of other southern European countries â and seriously to hinder development in these areas.
If the process does not move forward soon, it may be too late.
I should therefore like to ask you how long the worst affected areas will have to wait before practical, effective measures, such as the safeguard clauses, will be put in place.
Â Â  . The investigation will be completed within the prescribed time, though I am unable to say precisely when that will be.
Provisional measures can be taken by the Commission between two and nine months after initiation of the investigation.
I should stress that this really is a very complex matter indeed; much more so than was originally anticipated when we began the investigation.
We have to be very careful that we assess precisely not only what the effect on the Community interest is, but what the impact would be if we were to take anti-dumping action on a variety of different producers and economic operators in this sector.
Some Community producers are themselves partly producing outside the Community.
Former fully-fledged Community producers have kept their research, design and development activities within the Community, but are getting supplies from a variety of sources, like China and Vietnam, but also Romania, Bulgaria and Brazil as well as Italy, Slovakia and other Member States.
Those former producers also provide a considerable amount of jobs through these other economic activities.
You can see from this â and I could also identify other issues complicating this matter â that we have to be very careful in our assessment.
We do not have a single homogenous set of European producers with one set of clearly identifiable and quantifiable interests.
There are a variety of different producer interests and we have to ensure, after our initial judgement on whether the alleged dumping practices have been substantiated, what the impact would be on a variety of different producer interests should any action follow.
Â Â  I am pleased and relieved to hear the Commissionerâs response because I have been lobbied by European retailers who have invested considerable money in Asia, have improved health and safety conditions and working conditions in Asian countries, and are bringing economic benefits both to Asian workers and to European retailers.
Would the Commissioner agree that it would be quite wrong if those companies were caught up in any anti-dumping duties?
Â Â  . The honourable Member has identified one such type of European producer whose interests I have to take into account.
It will clearly not be easy to find a balanced and equitable solution in this very complex situation and, frankly, the Commission will need a fair amount of ingenuity and flexibility in order to lead this case to a solution acceptable for the Member States and the economic operators.
Having said that, Member States will soon receive a proposal from my services not to grant market economy treatment to the Vietnamese exporters, since state interference, subsidies and other competitive distortions are still widespread.
The Commission has not yet assembled any results on China.
Â Â  Madam President, I also wish to thank MrÂ Mandelson for advocating free trade and speaking up for those industries that benefit from free trade.
In specific connection with this matter, I should like to know why the anti-dumping investigation also extends to include sports shoes, which have been exempt from Regulation 467/98 and, overall, have been exempt from all import restrictions for many years.
The kind of impression given is that the Commission has panicked at having been put under this pressure by forces in the EU that fear free competition.
Can the Commissioner confirm that this is not the case?
Â Â  . The honourable Member has put the finger on an important issue.
She should not assume that anti-dumping duties will be levied on such sportswear producers.
I have yet to satisfy myself that there is a direct Community competitor producing such sportswear.
Therefore it is not yet clear to me as to what Community interest in that segment of the sector is being harmed.
However, the investigation continues.
I suspect that shortly we will be able to reach a view about the particular sector to which she refers.
Â Â  Questions Nos 49 to 53 will be answered in writing(2).
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissionâs activities in the field of restructuring are carried out on a pan-European basis.
It does not have special instruments at its disposal for forecasting the restructuring of enterprises and future economic and labour developments in each sector of the market and in each type of job in island, rural and outlying areas.
Whereas each Member State has access to instruments for monitoring individual sectors and its own labour market, the Commission can only monitor specific sectors or regions on an individual basis.
The Commission communication of 31Â MarchÂ 2005 on restructuring and employment provided the social partners with an opportunity to make their views on this matter known to the Commission.
Furthermore, in its communication of 5 October on industrial policy, the Commission referred to certain industrial sectors in which structural changes may take place over the next few years.
It follows that we must be able to anticipate these changes and to facilitate them at regional, national and European level.
The tertiary sector may also be affected by restructuring, and detailed studies of this issue are needed.
The Commission is working together with the Dublin-based European Monitoring Centre on Change and actively participating in its projects, which are targeted at various sectors and at the monitoring of restructuring.
The commitments the European Union has entered into and the treaties it has concluded on a bilateral and international basis have an impact on certain key aspects of restructuring, such as the extent to which markets are opened up, access to markets, technological innovation and technology sharing, and the social clauses in this type of treaty.
The Commission has certain instruments at its disposal to promote the sustainable development of the regions, including and in particular the European Employment Strategy, the European Social Fund in the case of investment in human capital and the European Regional Development Fund in the case of investment in infrastructure, productive investment and the development of endogenous potential.
Assistance is available from the Structural Funds in the shape of medium-term strategy programmes aimed at forecasting and better managing industrial developments, and minimising their impact on workers.
With this in mind, the Commissionâs proposals for the 2007-2013 programming period prioritise the monitoring and management of change, under the goals of competitiveness and employment.
The result of this will be a focus on three key issues; the major inequalities that exist in the field of employment, the continuing fast pace of economic and social restructuring, brought about by globalisation and the development of a knowledge-based economy, and demographic changes that will lead to an ageing of the workforce.
Among other things, this regulation provides for a contingency reserve of 1% for convergence regions and 3% for other regions.
This will enable Member States to make use of the Funds to better manage economic and social restructuring and to better deal with the consequences of global market opening.
On top of this, the Commission recently proposed setting up a Globalisation Adjustment Fund, aimed at tackling any adverse effects of restructuring.
If this Fund is set up, it will support workers hit by globalisation-related crises.
As far as the education of future generations is concerned, the European education programmes Erasmus, Socrates and Leonardo enable thousands of young people to study abroad.
In addition, the framework programmes for EU-funded research make it possible to fund key projects at EU level, particularly in the fields of employment, education, vocational training and innovation, and these projects will pave the way for further measures.
Â Â  â Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his fairly elucidating reply.
I specifically wished to ask if you have planned where the financing for this planned fund to strengthen restructurings is to come from and if provision has been made to publicise all these auxiliary measures in order to strengthen the confidence of Europeans in developments and prevent them from becoming discouraged in the face of the phenomenon of globalisation.
Â Â  .Â Â Â It is of course the case that the funds currently at the Commissionâs disposal mean that it can already respond to certain unexpected changes.
To take one well-known example, 5Â 000Â people were recently made redundant at Rover over a short period of time.
The Commission made use of the Structural Funds to intervene, and this intervention has been widely acknowledged to have been a success.
It goes without saying that this case was out of the ordinary, since it affected only one manufacturing plant in one country.
The recent changes at Electrolux are an example of interrelated problems caused by major system restructuring, involving more than one country.
At present we lack effective instruments to deal with cases of this kind, which is why the idea of a fund to tackle the effects of globalisation and restructuring has been mooted.
Its aim would not be to protect non-competitive businesses, but to make it possible for people negatively affected by restructuring to find a new livelihood.
To use a metaphor, if I may, our aim is not to save a sinking ship, but to rescue the crew and to get them to another ship or to dry land, so that they can carry on with their lives.
The fund will promote investment in human capital and in life-long learning, as well as the conclusion of agreements on employment and partnerships for innovation at national, regional and local level.
It will also support the development of systems and instruments that make it easier to forecast social and economic change, encourage greater flexibility of workers and businesses affected by restructuring, and boost the administrative capacities and productivity of all stakeholders, for example by training managers involved in change.
It will be possible to use instruments that already exist at Member State level, such as those used for the European Social Fund, to implement this fund.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, when the treaties of accession were concluded, it was agreed that the â2+3+2â policy would be adopted for the transition periods.
One way of looking at these multiple transition periods, or intervals at which checks can be carried out in order to decide whether there is any point in extending them, is to view them as motivated by a desire both to sign the treaties of accession and to put an end to the transition periods, since the latter would make it impossible to achieve full freedom of movement for workers within as short a period of time as possible.
The Commissionâs current obligation is to submit a report evaluating the impact of the transition periods in their first two years.
Our aim is to draft a report which is credible and absolutely reliable in terms of methodology, and which takes all the surrounding circumstances into account, including the fact that some countries share borders with new Member States.
I have to say that I attach a great deal of value to this report.
As well as providing an authoritative basis for decision-making on such a sensitive issue, it must also serve as a platform for further work and evaluations in three yearsâ time.
At this point decisions will again be taken in line with the treaty, since five years will have passed since the transitional period began, and there will be a great deal less room for manoeuvre then than after only two years.
It is in our interest, not to say our supreme interest, to give due consideration to all the relevant circumstances surrounding this sensitive issue, including the geographical location of individual countries.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his comments, and for his assurance that the report will be balanced.
I should like to put the following supplementary question.
Why is it that the public statements made by yourself and your officials have intimated that a decision has already been taken, and why is there such a rush to grant freedom of movement?
We all agree that freedom of movement is our goal, and we too uphold this fundamental principle of the European Union.
The key issue, however, is ensuring that the concerns of all parties affected are taken seriously.
To repeat my question, therefore, why have you already taken your decision on this matter?
Â Â  .Â Â Â In a sense I have already answered this question in my previous response, but I believe that it is of such significance that it merits a more detailed answer.
The treaty of accession divided up the transition periods into certain stages, on the assumption that these would be subject to in-depth evaluations.
The implicit goal of these interim stages is to put an end to the transitional periods, and the sooner this happens the better.
It is my firm belief that the free movement of workers is one of the major driving forces behind the European Unionâs economic growth, by which I also mean job creation.
It follows that this is therefore a matter of public interest.
Conversely, I am also very much aware that this is a highly sensitive issue.
I would reiterate the point that our goal will be to submit a report that is regarded as authoritative, by which I mean that it will be above reproach methodologically speaking.
Individual countries will naturally take their own decisions in line with the treaty, and they will be able to decide what is right for them on the basis of the facts.
It is by no means the Commissionâs intention to break up or bring about the destruction of the labour market in any country.
The aim of the treaties of accession, however, is to create a common market and to achieve the free movement of workers within this common market, since this is one of the four key values which are upheld in the European Union and which underpin the concept of European integration.
In view of this, I believe that we should act with due speed and with the necessary courage, after weighing up all the relevant information.
It goes without saying that the responsibility for taking the decision lies with the governments.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for restating your commitment to the principle of the free movement of workers.
I very much agree.
However, I should like to ask you whether you plan to research or analyse, from the Commission point of view, the decision by the United Kingdom and other countries to open up their labour markets to free movement of labour immediately, as opposed to those countries which impose restrictions.
Is this something that you plan to do and could you tell us if it is a feasible idea?
Â Â  .Â Â Â There can be no question that the experience gained by the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden is a valuable source of information when it comes to assessing the impact of any termination or non-enforcement of transition periods.
Careful evaluation is needed of these experiences, and this may well involve using certain studies.
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time is at an end, QuestionsÂ Nos 56 to 90 will be answered in writing(3).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, in principle the Commissionâs proposals are a welcome development, and its enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans is exactly right. The fact that the Commission has now formally confirmed that EU membership is a medium-term prospect for the Western Balkan states is also good news.
This is enormously important for the future development of this region, since in the long term it is the only thing that will bring peace to this part of Europe, which has had such a difficult past.
At the same time, however, the European Peopleâs Party (European Democrats) would urge the Commission to assess the fitness of each candidate country in the Western Balkans to join the EU on an individual and point-by-point basis before binding dates are set for the opening of accession negotiations, and before timetables are drawn up for accession. The Commission must not make the same mistake with the countries known as the Western Balkan states that it did in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, and particularly in the case of Turkey, when it named a date prematurely, before the criteria had been met in full.
The European publicâs reaction to such a move would be even greater opposition to other countries joining the EU, while at the same time excessive demands would be made of the Balkan states in terms of their capacity for reform.
This is the last thing we can afford in this highly unstable region, parts of which were ravaged by civil war until recently.
As the Commissioner himself said, it is apparent that significant progress has been made with reforms.
The Commission is right to maintain that Croatia and Macedonia have made the most progress, and have therefore already been recognised as candidate countries, or soon will be, as in the case of Macedonia.
This should also act as an incentive for neighbouring countries that are lagging behind on the road towards EU membership for many different reasons.
Each of these countries has its own lot with which it must contend. Albania must recover from the decades it spent under the communism of Enver Hoxha, when the country resembled a high-security prison.
Bosnia and Herzegovina must come to terms with the nightmare years of displacement, murder and war, and shoulder the burden of the Dayton Agreement, which was a monstrosity that ended the war but failed to establish a platform for good governance and cooperation.
Serbia took a long time to free itself of its dictator, and it is currently unclear how long its state union with Montenegro will last.
Finally, the status of Kosovo must be determined without delay, by means of an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina mediated by the international community.
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission would present an initiative and a strategy on this matter.
The Western Balkans and our enlargement strategy for this region are a litmus test for our European policies.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased with the report by MrsÂ deÂ Veyrac, which has the great merit of clearly proposing the principle of adopting a blacklist of unsafe, even dangerous, airlines. In view of recent repeated disasters resulting from the defectiveness of certain aircraft, it is essential that we act to identify them and ban them from flying.
It is essential to the safety of all air passengers that they be aware of the identity of the airline carrying them and, furthermore, to know whether or not that airline is considered to be dangerous. This is an absolute right.
This must be respected fully since it involves the lives of millions of people travelling across the world by air.
I would like to express one reservation, however. What will be the scope of the Community list of these airlines not meeting European safety criteria?
For the time being, it appears that the Commission has not set any common criteria for the establishment of a Community list.
Do you fear the diplomatic consequences in relation to certain sensitive countries?
Is there fear, for example, of the reaction of the Turkish authorities to the recent flight ban of Onur Air only by the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland?
Why are the other European countries not associated with this prohibition measure?
The text that has been presented to us proposes, amongst other things, increasing the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency. Why not, if the objective is the strengthening of common criteria for inspection, prohibition and restriction of flying rights?
Nevertheless, is there provision for measures to control this Agency and means for appealing against its decisions?
We must legislate, of course, and quickly, but we must take care not to remove any of the Member Statesâ room for manoeuvre in such a crucial area as the safety of their citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, on the particular issue of Units 1 and 2 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant, the rapporteurs in the Slovak Government have both come forward with an estimate of the total cost of decommissioning for the two units as likely to be EURÂ 750Â million.
Against this, the Commissionâs proposal for an appropriation of EURÂ 237Â million for the period 2007 to 2013 may seem modest, but there are two very strong arguments in favour of keeping to the Commissionâs figure of EURÂ 237Â million.
Firstly, although UnitÂ 1 is due to be shut down in 2006, major structural decommissioning will not begin until UnitÂ 2 is shut down in 2008.
EURÂ 237Â million is a substantial sum of money for the first five years of a decommissioning period which is expected to last for 30Â years.
Secondly, to increase the amount is to make a mockery of the budget which Parliament has already voted.
We know that politically we are entering into a very sensitive period on the financial perspectives and it does not help if Parliament votes one thing one minute and another thing the next. We have to respect the vote on the budget.
Nor should we be trying to force anyoneâs hand on the budget beyond 2013.
The debate on any further money for Bohunice should take place in the context of the next round of budget discussions and in the light of whatever has happened on decommissioning up to that point.


It is understandable, however, that the Slovak authorities want to know where they are with the funding over this 2006-2013 financial perspective, so the total sum of EURÂ 237Â million needs to be fixed for that period without further review, although the yearly appropriation may vary.
On the wider issue of decommissioning, the key challenge is to ensure that, on the one hand, enough money is available to decommission nuclear plants safely and, on the other hand, that the financing of decommissioning does not become state aid by the back door. Paragraph 5 of the report is important in this respect.
It is the nuclear industry â not governments â that needs to make provision in advance for decommissioning and ensure that the full cost is included in the balance sheet from the start.
Too many times in the past the nuclear industry has got its sums wrong and then come begging for financial assistance.
That is unacceptable because the failure of the nuclear industry to make proper provision for the cost of decommissioning distorts competition.
If back-end costs are not calculated properly, then nuclear-generated electricity appears to be much cheaper than it really is.
I hope that the Commission will ensure that such anti-competitive practices are not allowed to occur in future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for her very wide-ranging and in-depth analysis.
We have always believed that nuclear power station security and safety is a European issue, and that such issues affect us all, because malfunctioning or other problems affect the public across Europe.
Decommissioning and final storage are clearly issues for competition law.
We must make sure that funds are allocated in line with EU competition law, and I also believe that there must be legal provisions to prevent distortions of competition, by which I mean not only distortion in competition between the Member States, but above all between producers, and not only as regards nuclear energy but for all energy sources.
That is why we in the centre believe that peer review is necessary, that is to say mutual checks and transparent implementation, and that we need to pay particular attention to ensuring that in future funds for closure, final storage and consumer security are available for each energy source.
The European Union, the Court of Auditors and the various other institutions must create a clear legal framework. It is a matter of presenting the situation as clearly as possible and of applying models that reduce costs to the consumer while at the same time optimising security, safety, final storage and decommissioning.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would basically feel a lot happier in a Europe without nuclear power stations and free of the associated risks. However, because that is a decision made at national level, as the Commissioner quite rightly said, we need to pay particular attention to safety.
European rules and standards need to be applied here.
The only thing is that, in this case, we are talking about a power station that was built before accession to the European Union, one of the consequences of which is that it must now be closed down.
We are talking about a power station in a not very wealthy country, a country with economic problems.
That is something that I believe we must take into account, and that is why the Austrian Members in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking a higher contribution towards this power stationâs closure costs.
The PSE Group will therefore be voting for this higher contribution. I do not see any great contradiction with the financial perspective, because there is no problem about finding this funding in the long term.
Let me once again appeal to the House to support Slovakia in this instance and give it a real helping hand, so that we can, in the interests of Europeâs safety, close this power station down as soon as possible.


Â Â  MrÂ President, allow me to return for a moment to a deplorable incident that took place yesterday regarding the anti-abortion exhibition organised by our Polish fellow Members from the Independence and Democracy Group.
MrsÂ Gomes and myself were not only jostled, not only almost hit, but also called âfascistsâ and âNazisâ by this group.
That is unacceptable.
I was not planning to complain to the President, since the exhibition has been cancelled and the scandalous images associating abortion with the Holocaust â something that is really most absurd â have been withdrawn.
However, since my fellow Member had the audacity to call us, in order to complain about having been called a âfascistâ, I should like all the same to point out that we ourselves were called âNazisâ.
In this Chamber, that is particularly shocking.
Â Â  Thank you for that information, MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser.
As you were able to note, the exhibition has been withdrawn because the Rules of Procedure require that the debate take place here, in this Chamber, and not by means of an exhibition from outside.
As regards the events that you have just reported, I suggest that you refer the matter to the Bureau to see how it might usefully be followed up.
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Iraq after the referendum on the Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate comes at a critical stage in Iraqâs political transition.
When this Parliament last discussed Iraq with the Commission and Council in July, Iraqâs political leaders were in the process of negotiating a new constitution.
One month ago, Iraqis voted to approve that constitution which would, for the first time ever, provide them with guarantees on their freedom, security and human rights.
The constitutional referendum marks a further step by the Iraqi people on the road to democracy, freedom and peace.
In one monthâs time they will vote again, this time to elect a new government that will need quickly to tackle important tasks such as planning and delivering much-needed services that will provide hope for a brighter and better future for millions of Iraqis.
Last monthâs referendum was remarkable in many ways.
Along with Januaryâs elections, it provided Iraqis with their first real taste of democracy.
They participated, for the first time, in political decisions that will affect their own, and their countryâs, future.
It was humbling, particularly for those of us who come from countries which often take our freedoms and democracy for granted, to see the courage and determination of those who exercised their democratic rights and took part in the voting, braving difficult conditions and the threat of violence.
European Union support for the constitutional referendum had a significant impact.
The Commissioner will in a moment no doubt detail the valuable assistance which the Commission provided to the process in support of the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and of the UN.
The United Nations has played, and continues to play, a key and outstanding supporting role in the constitutional review and election processes.
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq played a vital role in assisting the Iraqi Electoral Commission under the most difficult of circumstances.
The decision to approve the Constitution paved the way for Decemberâs general election.
This should represent another major step in the political transition that will eventually lead to Iraq assuming its full role in the international community.
Iraq is, of course, still some way from achieving that aspiration.
Although a large majority of voters voted in favour of the constitution, the results of the referendum show there are still substantial divisions to be overcome between Iraqâs ethnic communities.
A review of the constitution will take place early in the new governmentâs tenure.
This offers an important opportunity for Iraqis to forge a broader consensus on the future of their country, and will assist the creation of an inclusive political system.
Iraqâs political leaders will need to resolve key issues, including federalism, dealing with its political past, and the management of natural resources.
Dissatisfaction also threatens the election process.
It feeds the sense of frustration and disenfranchisement that some communities feel.
It also breeds the sympathy which extremists and terrorists use to justify maintaining the cycle of violence and the insurgency.
It is imperative, therefore, that Iraqâs political, ethnic and religious leaders do all they can to address these issues.
We hope that the new parliament and government is as representative and as inclusive as possible.
Turning now to international assistance to Iraqâs process of political transition, the EU and the wider international community have already provided significant and valuable support.
I look forward to the Commissioner describing the Commissionâs invaluable and ongoing assistance.
I would like to mention an important step taken towards closer partnership between the EU and Iraq through the signature of the Joint EU-Iraq Political Declaration on 21Â September.
This paves the way for regular political dialogue with Iraq on issues of mutual interest, such as promotion of good governance, protection of human rights and conflict prevention and resolution.
During that visit, the Iraqi Government stressed how much it values the EUâs assistance, particularly in supporting the constitutional and electoral processes and work to improve capacity in the rule of law sector, including through the EUJUST LEX mission.
Many neighbouring countries and other regional players are making concerted efforts to engage constructively.
In particular we welcome the Arab Leagueâs suggestion to work with Iraq in holding a National Dialogue Conference early next year.
A preparatory meeting is due to take place in Cairo in a few daysâ time, on 19Â November.
This meeting has the potential to lay the foundations for post-election international engagement and support for the new government.
The Council has strongly urged regional states, in particular Syria, to support the political process in Iraq.
This includes cooperating with Iraq to prevent cross-border transit and support for terrorists and insurgents.
As we approach this landmark election we should consider what implications the formation of a new and long-term Iraqi Government might hold for our engagement with Iraq.
Our first objective must be to continue to provide support for the election process.
The Iraq Government has specifically requested this.
The EU will provide support to the election monitoring process, including through supporting the work of domestic election observers.
I know that some of you were present in Iraq for the January elections.
I hope that it will again be possible for Members of this Parliament to show their support for Iraqâs aspiring parliamentarians in December.
I have already said that the review of the constitution during the early part of the new governmentâs tenure will be key.
The EU stands ready to support actively these important efforts, and is well placed to provide expert advice and technical assistance.
In the longer term, we also need to continue support for the vital rule of law sector and consider its enhancement.
The EU is playing a leading role by becoming a supporting donor of the rule of law sector working group, which aims to coordinate donor and government activity in this sector.
The EUâs rule of law mission for Iraq, EUJUST LEX, is due to reach the end of its mandate at the end of June 2006.
The Iraqi Government has asked for the programme to be extended and expanded to include wider training of judicial, police and prison officers.
The Council is considering how to respond.
Strengthening respect for human rights is also key.
Iraq has asked for help in developing its capacity to implement human rights principles and to accede to key human rights conventions.
The European Union is uniquely placed to provide this support and advice, and the EU stands ready to offer further support in this area.
Both the EU and Iraq hope to broaden and enhance their partnership further, as the political process goes forward, through the establishment of contractual political dialogue and other appropriate contractual relations.
Let me say once again that as Iraq approaches this milestone in its political transition, now is the time for the international community to provide its full support to the Iraqi people.
The European Union, along with others in the international community are, and should continue to be â as in so many other developing and recovering countries â at the forefront of reconstruction and development.
I look forward to discussing this with Parliament and hearing honourable Membersâ views.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is almost exactly four months since we first discussed Iraq, as Lord Bach has said.
I remember saying then that for the Iraqis the hard work was only beginning.
I truly meant it.
Today, the Iraqis have a constitution.
They will soon elect a constitutional government.
But today Iraqis are also aware of substantial divisions that still need to be overcome in the country.
They are now facing two very critical challenges: on the one hand, ensuring inclusive electoral consultations in December and, on the other hand, after doing that, carrying out a comprehensive review of the constitution, which has to be more inclusive.
We stood by the Iraqis during the constitutional process and will also do so during the preparation of the election process and the elections.
By providing another EURÂ 20Â million in support, the Commission was the sole supporter of the United Nations and the UN-led constitutional support project.
We feel part of a process that allowed the Iraqis to have their say on the constitution by casting their ballots on the referendum day.
With regard to the elections, you surely remember how hopeful I was in July that we could also dispatch an electoral observation mission.
But today we must accept the evidence that the security conditions do not allow it.
This does not, however, prevent us from assisting in other equally effective ways.
We are providing EURÂ 30Â million to the UN electoral support project.
While I speak, several European electoral experts are working side-by-side with the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and with the UN to ensure proper preparation of the elections and also to set up a transparent domestic monitoring system.
But the road leading to democracy and peace in Iraq does not end with elections.
Inevitably, it crosses the path of regional cooperation.
Iraq, its neighbours and the other states in the region are called upon to play a key role by strengthening good neighbourly relations and by cooperating to improve regional security.
I am very happy to say that the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mr Amre Moussa, has also gone there now and that there will be a conference next year, together with the Arabs, in order to enhance this relationship that has been hampered in the last few years.
Iraq will be a federal Iraq.
Functional central institutions will be set up to support the state structure that the Iraqis themselves have chosen.
To that end, suitable legislative and institutional frameworks need to be established.
Viable solutions will have to be identified rapidly to ensure continued progress towards stability and democracy.
Inclusiveness is absolutely the only way forward.
We shall also consider how best we, the European Union, can help the building-up of institutions that favour an inclusive approach.
We shall also encourage the efforts of the Arab League and others in the region â such as Jordan, for instance â to promote inclusiveness and national reconciliation.
I am convinced that the recent visit of Kofi Annan has had a positive effect in advancing that understanding among different parties.
The political process and stability in Iraq is important for all of us and for its neighbours.
The recent events in Jordan very clearly remind us of the importance of succeeding in this inclusive approach, which is crucial for the whole political stabilisation of the region.
For the Iraqi citizens, it is very important that they really have the feeling of freedom and can exercise their freedom.
In this regard, we shall not forget that most Iraqis are still struggling for their children to go to school, for their hospitals to be opened in order to fight the most ordinary diseases, for access to water, jobs â the basics â and for their livelihood.
It is an unsustainable situation for any people in any country, and therefore also for the people of Iraq.
Their needs will continue to be at the core of our assistance to Iraq in 2006.
I should like to elaborate on what we have been doing.
We have supported the political process.
In addition, we, together with the United States, have co-hosted a very important conference â the Iraq International Conference â in Brussels on 22Â June.
That was instrumental in mobilising international support from over 80Â countries and organisations for the Iraqi transitional government and for the institutions for the transitional period before the December elections.
We have also always assisted in reconstruction: we delivered an assistance package of EURÂ 580Â million through the International Reconstruction Fund for Iraq.
We have always tried to work towards meeting the basic needs of the population such as water, sanitation, healthcare and job creation.
We are also working together with two ministries â the energy and trade ministries â on institution-building.
For the future, we want to support the political process for the election.
We also want to set up joint working groups in areas of common interest such as trade and energy.
We want to support the WTO accession request, initiate negotiations for an EU-Iraq agreement on trade and cooperation and progress on the opening of the Commission delegation in Baghdad in 2006.
The Union has much to offer beyond supporting the reconstruction process.
We want to be a meaningful partner for Iraq.
The Iraqis are looking forward to that.
We shall meet their expectations.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, following your very interesting statements, I should like to make the following comments:
The first comment concerns the Commissioner's last sentence.
The European Union does indeed have much more to offer beyond reconstruction and our problem is how we can translate this very interesting idea into specific policy.
The second comment concerns the vote on the constitution.
I too agree that the vote for the constitution, despite the fact that an important group did not respond, is an important event.
An important event which, however, still leaves certain very important problems outstanding, such as the issue and the role of religion, the federal model, the national identity and access to natural resources, especially oil.
The third comment concerns the elections.
The elections are indeed very, very important, especially as the new parliament will turn its attention â as the constitution says â not only to revising the constitution, but also to the manner in which certain of its provisions are applied.
The fourth comment concerns a matter which, unfortunately, despite efforts, despite the democratisation process, is still outstanding.
It is the matter of security.
I do not wish to reopen a debate which has been held in Parliament, in the Council and in every Member State.
However, I do wish to say this: there are a great many investigations, many of which have also been published, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in newspapers in your country, which raise the question of the continuing presence of foreign military forces in Iraq.
I refer here, and this is my last point, to the proposal which we debated in the European Parliament: I think the time has come to replace the foreign military forces in Iraq with a UN peacekeeping force.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating you and giving you Parliamentâs full support for the efforts you are making today so that the European Union carries some weight in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Allow me, though, to return to an unsavoury point.
A short time before the start of the war in Iraq, General Morillon put the European Parliament on its guard by saying: âthere is no such thing as a clean warâ.
One might have hoped, though, that a war of independence might be less dirty than others.
It is no such thing.
After the terrible images of the invasion and the scandal of the Abu Ghraib prison, there is now the controversial issue of the white phosphorous bombs allegedly used in the siege of Falluja, a rebel town, but also a martyred town.
Our history taught us that no kind of peace could be built in a country by hiding the atrocities committed there.
It is here that an investigation and quest for the truth are required.
The formal democracy seeking to establish itself in Iraq and the relations with this country we are seeking to reconstruct come up against the following obvious fact: âthere can be no democracy without truthâ.
SaddamÂ Hussein will be judged for the crimes he committed and, in all likelihood, for using chemical weapons against the Kurds in 1991.
That is a simple matter of justice.
The truth about the siege of Falluja, about its burned martyrs and about where the responsibility lies regarding the use of weapons banned by the 1980 Geneva Convention are also part of what we must contribute to the Iraqi people in addition to our material aid.
We are going to help them to create their justice system: this is what is known as capacity building.
Yet, can we really succeed in this undertaking if we do not also make them feel that justice, and especially international justice, exist?
I therefore call on you, MrÂ President, Commissioner, to demand of the coalition forces that a completely independent investigation be carried out and that justice be served.
We have requested in due time that Saddam Hussein be tried by the International Criminal Court.
The crime against humanity that the use of chemical weapons in Falluja would constitute, if proven, would fully warrant this move.
Yet, if we, in this House, think that all of this is just a pipe dream, then what message of hope can we give today to the Iraqi people?
Â Â  . Mr President, when Saddam Hussein ran Iraq it was well described as a mass grave below ground and a torture chamber above.
Yet after two years and eight months of war, the deaths of countless Iraqis and over 2Â 000 coalition troops, it is clear that life in Iraq is little better than before.
Baghdad was statistically the worldâs worst place to live even before the security situation deteriorated.
How much worse now that civilian casualties run at more than 60Â a day and insurgent attacks have almost trebled in 18Â months.
It is difficult to know whether the persistent presence of coalition troops under these conditions is a help or a hindrance in the restoration of normality.
I fear I detect an air of complacency in the Councilâs statement today and surprising optimism from the Commission.
There have been notable successes on the road to democracy.
Iraqis now have their own constitution; they have their own security forces, and in December they will have a democratically elected government.
There are even signs that Sunni Arabs are moving into politics and preparing to contest the election, such as the formation last week of the National Public Democratic Movement in the province of Anbar.
Nonetheless, Europeans have a number of serious concerns.
There are signs of widening instability in the region.
Evidence of gross human rights violations, including torture and the systematic use of arbitrary arrest, has badly damaged the coalitionâs standing.
That has helped recruit many to the insurgentsâ cause.
I have three specific concerns.
First, the Pentagonâs acknowledgement a few hours ago that the US used phosphorous incendiary devices in Fallujah.
The European Union must demand a UN inquiry into the use of these banned weapons.
Second, yesterdayâs revelation in sections of the media that of the more than 35Â 000 Iraqi civilians detained by the coalition, only 5% have ever been brought to trial and many have been denied legal counsel.
What kind of example are we setting?
Third, the European Union Member States need a clear exit strategy.
If we want to stop violent insurgents continuing to gain at the expense of moderate Iraqis, what is needed â and what the Blair-Bush alliance has always lacked â is a clear end-game.
Europeans disagreed on the rationale for going into Iraq.
We must not be divided on the conditions for leaving.
We must talk to the Arab League, the Iraqi authorities and other Middle Eastern governments with a view to establishing the terms and timing of our departure that will leave Iraq a more stable and secure place.
President Talabani has already made it clear that the Iraqi people are, and I quote, âlooking forward to the day when we can say goodbye to the forces of the coalitionâ.
Europe must work towards that goal.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, too, will be supporting the measures proposed by the Council and the Commission as a means of giving the Iraqi people a chance of a peaceful and democratic future.
I would, though, like to focus on something that Lord Bach said, to the effect that we Europeans want to take a leading role where democracy and human rights in Iraq are concerned.
I have to tell Lord Bach that we must, in that case, have the courage and strength to tell our NATO partners that they must refrain from constantly breaching international law and to ensure that they do not, and we must give an assurance to this effect.
What lessons can we learn from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo?
To this day, the prisoners in Guantanamo have no rights and no legal protection.
They are kept under appalling conditions.
Can we, then, be all that horrified by the fact that those in positions of power in Iraq are also setting up prisons in secret?
In what sense are the international community and the EU setting a democratic example?
It is no more than cynical for Rumsfeld to enact new rules on torture stating that dogs may no longer, in future, be used in torture and interrogations, with not a word about compliance with the Geneva Convention.
Those are the things about which I expect statements to be made.
Do you know what white phosphorus is?
Do you know about the effects of white phosphorus, which the Americans now admit to having used in Fallujah?
It is a form of arson, with people as its victims, and there is no antidote, no means of putting the fire out â not even water can do it.
It is a means of extermination that is contrary to international law, and it is means such as this that have been deployed.
Lord Bach, you may have spent nine and a half minutes accentuating the positive, but you will carry no conviction unless and until you demand that the EU and the Council â particularly when it is being presided over by the British â commit themselves to getting the Americans to at last sign the international Convention, for unless we do that, we will not regain our international credibility and whatever instruments are applied, no matter with how much effort, will be ineffective.
It is for that reason that I call upon you to ensure that there are not just investigations, but that the Americans also sign the international convention specifically outlawing the use of white phosphorus.
Failing that, we will be unable to actively promote peace in Iraq.
Â Â  .
Mr President, for years, Europe and America turned a blind eye to the dreadful dictatorship in Iraq because Iraq supplied oil.
Rather than provide support to Iraqâs opposition in good time, it was decided that there would be an intervention from outside on the basis of false arguments and without the UNâs approval.
The way in which the superpowerâs views and interests have been imposed, by force and unilaterally, has caused part of the Shiite majority to turn their backs on the Western occupiers and seek recourse to an Iran-style theocratic dictatorship.
The good thing is that it has now proved possible to put an end to the situation in which the Kurdish north and the Shiite south were occupied lands oppressed by the central area surrounding Baghdad.
The federalism inherent in the new constitution protects disadvantaged areas against oppression and exploitation, and so 80% of the population stand to benefit.
A democracy in the new federal states can only succeed if the foreign military and the predominance of foreign companies withdraw from that country sooner rather than later.
Staying on is a fresh provocation that continues to incite protests.
When will the military presence of the EU Member States come to an end and in what ways is the EU helping Iraq to find its domestic solutions, thus ousting Halliburton, a failing American company that cannot repair the public utilities?
Â Â  .
Mr President, this year, 2005, will go down in history as the year of the freest elections Iraq has ever known.
Simply compare this three-day voting period with that countryâs experience under the 35 years of the Ba'athist regime, with no elections whatsoever for the first 12 years and mock elections for the rest.
What a contrast and what political progress!
We do not get to hear anything about this in this House.
To be sure, Mesopotamiaâs reconstruction continues to be threatened from within and without, as it was before.
That is why the future of a federal Iraq looks very fragile.
Earlier this week, a prominent Iraqi politician warned me that this affects Europe in equal measure.
Indeed, if the destructive powers win, then our continent will also be in the firing line.
I would ask the Council and Commission what the European Union could do for the Iraqi state and people in this precarious situation.
Firstly, we must exert firm pressure on Baghdadâs neighbours so as not to fan the flames of terrorism across the border.
Secondly, we must help lay the foundation of democratic rule of law along the banks of the Tigris.
âWe must learn from the Europeans, and we do indeed want toâ, said my Iraqi friend, full of optimism.
The main thing is that we should not let them down in this aspiration.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Iraq is painfully yet determinedly raising its head again after the bloody and in many ways insane dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and after the events of recent years, which have certainly paved the way for change but have also deeply scarred the Iraqi people.
The next step, still under the aegis of the international community, should be for all the Arab states in the region to become increasingly involved in the whole process of democratisation and the fight against terrorism.
The extraordinarily successful turnout in the recent elections was an historic event, but we have a clear duty to continue to stand by the Iraqi people and the freely elected authorities that are administering the country.
We must provide practical help for all the young people who, with great courage and often at personal risk, want to fight to make Iraq a free, democratic and fair country at last.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the elections, the referendum and the new vote planned for 15Â December show that, after years of bloody dictatorship, a true democracy is emerging in Iraq.
It is a success story for the Iraqi people, who have shown through their turnout in the elections that they want to play an important part in establishing peace in the Middle East.
At the cost of great sacrifices and hundreds of innocent victims, those who uphold democracy are winning the battle against the small minority who practise terrorism in the name of fundamentalism.
The final goal has not yet been achieved, however, and much remains to be done to defeat Al Qaeda and its allies and to bring permanent stability to Iraq.
Having survived a number of splits, the European Union has begun to make an important contribution, albeit belatedly.
I agree with what the Council representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have just said.
Nevertheless, we have to do even more for the Iraqi people, in conjunction, of course, with the United Nations, which, through Resolution 1546, has enabled 35 countries to make a significant contribution to the birth of that new democracy.
Their contribution is not only financial, as in the case of the democracy fund set up by the United Nations, but also political and military.
Many Europeans are taking part in the peace mission, and we should be grateful to them for what they have done and are still doing â including risking their own lives â in order to make a fundamental contribution to the resurrection of Iraq.
These people, soldiers and civilians alike, among whom are a great many Italians, have breathed life into thousands of projects to develop infrastructure in the fields of agriculture, transport, education and culture.
This successful strategy is leading to cuts in the numbers of troops, who will be leaving Iraq under an agreement between them and the legitimate government in Baghdad.
Many of those who criticised the peace mission are today having second thoughts and realising how important it has been.
I shall finish, MrÂ President, by pointing out that it would be a mistake to think that resolving the Iraqi crisis will be enough to bring peace to the Middle East.
We still have to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, with the European Union playing an important role, by guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy is not a mere exercise in style, but requires roots that have not yet been put down in Iraq.
Let us finally take a close look at the real situation.
The Kurds turned out to vote because they glimpsed independence for their province on the horizon; the Shiâa did so to obey their religious leaders; and the few Sunni who voted did so to avoid being completely sidelined in the reorganisation of the country.
The basic conditions needed to allow democracy to put down roots are economic security, a state apparatus that works and equality for all citizens under the law.
The reality is that the project to export democracy on the wings of fighter-bombers has failed and the Western powersâ military occupation of the country now stands in the way of any solid, tangible progress.
From another perspective, Iraq has become an exporting country, and not just of oil.
The attacks in Jordan are proof: Iraq now exports its terrorism.
The suicide bombers who blew themselves up were in fact Iraqis.
A woman who was supposed to take part in the attacks but survived has explained that her family was decimated during the American offensives in the Sunni triangle.
Therefore, I too strongly call for a UN investigation into the use of banned white phosphorus bombs by the American forces.
Iraq is thus looking dangerously like another Afghanistan.
PresidentÂ Bush wanted to fight the terrorists in Afghanistan so that he would not have to do so elsewhere, but today the terrorists already are elsewhere, and we wonder just how far they will go.
Europe thus has to face two challenges, namely the obtuseness of those who still claim that the Iraqi campaign has been a success, and the murderous determination of those who demonstrate every day that it has been a tragic failure.
To find a way out of this morass, we need neither propaganda nor comforting stories, but clear-headedness and brave statesmen who can acknowledge their mistakes and sketch out a new strategy, a strategy for peace.
Â Â  Mr President, sadly the anti-Americanism of some in Europe is so great that I sense that some even take a perverse satisfaction from the turmoil prevailing in Iraq.
These same people, of course, are those who would have been quite content to allow Saddamâs tyranny to continue undisturbed.
Of course it was wrong of Blair and Bush to rely on and peddle false information to justify the invasion of Iraq, but the removal of Saddam was right and necessary.
The situation as it is must now be faced.
The core issue is to ensure the triumph of order over terror so that democratic stability may indeed be established.
A heavy price is being paid and I would wish to acknowledge the sacrifice of the American, British and other troops seeking to bring order to this strife-torn land.
I regret that in their contributions neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to make an acknowledgement of that sacrifice.
It must be said that it is typical of its grandstanding that the EU now wants to pontificate on the future of Iraq.
It has little that is credible to contribute, for, when it mattered, the EU as an organisation and most EU Member States left the heavy lifting to others.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Iraqi peopleâs adoption of an interim Constitution is, as far as we are concerned, a major step forward.
The extensive participation of the people in the electoral process constitutes a reason for feeling optimistic about Iraqâs burgeoning democracy.
The development of the country clearly opens the door to a future partnership between Iraq and the European Union, particularly in the context of the EUâs Neighbourhood Policy and of peace in the Mashreq region and, in this regard, I thank MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner for the commitments made on behalf of the Commission.
There are a great number of issues at stake for this partnership: the democratic stabilisation of the country; the creation of a real, and no longer formal, rule of law; respect for fundamental freedoms and minority rights, and yet also the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy and from a state-controlled to a market economy; the allocation of oil resources to diversification promoting agriculture, industry and services; and, finally, the reconstruction of the education and health care systems destroyed by so many years of authoritarian rule, embargoes and war.
There are a number of prerequisites for this partnership, however.
Iraqâs as yet uncertain development calls for us to exercise the utmost vigilance.
We cannot just dismiss the use of white phosphorous bombs by the Americans in Falluja â if the information turns out to be true.
An investigation must be carried out.
Replacing the foreign forces with a peacekeeping presence under the aegis of the United Nations features among our objectives.
The December elections must enable the Iraqi people to elect a government and a parliament that are representative of the human and political balances in the country.
In this regard, the federal institutional framework seems particularly suitable.
Curbing types of fundamentalism, combating the theory of the so-called clash of civilisations and building this entire Mashreq region upon the foundations of shared values are the goals that the European Union must be given.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, over 2Â 000Â American soldiers have died and 15Â 000 have been injured since military operations began against Saddam Husseinâs regime in Iraq.
Iraq Body Count, a British research group, has estimated on the basis of news agency and newspaper reports that over 30Â 000Â Iraqis have been killed, with other estimates placing the number of victims at 100Â 000.
Constitutional ratification is a major step towards the reconstruction of Iraq.
Two hundred and twenty-five political groups and coalitions have registered for the parliamentary elections due to be held on 15Â December, and the parliament will elect a new government by 31Â December of this year.
This democratically elected parliament, which will include Sunni members, will be able to make amendments to the constitution over the next six months.
The constitutional referendum held in Iraq gives us further reason to hope that Islam and the concept of liberal democracy can be reconciled in the Middle East and Central Asia in the shape of a so-called Muslim democracy.
The period of rule of interim and transitional governments is coming to an end in the country, and a democratic political culture is emerging in its wake.
At the same time, however, the situation continues to be characterised by incessant terrorist attacks and the constant possibility that civil war could break out.
Â Â  â Mr President, the international community welcomed the results of the referendum as an important stage in the course of the democratisation of Iraq.
It is indeed, if you look no further than the degree of participation and the arithmetic aspects of the results.
However, I fear that everyone is shaping their own fictitious reality for Iraq.
However, we cannot ignore the actual reality in Iraq, because the serious security vacuum continues to exist.
Instead of the centrifugal trends of the national and religious communities gradually weakening, they are strengthening and undermining the objective of the national unity, identity and sovereignty of Iraq.
The majority of Sunnis are consciously outside political processes.
The process of political reconstruction is leading to the creation of a loose state of at least three speeds.
On the one hand, we welcome progress towards a democratic Iraq and, on the other hand, a theocratic Shiite regime is being established in the south and the quasi-independence of the Kurds is being established in the north.
The consequences for peace and stability are obvious.
Under these conditions elections are being planned to promote the new Iraqi parliament.
However, I fear that the wishes and hopes being expressed here today do not correspond to the harsh reality of the military occupation and the serious strategic mistakes which the United States continues to make.
There is an old saying in Arabic: 'Better a hundred years of tyranny than one year of chaos'.
While the tyranny of the Hussein regime has been overturned, the conditions being created on a daily basis are pushing Iraq into long-term chaos.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank all those who have taken part in this debate.
This is an issue that raises passions and strong views and we have heard them expressed around the Chamber this morning.
However, I hope we can agree on two aspects at least.
Firstly, on how excellent and what a good thing it is that Saddam Hussein is no longer in power in Iraq.
Secondly, we can agree that any human rights abuses that have been shown to have been committed since he fell from power should be investigated and dealt with in a proper and sensible way.
I am very grateful for what the Commissioner had to say and for the excellent work of the Commission.
It is right to point out that the EU has contributed to the UN Office of Constitutional Support both financially and through the provision of experts.
The Iraqi Government has requested that the EU provide election monitors and, whilst the full election observation mission would, as the Commissioner said, not be possible at the moment, the Council will look closely at what we can do to monitor and support the elections.
As far as human rights are concerned, the Councilâs conclusions following the external relations meeting on 7Â November emphasised the importance of full respect for human rights in Iraq.
The Council underlined the EUâs strong opposition to the use of the death penalty.
It noted with concern recent reports â including by the United Nations â of human rights violations by the Iraqi security forces and urged the Iraqi Government to address these allegations.
The EU stands ready to offer further support.
At the same time, the Council welcomed the improvement in the human rights situation since the fall of Saddam Hussein and condemned, as we all should, the atrocities of terrorists since then.
The issue of coalition troops has been raised during the debate and it is certainly an important issue.
However, honourable Members will forgive me if I mention what President Talabani, the Kurdish leader whose people suffered so appallingly under Saddam Hussein, said only last weekend: âImmediate withdrawal would be a catastrophe and lead to a kind of civil war.
We will lose what we have done for liberating Iraq from the worst kind of dictatorship ...
Instead of having a democratic, stable Iraq, we will have a civil war in Iraq, we will have troubles in Iraq and they will affect all the Middle Eastâ.
That seems to me an important statement by the President of Iraq at the present time.
The people of Iraq have demonstrated great commitment to democracy.
They turned out in their millions and in the most difficult of circumstances to approve a new Constitution that will guide their country and protect their rights.
If this momentum can be carried through to the December elections, then I believe Iraq could be on the verge of a major turning point and, with the election of a new government, Iraq enters a new phase.
The leaders of Iraqâs first constitutionally elected government will owe a huge debt of responsibility to its people.
They will place their trust and their future in the hands of those leaders and those leaders must respect that trust.
That means putting the nationâs interests above political and personal ambition or ethnic or religious interests.
The new government has to be truly representative if it is to survive.
It also must waste no time in getting down to business.
That means ensuring security, health, education, employment and, of course, human rights.
Terrorism and insecurity remain the biggest obstacles to political progress and reconstruction.
We should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, and I do not think this Parliament does.
There is still a lot to be done and huge dangers that we all know about still threaten these processes.
This fledgling democracy will require support for some time to come.
The international community has done a lot already and the EU has a proud record: it has joined with the UN and others in committing significant resources to supporting the political transition and reconstruction.
We all have valuable expertise and experience of democracy-building to share.
The Iraqi Government has expressed its appreciation for the significant contribution of the EU and it has asked for more.
We should not let Iraq down.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is true that the European Union has been divided over Iraq in the past, but it is also true that we are now united in building a new Iraq, and that is the most important thing now.
We cannot continue looking backwards.
We have to build a stable Iraq now and, although Mr Watson is correct in saying I emphasised the positive things we have been doing, it is also absolutely clear that the underlying situation is very difficult.
That is why I said we cannot send to Iraq an election observation mission which otherwise I would have provided.
It is too dangerous for our people and they would not be able to do their job properly.
What would the alternative be?
In fact we have no alternative other than to try to work together.
Of course, the challenge is absolutely enormous, and I consider that the Iraqi Government and its people have shown great courage in this.
What my colleague has just said is true.
The outcome of the election was quite encouraging and really astonishing under these difficult circumstances.
This shows that the average Iraqi wants stability and peace, but there is also a minority, a very strong minority, which is of course extremist and radical, that is trying to undermine all the efforts made by the international community and the Iraqi Government.
I did not mean to be one-sided and perhaps I could have made myself clearer.
On the question of torture and recent events, we will have to see whether all the allegations are true.
If they are, we must make it clear that human rights, just as Lord Bach has already said, are part of our very strong values and the ones we want to export to Iraq and to be taken into consideration there.
I learned today that the Prime Minister of Iraq has already said he would himself set up a committee to investigate all instances of torture perpetrated by Iraqis themselves.
We can contribute to that through EUJUST LEX and by building up a police corps that does not torture, but which knows what the limits are and tries to help restore order.
We are therefore in this for the long run and will have to remain in Iraq for a long time in order to restore stability to that country.
This is something that is also very important for the region as a whole.
Indeed, I am working with regard to the whole region as part of the broader Middle East initiative, and we will cooperate with the Americans on this issue too.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . Mrs President, there is now almost universal acceptance that climate change is a serious and an urgent problem.
The IPCC predicts that global temperatures may rise by as much as 5.8Â°C by the year 2100.
According to one insurance company, the estimated economic costs of global warming could double to USDÂ 150Â billion each year in the next 10Â years, hitting insurers with USDÂ 30-40Â billion worth of claims.
There is good evidence that the 2003 European heatwave was influenced by global warming and that, as Members will recall, resulted in 26Â 000 premature deaths, as well as costing USDÂ 13.5Â billion.
Those events and their associated price tags bring very close to home the reality of what unchecked climate change would mean for us.
It is clear that the scale of a climate change problem is enormous and that it is pressing, and that is why the UK decided to make climate change a priority for our presidencies of both the G8 and the EU.
2005 has been a critical year for international climate change policy.
The Kyoto Protocol has entered into force.
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is up and running and we are due, at the end of the year, to begin discussions on further action beyond 2012, something to which I will return.
The G8 represents only a small â albeit key â group of countries, but the progress we have made there will, I hope, have a major impact.
The G8 summit discussions in July concluded with an ambitious communiquÃ©. It included agreement from all members, including the United States, on the role of human activity in global warming and on the need for urgent action.
There was also consensus on a package of actions to combat climate change through a diverse range of avenues: energy efficiency, cleaner power generation, research and development, financing of cleaner energy, managing the impacts of climate change, as well as combating illegal logging.
The G8 countries have engaged with the World Bank and other development banks to improve the harnessing of funding for clean technology and, crucially, they also agreed to begin a new dialogue between the G8 and other countries with significant energy needs on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development.
The first meeting of that dialogue took place in London on 1Â November.
Mexico has offered to host a second meeting next year.
The Member States of the European Union were some of the first in the 1990s to recognise the dangers of global warming, the link to human activity and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
As long ago as 1991 the Commission issued the first Community strategy aimed at limiting CO2 emissions and improving energy efficiency.
In the light of the EUâs commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, it soon became clear that more needed to be done.
So, in 2000 came the launch of the European climate change programme.
Today the EU is taking the lead, for example in focusing on emissions from aviation, and we warmly welcome the Commissionâs recent communication on reducing the climate change impacts of aviation.
Its announcement of support for the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is highly encouraging and we look forward to fostering progress in that area as a priority for our Presidency of the European Union.
Within Europe there is a clear recognition of the importance of energy efficiency in meeting the challenge posed by climate change and work is already under way to deliver energy efficiency savings throughout the Community.
The energy services directive which we hope to agree by the end of the year is expected to provide a challenging first step, while the Commissionâs Green Paper on energy efficiency published at the end of June should set the future blueprint for Europeâs energy efficiency strategy to 2020.
But despite all this work and effort, it is clear that emissions in the EU are not being reduced as quickly as we want and that urgent action is needed in all sectors, at both national and EU level.
So I applaud the Commissionâs decision to launch a new phase of the European climate change programme to look at what more can be done.
Alongside this, the Commission and Council are developing an EU medium- and long-term strategy for tackling climate change and will report on progress so far to the December European Council.
Parliamentâs input in this will be crucial, so the resolution that you have recently produced is an extremely valuable contribution to this process.
The UK Presidency has set out to create a fresh momentum in the wider international process in which the EU plays such a crucial role.
That is why we put climate change on the agenda of our EU summits with China and India.
These two countries are particularly important partners for the EU in tackling climate change.
Both summits included useful bilateral discussions on energy security and efficiency.
A key element of the partnership with China is a new initiative on near-zero emissions for coal, with carbon capture and storage, to address the vital challenge of tackling the increasing greenhouse gas emissions from coal.
We also agreed a new partnership with India.
The EU-Russia summit too was an excellent chance to consider what experiences we can share with regard to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, to ensure its mechanisms are up and running as soon as possible.
In September, for the first time, Ministers from the Agriculture Council met Environment Ministers to discuss the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the EU.
We also put climate change on the agenda of the Energy, Transport and Competitiveness Councils.
All this activity is leading to the first meeting in December of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Montreal, where, under the Protocol, parties will begin discussions on the next period after 2012.
Let me make it quite clear that the EU and the UK remain absolutely committed both to the Kyoto Protocol itself and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
As our Prime Minister Tony Blair said this week at the Lord Mayorâs banquet in London, the world needs a framework with the necessary targets, sensitively and intelligently applied over the right timeframe, that takes us beyond 2012.
Perhaps I could ask colleagues to take particular note of the use of the word âtargetsâ, because the UK has repeatedly stated that formal agreements with targets are absolutely essential in any international climate change regime, not least because they give incentive and certainty to the business community.
The informal G8 process is also hugely important, but it is complementary.
It is not, and was never intended to be, a substitute for the Kyoto Protocol or for the United Nations Convention.
I hope the work we have done this year through both presidencies will in fact be built on at Montreal.
Montreal will primarily be the celebration of a massive achievement: the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
There were times when it looked as though that might never happen, but the EU continued doggedly to work for such an outcome, and now here we are, with the worldâs only credible, binding international agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU set out our negotiating position for Montreal at the October Environment Council.
First, we want to agree the Marrakesh Accords â the decisions that will form the rulebook of the Protocol.
Secondly, we want to agree a compliance mechanism to ensure that parties to the Protocol keep to its rules.
Thirdly, we want to seek to improve the way the Kyoto mechanisms â and here I am talking mainly about the clean development mechanism â work.
Emissions trading, the CDM and joint implementation are all crucial elements to the Protocol and will remain essential in the years to come.
Finally, the Montreal Conference will look to the future and begin to discuss what happens when the first Kyoto commitment period ends in 2012.
This last issue is likely to be by far the most delicate, as well as the most important, element.
There is no question but that we want to build on the Kyoto Protocol post-2012 and that we have to launch a discussion under Article 3(9) of that Protocol to consider future commitments of the EU along with other Kyoto parties.
However, it is also quite clear that for a global climate change regime to be truly effective, we need broader participation than the Protocol currently offers.
At Montreal we will be looking for pathways towards a framework post-2012 which builds on and learns from the Kyoto Protocol as it stands and can include as many countries as possible.
The EU will clearly have to back our political ambition for the Montreal Conference of the Parties with real evidence that we are taking a lead in tackling climate change.
The Kyoto Protocol also stipulates that, by the end of 2005, parties must demonstrate their progress in meeting their Kyoto commitments.
This will be the ideal time for the EU to reaffirm our commitment to Kyoto, to meeting our emission reduction targets and to our obligations to assist developing countries.
In preparing for the conference, we are assembling data, facts and figures to show the practical application of our political commitment.
We know that we need to do more and we all stand ready to do more.
Todayâs debate here in Strasbourg will allow us to take stock of the current situation and offer us a further opportunity to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the EU takes this problem very seriously and is committed to delivering results.
Together we have already achieved a great deal; we have shown leadership and made a real difference.
We need to continue to do that and not falter as the environmental stakes get higher.
We will not see a resolution to the problem at Montreal, nor under the current UK Presidency of the EU.
We need future presidencies â both of the EU and of the G8 â to carry on this work, keeping climate change high on their agendas and tackling the major threats it poses to our economies, our society and our environment.
There are encouraging signs that the next G8 presidencies â Russia and Japan â fully intend to do so and I have every confidence in the EUâs continued determination to tackle this vital issue.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am particularly pleased to be given the opportunity to debate with you the recent developments surrounding climate change and the way in which the relevant policy of the European Union will be strengthened and the active involvement of all partners in productive international cooperation in this field will be achieved.
Today's debate is particularly important in the run-up to the forthcoming meeting of the parties in Montreal, which will be marked by the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol and discussions about the system to combat climate change after 2012.
We have all been worried by the recent succession of disasters.
We had a serious drought on the Iberian Peninsular this summer, we had floods during the summer in central Europe, we had a series of hurricanes â Katrina, Rita, Wilma â and other smaller-scale disasters.
2005 has already achieved an unprecedented record, in that 2005 was the year with the highest number of named tropical cyclones since records began.
Although specific weather phenomena cannot be connected directly to climate change, the increase in the phenomena of droughts and floods and the more serious and more frequent hurricanes or tropical storms nonetheless confirm scientific warnings about climate change.
The earth has probably never in its history heated up as quickly as it has over the last 30 years.
The 1990s were the hottest decade and nine of the ten hottest years in history fell between 1995 and 2004, with the hottest in 1998.
Scientists are expressing fears that 2005 may ultimately be the hottest year in history.
As we all know, when the planet heats up, the sea also heats up and when the temperature of the sea exceeds 26Â°C, then a tropical cyclone is likely to develop.
The temperature at the surface of the sea has increased at global level over the last 100 years to 0.6%, which means that we shall probably have much more frequent and stronger cyclones in future.
Nonetheless, rather than determining the extent to which hurricane Katrina or other weather phenomena were caused by human activity, it is more important that we draw lessons from these weather phenomena, so that we can win the battle against climate change.
I should like to refer in particular to Parliament's motion for a resolution on the communication entitled 'Winning the battle against global climate change' and I should like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their valuable and specific proposals.
The motion for a resolution emphasises that the Community strategy for restricting climate change must be based on an approach which includes the following: building on key elements of the Kyoto Protocol, strong reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union, the participation of all the main countries, such as the United States, the development of a strategic partnership with developing countries of crucial importance, vigorously promoting research and innovation and improving energy efficiency in the European Union.
I agree with and support this approach; the initiatives taken by the Commission this year in the field of climate change mostly go hand in hand with Parliament's proposal.
Allow me to make a brief general remark: in October, the Commission marked the beginning of a new era in the European programme on climate change at a major conference in Brussels which was attended by the main actors in the sector.
The new European programme on climate change will be a new framework for the policy which we exercise on climate change beyond 2012.
We address a series of new issues, such as aviation, and we also turn our attention to new technologies, such as carbon capture, which offer opportunities for taking financially efficient measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
As a first step, the Commission is setting up certain working parties. They include the working party which will review the progress made to date in implementing policies on climate change, the working party which will investigate carbon capture and storage in geological formations as a means of moderating climate change, the working party which will evaluate the integration of aviation into the Community greenhouse gas trading scheme, the working party which will prepare the review of the Community strategy on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from light commercial vehicles and the working party which will determine the necessary political adjustments which the European Union needs to follow.
Each of these working parties will determine specific new fields in which the European Union can step up its action to combat climate change.
The first of these working parties is expected to start submitting its final reports during the first half of next year.
As Mrs Beckett said, the Commission has also adopted a Green Paper on energy efficiency.
Similarly, I should like to refer to the Commission communication entitled 'Reducing the climate change impact of aviation'.
Aviation is making an increased contribution to emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Communication arrives at the conclusion that, in order to reduce these emissions, the best way is to integrate the aviation sector into the Community emissions trading scheme.
Following consultations with the interested parties, the Commission intends to submit the relevant legislative proposal by the end of 2006.
Of course, the Commission's initiatives are not confined solely to developing action within the European Union.
We take an active part in discussions with third countries and seek their opinion on the next steps which need to be taken during future negotiations on climate and on the creation of new structures to strengthen our political dialogue and technological cooperation.
Climate change and, in particular, its connections with energy and the secure supply of energy, are included in the priorities of our bilateral and multilateral contacts.
In this sector, we are cooperating closely with the British Presidency which, as Mrs Beckett said earlier, has placed climate change very high on the agenda for the G8 summit in Gleneagles and has constantly placed the issue of climate change on its list of priorities.
The results are encouraging.
The agreement on the partnership between the European Union and China on climate change and energy provides the political framework for closer cooperation and dialogue on these issues.
The main objective of the EU-China partnership is to develop advanced, almost zero-emission, carbon technology based on carbon capture and storage in biological formations.
Its other objectives are to promote other clean energy sources and energy efficiency, energy savings and renewable sources of energy.
The EU-India initiative on clean development and climate change makes provision for various initiatives in order to develop dialogue.
It emphasises cooperation on the development and evaluation of clean technologies, on the necessary adjustments to the heating of the planet and on the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.
The UN Climate Change Conference will start in Montreal in Canada at the end of the month and will last two weeks.
The Commission has participated actively in a series of unofficial meetings to prepare for the Montreal conference.
Our activities, both in the European Union and on the international stage, have played a serious role in shaping the conditions for the success of this conference.
What are our objectives in Montreal?
Firstly, the conference will mark the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, with the adoption of the rules and procedures required for its application.
Within this framework, it is important for us to demonstrate that the European Union is responding to its commitments.
Secondly, the intensive dialogue held over recent months has created important momentum, so that at the Montreal conference the debate will start at international level on the shape of the future international climate change strategy.
However, the achievement of the above objectives is not a foregone conclusion.
A small number of countries, headed by the United States, continue to be unwilling to participate in the dialogue on the future global strategy relating to climate change.
We shall need to step up our efforts over coming weeks, so that these countries also cooperate in starting the dialogue.
It is also important for us to realise that the Montreal conference will not be the end of the procedure; it will mark the beginning of the dialogue but it will not provide the solution.
The solution will only be found through an intensive international debate over coming years.
Through this dialogue, we need to find the solutions that will respond to the basic elements of the future climate strategy, as determined in the Commission's communication earlier this year.
These elements are reflected in Parliament's motion for a resolution: broader participation, coverage of all sectors and all gases, strengthening the development and use of new technologies, using means based on market mechanisms and finally, policies to adjust to the consequences of the increase in the heating of the planet.
To close, if there is to be a positive outcome from the dialogue, there must continue to be active political interest in the issue of climate change and the leading role of the European Union must be strengthened.
We need to demonstrate that we can reduce our emissions and that this contributes towards our economic development.
The motion for a resolution sends out a clear message that, in meeting this challenge, the Commission can always count on the support of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to convey my special thanks to MrsÂ Beckett, who was present in this Chamber today.
Climate change is one of the most serious threats we face.
I wish to emphasise that it can no longer be seen as an environmental problem.
A warmer climate is a less stable climate, entailing a threat to just about every sector of our society, a threat that must be designated as one of our security problems.
It is a security threat not only to the EU and its Member States but also, of course, to many poor countries in the tropics.
At the same time as saying that, I wish to emphasise that it is important not to see the climate issue merely as a problem and a burden.
If we do the right things, we can reduce the risks for society in the future.
If we do the right things, we can also open up opportunities for companies and technology in a range of areas.
The world boasts an association known as the Climate Group.
This includes a number of large companies, which show that it is possible both to reduce emissions and to earn a lot of money in a relatively short period.
I believe that the necessary transformation of energy and transport systems in our part of the world should become an important lever in the Lisbon Process and should be able to create some impetus for creating new jobs and export opportunities.
Parliamentâs report offers a list of proposed measures for the strategy after 2012.
We think that the EU should continue to play a leading role in climate change work at an international level.
MrsÂ Beckett has just confirmed in her speech that this is a view shared within the Council.
We must do more in the short term so that we really do comply with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
We are, however, at present responsible only for a portion of emissions, amounting to approximately 14%.
We must, then, involve other actors.
It is a matter of great urgency that, in the long run, we involve the United States in constructive cooperation.
We must establish long-term goals.
What we demand, and want to see, are reductions of 30% by 2020 and of 60% to 80% by 2050.
This is also a demand constantly heard from the business world, which says that it needs long-term ground rules.
The situation of the developing countries is, of course, incredibly important.
For them, energy is first and foremost a question of growth and development, but they need not repeat our mistakes.
We require strategic partnerships, especially with the large developing countries, in order to provide a stimulus for technological leaps forward and for investment in the best possible technology.
What has been introduced in this area through the Commissionâs agreement with China is, of course, extremely constructive, but it must take place on a larger scale and become very much more significant.
It should be borne in mind that, every month, China puts two new coal-fired power stations into operation.
We must invest more in research and development.
It is now a fact that governments throughout the world invest less in energy research as a proportion of GDP than they did 30 years ago.
That is quite incomprehensible to me.
I often compare this state of affairs with that which applied in relation to the Apollo project.
If the Americans were able to put a human being on the moon within ten years, we should, by means of huge efforts in the fields of research and development, be able to do something similar in terms of a breakthrough in new technologies.
In order to become politically credible, we must take vigorous measures at home.
We must give impetus to energy saving, something that has already been emphasised on several occasions.
This means that, for example, the Buildings Directive should be extended and made more ambitious.
The transport area is a very critical one.
We welcome the fact that shipping and aviation are to be included in climate policy.
We recommend rapid measures designed to make railway transport more efficient.
We think that we must draw the right conclusions from the difficulties in reducing road traffic emissions.
We need, and therefore propose, ambitious and binding rules governing carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles.
We need to help put new technologies â which do exist â on the market.
There are, however, a great many obstacles.
One of these is, of course, the fact that we continue to subsidise conventional technology, that is to say technology powered by fossil fuels.
We need to develop emissions trading, but we must of course ensure that the allowance is not as ambitious as it was last year.
Instead, we must lower the ceiling step by step.
We must invite other actors to participate in this process so that we in Europe do not become the only market.
The majority of the measures proposed in the report are aimed at companies and manufacturers.
We also think there needs to be more active involvement on the part of our citizens.
The life-styles of all of us affect developments.
We have an idea about, in the long run, considering some form of emissions trading at the level of the individual.
Perhaps that is impossible to implement in practice, but a first step should be to increase knowledge both of the carbon content of everything we buy and of the carbon emitted by our forms of transport.
We in Parliament and in the European institutions should naturally practise what we preach.
We should ensure that, for example, our buildings and forms of transport go as easy on carbon as possible.
There is a lot to do in this area.
In conclusion, I want to wish both the Commission and the Council good luck in Montreal.
You must ensure that the EU can continue to play a leading role and you must propel international work on climate change in the direction of achieving positive results.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Development, I should like to begin by congratulating our fellow Member, MrÂ Wijkman, on his excellent report on climate change.
As draftsman of this committee, I should like to make a few brief remarks of a general nature.
Our fellow Member is right to emphasise that, although global warming represents an environmental challenge, it is above all a challenge for development.
In actual fact, climate change is, in our opinion, a real concern for civilisation.
That is why our committee was keen to highlight that the combined effects of climate change, of worldwide demographic changes and of economic globalisation open the doors to an unprecedented period of instability in the history of humankind.
There are indeed grounds for fearing that, in this context, global warming will increase the divide between the developed world and countries whose development is lagging behind.
There is, unfortunately, no doubt that these countries will be affected most by the impacts of climate change.
This is particularly the case as regards the small island states, which are vulnerable in more ways than one, above all in the face of hurricanes and of rising sea levels.
That is why we believe that providing aid to enable these countries to adapt in the face of the impacts of climate change must be one of the priorities of the European Unionâs development aid policy.
We recommend that the European Union develop a specific cooperation policy for developing countries.
You will have realised that, as far as the Committee on Development is concerned, the fight against climate change is therefore irrevocably tied to the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
The report is also right to emphasise the mitigation efforts that still need to be made in order to achieve the Kyoto Protocolâs objectives.
Just one question to conclude, MadamÂ President: while, today, 20% of the planetâs population consumes 80% of the worldâs energy, how polluted will the atmosphere be in around 2050 at a time when the energy requirements of between nine and ten billion people will have to be met?
Â Â  . Madam President, it is clear that climate change is so intense and so close to us that it is no longer an intellectual problem or a problem affecting certain more sensitive groups which had raised the issue.
This is an opportunity to change our habits and customs, it is an opportunity to reduce emissions and to create cleaner air, it is an opportunity to develop renewable and alternative energy sources and it is also an opportunity for Europe to look at its dependence on fossil fuels, often in areas with great political instability and subject to dramatic price fluctuations.
I therefore believe that it also opens up the opportunity to look again at nuclear energy as one of the many solutions, in addition to other alternatives.
We must still greatly improve research into and knowledge of the causes of climate change.
For example, very little research has been done on the relationship between agriculture and climate change.
Recent research has raised an alarm and opened up another direction; we are only blaming industry for the problem.
I believe that we should create an intelligent form of agriculture which is geared towards those strategies; that would be much safer from a scientific point of view.
Furthermore, I believe that we must also make improvements in relation to quotas, the mathematical models for setting quotas; there are still many countries that are not doing so correctly, while others have found good solutions, such as the British.
I also believe that we must seek strategies for compensating for climate change and determining the extent to which it can be alleviated.
I believe that we must review our policy on drought and desertification in the Mediterranean and deal with the suffering and deterioration of the eco-system and of our animal resources and fauna.
Â Â  . Madam President, we have seen the faces of the victims of the New Orleans hurricane and flood.
Global warming does not mean actual warming in every single part of the world.
It means a growing number of disasters, for instance weather irregularities, huge losses of lives and valuables.
We simply use too much fossil energy.
If the developing nations, including almost three billion people in China and India, follow the American way of consumption then we will burn up our planet.
That is why on behalf of the Socialist Group I welcome MrÂ Wijkmanâs brave report.
Nice words are not enough, however.
We have to urge our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
We have to find allies for this goal among broadminded politicians and citizens in the US who understand the importance of sustainable development.
In order to reduce emissions we need a strong shift to public transport.
Rail is five times more efficient than road transport.
Furthermore, it is environmentally friendly.
But the European Union still lacks the proper tools to encourage it.
The EU does not have any projects to improve urban public transport, and the growing number of cars in our cities means that urban life is becoming more and more chaotic and unhealthy.
Our urban population deserves more care from us as politicians as regards clean air and good public transport.
Renewable energies are developing in some countries, but in other Member States only a few steps have been taken.
We need binding targets if not for 2010 then at least for 2020.
There is one point on which I would contradict MrsÂ Beckett.
I think that semi-solutions such as carbon storage cannot be a solution for the future.
Instead of hiding our growing emissions temporarily, we have to reduce them.
If a nuclear power station is to be closed down for any reason it should be replaced only by renewable energies.
Closing nuclear power stations and using more fossil energy would be a kind of collective suicide.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission and Council for their statements.
I have to say though that I do not share Mrs Beckettâs upbeat assessment of how the European Union is doing, despite the British Governmentâs pledge to make climate change a priority for its Presidency.
Progress on the ground has been very disappointing.
Hearing the G8 communiquÃ© on climate change being called ambitious stretches the English language almost to breaking point.
If the British Presidency is genuinely going to show international leadership on this subject, then it has to get its own house in order first.
Earlier this year, we commissioned a report from the Association for the Conservation of Energy to assess how well this government has been implementing existing European laws on reducing fossil-fuel use.
Their findings made clear that this is a government which has delayed implementation of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, demanded an increase in the UKâs level of CO2 emissions permitted under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, failed to set binding targets for energy-demand reduction under the energy services directive, and failed to promote small-scale combined heat and power plants in line with the cogeneration directive.
This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliamentâs report on climate change, which has been expertly drafted by Anders Wijkman.
There they will find a genuinely bold and ambitious call to action.
In particular, the report demands strong emission reductions at home, starting with 20% to 30% domestic reductions in the EU by 2020, increasing to between 60% and 80% by 2050.
It calls for the goal to make Europe the most energy-efficient economy in the world by setting targets for annual reduction in energy of the order of 2.5% to 3% and for a robust strategy for Montreal.
And, in our amendment, the Greens are calling on the EU to ensure a formal mandate and timetable for negotiating future climate commitments with a time limit for achieving agreement at the end of 2008.
I want to end with two quick questions for the Council.
First, what is its view on contraction and convergence as a framework for future action?
Second, alongside the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading scheme, will the Council propose instruments in parallel to tackle the full climate impact of aviation since, as we know, the Emissions Trading Scheme will not cover emissions that are not CO2 related?
Â Â  .
Madam President, to cut straight to the point, a free market system is not the best solution to the problem of climate change.
An unbridled free-market economy without any restrictions to excess consumption and products leads to the increasing emission of greenhouse gases and thus exacerbates the problem.
Economic growth is like a sacred cow: it is sacrosanct, with each and every consumer product required to be available on the market across the world at the same time.
We have to remember, though, that sacred cows can also spread harmful gases, and that is not just metaphorically the case, but also literally true, if one considers the proportion of intensive cattle farming in the level of CO2 emissions.
The nuclear energy lobby has seized the issue of climate change to put itself back on the map.
Strangely, they do not breathe a word about the enormous waste mountains they create for us and which will present us with major problems for the next ten thousand years.
We should not attempt to solve one environmental crisis by creating another.
The billions that are still being pumped into the development and promotion of nuclear energy could be spent more wisely on wind, solar and hydraulic energy.
Emission levels in the transport sector will, in 2030, still be 28% above the 1990 level.
Its symbolic value for an international free market economy makes it a difficult sector in which to take measures, and so I would call for taxes on air and maritime transport.
In contrast to the trade in emission rights, we cannot, by means of taxation, pass the problem to developing countries.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I am impressed with the work schedule presented in this House yesterday by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.
It contains many valid points with regard to beating climate change too.
For example, I warmly support the inclusion of air traffic within the scope of the emission trade system, as well as the revision of the Directive on national emission ceilings, which dates back to 2001.
Even so, the Commission has not, to my mind, been very ambitious in this respect.
For years, we have been discussing drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but emission levels are still increasing year after year, not only worldwide, but also within the various Member States.
If we want to be taken seriously in Montreal, we should not only dare mention reductions, but also commit to really taking measures this time.
If necessary, we should involve a smaller number of countries.
I urge Commissioner Dimas to present a strategy that contains measures which can help us achieve our long-term goal, for despite the positive effect the proposals that have been presented here this week have had, it is only short-term vision that inspires them.
Â Â  .
Madam President, a decade ago there was much speculation about climate change, but today it is very much a reality as we see the future unfolding before our eyes. The Arctic people see it in disappearing Arctic ice; the shantytown dwellers of Latin America and southern Asia see it in lethal storms and floods; Europeans see it in disappearing glaciers, forest fires and fatal heatwaves.
In Brazil this year, for example, while hurricanes thousands of miles away battered the United States and the Caribbean with water and wind, residents of a small fishing town deep in the Amazon region watched the lake on which they depend for food and transportation shrivel away in a year which saw the regionâs worst drought in four decades: the result of warmer ocean water, which has also been blamed for one of the most violent hurricane seasons on record in the Gulf of Mexico.
The signing of the ratification protocol for Kyoto by some of the major players has been a much-welcomed event.
The Kyoto Protocol is off life support because the Russian Federation ratified it.
However, major players now need to be more proactive in convincing countries with the highest levels of pollution: the United States and developing countries.
I remain deeply concerned that the United States continues to choose to tackle the climate change issue through unilateral activities.
Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem.
If carbon dioxide is not reduced, the Arctic ice cover will disappear. That will affect the quality of life in particular of those living in coastal regions and island communities.
That is a scientific fact, not a passionate policy comment on my part.
Ireland is much more energy efficient than it was a decade ago.
I encourage other Member States to follow suit.
Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy, but complacency in dealing with it is far worse.
