It has become G8 practice to arrange an outreach meeting with some Heads of State and Government from developing countries.
In this vein, the Italian hosts have invited leaders from South Africa, Nigeria, Mali, Algeria, Bangladesh and El Salvador to attend a working session and a dinner which should focus mainly on the poverty reduction strategy and the global health fund.
As I said earlier, this part of the summit will also be attended by the UN Secretary-General, as well as by the President of the World Bank and the heads of the World Trade Organisation, the World Health Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
The G8 is not an organisation or an institution.
It is not based on a treaty, it does not have a secretariat.
The Group of 8 is an annual gathering of democratically elected leaders of the leading nations of the world.
The European Commission is invited to participate, not least in view of its trade and other responsibilities on behalf of the whole Union.
As in the past, Mr Prodi intends to make full use of this opportunity to convey the views and positions of the European Union.
It is not enough that world leaders meet and discuss these issues between themselves, however.
They must listen to the concerns of third countries and civil society and then enter into dialogue with them.
That is why the G8 is increasingly organising side events and meetings with third countries and civil society alongside the summit.
I have already mentioned the outreach meetings with other leaders.
The Japanese last year added an NGO centre in Okinawa.
The Italians continue this year with a number of meetings that have already taken place and others set to take place on the eve of the summit.
The Commission has extensive experience in its own relations and consultations with civil society - we have been keen to share our knowledge with G8 members, and we hope the encouragement of this type of dialogue will continue and will be developed further.
I will just make one final point.
However much one agrees or disagrees with some representatives of civil society on issues such as globalisation, it seems to me exceptionally important to have an open dialogue which is not disfigured by street violence.
Some of the scenes we have seen surrounding recent summits and meetings have, I think, sadly made it more difficult for legitimate representatives of civil society to get their point across to the leaders who are present.
I feel that is a tragedy.
It very unfairly devalues the case which those legitimate NGOs have to make, and I very much hope that they will make that point and that those who have been guilty of violence in the past will get the message.
Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his words, but I cannot fail to express my deep regret at the fact that Parliament has not dedicated a wide debate, which could maybe have ended with a joint motion, to a matter which is so important and so affects our societies and public opinion.
It is strange that a summit with an agenda which is so sensitive to global governance issues should receive such severe, groundless criticism.
Clearly, there has been a problem and there still is, not just of communication but also of democratic participation, not the participation envisaged by the violent antiglobalisation protesters but the participation that we see in national parliaments.
The market will not be the only subject of discussion at Genoa, then.
Quite the contrary: in actual fact, the agenda is wholly centred around the fight against poverty.
Fighting against poverty means, first and foremost, employment and the fair redistribution of the wealth derived from the process of globalisation.
As an economist, I would remind the antiglobalisation protestors that wealth has to be created before it can be distributed.
However, if Europe's goal of full employment is to be more than just the egotistic vision of a wealthy Community, it must be translated into a global objective of accompanying the process of liberalisation of free trade with active employment policies which will help to produce active societies and thus lead to social inclusion: by overcoming what is known as the digital divide, by building up human capital, by promoting self-employment.
Making employment a priority must lead to the widespread introduction of minimum levels of protection for all people.
Fighting against poverty means improving cooperation between the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the ILO and the WTO in order to integrate macro-economic stability and development policies with social policies.
As you can see, a great deal has changed since the summits of the mid-'70s.
As Commissioner Patten pointed out, on the first day of the Genoa Summit, the Heads of State and Government, who will be the guests of the Italian President, will meet with the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, the Director-General of the FAO, the Director-General of the WTO, the Director-General of the WHO and the President of the World Bank, and also with the Presidents of Nigeria, South Africa and Algeria, who launched the support and development plan for Africa.
The G8 Summit is certainly an exercise in global governance which can and must be fine-tuned but, already today, its foundations are much wider than those of the summits held during the seventies and eighties.
Madam President, at Genoa on 20 July next, the eight major economic powers will be in full view of the world, tackling a full agenda which includes poverty, the environment and the fight against AIDS.
I hope that the resources used to make the G8 possible will be matched by the capacity to find suitable solutions to current tragedies.
Italy has endeavoured to prepare the ground on these topics as well as possible; the new government appears to want to continue in the same vein as the previous one: I refer to the 20% of the world's population who consume 83% of the planet's resources, to the 1.3 billion human beings who live on one dollar a day, to the planet's changing climate.
The legitimacy of these summits is not in question but, quite apart from the fact that they have no real influence, they do suffer from a terrible deficit of representation - and by that I mean not just the representation of the poorest countries - which is a very serious problem - but, for example, the way the European Union itself is represented.
Therefore, all this must not detract from the urgent need to make international institutions such as the United Nations and its Economic and Social Committee and the World Trade Organisation, not to mention the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, credible, effective and democratic, with a view to creating institutions which are able to reestablish a connection between politics and economics, between government and market in terms of global trends which, hitherto, have favoured the liberalisation of the movement of capital and speculative investment over direct investment.
With regard to the agenda, it is right to tackle the issue of the external debt of the poorest countries, but we must do more than that through the 'Everything but arms' proposal; we must support the International Labour Organisation strategy; we must work towards higher-quality employment to avoid condemning the poorest countries to gaining access to markets primarily on the basis of social dumping; we must ratify the Kyoto Protocol; we must support the strategy of the African countries such as South Africa in the fight against AIDS through the global health fund mentioned by Commission Patten.
Will these decisions be taken at Genoa?
We hope so and we feel that pressure from this great, diverse movement is important in this sense.
I too feel, however, that, in addition to being an unacceptable medium for political expression, violence, whatever form it takes and whoever it is perpetrated by, is ultimately intended to divert attention away from the real issues - Commissioner Patten is right in that respect - and to exploit the media coverage of these events for subversive purposes which have nothing to do with the resolution of the issues at hand.
Madam President, last week I took part in a conference in Stockholm, during which, at the request of his African friends, the African chairman of the plenary session, to which I contributed, began the session with the following words: 'I was asked to bring back to Africa the cure for AIDS, the cure for poverty, the cure for political conflict and the cure for non-availability of information technology - the four diseases that are increasing the already wide gap between North and South' .
It was not of course without reason that he said this.
In 1960, the richest 20% of the world' s population had an income 30 times greater than that of the poorest 20%.
In 1990, the figure was 60% and in 1997 it was 74%, and there is no doubt that it has increased since 1997.
According to statistics in 'The Economist' of 16 June, the world has more rich people than ever before.
The unfortunate conclusion he drew following the meeting was, 'So it seems that I have to return to Africa without the cure for our four ongoing major crises' .
We have a problem with many of our meetings.
How much real success is there in changing things?
We can hope that the G8 meeting, at which the individual EU countries, the Commission and the presidency are represented, can perhaps play its part in moving things on a little.
If these meetings do not succeed in producing more striking results, there is of course the risk that the fear of globalisation will become greater and that we shall therefore see still larger demonstrations, for part of the problem is, of course, that people in general simply think that globalisation is a bad thing, while we politicians are of the opinion that it should, in a way, be a good thing and we know that it could, in fact, be so.
However, we fail to see the results, and the documents we obtain indicate greater and greater differences.
I therefore hope that we get to tackle some of the real problems.
I would therefore urge the Commission - and not, therefore, Mr Patten but obviously Mr Prodi - really to focus upon the desperation of the developing countries, for this is of course the world' s greatest problem today.
When the discussion turns to setting up a fund, providing debt relief etc., one must also remember to talk about 'additional money' so that we leave behind the situation in which it is the same money that circulates through the system and is never paid out.
Madam President, I warmly welcome Commissioner Patten's reassurance that poverty reduction will be a key issue on the G8 agenda.
Theoretically, the G8 governments are committed to achieving the UN development targets by 2015, including universal primary education.
Over a year ago, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, those same governments promised that no country serious about achieving education for all should fail for lack of resources.
Those are fine words, but where are the resources and where is the debt relief?
The G8 should cancel now all IMF and World Bank debts for countries committed to those 2015 development targets.
Those same objectives are shared by hundreds of civil society groups across the European Union, and many thousands of individuals care so much about those issues that they will travel to Genoa to take part in peaceful demonstrations to draw the world's attention to the need for urgent action on these issues.
May I end with the hope that the world's media will listen to them and will report their concerns and give far less attention to those tiny numbers of people who may be involved in violence, but who all too often drown out the legitimate concerns of the many thousands of peaceful, but passionate protestors.
Madam President, in our opinion, the new development at Genoa will not be the G8 Summit but, on the contrary, the meeting of the opposition movement.
Many social and political organisations, including ourselves, see the G8 as illegitimate, as an expression of a serious tendency to take important decisions away from the sovereign powers.
We are not the only ones to feel this: the entire Catholic episcopacy of the host region has declared itself to be of the same opinion.
After the Gothenburg tragedy, it would have been wise to suspend the G8 meeting.
Sometimes, it is a sign of wisdom not to resort to a display of strength; there is the risk that Europe will be catapulted backwards in time to when the forces of the law used to fire on the demonstrations held at the time by the workers' movement.
This G8 Summit has become a futile display of power, an exaltation of the participants' own authority, but there are many who have lost confidence in it.
They have lost confidence in it because globalisation cannot hide the damage it is doing in the world: it inevitably provokes crises, it is exacerbating injustices between north and south, it is not resolving the problems of poverty and illness but generating deep, widespread uncertainty regarding man's future and the future of the environment.
As a result, it is those who are against the G8, the movements of civil society who are now speaking to the world; the young people from wealthy countries are speaking out on behalf of the poor countries of the world and their people. They are finding that demands for democracy and participation are not being met.
They see the demands of individuals, the environment and groups calling for social justice.
The watchword of the demonstrators is: 'Another world is possible'.
This slogan is adopted by workers fighting for employment and proper salaries and by peasant farmers fighting for a different type of farming and for a response to the problems of hunger in the world alike, by all those fighting for a better future.
Where is Europe?
Europe remains silent.
I feel that we have a lot to learn from the lesson that, while Europe is silent, a great religious force such as the Catholic Church succeeds in expressing more effectively and interpreting the requirements of the civil society of this great continent, expressing all the criticism of the illegitimacy of this summit and of the inability to manage the great processes of world modernisation.
Madam President, in recent weeks, surveys of public opinion have been carried out, and it is with great surprise that I have to say that one result that has emerged is that the majority of Italians share the concerns of the G8 protesters.
This certainly does not mean that the majority of Italians support the violence we have witnessed on other occasions and which we fear will be displayed this time as well.
Of course, I am not among those who advocate violence, nor are most Italians, but this does mean that, in Italy - and, I would argue, in many other countries in the world - there is a real, deep-rooted concern at a type of world globalisation which is not what a large part of the population wished to see.
It would be a great mistake to see this as a question of right- or left-wing politics.
This is a question which concerns basic problems faced by man.
Indeed, it is an issue of great relevance precisely to those such as myself who have liberal tendencies, for one of our greatest concerns is that globalisation of the economy might come to pass without there being any rules to govern the process, which might well have worse consequences.
This brings great opportunities for Europe, but also great responsibility.
Great opportunities because, in actual fact, trends and ideas are currently developing in Europe which could provide at least a partial response to the problems of globalisation.
In the field of human rights, with regard to protection of the environment, with regard to minorities and the establishment of the citizens, with regard to diversity and the acceptance of differences, Europe is spontaneously largely in agreement.
This is shown by the almost unanimous position adopted on the Kyoto Protocol, by the battle to abolish the death penalty and to uphold respect for human rights and by the cohesion policy - as yet maybe not sufficient but still important - that we are developing.
At the same time, this highlights our responsibility as well, for these results are not political results now; as yet we do not have a Europe which upholds these ideals before the world, just individual countries.
Indeed, the image which will emerge from the Genoa Summit is a picture in which Europe does not appear, a picture, that is, which is in danger of being dominated by the one great superpower.
That is not the fault of the superpower, mind you: it is due precisely to the absence of what could have been a continent which takes a different line but is willing to do something about the concerns of such a large part of the human race.
Well then, there are two things we must do: one is to explore this idea, this debate in detail.
I believe that there are some extremely important things we could do ourselves: for example, the idea of going to the forthcoming summit on the environment with a united voice, with one single voice, the voice of Europe; the possibility of developing the idea of internal cohesion.
There is also a problem enlarging funds: a Europe which dedicated more of its resources to a policy - which has already had partial success - of improving certain economically deprived areas, would have great influence.
However, in addition to this, we need comprehensive political action.
If the voices remain the voices of individual countries, as they have been thus far, they will carry even less weight at the world summit.
If, however, we succeed in making progress on the road to European integration and we succeed in ensuring that it is not just some European countries which go to important world summits but Europe, acting with one voice, we will have contributed to resolving not just the problems of Europe but the problems of the world as well.
The Italian government is making progress in seeking dialogue with all the social players.
However, at this point, something further is necessary: there needs to be great drive from the European Union towards integrating the other countries so that these ideas, these hopes, which we are rightly striving to fulfil, are expressed by an entity which is powerful enough to be influential.
That entity cannot be any individual State; Europe must act as a whole.
Commissioner, as far as possible, globalisation must mean globalisation of rights and freedoms.
Therefore, I welcome, first and foremost, the 'Everything but arms' proposal, the Commission's initiative seeking to abolish customs duties for the poorest countries unilaterally.
This is a response of economic freedom which we must pursue to the end, apart from anything else because, in this way, we will be better able to respond to those who blame globalisation for the wretchedness and exploitation of entire peoples and areas of our planet, peoples who are exploited by their tyrant rulers, peoples who are exploited by economies which are, more often than not, closed and autarkic.
It is not true, therefore, that economic freedom and the opening-up of the markets are sending peoples to their ruin: in this respect, the initiative of unilateral abolishment of customs barriers is politically fundamental.
However, the globalisation of rights is also fundamental, and someone participating in the summit should make that clear not just to the States taking part but the whole world. Abolition of the death penalty and a universal moratorium on executions throughout the world; 60 ratifications for the International Criminal Court; a global fight against female genital mutilation: there you are; this is the kind of globalisation that the citizens would welcome.

Thus, the problem arises not so much of illegitimacy but of lack of rules or procedures.
It is not enough for the non-governmental organisations alone to participate and the so-called representatives of civil society; this is a problem affecting all the citizens.
Why then should the G8 Summit not be broadcast on-line, where all the citizens could connect and see the agenda, the debates, what is being decided and who is making the decisions?
They have a right to know what is going on.
The G8 is not an institution but it is still bound to be transparent in its work and decisions and to make them public.
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, our world leaders will be meeting in Genoa in just over two weeks' time.
The topic of debate will be globalisation and, specifically, the fight against poverty, the environment and conflict prevention.
The streets of Genoa will once again be teeming with demonstrators.
Unfortunately, the images of the rioting and stone-throwing minority will again attract a great deal of TV and media attention.
I condemn this minority, for a stone is neither right nor left-wing, it is simply destructive.
I do support, however, the protest of the minority of peaceful campaigners who oppose a world trade system which leads to the unequal distribution of wealth.
World trade has never flourished more than it has now.
It remains therefore shocking that the 20 richest countries earn, on average, 37 times more than the 20 poorest countries.
A divide which, forty years ago, was only half that size.
Poor countries, and particularly the poor population of those countries, do not benefit from worldwide prosperity.
Nearly half of the world population has to survive on less than USD 2 a day, and one fifth of the world population lives under the internationally recognised, absolute poverty line of USD 1 per day.
In the light of this, it is, and remains, entirely unacceptable for the developing countries to be forced to open their markets to our products, while all kinds of trade barriers in the West appear to constitute an impossible hurdle for the developing countries to negotiate.
The European Union has taken an initial step with the exemplary 'Everything but arms' initiative.
Europe must now keep the momentum going.
I would especially call on all other Western industrial superpowers, including the United States, that are now grossly neglecting their duty to follow in the footsteps of this European initiative.
Similarly, a fresh WTO round is only credible if it actually becomes a development round.
World trade with the intention of fighting poverty.
That would be a powerful incentive on the road to the fair distribution of wealth.
We need much more than that, however.
Due to a lack of political commitment, the international agreements, such as universal access to primary education and basic health care by 2015, will not be achieved.
Even in 2001, 130 million children never attend school and another 150 million children start primary education only to stop it before they can read and write.
The AIDS epidemic is causing an unheard of social breakdown in the developing countries.
Financial pledges in Genoa for an international fund for poverty-related illnesses are, of course, laudable and particularly newsworthy, but they remain the proverbial drop in the ocean if those same donors do not even meet the international agreements: 0.7% of the gross national product for development aid.
That also applies to Member States such as England and Germany, but mainly to the United States which trails behind with 0.1%.
The topic of instability within the financial world markets will also be discussed in Genoa.
In my opinion, it would be useful if the combined world leaders were to back the intention of the Belgian Presidency to study the scope of a Tobin tax on international high-speed capital.
It is precisely this form of tax levy, much maligned by, inter alia, the United States that can prevent financial crises, and the profit from this could subsequently be invested in development projects.
I shall be assessing the G8 Summit on the basis of actual political commitment to fight poverty.
That requires decisive measures, compliance with existing international agreements and the will to put global interests above the sometimes very narrowly formulated, national, economic or industrial interests.
Madam President, G8 summits looked like becoming a routine sort of affair.
That has now changed and more and more people are recognising that they are moving away from economic and financial issues and beginning to take on the role of a sort of world government.
That generates mistrust and encourages rejection.
We may bemoan the weaknesses of the UN, but it is accredited by the international community, as is UNCTAD, although UNCTAD appears to be in a state of enforced inertia.
By contrast, the G7 or G8 have devised their own mandate, acting purely on the strength of their economic clout or clout in general, in their bid to rule the world.
The neoliberal policy promoted as a result widens rather than narrows the gulf between north and south and speeds up the rate at which developing countries fall into poverty and debt.
Anyone who criminalises resistance on the part of those who oppose globalisation in general - as has already happened, not that I condone violence - is guilty of hushing things up and confusing cause and effect.
We should be looking for alternatives to neoliberal policies, not deploying riot police and cancelling agreements on tourism.
What we need is for attention to be paid to our citizens' interests - that is what the European Union should be committing to. We should be safeguarding these interests and making sure there is no room for what is currently happening.
Madam President, in an article in an Italian newspaper today, President Prodi refers to the conclusions of the Gothenburg Summit on sustainable development as an example of directing globalisation towards objectives of world redistribution of wealth and protection of the environment.
I will focus on this last aspect.
It is true that Gothenburg incorporated the environmental dimension into the economic and social dimension.
Protecting the environment is no longer merely a moral matter but an opportunity for a new wave of innovation that will generate growth and employment.
The political importance is clear: this is a point of no return for the Member States but also for the candidate countries and third countries.
Following the announcement that the United States wishes to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, this is a genuine declaration of intent with a view to the forthcoming international events: Genoa, of course, but then, more specifically, Bonn and, after that, Johannesburg in 2002.
However, the point is this: even when they produce such major results, the great international summits do not succeed in communicating with what are known as the Seattle movements and, above all, do not connect with that much deeper, much more widespread, silent demand for security on the lips of the citizens, the submerged base of an iceberg whose tip is represented by the raft of different types of protests.
Why?
Why then is dialogue so difficult, not to say impossible?
Of course, there is an element of parading before the media at these summits which is no longer tolerable.
However, I also feel that confidence in the ability of politicians to implement these types of commitments has crumbled.
There are many reasons why and we too bear some responsibility.
Even at Gothenburg, when we needed to move on from words to action it was put off to a later date. There was no Sustainability Council, no time frame, no tangible reference to the implementation of environmentally friendly rules.
When will these things happen?
Madam President, the economy needs to be managed differently from the way it is now; it must not just be controlled by a few but at least be subject to democratic supervision.
Like all economic processes, globalisation is not a natural phenomenon but a worldwide process we have to contend with, taking all the factors at all levels into consideration.
For this reason, we need to influence the way globalisation is managed, working to achieve a democratic perspective, giving the people and governments back a role of supervision and management.
To this end, we will be at Genoa demonstrating peacefully against the G8, and nobody can take away our right to demonstrate.
However, we do warn you of the serious danger represented by organised groups who will be there with the declared objective of starting fights and creating violence on the streets, and we therefore request all those who are going to take part in the demonstrations to publicly disassociate themselves unambiguously, from this moment onwards, from action by irresponsible groups, and to make a commitment as of now to isolating and neutralising the troublemakers.
Madam President, G8 summits are in fact an attempt to find global political answers to the globalisation of the markets, which is now a fact of life.
We need these political answers.
What would make me very happy, however, would be if we could take stock of the G8 summits and find out if their agreements had brought in any results.
I need only quote the very specific problem of children in armed conflicts and protection for these children to illustrate that, unfortunately, we have not made much headway at all here, despite the fact that the G8 has already passed an agreement on this subject.
Apart from the very important question of how we can help the poorest developing countries, the question of an improved world trade order as a means of improving the situation in the developing countries is also quite rightly on the agenda.
I would also like to see the G8 summit express a desire to create an international competitive order within the world trade order, and not just confined to specific regions of the world.
This is all the more important now that a summit issue which has never yet been on the agenda, is also set to become the subject of discussion and consultation, namely the gloomy prospects for growth in the world economy.
I really hope that the optimism of the Heads of Government at the summit will help to kick start the economy again because we are in dire need of sustainable growth both in the USA and in other regions of the world; even Europe is not immune to developments in other regions of the world.
In this context I should like to call once again for the Heads of State and Government to put the subject of a new financial architecture on the agenda.
We need financial stability on the markets.
If there is no financial stability on the markets, this adversely affects the world economy and our own economies.
The Heads of State and Government also need to express a desire and call for the private sector to be involved in managing crises on the financial markets.
I really cannot stress enough that stability on the financial markets is a public asset which is most definitely in the common good.
I would like to make two brief responses to this debate.
Two points which should be obvious to all of us, as democrats concerned about issues such as global social equity, but nevertheless important to make.
First of all, most speakers in this short but interesting debate, with one unfortunate exception, have drawn a clear distinction between violence and open discussion of the serious issues which will be on the agenda at Genoa.
There is a real danger in occasionally implying that there is a moral equivalence between people who go to these conferences with a balaclava helmet in their back pocket, prepared for violence against police officers and against property they do not like, and the democratically elected leaders of the governments who are meeting in the city where the demonstrations are taking place.
Once you blur that distinction, it seems to me that you are on a very slippery slope indeed.
At GÃ¶teborg, I do not believe that a government could have made a greater effort to involve civil society in the discussion of what was happening.
We still saw those scenes of violence on the streets of that otherwise peaceful city, however.
So I think it is very important that the message from a democratically elected assembly like this is very clear: that there is no moral equivalence between violent demonstrators and those who are elected.
Secondly, I will not trouble the Chamber with a detailed exposÃ© of my views on globalisation, but I want to make one obvious point.
While it is true that most people have done better out of globalisation this time round, with the combination of opening markets and technology.
It is also the case that too many poor people in rich countries have been left behind and too many poor countries have been left behind.
Too many poor people face not the opportunities of globalisation but the challenges of globalisation; the dark side of globalisation. The transmittable diseases; the drug trafficking; the illegal trafficking in human beings; the transnational crime; the environmental degradation; and the sheer grinding poverty.
The only way you can address issues, such as the decline in aid flows during the 1990s, is through multilateral efforts.
Now how you make multilateral efforts without world leaders coming together as they will in Genoa later this month beats me!
You need the democratic leaders of the world to get together to focus on these problems and then to try to give some impetus to solving them.
The problem is not that we have these summits, though I wish the media would focus rather more on what is actually discussed at them rather than what happens on the fringes.
The problem is not the holding of these summits, the problem is ensuring that the institutions which then try to follow up the summits have the maximum legitimacy and credibility with the world's citizens.
They will only achieve that if we are more successful in making multilateral solutions stick.
Therefore, when we talk about the Kyoto Protocol at Genoa, it is very important that we are able to do so in a way which leads to action on climate change and not the collapse of what has been an extremely important effort by the international community to address a major change.
I do not understand those who say that we should not have G8 meetings.
I would have responded as well to what Mr Bertonotti had to say about the role of the churches.
As a member of the church he referred to, I have some views about the way it could contribute rather more to the debate about universal human rights as well to the debate about social equity, but since Mr Bertonotti was unfortunately not able to stay until the end of this debate, I will sit down.
The debate is closed.
Recreational craft
The next item is the report (A5-0218/2001) by Mr Callanan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to recreational craft.
It is interesting how, in this House we move seamlessly from global economic policy and world summits to the technical regulations of exhaust and sound level emissions from recreational craft in Europe: such is the broad sweep of politics dealt with in this place.
I believe strongly that we must always be extremely wary in Europe of over-regulation, of using 'a sledge-hammer to crack a nut', of introducing unnecessary, cumbersome and bureaucratic regulations.
To put this directive into perspective, recreational craft in the EU are responsible for less than half of 1% of all exhaust emissions in the Union and if it is the case that this regulation turns out to have severe impacts on small boat owners, driving them unnecessarily off the waterways, then sadly this will merely increase disenchantment with Europe among many of our citizens.
In my own country we have a very thriving small canal boat industry to which Commissioner Patten has just referred.
As a former Member of Parliament in the West Country, he will know that industry extremely well.
It is composed of many historic craft, the potential for tourism is extremely great and we must be careful to ensure that they are not regulated out of existence.
It consists of many small enterprises and enthusiasts.
The object of this proposal is to complete the internal market and to protect the health of users and third parties in Europe: those are indeed laudable aims.
However, as I intimated, I do have a number of concerns about the way these regulations have been framed.
First of all, on the issue of retrospectivity.
In my view, retrospective laws are often extremely bad laws - they are grossly unfair to existing users and industries which have grown up under an existing regulatory framework.
Secondly, they very often act as a perverse incentive.
For instance, under the regulations being framed in this directive, if you have an old boat with an old polluting engine, it is perfectly legal provided you do not replace it with a slightly newer possibly even cleaner engine of a greater power rating.
If you do that, obviously improving the environment in the process, then you are subject to the full force of these regulations and would possibly be faced with extremely expensive compliance costs for your craft.
I cannot see that regulations framed in this way benefit anybody.
Furthermore, it is of course extremely difficult to see how they could possibly be policed in practice without having inspectors in every boatyard, every harbour, every port, every river and every canal in Europe, which we are clearly not going to do.
Can I also move on and say a couple of words about some of the amendments which have been proposed.
I will not mention all of them (the House will be pleased to know).
The Socialists have tabled a proposal by Mr Lange which was passed by the Environment Committee (No 30) seeking to impose an additional second table of stricter limits for boats on drinking water lakes.
I understand the raison d'Ãªtre behind that proposal, but I believe that it would prove extremely problematical.
Very difficult to implement in practice, it would be a barrier to trade and it would completely contradict the Commission's intention to harmonise the internal market which will be further fragmented.
I hope the House will think very closely before supporting that amendment.
The proposed limits in Mr Lange's amendments are extremely strict, particularly for two and four-stroke engines.
They are technically very difficult to implement and the prospective benefits that are produced are not very great.
I am sure that the problems presented in one or two lakes in Germany and Austria could be solved, but imposing these limits throughout the whole of Europe where they are often unnecessary will not do that.
It will result in manufacturers producing engines only for their own local markets in their own country and I would urge Parliament to reject those amendments.
Can I also say a word about Mr Lange's other proposed Amendment No 48 on sound level measurements.
Without going into the technicalities of it, the new method that he proposes would cause many problems particularly if you had an instantaneous difficulty, particularly say wave-slap, resulting in a one-off sound level measurement which would be very difficult to repeat day after day and therefore very difficult to implement in practice.
This proposal could produce modest environmental benefits, but we must make sure that those modest environmental benefits do not come about at the expense at the loss of hundreds of jobs in many small enterprises across Europe and the pricing of many European citizens off the waterways which they have enjoyed for many hundreds of years.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the European Union recreational craft are used mainly for leisure activities and I do not think this will change in the next few years.
This leisure activity has become extremely popular over recent years.
There are now over 3.5 million motor boats in the European Union and the number is rising.
If you include sailing boats and rowing boats, there is one boat for every 70 citizens.
The use of recreational craft - and here I must disagree somewhat with our rapporteur - is not totally without its problems.
Certainly, exhaust emissions compared with overall exhaust emissions from other engines in the European Union are tiny.
We have brought about a great many improvements with cars and lorries over recent years and we should seek to achieve fundamental improvements in the recreational craft sector.
More importantly, people living on the banks of highly frequented inland waters live with the impression that the noise from motor boats is a constant source of disturbance, even at quiet times.
The point here, I think, is that we need to reduce the level of noise generated by these recreational craft.
People trying to relax at the weekend and local residents in particular sometimes have to put up with a great deal of disturbance, precisely because of the increase in the number of recreational craft.
Nor must we underestimate the noise generated when the water is displaced by boats travelling at high speed.
Implementing the directive will reduce noise and exhaust emission levels.
I too think that the derogations proposed in committee are right.
More importantly, I think the derogations for historic craft and self-build craft are justified.
Building these craft often takes a long time and is a leisure activity in itself.
We need to retain this.
However, as I have already mentioned, recreational craft are used in areas in which there are large numbers of people trying to relax, which is why it is especially important to keep on reducing noise pollution and why I think it would be wrong to allow any further derogations.
However, I think it is right that, even with the need for harmonisation, Member States should still be able to issue stricter requirements for inland waters used for drinking water supplies.
This has nothing to do with making inland waters off limits; it is a move towards reducing costs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I think Mr Schnellhardt has highlighted the main point.
The equipment at issue here - recreational craft and, more importantly, jet skis - is used solely for leisure activities.
In other words, it is something our society can do without.
If we are to pollute the environment not because society needs to but merely in the pursuit of leisure, then this equipment should be as clean and quiet as possible.
It is therefore right and proper that we should want to improve on one or two points in this directive.
With all due respect to our rapporteur, this is not about canal boats in Great Britain, it is not about self-build craft which are not marketed.
That is not where the problem lies and we have allowed derogations for these craft.
The main problem is with sports craft and - I repeat - jet skis in particular, which are produced in large numbers and used on sensitive inland waters, including waters used for relaxation and drinking water supplies.
In this respect, we need very strict provisions for these areas in order to transfer the technology which we have already adapted and introduced for other mobile engines - in cars and lorries - to engines for recreational craft.
This cannot be done from one day to the next.
That much is obvious.
We need a certain transitional period here, we are all pragmatists here, and we shall give manufacturers a transitional period.
We need to apply the technology, however, so that leisure activities cause the minimum possible exhaust emissions and the minimum possible noise.
Mr President, Commissioners, this is a directive which the Finnish recreational craft industry, for example, has been looking for because it believes it is important that we have uniform rules.
It is important that we take into account current developments, for example with four-stroke engines, which the Commission' s proposal does.
I believe that the Commission' s proposal, along with the improvements which we are adding here, will reduce emissions considerably.
It is said that exhaust gases will be cut by half.
In this way, we will be able to contribute to improvements in sensitive water environments.
As a Finn, and not necessarily as a representative of the ELDR Group, I must say, however, that I am worried about the two-tier system which the rapporteur proposes.
Otherwise, I believe that on many points he has drawn up a realistic proposal which corrects certain errors in the Commission' s proposal and which takes into account the costs and classic boats.
I, myself, have a boat over 30 years old in my boat house which would not meet these standards; I believe it is a classic boat.
In this respect it is a good proposal, but a division whereby different rules apply for inland waterways and seas is not good.
For example, in the country which the Commissioner responsible for and I know best, it is possible to use the same boat on inland waterways and on the sea in the same day.
When a boat is manufactured, it is not known which conditions it will be used for.
I therefore think that Amendment No 15 is unworkable, and that is also the point made by the rapporteur.
There is much to be done if we are to be able to engage with the recreational craft sector.
In this context, I would also like to have seen us dealing with septic tank requirements, as I believe that this, at least with regard to the situation in the Baltic Sea, is one of the most problematic environmental issues associated with the boat industry.
I would thank the rapporteur for a good proposal.
We have been greatly interested in the fact that the Commission has now tabled this.
It is important in order to ensure that the water environment will be improved.
However, I believe that the issues which Mr Lange addressed with regard to groundwater should be solved at their respective locations, and that is something for which we have other legal instruments.
Mr President, pleasure boats generate a great deal of noise and pollution.
In my city, Amsterdam, the dozens of boats create far more stench than the tens of thousands of cars.
I therefore welcome the fact that the European Commission, at the instigation of the Scandinavian and German boat industry, want to improve that situation.
The modest Commission proposals, however, have been watered down by a majority of the Christian-Democrats and the Liberals in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The Group of the Greens has tabled one correction amendment.
We are counting on the Christian-Democrats and the Liberals, who care about the environment, to wake up and no longer to tag along behind the Conservative rapporteur, Mr Callanan.
If they were to continue to back him, that would be a blot on the European Parliament' s green escutcheon.
What is worse, we in Amsterdam, as elsewhere in Europe, would continue to be faced with the noise and stench of the pleasure boats on and around the water.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Callanan and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for this comprehensive report.
It is very well timed for European citizens, who are now preparing for their holidays and may experience the problem daily.
Engine noise, air and water pollution are becoming an increasingly common irritant in recreational activities.
I recently read in the press that, in the past, no attention was paid to research and technology on noise pollution and that is the reason for the delays in development.
While exhaust emissions from recreational craft are relatively small in comparison to the total amount of pollution in the environment, the effect of pollution is amplified by the way recreational craft are used.
Noise pollution has been targeted, because motor boats are often used in areas where people go to relax.
Recreational areas free of unpleasant noise are an important but scarce national resource that should be protected.
This has led to the introduction of different emission requirements in the different Member States.
The proposed legislation therefore seeks to avoid fragmentation of the internal market and at the same time to ensure a high level of health, safety, and environmental consumer protection.
The Commission proposal is a good example of synergy between environment and industrial policies contributing to sustainable development.
Comparable legislation exists in the United States on exhaust emissions from recreational out-board engines.
The environmental protection agency is currently preparing legislation to cover recreational in-board and stern drive engines.
These cases are under discussion under the auspices of the transatlantic business dialogue, in which I am also participating.
Mr Callanan and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are to be congratulated for the amendments which aim to simplify the noise-testing procedures, produce the conformity assessment costs for SMEs and clarify requirements in the case of replacement engines.
The Commission can accept the amendments which aim to clarify and improve the wording of the initial text in relation to partly completed craft and weather conditions, as well as those concerning the simplification of the noise-testing procedures.
The amendments concerning the distinction of stern drive engines, the formulas to be used for the noise-testing procedures and clarification of the coverage of replacement engines can be accepted in principle.
While we have no problem with the general direction of the proposals, we need to analyse further the values and definitions proposed.
As regards the institutional aspects, the proposal envisages, in conformity with the rules governing comitology, a regulatory committee to deal with a number of standard issues relating to the adaptation of technical provisions to technical progress, including measures concerning the evolution of exhaust and noise emission limits.
A regulatory committee is thus essential for the efficient implementation and the regular update of a specific range of technical elements of the proposed directive.
It would be contrary to the simplifying aims of the comitology decision to initiate a formal modification procedure in the case of non-essential provisions subject to regular review.
Consequently, the amendments requiring the rescission of this provision relating to comitology cannot be accepted by the Commission, as they are contrary to its executive powers under Article 202 of Treaty.
Nevertheless, in order to meet concerns expressed by some Members of Parliament, like Mr Lange, as regards further steps in the case of emission limit values, it may be possible to arrive at an acceptable formula in the light of subsequent negotiations.
The Commission will consider the most appropriate ways to take into account the evolution of exhaust and noise emission limits.
For example, the question of possible further reductions in emission limit values could be dealt with in the report to be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council under Article 2 of the Commission proposal.
I am convinced that further work in close cooperation with the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will lead to a balanced solution offering a clear benefit for the environment and the internal market, while minimising additional burdens to SMEs.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 6, 14, 18, 19, 22, 27 to 29, 37, 39, 41 and 44.
Furthermore, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 21, 23, 35 and 36.
In addition, the Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 10, 43 and 45.
On the contrary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24 to 26, 30 to 34, 38, 40, 42 and 46 to 50.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Aid to uprooted people in developing countries
The next item is the report (A5-0228/2001) by Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on measures in the field of aid to uprooted people in developing countries in Latin America and Asia.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue now under our consideration is one of the most tragic facing mankind at the beginning of this new century: the phenomenon of populations uprooted as a result of violent conflicts.
The text of my report contains some figures that are by themselves striking enough. Nevertheless, recent estimates show that the situation is growing worse.
In the last two years, more than five million people have been forced to leave their homes.
According to current estimates, more than thirty million people are displaced, some as refugees seeking shelter in foreign countries, others forced to seek refuge in safer areas within their own countries.
The continent that has been worst affected is Africa, but the situation in Asia has also deteriorated.
We only need to look at Afghanistan and the refugee camps in Pakistan.
Problems also remain in Timor, for example, although East Timor is making considerable progress in building on its independence and democracy.
With regard to Latin America, the situation in Colombia has become practically intolerable.
We could mention other tragic examples, but the essence of the problem speaks for itself.
What have we done in the face of this situation?
Since 1984, the European Parliament has promoted the creation of a budget heading designed for refugees in Asia and Latin America.
It was only in 1997, however, that this heading was given a legal basis.
What are the substance and the grounds for such aid?
We all know that there are budgetary headings for emergency aid, such as the ECHO programme and other forms of what we could call 'horizontal' aid.
These aid packages only cover the first six months, however. They are an attempt to provide a period of basic survival.
The line of aid discussed in this report seeks to fill the gap that exists between emergency aid and development aid.
In fact, in many cases, once populations have passed through the initial survival phase, they still lack the organisational ability needed to obtain development aid - sometimes also because their countries themselves lack the necessary political structures.
There is broad consensus in Parliament on the importance of this aid line, and the proof of this is the 1996 adoption of the Howitt report.
Nevertheless, the 1997 regulation expired in 1999.
What did Parliament receive more than a year later?
A proposal for a regulation that was very similar to the previous one.
At the same time, and with regard to the past, it should also be noted that, due to the shortcomings of the Commission' s planning, the timescale for Parliament' s work was exceptionally tight.
It is only now that we have finished, due to the cooperation of many NGOs, and those who have worked on the process on behalf of the Commission and the Council.
Parliament not only strove to provide greater flexibility, clearer coordination and greater rigour in the assessment and implementation of aid but also fought to include greater coherence between cooperation and development policies in the regulation, bearing in mind the European Union' s political commitments.
It is precisely in order to ensure coherence that we must make more appropriations available: we must increase them from EUR 36 million in 2001 to around EUR 55 million per year over the next three years.
We cannot claim to consider this to be sufficient, but it is important to emphasise that this is a political message which is positive and meaningful at international level and which is also an incentive for the work of the NGOs and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
I should also like to draw your attention to the urgent need within the European Union to address the refugee issue in a united way.
Our strategic objectives must be to prevent further occurrences of this phenomenon.
We must invest in conflict prevention and in establishing conditions that save local populations from the tragedy of major large-scale displacement.
We must give priority to cooperation and development policy throughout the European Union' s external policy, not least as an important source of legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy.
In raising the question of Africa as one of its priorities, the Belgian Presidency is working towards this goal and we are very pleased with this development.
We therefore hope that we will have the support of the Commission and the Council, especially because this type of action gives more credibility to the common European project.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur.
As she said, this report is important because it aims to help uprooted people, in other words, refugees, displaced persons and returnees in Asia and Latin America.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to emphasise the need to approve this programme immediately so that we do not lose the appropriations for this year.
Parliament has always been in favour of having a separate action for uprooted people on the basis of the unique circumstances facing them, as outlined by the rapporteur.
I have some reservations about the function performed by the management committee.
My opinion includes an amendment replacing the management committee with a consultative committee in order to enable the Commission to exercise more adequately its responsibility for implementing the budget.
One of my main concerns is that the legal base for these actions expired at the end of December 2000.
I do not know why the Commission left this new proposal so late, especially when we only had a one-year extension granted in 1999.
I have yet to find an adequate response to that.
If we want to improve the spending on this appropriation, it is not acceptable for the Commission to submit each and every project to a committee.
It is important that the committee should concentrate more on annual work plans and look at ex-post evaluation.
Finally, in these particular lines, the Commission has not included a reference amount in the legislation.
This is wholly justifiable as the nature of the programme dictates that any attempt to anticipate future needs will prove futile.
I recommend we approve this report.
Mr President, I am a strong supporter of a programme to help the many refugees in both Asia and Latin America.
In the main, the programme is a success.
I should like to commend the rapporteur for having tackled all the most important problems and thank her for having adopted all my amendments.
One of the greatest human catastrophes of our time is taking place in Afghanistan.
I am therefore pleased to see that most resources go to uprooted people from that country.
More than 50% of the aid at present goes to refugees from Afghanistan.
There are between 500 000 and a million displaced persons in Afghanistan, almost 2.6 million of whom live in the neighbouring countries of Iran and Pakistan.
These people are some of the most disadvantaged in the world, and that applies especially to the women.
We are all familiar with the depressing pictures of veiled, ghost-like women who are shot if they show the slightest signs of rebellion.
Nonetheless, there is a need for increased supervision of programmes such as this.
I have added that OLAF must have the opportunity of exercising supervision on the spot.
I have also asked the Commission to answer the question of whether EU aid to, for example, Afghanistan has been chanelled through an illegal money network by the name of Havela.
Havela is a closed, secretive and worldwide network which, within twenty-four hours, can transfer large amounts of money to anywhere in the world.
The transfers take place without documentation and can therefore never be traced.
The network is considered to be a dominant factor in global money laundering.
To a certain degree, the end justifies the means when we are dealing with as serious and catastrophic a situation as that in Afghanistan, but the methods used must be open and above board, and I have therefore asked the Commission if it thinks it is in order for EU aid to be used to conceal money laundering and funds from drug smuggling and the trafficking in human beings.
Mr President, I am very pleased as shadow rapporteur to commend this report to Parliament and to congratulate Mrs Carrilho on an excellent report.
Last year I was the rapporteur for this report when we extended the budget line for a few more months.
I am also pleased that the Commissioner is here this morning to reply to the debate because I want to talk to him about a big idea.
Are we not in a rather curious position?
On the one hand we have asylum-seekers coming to Europe and seeking help, shelter and aid and, on the other, we have displaced people living in camps in countries such as Afghanistan and right throughout the world.
These are the same people and we need to make that connection: the people who come here are actually the same sort of people who are living in camps.
If we can help them to be resettled, then we are not only helping them fundamentally but we are also helping to alleviate a problem that is growing in Europe.
My big idea is nothing to do with this, however.
It is about the Montevideo Convention.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he could envisage a new approach?
After the Helsinki and Harare meetings we now give aid to countries on the basis of human rights, good governance and so on. Yet there are 59 civil conflicts around the world creating uprooted people and many of these conflicts are about looting natural resources, greed and dictators wanting to run their show their own way.
Yet we all recognise each country as an equal sovereign nation.
I find it very curious that on the one hand when we give aid, we treat people with a certain measure of circumspection, but when we recognise the national sovereignty of a country we apply the Montevideo Convention and say they are all sovereign.
When the British ran the British Empire, particularly The Raj, they had a habit of giving gun salutes to different Maharajas and Rajas depending on how they behaved.
It is time that we looked at how we recognise what we call national sovereignty and how we treat so-called independent nations.
We need to differentiate between countries and presidents and governments that are democratic and behave in a civilised way and countries that are dictatorial or brutal.
Then we can give different levels of 'gun salutes' to the latter countries so that we do not treat everybody in the same way.
I warmly thank Mrs Carrilho, my friend and colleague.
I did this report in the last parliament.
But she has more than ably taken on and developed the work that I and Mr Deva have been involved in the past and I warmly thank and congratulate her on her work.
I have three points that I want to make.
Firstly, it is important to say to the Commission that we in Parliament, having established this budget line, have adopted some important principles that we want to see adhered to in the way that it is implemented, strengthening our commitment to non-refoulement.
There have been instances in the past where we could have been accused of complicity with forced return: it is absolutely illegal in international law and the Commission must be vigilant on that.
We want to ensure that this budget line is used creatively, including not just visible support for camps, clean water and so on, but the less visible help that is so critical in refugee situations including psycho-social support and counselling, support on reproductive health issues and indeed, support for refugees with disabilities.
I should like to associate myself with the points made by Mrs Gill on comitology where that is particularly damaging to the delivery of this budget line.
I suspect Commissioner Patten will agree with that point.
Secondly, I should like to reiterate to Commissioner Patten that the fact that the Commission brought forward no money for Latin America in their preliminary budget is bizarre particularly when 2.1 million displaced people exist in Colombia.
He is doing a lot of very good work in terms of emergency assistance there, but the safe and protected return of internally displaced people in that country is crucial and it is bizarre that they do not include that in their plans.
Finally, Commissioner Patten himself told us in Parliament when he brought forward the 12-month extension that it would not be late again; he listened to our views and yet the situation has arisen again.
It is important that we be seen to ensure that the reform is on track, and that means these issues being dealt with much further in advance than we are now once again seeing.
I guess he is a little embarrassed by having to come at this late stage once again here today.
Mr President, from G8 to recreational craft, and from recreational craft to uprooted people. That is what you might call a range of subjects.
There are certainly sound reasons for having such a range, without my explaining in more detail what I mean.
Until I heard Commissioner Liikanen commenting on recreational craft, I was quite convinced that it was these that would win the debate in the press. After hearing his contribution, however, I am, in spite of everything, a little less certain of that.
He did in fact manage to talk the subject down.
In the previous debate on the G8 Summit, we of course discussed the usefulness of the global meetings.
As Commissioner Patten strongly emphasised, these are important, but it is just as important that these meetings should be followed up, and the present debate might well be said to be an example of such follow-up.
It is also an example of how - one might almost say - tediously practical the work of democracy also is and of how it is therefore difficult for democracy to compete with the more violent and spectacular global demonstrations.
Nonetheless, this work is absolutely essential.
The proposal no doubt also emphasises very clearly, however, that the only really effective method we have in this context is effective prevention, and I should like to have seen this emphasised a little more.
The proposal also shows - and I think this is a good thing - the need to involve the NGOs in the work.
Without them, success will elude us.
I shall therefore just conclude by saying that - like the previous speaker, Mr Blak - I too think it is heart-breaking to see the developments in Afghanistan.
I can clearly remember the first time I heard about them on the radio.
Developments there increasingly cause one to despair, as does the fact that the international community has so few opportunities for intervening in time.
Mr President, the Greens/EFA Group would, of course, like to congratulate the rapporteur. I would like to say that we agree entirely with her stance and proposal in this report.
I do not intend to go into detail at all but would just like to say that we are all waiting for the Commission' s overall proposal for Asia and Latin America to arrive soon - after the summer, if I have understood correctly.
More generally, I would like to criticise the Commission and the Council for having shown themselves to have been extremely ill-prepared for the legislative process, which has led to payment of the limited funds available for development aid being delayed for an extremely long time.
Now, many aid organisations and non-governmental organisations are desperately waiting to receive money.
This really is not the way it should be.
I would also like to remind the Commission that, at the Gothenburg summit, an undertaking was given to contribute to sustainable development on a global basis, for example, by ensuring that the UN targets for aid, amounting to 0.7 per cent of GNP, are achieved.
I would like to ask the Commission whether there are any plans regarding how this is to happen, bearing in mind that Germany is now down to 0.25 per cent of GNP and that only Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg have achieved the target or exceeded it.
What plans are there for achieving this in practice?
I think it is shameful that Germany is now down to around the same level as the US.
Mr President, the topicality and the importance of the matter we are now debating; uprooted populations in the developing countries of Latin America and Asia, are clear.
I wish to express my total support for the concerns of the rapporteur in general and, in particular, for rapidly reaching agreement with the Council, in order to objectively follow up specific support measures.
Nevertheless, I should like to state my disappointment at the Council' s insistence on introducing a time limit and a tight one at that, for this regulation.
The problem of refugees and uprooted populations is a structural and global problem, which will not be resolved by means of one-off and short-term measures.
By being so unwilling to compromise on this issue, the Council is preventing us from developing a strategic approach, which, incidentally, was present in the Commission' s initial proposal.
We can only censure the Council for this attitude.
Mr President, I should first of all like to echo the appreciation for Mrs Carrilho' s report and also, of course, for the input from our first speaker, Mr Deva.
In fact, I completely concur with the views he has outlined.
The reason why I have taken the floor is to draw your attention to a specific situation, namely that in Indonesia, and the Moluccas, to be more precise.
I am also doing this because it appears from the reports that most of the Union' s funding for refugees and displaced persons in Indonesia has been allocated to Timor.
Needless to say, I fully understand why that was done, given the recent tragedies there and the huge amount of work that still needs to be done there.
Meanwhile, however, the situation on the Moluccas has become far more serious.
More than 300 000 people have fled from island to island due to aggression, especially from Muslim fundamentalists of the Laskar Jihad and disloyal sections of the Indonesian army and police.
On 20 May, another nine people were killed and seventeen wounded in Belakang Soya and Karan Pajang, and even after that incident, violence simply carried on.
People from the Christian communities are also fleeing because they are forced to convert to Islam.
There have even been forced incidents of circumcision.
Similar atrocities are taking place in Irian Jaya.
I would therefore ask the Commission to use the aid for Indonesia not only for Timor, but also for the displaced and refugees on the Moluccas and in Irian Jaya.
I should welcome a reaction from the Commission to this request.
I should also like to highlight how important it is for the European Union to cooperate with the UNHCR and the NGOs.
I could not agree more with Mrs DybkjÃŠr, for they end up doing the practical work anyway.
In this connection, I should like to know from the Commission whether the problems with the UNHCR have now been solved, that is to say whether the UNHCR is now obtaining more funding from the Commission.
For while the number of refugees and displaced persons is increasing, the budget of the UNHCR is being cut back.
That is, surely, not justifiable.
Mr President, I should like to concur with Mrs Maij-Weggen regarding the Moluccas.
I should now like to turn to the report by Mrs Carrilho. In her report, she made a number of essential observations further to the Commission proposal.
With the criticism about a lack of coherence in European policy fresh in my memory, I consider Amendments Nos 3 and 4 to be of particular importance.
Emergency aid also forms part of that development policy and must fit within the general objectives of the European Union' s development policy.
Organisations involved in development activities in the grey area between emergency aid and development aid sometimes threaten to fall between two stools.
I was faced with exactly that situation involving a Dutch development aid organisation.
Furthermore, there are often distressing situations among the target groups of this aid.
That is precisely why I should like to join the rapporteur in her plea for maintaining this budget line.
Mr President, I should like to invite the House to support the report by my colleague, Maria Carrilho, which aims at improving a regulation which we consider important.
Europe must do all it can to help displaced people, in this case in Latin America and Asia.
We must help those who are forced to leave their places of origin for reasons of extreme poverty, wars, various situations of repression and force, and internal conflicts in which civil power crumbles and democracy as the normal way of coexisting is scorned.
The European Union must make a political effort at an international level to encourage countries to adopt a flexible interpretation of the Geneva Conventions and also to promote new instruments of international law to protect these internal refugees.
In our capacity as donors, the European Union Member States and the European Union itself must not hesitate to use every possible means to ensure that the countries with which we cooperate guarantee the safety of their nationals and respect for their human rights.
Of course, taking on the responsibilities of the Union in the field that we are concerned with here must be matched by a consistent financial effort, which should already be reflected in the budgets for 2002.
Alongside the immediate, urgent need for political and financial action to help the uprooted victims, however, we must not lose sight of the need to attack the very roots of the problem.
Our medium and long-term efforts must be directed at the eradication of poverty and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy everywhere, which can foster development and social justice. In other words, prosperity and stability so that all can live with dignity in their own lands.
This has been an interesting if short debate.
I would like to comment on a couple of the points that were raised, though I am sure we will have opportunities on other occasions to follow up the speech on sovereignty that was made by Mr Deva.
Mrs SchÃ¶rling, asked what we were doing in order to oblige Member States to meet the UN target for development assistance.
Had Mrs SchÃ¶rling been able to be present for the debate we had earlier today on the G8, she would have heard how much I sympathise with the objective which she has, but it is an argument that one has to put to the governments of Members States and to their parliaments, which vote on this public spending of those governments.
I sympathise, particularly against the background of declining aid flows in the 1990s.
Mrs Maij-Weggen knows that I share her concern about the situation in Indonesia, not least the situation in the Moluccas and some of the other islands and provinces and I assure Mrs Maij-Weggen that we will be allocating EUR 3 million to the Moluccas next year and for future years, if that is required.
I would like, however, to begin the substantive part of my speech by congratulating Mrs Carrilho, for the quality of this report.
I am very well aware of the difficult work conditions and the time pressure.
The analysis, conclusions and amendments contained in her report are, in the Commission's judgment, of the highest quality and contribute to improving significantly the original Commission proposal.
I say that without any qualification.
We share all the concerns and the recommendations contained in the honourable Member's report.
I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their contributions to this debate.
On 21 June, the international community celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
Unfortunately, there was not much to celebrate.
Today, there are more 22 million uprooted people in the world and that figure is increasing.
Every day from Afghanistan- and I will certainly look into the points raised by Mr Blak - to Colombia, from the Balkans to the region of the Great Lakes, thousands of families are displaced by war, famine and poverty.
We know that the international community is affected by donor fatigue.
The UNHCR is struggling to find the resources to cope with these human tragedies and has recently downsized its operations.
Again, in response to the honourable lady, we are involved in discussion not only with the UNHCR, but with other UN organisations to try to put our financial relationship with them on a more sensible footing.
It is a good time to state clearly that the European Community will continue to earmark financial and human resources to help uprooted people to go back to their homes, to start a new life and live in peace and security.
Parliament has decided to send a political signal in this respect by proposing an increase in the financial resources available and we welcome this proposal.
Since 1997, more than EUR 200 million have been committed to finance projects throughout Asia and Latin America in favour of uprooted people.
Money has been used to help refugees to live a decent in camps, to return to their home country, or to resettle in a third one and to become self-sufficient.
The budget line has financed projects to protect uprooted populations in the host countries on their way home and at their final destination.
It has helped host communities to accept and integrate uprooted families.
Most of all it has ensured the presence of the international community in the delicate transition from humanitarian aid to long-term development - a point raised by Mr Deva - by rebuilding homes and schools, ensuring access to drinking water and irrigation, improving health and education services, setting up credit facilities and restoring economic activity.
Indeed, the evaluation carried out in 2000, though indicating a series of management weaknesses that the Commission has addressed with its reform of external aid, confirmed that the budget line is highly relevant and should be continued.
Coming to the specific amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission agrees with all the changes proposed.
First, we appreciate the strengthening of the human rights of the regulation; second, the clarification of the role of the regulation in the continuum of relief, rehabilitation and development; third, the reinforcement of control monitoring and reporting functions and finally, the strengthening of peace- building and conflict management dimensions of the regulation along the lines of the recently adopted Commission communication on conflict prevention.
Concerning the duration of the regulation, the Commission originally proposed that the regulation should be valid for an indefinite period of time to avoid periodic discussion on a question which seems, sadly, unlikely to go away or change in nature in a significant way.
However, we consider that December 2004 is a very reasonable compromise, particularly in the light of our intention to revise the Asia and Latin America regulation, and will examine the possibility of incorporating the question of uprooted people into a single geographical instrument.
Finally, we take note of the desire of the Parliament to earmark, for the operations to be financed under this regulations, financial resources beyond the amount already programmed.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent job which she has done and I hope that as a result our programmes in this very important sector will be both generous and better focused and managed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11:50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
Mr President, I move that any member should be able to use the travel office to visit groups of visitors within a radius of 25 kilometres of the European Parliament at any time.
At the moment we are only allowed to travel 20 kilometres, which equates to a 15 kilometre radius.
That is too short, given the hundreds of kilometres which many groups travel in order to come here.
Please could you take suitable action here.
Mr Meyer, we talked about this matter yesterday.
However, I would ask you to express your concern in writing for the Quaestors.
Mr President, yesterday afternoon there was a demonstration in front of Parliament.
The demonstrators used powerful public address systems, that is, loudspeakers.
This unbearably noisy spectacle hampered both me and other members in the exercise of our mandate.
Please ensure that, first, demonstrators have no cause to enter the grounds of Parliament, as happened yesterday and, secondly, that they are prohibited from using public address systems in the vicinity of the European Parliament.
So as to avoid any misunderstanding, may I point out that I am an advocate of the right to demonstrate and am delighted when groups of musicians visiting members entertain us in Parliament and the inner courtyard with their musical renditions.
We have taken note of your comment, Mr Knolle.
Mr President, we are about to undertake a series of very important roll-call votes.
Can you confirm that Mr Brienza has been registered in the voting system today?
The competent services confirm that he has, Mr Dell'Alba.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
The rapporteur asked the Commission to take a position on the part of Amendment No 25 concerning Article 18(2) of the proposal.
This part concerns Community officials seconded to the agency, and other servants recruited by the executive agency.
Mrs Schreyer stated in yesterday's debate that the Commission could not fix the minimum percentage of Commission officials on secondment to the agency, and therefore could not accept the rapporteur's suggested 25%.
Sufficient Commission officials will be seconded to the agency to meet job requirements.
Mrs Schreyer, however, can confirm that other servants will be recruited on renewable contracts.
The final part of that amendment on the nature of the contracts and the obligations and criteria required is also acceptable.
I hope that this statement will allow Mr Bourlanges to support the adoption of his report so that the proposal can conclude its passage through the Council as soon as possible.
I thank him for his excellent work on this matter.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for his statement which settles an extremely important issue, giving the assurance that the staff of the agencies will not suffer from job insecurity or be of insufficient quality.
I think that is a very important point.
I take this opportunity to add that we had a very late discussion with Mr van Hulten, the representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and - he has authorised me to say this -- contrary to what was envisaged previously, his group could agree to support both Amendment No 13, which was passed by the Committee on Budgets, and also parts 3 and 4, just referred to by the Commissioner, of Amendment No 25.
I am saying this so that there is no misunderstanding, and if I have not expressed Mr van Hulten' s thinking correctly he can put it differently, but it will mean we have a much more united vote in this House.
Mr President, I wanted to take the floor because, today, in the relative confusion of the votes, partly due to the fact that we were voting on important issues, the European Parliament has given, given back or, to be more accurate, has agreed to give EUR 12 billion - to be exact, EUR 11.6 billion - back to the Member States because it was left over from the budget for 2000.
Now, I consider all this to be ridiculous: we have been following this practice for years with the result that, not only are we not in control of the amount of income we receive but, in addition, we are allowing the Member States to take back all this money or to deduct it from their contributions for the year in progress.
I feel that, at a time when enlargement is pending, when we have budgetary problems and we need to be constantly seeking new resources, this system is wholly inappropriate: the Member States not only deny us those expenditure ceilings which were laid down in Edinburgh and confirmed in the Financial Perspective but they also want to take back funds which could be redirected and used to good effect, as happens in any other State budgetary system, where funds are not returned to the citizens, I regret to say, but put to another use.
Therefore, with this protest, I am explaining why we voted against the report.

Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget No 3, submitted to us in Mrs Haug' s report, is essentially about changes to OLAF and European Commission staff. As regards the Anti-Fraud Office, the amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets, in agreement with the Committee on Budgetary Control, changes the distribution between permanent posts and temporary posts in a way we find commendable and, as a whole, this Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget does not call for any special comment.
Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 deals primarily with the balance for the financial year 2000, and also provides for a strengthening of the supplementary payment appropriations for the Western Balkans from the 2000 balance, raising them from EUR 350 million to EUR 450 million, or EUR 70 million more for the Balkans and an additional EUR 30 million for supplementary financial assistance for FRY.
The rapporteur agrees to the 'revenue' side of this Supplementary and Amending Budget, in other words the reimbursement, which we support, of EUR 7.5 billion arising from the 2000 surplus to the Member States.
However, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group cannot join the rapporteur in condemning the fact that the European Parliament has no say in the 'revenue' section of the budget.
Mrs Haug' s other report, on the situation concerning the European Union's own resources in 2001, also reopens the debate on increasing revenue, taking the view that the European Union should depend less and less on payments from the Member States, and that the own resources system should be changed so as to achieve financial autonomy.
The resolution therefore states that the purpose of the reform should be to provide Europe with an 'autonomous source of revenue' , and it supports the establishment of a direct European tax, at the same time demanding full association of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure, in particular as regards revenue.
The French delegation of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is opposed to all these inappropriate proposals, which in any case infringe the Treaty.
(Explanation of vote shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
In relation to Supplementary and Amending Budget Number 3 of this year, I would like to refer to an amendment which I tabled on behalf of my group, UEN, at the Budget Committee but which unfortunately was not accepted.
The amendment related to Budget line A-3015 which is used to finance the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages.
I am glad to have the opportunity to explain my amendment.
Many colleagues will be aware of the excellent work carried out by the Bureau in promoting protection for lesser used and minority languages.
This becomes all the more important in the context of enlargement with the cultural and linguistic diversity in many of the applicant states.
As many colleagues will be aware, the Commission is attempting to impose conditions on the Bureau which would have the effect of closing its office in Dublin.
The Bureau was set up some years ago on an initiative of the Irish government and is still co-financed by the Irish government.
The secretariat was originally all in Dublin, though in recent years an antenna was opened in Brussels to carry out relations with the EU institutions.
I have been in contact with the Irish Minister responsible for language matters and I believe that it would be very difficult to sustain the same level of interest in the Bureau among Irish government circles, should the Bureau be forced to close its Dublin office.
Concern over this was also expressed from northern circles because the Bureau is active with regard to the language aspects of the Good Friday agreement.
I believe that the Commission is acting to subvert the will of parliament in imposing such conditions on the grant and consequently, I proposed including a direct reference to the secretariats in Dublin and Brussels in the footnote.
Once the new budgetary procedure begins next September, I will be seeking support once again for such a move.
On this occasion I simply want to draw the attention of colleagues to the machinations of the Commission which I believe could have damaging consequences.
Haug report (A5-0238/2001)
Mr President, on the subject of the use of the European Parliament's own resources, I would like to say, both on behalf of the Pensioners' Party which I represent and on behalf of the associated French, Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, Slovenian, Bulgarian and Lithuanian Pensioners' Parties, who have authorised me to speak on their behalf, that I openly support the proposal that the European Union should levy its own taxes and that this should not mean an increase in taxation for the citizens but, on the contrary, a reduction in the taxes that the citizens pay in their own States.
Only in this way will the citizens see Europe in a positive light.
We have today voted against all calls to introduce a direct EU tax.
We do not think that a tax specific to the EU would be a good idea at all.
It is very doubtful whether such an EU tax would strengthen people' s attachment to, and enthusiasm for, EU cooperation.
Any EU tax would become part of a complex interplay involving national taxes, and there would be cause to fear that it would become difficult for national governments to supervise the combined tax burden.
It is therefore impossible to guarantee that the introduction of an EU tax would not involve further burdens for tax payers.
The introduction of an EU tax also looks like a step in the direction of a more federal EU, which is something neither we nor the majority of Europeans support.
My group, like many Members of this House as well as various experts, takes the view that the EU resources budgeted in the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 are insufficient, especially in view of the enlargement of the EU and the work which needs to be done to stabilise the situation in the Balkans, solve the problems of unemployment and stabilise social systems, to name but a few.
There is therefore good cause to put the question of additional sources of revenue for the European Union on the agenda.
Mrs Haug proposes in her report to abolish the previous system of transfers from Member States and to modify the own resources system so that the European Union can achieve financial autonomy.
She calls for a European tax to be introduced as a direct revenue.
My group cannot subscribe to this approach.
The system of transferring a proportion of gross national product used in the past is based on a principle which is conducive to economic and social cohesion in the Union - the solidarity principle.
To abolish this principle is to rob the European Union of its basis and, for us, this is unacceptable.
We take a constructive view of the idea of supplementing the present system of financing the EU with further sources of revenue in the form of European taxes which do not minimise taxes in the Member States of the European Union.
Our thoughts turn in this context, for example, to the introduction of a Tobin tax to cream off profits from financial transactions or the introduction of a pan-European CO2 tax on companies, which would also help us to implement a forward-looking environmental policy by applying pressure for more environmentally-friendly ways of generating energy and helping to safeguard the Kyoto agreement.
We also take the view that the present financial regulation should be amended so that resources not called up by the Member States stay in the European budget, rather than being channelled back to the Member States.
At the same time, we need to apply stricter budgetary discipline; for example, commitment appropriations not disbursed because they have not been called up by the recipient, should lapse after no more than 3 years, meaning that the allocation notice will need to be altered.
That is why my group rejects this report.
By multiplying free trade areas, abandoning customs duties in a system of generalised unilateral preferences, making gifts of customs duties to the 49 least advanced countries, under the pretext of welcoming everything 'except weapons' and above all submitting to the demands of the masters of the empire, from the GATT to the WTO, the European Commission has sawn off the financial branch the European budget used to hang upon - customs duties, which represented over 55% of Community resources in the 1960s, and only represent 14% of them now.
In addition, with the abandonment of Community agricultural preference, the common agricultural levy on imports of agricultural products from the Commonwealth, Central America and elsewhere, which protected it, is on the way out.
It only produces about 2% of Community resources now.
So much so that only 17% of the European budget' s resources now comes from customs duties and that agricultural levy.
As these two first historical resources are the only ones specifically belonging to the Community and able to make it financially independent of the Member States, their decline means the Community budget depends on payments from the Member States.
That is illustrated by the size of the GNP levy, the fourth historical resource of the European budget, which has only been in existence since 1988.
This constantly increasing levy already provides more than 45% of Community resources and in fact boils down to classic contributions by governments to finance an international organisation.
We have thus arrived at the astonishing situation where the European Commission, the beating heart of federal integration, has pursued a world customs policy which has reduced the Union to financing itself like any other intergovernmental organisation under entirely intergovernmental international law.
(The speaker was cut off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
I have voted against the proposal.
Sweden' s Christian Democrats do not support items 5 and 11, which propose that the European Union should be given its own powers of taxation.
We do not want to increase the number of tax levels in society for our citizens.
Swedish tax payers pay tax to the municipality, the county council and the state.
Creating another level of taxation, a European one, means an inevitable increase in taxation in the long term.
This is a development which we do not want to support.
If the EU receives what the report calls 'financial autonomy' , this will also lead to political autonomy from Member States and their governments, with all the dangers and the lack of control which this brings with it.
We do not wish to support such a development.
Costa Neves report (A5-0241/2001)
This preliminary draft budget by the Commission, which represents less than 1.06% of the Community' s GNP, is truly the lowest that has ever been drawn up and is, therefore, unacceptable, not least because it represents a reduction in spending, especially in the area of cooperation with least-developed third countries.
Not even East Timor has escaped this downward trend in spending.
The report' s conciliatory tone is, therefore, surprising, as is its lack of strategy and priorities. These absences are also surprising in the face of an oft-heralded enlargement, not to mention social issues, which are all but ignored.
The European Parliament needs to be more audacious and should not simply accept what it is presented with, as is happening once again.
As a matter of fact, the presentation of the fourth (!) amending budget in the current year is an example of the budgetary chaos in which the Community operates and also proves us right for having tabled a motion refusing to discharge the budget last year.
In the meantime and if we are to believe the Haug report, the solution to all of these problems would be to create a Community tax!
We consider this kind of proposal to be a red herring.
Apart from issues of principle raised by such a proposal, it must be emphasised that the reduction in the Community budget is primarily a result of the restrictive guidelines laid down in the Stability Pact.
This is where the appropriate answers can be found.
Furthermore, it is a matter of priority to ensure that the participation of the Member States takes place according to their relative wealth - on the basis of their GNP - and that the contribution by the citizens is fair and balanced.
Solidarity is a fundamental issue, which must be addressed together with the Community budgetary revenues.
Niebler report (A5-0232/2001)
Mr President, it is the year 2005.
One pensioner asks another: "What sort of things do you watch on television?"
"I watch dance shows, entertainment shows and programmes with beautiful girls in".
"You've got it all wrong," replied the other.
"I don't have time to watch that sort of thing. Every evening, I watch Fatuzzo's European Show.
It is a show presented by Mr Fatuzzo, an expert on pensions, who talks to pensioners about how to increase the size of their pensions.
I advise you to watch Fatuzzo's European Show too."
This has all been made possible by Mr Niebler's report, which allocates radio spectra which, I hope, will be used to broadcast informative material for all the citizens, especially pensioners.
McKenna report (A5-0219/2001)
Mr President, we have just adopted the report by my colleague, Patricia McKenna, and I must certainly recognise that it has turned out to be a good document, covering in detail all the circumstances and problems affecting our coastal areas, both on the geographical, climatic, environmental and biodiversity side and as regards their economic, social, cultural, and leisure and recreational aspects.
I just wish there were a clearer and more committed reference to tourist developments and especially the numerous illegal buildings that have been put up in a speculative manner along many parts of the coast in Spain - and other countries too. They are clearly an assault on proper town planning and a threat to the environmental balance.
I believe the governments involved should act firmly and put a stop to the consequences of their lack of control over these illegal building projects.
Lastly, I must express my dissatisfaction that my proposal was not accepted to give this document, which we have just adopted as a simple recommendation, the rank of a Community directive, which would make it mandatory for the Member States to comply with it and make it part of their own national law.
Mr President, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party I welcome this European Parliament proposal. I welcome this proposal not just as a representative of the Pensioners' Party but also as a native of Genoa, a person born in Genoa.
In Italy, in Genoa and all along the Ligurian coast, unfortunately, when it rains rather more than usual, all the street level houses, flats, shops and bars are flooded.
I hope and pray that this will be the beginning of a European policy for coastal areas which is genuinely effective and benefits the European citizens who live on the European coasts.
This report makes a critical analysis of the proposal for a recommendation on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council recommendation concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe and tables various amendments which, for the most part, deserve our support. They deserve our support for highlighting the importance of our coastal areas, the causes of degradation and destruction that we are now seeing in various areas and the new dangers resulting from global warming and climate change, which pose perhaps the greatest threat to Europe' s coastal areas.
Nevertheless, it must also be emphasised that the decline in fishing and in related industries, which are fundamental factors for socio-economic cohesion in many of these areas that depend on fishing, are making them highly vulnerable.
Therefore, although the report is, as the rapporteur states, a first, crucial step in protecting Europe' s coastal areas, the Member States must also be committed to achieving this and to ensuring a degree of coordination between the various instruments to be used.
Nevertheless, we have some reservations about the measures described by the rapporteur, specifically those concerning a binding common strategy, since the Member States' role and capacity for action in this entire process are far from clear.
There is little difference in height between shallow areas of the sea along the coasts, the so-called continental shelf, and low-lying coastal areas.
Many of those areas have over the years turned from land into sea or from sea into land, with or without specific human intervention.
Thanks to the US President, Mr Bush, and the large oil concerns, these land areas threaten to be turned into sea once again, for as long as artificial global warming persists, the ice caps will continue to melt and sea levels will continue to rise.
It is precisely in those low-lying coastal areas that a large proportion of the world population is concentrated and key economic centres located.
Not only do eight million Dutch people and two million Flemings stand to lose their residential areas, but so do the people living in the Po plain in Italy, Les Landes in south-western France, and parts of cities including Helsinki, Copenhagen, London, Hamburg, Barcelona, Lisbon and Thessaloniki.
In addition to population pockets, coastal areas also boast areas of special natural beauty, such as the Ã©tangs on the French coast and the Wadden Sea in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, which is under continuous threat of being encroached upon by ports and industrial areas.
I share the opinion of Mrs McKenna entirely that coastal areas require far better protection than the European Commission proposes.
The social fabric of many coastal zones has been altered over recent years by the restructuring of the fisheries and traditional agriculture sectors.
Although certain regions have been faced with an exodus of their endogenous population, most of the coastal zones are experiencing an increase in overall demographic pressure, as well as significant seasonal variations in employment, essentially linked to tourism.
Major works required for urbanisation and development can threaten the coastal environment if carried out without sufficient knowledge of the coastal dynamic, by accelerating the erosion of the seashore.
Furthermore, pollution of marine or terrestrial origin is increasingly contaminating soil and drinking water resources.
The coastal territories are the focus of constant antagonism and conflict.
Lack of integrated management of maritime and terrestrial resources causes serious tension between the various sectors of activity, namely fisheries, agriculture and services, with the consequence that the sustainable development of the coastal areas is put on hold.
The strategy proposed by the Commission is an interesting approach intended to resolve the fundamental problems facing the coast: lack of information, insufficient participation by the population in projects, weak coordination between the various planning authorities and absence of real partnership which involves the economic sectors concerned, the regional and local authorities and the interregional organisations, in decision-making.
However, it is essential for the strategy for coastal zones to constitute one of the first examples of implementation of the guidelines developed under the European Spatial Development Perspective, because the principles set out in it are obviously valuable for the Union' s coastal zones.
This could even be an excellent occasion to restore vigour to a particularly inert ESDP, whose true impact still remains very limited.
Finally, I would like to express my agreement with those who regret that the Commission' s proposal does not take account of climate change, when that appears to have an influence on rising sea levels and increasing storm frequency, contributing decisively to risks of flooding, coastal erosion and loss of seashore.
Although we are only now beginning to recognise the new challenges that will face the coastal regions in the decades to come, the integrated coastal zone management strategy cannot decently ignore them.
Callanan report (A5-0218/2001)
Mr President, a few days ago, I was on holiday by the sea, sunbathing on a yacht.
I was not alone: amongst my companions was a beautiful, tanned, very nice, attractive girl who was sunbathing on the deck.
She was called Marilyn. At one point, she said to me: "But you are an MEP!
Can you tell me, then, why yachts and pleasure craft do not fly the European flag as well as the national flag?"
I could only reassure her that I was going to vote for this measure and recommend that it be laid down that pleasure craft must fly the European flag too.
Brok report (A5-0244/2001)
I should like to use the opportunity provided by the resolution on macro-financial assistance to Yugoslavia to express my support for the assistance measures, even though they are minimal in comparison with the destruction wreaked in Yugoslavia by the NATO attacks.
At the same time, however, I wish to express my categorical condemnation of the manner in which assistance from donors has been used to circumvent and disregard constitutional procedures in Yugoslavia in order to bring Milosevic to the Hague tribunal.
It is financial blackmail and it offends every aspect of international law.
Of course Milosevic bears a huge responsibility for the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and he must be brought to justice, but to link financial assistance with anti-constitutional action within the interior of the country in receipt of the assistance, without the knowledge of its democratically elected president, perverts and undermines the very nature of the European Union's aid programmes.
We are obviously in favour of the assistance to the reconstruction and development of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
This report, however, totally conceals the destruction caused by the NATO bombing of FRY.
Worse still, in an astonishing and utterly cynical reversal of perspective, the French version of the justification refers to the deterioration in the Yugoslav economy due to the 'war against NATO in 1999' .
We cannot support a policy which uses financial assistance to force the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to behave like a banana republic politically and economically, while helping neither Serbian awareness of the crimes committed, notably by Milosevic, in the name of the Serbian people, nor the emergence of a state of law, nor indeed the credibility of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as a judicial authority independent of the political powers, nor yet the reconstruction of the country with a minimum of social cohesion and peaceful relations between neighbouring peoples.
For all these reasons we have abstained.
The fact that I agree that we are making funds available for Yugoslavia does not in the least mean that I condone predictable attempts to draft that country into NATO, to subject its economy to foreign interests and to subordinate the rights of Montenegrins and Kosovars to relations with the Serbian government, which appears surprisingly cooperative.
Yugoslavia, impoverished and razed to the ground, requires a great deal of funding, and the former President deserves to be punished for suppression, war and undemocratic government.
Following a judicial procedure at home, an international trial was therefore inevitable.
What is happening now bears little relation to justice, and more to the trading of a political rival by the President of a federal state, in contravention of the federal government and the Supreme Court.
Only when last Thursday, Mr Milosevic was brought to The Hague, did a huge amount of money become available on Friday.
Evidently, one has to lose a war and governing power, and bankrupt one' s own economy, to be condemned a war criminal.
It is never the winners who are condemned, only the losers.
Funding is desperately needed to pay for the damages incurred in war in 1999, but now, it mainly appears to be a means to reward agreeable leaders and punish others.
I fear that the ignorance and nationalism of many of the people involved will only grow.
Resolution (B5-0480/2001) on the COM in fruit and vegetables
Even though this resolution is a generalisation, we agree with it in principle and shall vote in favour of it because it expresses the view that support for locust beans and nuts, which come under fruit and vegetables, should be reinforced.
However, we must register our disagreement with the items at which the resolution becomes more specific.
The first point on which we disagree concerns producer organisations, which we oppose because they undermine cooperatives.
Even where cooperatives are converted into producer organisations, numerous problems arise because cooperatives in Greece are multisectoral, as are farmers, while producer organisations deal with one specific product. As a result, several producer organisations end up working within the same cooperative and, if they work properly, that is, in accordance with the relevant regulation then, in practice, the cooperative is fragmented into as many parts as there are products handled by it.
The problem could have been resolved if Member States had been given the right to recognise these farmers' organisations and if the regulations had referred to cooperatives and producer organisations as being equivalent.
This is not the case, however, and the European Union only recognises producer organisations with an anti-democratic legislative framework as producer groups.
The second point concerns the emphasis in the resolution on the operational programmes of producer organisations.
We do not disagree with these programmes, we just consider them to be of secondary or tertiary importance.
When we talk of more efficient support for products, we mean better intervention prices, more subsidies and protection from mass imports.
The operational programme limiting environmental pollution is good but it alone will not improve income support for farmers.
Wuori report (A5-0193/2001)
Mr President, I have no intention of joining the regulars who give an explanation of vote; yesterday my timetable simply overran, and, unfortunately, I was too late for the deliberation on Mr Wuori' s report.
The importance of that report is only highlighted by the fact that the EU human rights policy is clearly now at the development stage.
It is based on an unshakeable view of human worth, because without human worth there are no human rights either.
It is important that the EU' s internal problems are reported at least as effectively and transparently as those of non-member countries.
As, eighteen months ago, I raised the issue of police violence as being a human rights problem within the EU, I cannot now help but raise it once again, alongside the matter of freedom of speech that the committee regards as the main point of focus.
There is every reason to analyse the reports of violence that occurred when the Gothenburg Summit was taking place just as seriously as the events themselves.
It was with an equal feeling of sorrow that I read not only about the injuries but also the fairly uncritical attitude of the journalists as they reported the events.
It is difficult to defend freedom of speech of the people and the press in a credible way if this freedom is increasingly being used irresponsibly.
If the EU is to be a globally important human rights player, its citizens will also serve as important models for the administrations of other countries of what the implementation of freedoms might mean in practice.
Mr President, I naturally support the Wuori report on human rights in the European Union but I feel - I am convinced - that the European Union needs to do much more.
We often discuss human rights throughout the world in this hemicycle in Strasbourg, but we, the European Union, continue to provide economic aid in the form of funding to countries in which there is no respect for human rights.
I call upon Parliament and our institutions not to give another euro to countries which do not respect human rights in the world.
It can never be repeated often enough that the European Union must actively promote human rights and democracy in all its activities throughout the world.
Respect for human rights must be a priority in all EU activities, including conflict prevention.
Indeed we must 'export' , as the saying goes, our common values like liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law - the EU' s founding principles.
However, it is essential to respect national sovereignty and not lapse into interference.
The European institutions must put their heads together and come up with more effective methods.
The rapporteur is proposing that the Council and the Commission elaborate more focused common strategies on human rights.
The EU Presidency is invited to ensure that the working programmes systematically include sections on well-defined policies and actions aimed at promoting human rights and democracy.
Specific annual priorities should be established, matched with measures for implementation.
These strategies must be subject to annual review and ensure consistency between the various Community policies involved.
I think it is important for the European Parliament to improve its own structures for dealing with human rights issues.
I welcome the suggestion to appoint a special representative, possibly a vice-chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. This person would deal with all human rights issues and would also ensure that individual cases of violation of human rights are followed up.
(Explanation of vote shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
The European Union is poorly placed to give lessons on human rights.
Amongst others, it invokes the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but it does not respect them.
What has it done to put an end to the scandalous haemorrhage that repayment of debt represents for the countries of the south?
The Member States do not pay the WHO the money it needs to combat AIDS or tuberculosis, because the Maastricht criteria require reductions in public deficits.
'A more consistent crisis prevention policy' presupposes removing the oil multinationals from positions where they can do damage, like Total Fina Elf, whose war-mongering role in southern Sudan and Congo is increasingly apparent.
Furthermore, the European Union must respect the right of asylum and the 1951 Convention by getting rid of waiting areas and detention centres, and not by 'stricter visa requirements' as the report recommends. That is urgent.
Nor is it enough to 'regret' that the Roma are victims of serious discrimination.
They must be granted asylum and collective expulsions, carried out, for example and in particular, by Belgium, must be condemned.
The right to asylum can only be respected and human traffic effectively combated through freedom of movement and a policy to regularise the position of all those without papers.
As for freedom of the press and the battle against excessive media concentration, a populist predator in charge of Italy provides an instructive image of liberal Europe' s doublespeak.
I voted in favour of the Wuori report on European Union human rights policy.
I welcome the call for a better EU human rights strategy towards third countries and candidate countries.
Economic questions take centre stage during accession negotiations, while human rights issues are granted nowhere near the same importance.
I voted against the rapporteur's Amendment No 10 because it deletes the passage calling for the Turkish government to guarantee the return of more than 3 million refugees.
I have visited a number of refugee camps in south-east Turkey and seen the human misery for myself.
Even human rights reports should not ignore refugees.
I should also like to add, Ã  propos the Wuori report, that there are not just Christian minorities in Turkey, as stated in Article 90, there are also the Yezidi, a religious community which is not recognised.
On official documents such as birth certificates, instead of Yezidi, a cross is entered or they are left blank as a sign of non-recognition.
Everyone has the right to worship freely and I therefore call for all religious communities in Turkey to be recognised.
British Conservatives are strong supporters of genuine human rights and, accordingly, have voted in overall support of the Wuori resolution.
However, there are a number of elements in the resolution with which many of us disagree, such as: the redefinition of human rights (paragraphs 50, 51 and 72); the unbalanced condemnations of Turkey (paragraphs 88 and 89); the misunderstanding of the nature and status of caste in India (paragraph 106 etc.); the call for legally-binding criteria for arms exports (paragraph 113).
Cornillet report (A5-0223/2001)
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cornillet, even though he is absent because, in his report, he has presented us with rich and varied information on the state of human rights in the European Union and has sent the governments and nations of Europe a clear message saying that the European Union insists on being an area of freedom, justice and social cohesion in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected.
However, my group, the Greek MEPs in the European People's Party, and I personally have a number of objections to the final text, which is why we each went our own way, some voting against and others, like myself, abstaining.
These objections have to do with relations with political and electoral rights, with immigrants and with the fact that we believe that political will comes first, with the European institutions adopting, drawing up and applying a common immigration policy and the Member States endeavouring to create the conditions needed for immigrants to integrate into society, wherever they may come from.
Electoral and political rights may be a natural and historic development, but we need a period of consultation and understanding with the citizens, we need dialogue before we can reach a creditable solution.
Another point to which we object is the official recognition of homosexual marriage because we believe that this does not only have to do with sexual freedom, it also has to do with the institution of the family and this touches on sensitive issues for European citizens which are protected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.


Mr President, I voted against the Cornillet report on citizens' rights in Europe because I feel that the rights of elderly people are not respected in Europe, at least in many of the 15 States of the European Union.

The rights of the elderly are not respected when we become ill, completely incapacitated and lose our self-sufficiency: if we are lucky we are cared for by our families at home but, if not, we have to go into care homes which do what they can but, in any case, we have to pay for the care out of our own pockets with our own savings, if we have enough, and that is after we have given our work and paid taxes and contributions to the State all our lives.
Europe must take effective, practical action to uphold the rights of the most incapacitated elderly people too.
Mr President, I have taken the floor to express my satisfaction at the historic decision by which the European Parliament has adopted two extremely important amendments which confirm a principle of freedom, calling upon the Italian government and parliament to abolish the thirteenth provision of the Italian Constitution on the exile of the male descendants of the House of Savoy.
I would like to express my personal delight and satisfaction as a native of Piedmont too: this is an important, well-founded decision, for we are dealing with the last case of members of a royal family being forced to remain in exile and it is 50 years since the measure was adopted.
Their history, from Emanuele Filiberto to Mafalda of Savoy, is an integral part of the history of Europe; this rule abolition we are calling for, is in conflict with the fundamental values of freedom shared by all the countries of the European Union and affects European citizens of which one, the younger, was not even born when the thirteenth provision was adopted.
Since we are talking about human rights, I shall raise once again the violations of the rights of intellectuals of all specialisms who dare to express independent opinions on history, leading them, for example, to re-examine certain aspects of the Second World War and the tragedy of the concentration camps.
A tragedy which, unfortunately, is currently exploited relentlessly on a daily basis to profit political or financial interests which have little to do with the memory of the victims.
In fact, at the present time, there are thousands of historians, sociologists, researchers, academics or just plain citizens being persecuted in Europe when their only crime is wanting to make a free examination of the dogmas - changing dogmas moreover - that the official authors impose.
As I did in 1999, I shall give just one example, taken from our rapporteur' s own region of RhÃŽne-Alpes.
A penniless young historian, a person I did not know, Mr Plantin, was condemned just for the crime of mentioning, in a bibliography in the scholarly review he edits, works that correct historical errors to which no serious historian now adheres.
He was arrested.
His personal computer was confiscated.
Each of the usual funded associations suing him obtained heavy damages against him and his printer, a rural craftsman.
The magistrates of the Lyon Court of Appeal, Dominique Fournier, Jean-Luc Gouverneur and Marie-Odile ThÃ©olleyre, also banned publication of the review with a ruling worthy of Stalin' s court.
The counsellors at the Court of Cassation, Bruno Cotte, Christine Chanet and Guy Joly, failed in their duty by not censuring the manifestly abusive use in the case of a law on publications intended for young people.
What is more, under pressure and quite unlawfully, Professors RÃ©gis Ladous and Claude Prudhomme made themselves look ridiculous and odious by revoking, eleven years on, Mr Plantin' s master' s degree which they had marked 'Very Good' in full knowledge of the facts.
All this is going on in the twenty-first century, in France and in other European countries!
Such persecution obviously only strengthens the doubt surrounding the official dogmas.
It is unworthy and intolerable.
It must end as soon as possible.
I am very satisfied that the amendments connected with the recognition of relationships between people of the same sex were added to Mr Cornillet' s otherwise excellent report.
Regarding some other questions, I would like the report to have had more far-reaching views in the area of, for example, the adoption rights of gay and lesbian couples.
Human rights problems that affect sexual minorities are still regrettably common today in the Member States.
I think the references to legislation in applicant countries and to the fact that the equal treatment of citizens with regard to different relationships and family models should be taken into consideration in enlargement negotiations are important.
Some of the Cornillet report' s recommendations are undeniably positive.
We support extending voting rights to residents from non-Community countries, deletion of the Aznar Protocol - a veritable denial of the right of asylum, non-restrictive recognition of refugee status extending, for example to all the persecuted Algerians, measures against the discrimination suffered by the Roma, and recognition of the rights of homosexuals.
All the same, the good intentions sometimes stop halfway: detention centres and waiting areas are actually prisons in all but name, where living conditions are inhuman.
Limiting detention to 'exceptional cases' or 'a maximum period' are inadequate recommendations which maintain the criminalisation of asylum seekers and people without papers.
Article 32 proposes to 'humanise' detention for minors, but they should not have to suffer that degradation at all.
There must be standardised rules across Europe to allow victims of the traffic in human beings and domestic slavery to escape their persecutors.
Long-term residence permits would be much more effective against the exploiters than 'temporary residence permits ... for the duration of the inquiry and the judicial procedure' .
If the recitals and amendments on the right to vote and the rights of homosexuals are maintained, we will vote in favour of this report.
Otherwise we will abstain.
I abstained on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union because certain forces in this House have again exploited this report to give credence to the argument that a Member State would not be respecting fundamental rights in the European Union if it did not amend its legislation to permit homosexual marriages and grant homosexual couples the same rights as married heterosexual couples.
That is going too far.
There should be provision for unmarried heterosexual couples and homosexual couples to settle certain difficulties connected with their position, for instance by concluding an agreement.
However, there can be no question of granting them the rights of a surviving spouse in terms of social security, or, for example, the same rights as a married couple, with or without children, in terms of taxation and adoption.
Unmarried couples can separate far more easily and cheaply, while divorce proceedings are always complicated, expensive and painful.
A regulation like that advocated in the report would end up discriminating against married heterosexual couples.
That cannot be allowed to happen.
In a chapter on European citizenship, there is an attempt to get it accepted that a Member State is violating fundamental rights if it does not grant the right to vote and to stand for the European Parliament and local elections to nationals of third countries legally resident in their territory for at least three years.
The right to vote is acquired on the basis of reciprocity by citizens of Member States of the Union living in another Member State.
The Portuguese can vote and stand for election in Luxembourg and I could do the same if I lived in Portugal.
However, why grant an Algerian, for example, the right to vote in a Member State if a national of that Member State does not have the right to vote in Algeria?
I cannot agree with these demands, quite apart from the fact that we are talking about areas of civil and political rights that come under national sovereignty.
Each Member State is free to grant such rights to nationals of third countries and offer such solutions to its residents.
There can be no question of this Parliament condemning Member States which decide not to do so.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I have voted against the items (78 and 82-84) which seek to control Member States' legislation in the area of family policy.
This is a national issue, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which has no place in a report on human rights in Europe.
I have also voted against items 119 and 120 on giving people without citizenship in a Member State of the EU the right to vote in European Parliament elections.
Responsibility and duties must be linked to rights and eligibility.
This should be an obvious principle and fact of life.
Wuori report (A5-0193/2001) and Cornillet report (A5-0223/2001)
Two reports, one on human rights in the world (the Wuori report) and one on fundamental rights in the European Union (the Cornillet report), were debated by the House today.
These are two provocative texts, both in what they say (mainly in the Wuori report) and in what they fail to say (mainly in the Cornillet report).
The Wuori report supports the imperialist aspect of the European Union right from the outset saying, just so there can be no doubt, that "the principle of national sovereignty should not deny the ÃU the right to seek to exert influence - and possibly to intervene - with a view to halting gross and systematic violations of human rights".
The peoples of the Balkans and of other regions in the world have paid and are still paying dearly for this 'welcome' mission by the ÃU.
Thousands dead, even more poisoned by depleted uranium bombs, the FYROM hostage to 'invincible' Albanian extremists and protectorates across which European monopolies and their political backers are scattered.
The disgraceful manner in which former President Milosevic was recently abducted, in direct defiance both of the constitutional jurisdiction of his country and its president, and handed over to the opportunistic International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague are eloquent examples of how the EU thinks human rights should be defended.
However, the report goes further still, calling for new international criminal tribunals to be set up on Chechnya, East Timor and Iraq.
The 'rapid-reaction mechanism' for conflict prevention, that is, the euro-army, is seen as a basic tool within the framework of EU strategy and 'smart sanctions' rather than 'blind sanctions' are advocated.
Without making any reference to the criminal consequences for the people of Iraq of the embargo to which the EU made a decisive contribution, it proposes in an excess of indifference that embargoes be imposed on other countries, using existing offences against human dignity as a pretext.
Despite busying itself with absolutely everything, the report does not conceal its preferences or selectiveness.
For example, although it is directly critical of the Socialist government of Cuba for repressing 'free' journalism, it is particularly polite and cautious in the case of Turkey and Ukraine, even though it is a well-known fact that dozens of journalists are in prison in Turkey and that a journalist was murdered during the last round of elections in Ukraine.
Finally, the report's extended reference to Turkey does not contain a single word on the continuing hunger strike in Turkish jails or on the victims of Turkey's intransigence.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Topical and urgent subjects of major importance
The next item is the debate on topical, urgent and important questions.
Death penalty in the world
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0486/2001 by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;
B5-0497/2001 by Mr van den Berg and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
B5-0504/2001 by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mr Rutelli, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party;
B5-0484/2001 by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
B5-0512/2001 by Mr Manisco and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;
B5-0527/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members
on the death penalty in the world and on the introduction of a 'European Day against Capital Punishment' .
Mr President, it would appear that, considering that there are very few subjects on which the entire European Union is united and the abolition of the death penalty is one of them, we must, first and foremost, welcome and take pride in the initiative taken by Parliament and the Council of Europe together to hold the Congress on the death penalty, which took place on 22 June.
Secondly, we must make it clear that it is time to move on to the next stage, which is to prepare for the General Assembly of the United Nations and the possibility of adopting a resolution on a moratorium on executions.
I feel that this must be our task in the coming months and I hope that the Belgian Presidency will live up to the commitment it made yesterday before this House and support us.
Mr President, Mrs Frassoni is right when she says that today we are united on this matter, but twenty years ago we certainly were not.
We have therefore made progress.
Today the European Union is united against the death penalty, and this is reflected in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 2, where it mentions the right to life.
I recall that, when we were discussing this Charter, many in the Convention used to say to us: 'It is inconsistent to say that this Charter is directed to the institutions of the Union,' and you, Mr President, will no doubt remember this, 'and at the same time demand the abolition of the death penalty, when the European Union cannot condemn anybody to death.'
It is true: there was an inconsistency there.
We accepted it, however, because we believed that the Charter had to embody the values and principles that underpin the construction of Europe.
I must also tell you that recently, Mr President, when I was on a flight here, I was reading the news that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that the Constitution of that country would have to be rewritten because, in order to join the European Union, it was necessary to abolish the death penalty, as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I remembered the title of that Oscar-winning film, 'Life is Beautiful' , and realised that our work does occasionally bear fruit.
Therefore, Mr President, I believe not only that we Europeans should proclaim our desire that the death penalty should be abolished, but that we have a right and a duty to interfere in the affairs of other countries so that they do the same.
For that reason, complying with a resolution of a conference held two weeks ago in Strasbourg, we have asked in this resolution - which I am sure will gain the unanimous support of this House - for a special day against the death penalty to be set up: a European day, which I hope will soon be a world day, since I believe there is room for hope.
My good friend, Mrs Ana Palacio, who reads everything that is published, has today given me the editorial from the Herald Tribune, in which a Supreme Court judge, Mrs O' Connor, who has always been in favour of the death penalty, is today saying the opposite.
Mr President, I believe that, if intelligent people change their minds, we shall be able to win this battle throughout the world.
Mr President, the death penalty is unethical because it is wrong to take someone else' s life.
Too often, innocent people are given the death penalty. The penalty is irrevocable, and a subsequent appeal, even if fresh evidence is submitted, is no longer possible.
The death penalty is downgrading and is in contravention of the universal principle of justice.
JoaquÃ­n JosÃ© MartÃ­nez was recently acquitted in the United States. He came to visit us here in Parliament after he had been in prison for quite a few years.
It became apparent that in his case, everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong.
According to Amnesty International, at least 1 475 prisoners were executed and more than 3 000 death penalties given in 2000.
China, Iran, Saudi-Arabia and the United States account for approximately 88% of those.
The first world congress against the death penalty took place here in Strasbourg between 21 and 23 June: 87 countries in the world uphold the death penalty, to which the under-aged and also mentally handicapped people often fall victim.
We very much regret the fact that countries which often boast a very high standard in terms of human rights still elect to use this penalty, and execute - what often later appears - innocent people, while it is often clear from statistics - this is especially pronounced in the US - that social and racial aspects play a major role.
We are also extremely concerned about the fact that the organs of those involved are subsequently offered for sale.
I agree with Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo that a European day against the death penalty would be extremely useful.
Allow me to draw your attention to point 4 of the resolution which states that we urge the Belgian Presidency now to try to organise another vote in the sitting of the General Assembly of the United Nations in September on a resolution to abolish the death penalty.
We hope that the Presidency, on behalf of all EU countries, will be able to count on sufficient support so that this time the resolution can be adopted.
Mr President, Commissioner, no one is unaware of the loathing felt in this house for the death penalty, wherever it may occur.
The European Parliament is continuing its long and dedicated battle against this barbaric punishment, and we know that we have a good ally in Commissioner Patten.
Commissioner, we really appreciate your work in this area.
Our joint fight has resulted in one applicant country after another abolishing the death penalty.
This requirement is irrevocable for membership of the European Community.
It is high time that Turkey also abolished the death penalty - without delay.
It can sometimes feel hopeless fighting against the death penalty when the world is the way it is.
Mr Van den Berg has just mentioned figures showing the worldwide situation.
It is important to note that 90 per cent of all executions occur in only four countries.
The worst by far is China with over 1 000 executions this year alone.
It is also deeply tragic to have to place the US on the same list as the dictatorships.
Over and over again, we have appealed to the American leaders to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty and to stop sentencing teenagers and the mentally disabled to death.
Just the suspicion that one single person has been falsely executed - and we know this has happened in the US - should be sufficient reason to abolish the death penalty.
However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel.
It is encouraging that there is a certain, albeit slow, shift in opinion in the US.
It is also the case that, during the 1990s, 30 countries abolished the death penalty.
Here in Strasbourg, a successful conference was held two weeks ago.
Both the EU and the European Council will continue to fight tirelessly.
In order to further strengthen the fight against the death penalty and to ensure that this issue is always on the agenda, a year ago in this House my colleague Mr Rutelli proposed a European day against the death penalty.
We could hold this every year until the death penalty is abolished everywhere.
It is encouraging that this is also the view of this House, and I hope that the Council and the Commission can work with the European Parliament to bring about such a day.
Mr President, I am going to be very brief.
In the last five years, I have had the impression that whenever we place this dramatic issue, this routine horror of the death penalty on the agenda, the House has been a kind of debating society.
Everybody expresses their condemnation and their righteous indignation, but when the moment comes to decide what to do about the indifference, the apathy and the determination of some countries to insist on these barbaric institutions, the mood changes because obviously money talks.
Mercantile relations are very important for everybody, and while it is good to denounce the sin, we need to identify the sinners.
That is why in this resolution that we are going to pass, I would like very much to add the names of the sinners.
First of all, the People's Republic of China.
We have read yesterday and today what happened with the so-called 'suicide' of 15 women in a concentration camp.
We passed resolutions in this House two years ago about the trade in human organs transplanted from executed people.
Now we have to start thinking about, for instance, not voting enthusiastically for giving the Olympic Games to the People's Republic of China without reservation.
The same applies to the United States of America.
That is why I am tabling two amendments to our resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me make one comment first of all. Our resolution mentions 87 countries which still have the death penalty.
I do not think that figure - which is provided by Amnesty International - is accurate.
There are actually 71 countries which continue to apply the death penalty, and I think the difference is important given that there are 180 countries in the international community and that means the majority of abolitionist countries is much bigger than Amnesty International' s figures suggest.
Furthermore, I do not think we need to regard Amnesty International either as a bible for a whole series of issues, or indeed as a representative of civil society, which is not at all the case. It is an association which does a certain job and which, in my opinion, also deserves a critical look from us from time to time, if not more frequently.
Secondly - as Monica Frassoni said, along with Mr van den Berg and Mr Manisco - I think the problem is to come to the United Nations Assembly General with a resolution on the moratorium.
The problem is not to abolish death.
I think there are sometimes temptations in that direction.
Our problem is to abolish the death penalty because we believe there is a way to render justice without recourse to it.
The problem therefore consists of obtaining a moratorium, an entirely secular initiative, designed to lead other governments to consider the arguments against the death penalty and conclude, in a wise, secular way, that it is no longer necessary.
Consequently I believe our work over the next few weeks will be important to enable the Belgian Presidency to present a resolution on a moratorium in New York.
Mr President, we in the European Union must support any action leading to the abolition of the death penalty.
The abolitionists, who have met in Strasbourg at the first world conference against the death penalty, can count - and know they can count - on our full and active support.
A European day against the death penalty - as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo was saying, and I agree with him - is a good idea, but it is not enough.
We must also encourage the Community institutions and the European Union Member States to take our belief to its ultimate consequences - our belief, which without any doubt is reflected in all our legal systems, that the death penalty is against the law and is just as bad as other historical monstrosities, such as slavery.
The European Union should, therefore, as we request in the resolution, consider the abolition of the death penalty to be an essential aspect of its relations with third countries, and consequently this should be reflected in the conclusions of international agreements, aid programmes and trade relations.
Since Mr Van den Berg has already done so, I do not wish to mention such aberrations as the execution of minors or the physically disabled, nor to talk about cases of innocent people condemned to death.
I shall not go into the figures, either - because what Mr Dupuis has just said is true - and in any case I think they are irrelevant: a single case is itself a monstrosity.
The abolition of the death penalty is an elementary principle in the state of civilisation in which we now find ourselves, and nobody should be deprived of their life by a court sentence.
I therefore support both this resolution and the European day against the death penalty, but I believe we still have to go a little further in all our work to achieve the abolition of the death penalty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to salute the initiators of the first World Congress against the Death Penalty, which I consider the crowning achievement of abolitionists the world over.
Very important work was accomplished during those three days and I also salute the personal commitment of our President who, with her counterpart from the Council of Europe, called on the governments to establish a world moratorium on executions. That moratorium was signed by the 40 countries present, here, in this very Chamber.
Fighting for the abolition of the death penalty - as has been said here - means fighting to strengthen human dignity and extend human rights.
I think the European Union is doing that and it must continue its efforts, but I also think it is sometimes important, in an assembly like the United Nations, to put one' s own house in order first.
By that I mean that countries like Turkey, Russia and Armenia, members of the Council of Europe and applicants to join the European Union, must eliminate the death penalty from their respective criminal codes.
That, in my opinion, is a sine qua non of whether or not they become members and a guarantee that this fundamental principle of human rights is respected within the European Union.
Then, as Robert Badinter has underlined, the debate has moved forward enormously. One hundred countries have already abolished the death penalty.
Even in the United States, where 80% of people were in favour of the death penalty five or six years ago, that figure is down to 66% today.
That means that the struggle is making progress, and so much the better.
However, that has not prevented the existence of another highly symbolic case in the battle against the death penalty: the case of Moumia Abou Jamal.
From amongst the 3 700 people who are still on death row in the United States, Moumia Abou Jamal stands out as a symbol because he is in prison and on death row for being black, and in that respect his case reminds me a little of the struggle of Nelson Mandela.
He is in prison for being an intellectual writer, and in that he reminds me a little of Solzhenitsyn, and because he dared to write at a time when no one was writing against the atrocities of the Philadelphia police.
And finally he was a militant, an activist as they say in English.
He now finds himself on death row for these three reasons and I think it would be a marvellous signal if a country like the United States, which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, were to abolish the death penalty and free Moumia Abou Jamal.
Imagine the weight that would carry for countries like China and the other countries that continue this barbaric practice!
I am counting massively on the Belgian Presidency to move this idea forward with the full support of all of us here.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every Member State has undertaken to abide by the general declaration on human rights and hence to oppose capital punishment.
The death penalty violates the right to life and is degrading.
According to Amnesty International, 1457 people were executed in 2000, of which 85 were executed in the USA, 1000 in China, 75 in Iran and 123 in Saudi Arabia.
In Iran last week, a woman was condemned to death by stoning for adultery.
It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages.
This cruelty outrages and horrifies me.
No death sentences have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, it is true, but people are still condemned to death.
This is unacceptable, especially in a country which aspires to become a member of the EU.
Turkey must abolish the death penalty before it can be accepted in the European Union.
Every time a death penalty is carried out, there is a possibility that an innocent person has been executed.
Such cases have occurred in the past.
I am particularly concerned about the current debate in Russia on the restoration of the death penalty.
Five years after the last execution, more and more people are calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced for terrorists and drug dealers.
I should like to remind Russia that it undertook to abolish the death penalty when it joined the Council of Europe five years ago.
Armenia and Turkey must also honour this commitment as members of the Council of Europe.
The first world congress against capital punishment was held in Strasbourg in June.
I welcome events such as this, which endeavour to find ways of abolishing the death penalty.
I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric institution.
It is cruel and inhumane.
I condemn all 87 countries which still have the death penalty and call on those responsible to abolish it.
Mr President, I think we also have to thank Mrs Fontaine.
In the Spanish press we have read an article which, I believe, is a good reflection of the feelings of this Parliament against the death penalty.
I do not know if it has appeared in the press in other countries in Europe.
Secondly, I should like to recall here, Mr President, that on the other two occasions on which I spoke against the death penalty I talked about a Spaniard who was on death row in the United States, JoaquÃ­n JosÃ© MartÃ­nez.
I had the chance to talk to him and his parents last week, and among other chilling details that they told me was the 100 million pesetas that they had to raise to have their son released.
This is a common situation for minorities in the United States.
I confess that I never thought he could be released, and I am delighted to have seen him here alive.
The death penalty in my view is barbaric, Mr President.
Eighty-eight per cent of these death penalties are concentrated in four countries, and so Europe must talk to these countries to get them to stop murdering each other legally.
Our presence in the United Nations should also be used, as it always has been, to come out against the death penalty.
I very much welcome the fact that all the European Union institutions are united in working towards the abolition of the death penalty and am pleased that once again the European Parliament is in the forefront of these efforts.
As the House knows, both the Council and the Commission have made abolition a priority.
The Council is pursuing implementation of the European Union guidelines where the death penalty still exists.
The European Union calls for its use to be progressively restricted and insists that it be carried out according to minimum standards.
The European Union also presses, where relevant, for moratoria to be introduced.
It might just be helpful if I set out in detail the guidelines of our policy towards third countries on the death penalty.
Those guidelines stipulate that the subject should be mentioned, if appropriate, during political dialogue with those countries.
It was mentioned, for example, in our recent meetings with the United States.
The guidelines stipulate that dÃ©marches should be made when there is a threat that the death penalty will be restored or that an official or de facto moratorium will cease.
The guidelines make it clear that supportive dÃ©marches or public statements should be made when a country takes steps towards abolition.
We indicate, in the guidelines, that individual dÃ©marches should be made when it seems that minimum standards in this area are being violated.
For example: when there is a lack of legal safeguards; when the death penalty is to be applied to those who were minors when the offence was committed; to pregnant women or to the mother of a young child or to the mentally ill and the application of the death penalty for non-violent crimes or offences such as crimes of opinion and conscience and financial crimes.
In the recently adopted communication on human rights and democratisation, the Commission identified the campaign for the abolition of the death penalty as one of the four priorities that we would pursue over coming years under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
We have already funded a number of projects in this area by mobilising public opinion worldwide against capital punishment.
We hope to consign the death penalty to the history books as a form of punishment which has no place in the modern world.
To take an example, and I follow what an honourable Member said a moment or two ago, I find it almost impossible to believe that I am reading a newspaper published in 2001 when I read reports that women in Iran are once again being sentenced to death by stoning.
I agree with honourable Members that the first World Congress to abolish the death penalty in Strasbourg on 21 and 22 June 2001 was a very important gathering.
While I was not able to attend in person, the Commission services represented me and delivered an address.
I understand that the presence of those individuals who came to the Congress to testify about the years they had spent awaiting execution before being declared innocent was particularly moving and particularly valuable.
Also, I believe that the Congress proved useful in highlighting both the difficult problems related to the abolition of the death penalty and in gathering suggestions of a number of innovative policy strategies, in particular, from the American participants.
It was interesting to hear the honourable Member's remarks about recent converts on this issue.
I also take this opportunity to thank the President for her initiative to invite a number of presidents of parliaments as well as the Congress participants to attend the solemn appeal that took place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 June last.
This was an important part of the Congress highlighting the important role of parliaments in eliminating the death penalty.
The Strasbourg appeal that was adopted at this event will serve as an important reference document for our continued efforts to abolish the death penalty.
I am sure that as long as it is required, this Parliament along with the other European institutions, will continue to give this issue the priority and the importance which it deserves.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

on Beijing's application to host the 2008 Olympic Games.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Patten, you are well acquainted with this region.
Next week the IOC will decide which country is to host the 2008 Olympic Games.
The People's Republic of China, which is currently seeking political recognition on all fronts, would appear to be the most likely candidate.
Anyone who thinks that Beijing does not stand a chance after failing in its bid in 2000 and 2004, has not thought hard enough.
Politics in China have nothing in common with the spirit of the Olympic Games.
