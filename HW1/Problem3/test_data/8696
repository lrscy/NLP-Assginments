In some areas, exchange of best practice is probably enough, which is why I am pleased that my amendments on health care-acquired infections were adopted in committee.
Infections like MRSA are serious not only for hospital patients, but also for hospital workers.
Rates of infection vary considerably between Member States.
For example, the rate of infection in the UK is 10 times higher than in the Netherlands.
We need to know why, and how we can learn from best practice.
That is why, in one of my amendments adopted in committee, I called for an EU code of good practice on health care-acquired infections, and for the screening of all health care workers to be encouraged across the EU.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Willmott, for her excellent work and especially for having been so willing to compromise.
More than 160 000 people are killed and some 300 000 incapacitated every year in the EU because of industrial accidents and occupational diseases.
That is too many.
In this society of ours in which the individual is often regarded as a mere production factor, too little emphasis is placed on the human aspect of this problem.
The state, by which I mean legislatures and governments, must ensure that purely profit-driven business operators bear the social cost of exploitation.
That is the only way to ensure that the necessary priority is attached to health and safety at work.
Public opinion tends to take more notice of industrial accidents than of the wide diversity of occupational diseases.
More extensive and vigorous efforts are needed to redress the balance.
Improvements cannot be achieved without close scrutiny, in other words inspections and analyses and the setting of precise targets for reductions in the incidence of occupational diseases, including new illnesses affecting those who work in fields such as nanotechnology.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, adopting this report on health and safety at work would add yet more bureaucracy and red tape, just when I thought the Commission were intending to reduce that!
Workers losing time through illness and injury put up the cost to the enterprise concerned and hence their prices.
In an EU of free movement of goods and services there is more competition, so those who do not look after their workforce lose business.
People off work through illness also raise the cost of social benefits, contributing further to a rise in prices.
It is therefore in a company's best interests to keep its workforce in good health.
Good ideas always spread, so that should not be too difficult.
This depends, of course, on there being a free market, but of course, if like some members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs you think this leads to the law of the jungle, then you have another serious illness to contend with.
Apparently, Member States which promote a free market are psychiatric cases.
(FR) Madame President, the suicides of Renault and Peugeot workers in France and the thousands of cases of lung cancer among people whose jobs involve contact with asbestos are clear evidence that health at work is a problem.
In response, the European Commission has produced a communication elevated to the status of a 'health strategy', which in fact reads like something from Walt Disney - a resolution drafted by Snow White for the Seven Dwarfs.
And it really is quite touching.
In paragraph 35, for example, we are told that we need healthy lifestyles at the workplace; paragraph 29 is about encouraging medical examinations; paragraph 54 urges the installation of fire sprinklers; in paragraph 49 we read that stress is a threat to health; and recital D suggests, low and behold, that fatal accidents are more common among construction workers than among senior European civil servants.
Luckily, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry has solutions to offer, including the employment of a psychologist and a chaplain for every 500 employees.
We are actually told nothing, however, about the causes of occupational illness - of which there are three.
The first is the ideology of dismantling protection at our borders, thus placing our workers in unfair competition with Asian slave labour.
The only way our industries can survive is by going all out for higher productivity, at the expense of health.
The second problem is the daft policy of the strong euro, making us uncompetitive in terms of exchange rates.
The only variable left to adjust is productivity, which is forced up once again, and once again health is compromised.
The third cause of our troubles is the neurotic philosophy of competitiveness - in effect an economic war between Europe and Asia or Europe and Latin America.
But wars result in casualties and deaths, and the victims in this case are the people afflicted by occupational illness and accidents.
In other words, the European worker is out there like a bull in the global economic arena, stressed and bloody and giving his all, until his health has gone.
The solution is to take our workers out of that global arena with its unfair rules, and that will require new customs technology for deductible customs duties.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to give an overview of the key points of this strategy and discuss the recommendations contained in my opinion.
Guaranteeing equal social coverage of all workers regardless of the form of contract, speeding up bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized undertakings, and providing incentives, including financial incentives, for training are aspects of primary importance.
To discuss only those aspects would, however, be less than generous towards those who rightly call for explanations and justice in face of dreadful tragedies such as the one that occurred a few days ago in Turin, to which Mr Panzeri referred a moment ago.
During the night of 6/7 December, a fire that spread through the ThyssenKrupp factory killed seven workers; the fire extinguishers were not working.
It was only later that it emerged that the factory did not comply with safety regulations!
The European Parliament and I myself cannot fail to record that disgrace.
I certainly do not intend totally to condemn the conduct of the German multinational or even imagine that the factory, however guilty, maliciously and deliberately failed to comply with the safety requirements in order to save money.
I will not espouse the ideological arguments put forward by some Italian left-wing union members who, on learning last June of the closure of the factory, set themselves up as champions of safety and declared that they were responsible for and took care of safety at the factory.
However, the moment has not yet come to make judgments, especially hasty ones.
While respecting national competences in the matter, I do consider it urgently necessary for the European Union to guarantee that laws are implemented in full, first and foremost by reinforcing the inspection activities of the Agency for Health and Safety at Work, and to strengthen the coordination between the various national agencies by improving the functioning of the European Senior Labour Inspectors' Committee.
(EL) Madam President, there is no doubt that health and safety at work contribute to quality management, economic performance and competitiveness, and that they help in the development of the economy, and in the achievement of budget targets, including the budgets for the social security schemes.
Of course, beyond all these technical matters, there are humanitarian reasons which make it not only necessary, but also a matter of priority, to protect the health of employees and ensure that workplaces are safe.
The strategy for 2002-2006 has given positive results, and the prospects for 2007 onwards are positive if we all play a part - not only in terms of European planning, but also at the corresponding national level - in monitoring and planning for health and safety, especially in the vulnerable categories, which means young people, older employees - whom we are calling on to participate in production for a longer period of their lives - and also women, who are likewise called on to participate in working life.
A working life with new demands, fragmented into many different kinds of contract, self-employment, and small and medium-sized enterprises which lack the capability of large enterprises to impose proper working and safety conditions.
It must therefore be the concern of all of us to manage national and Community resources correctly, as the Willmott report proposes, so that the desired results can be achieved.
(EL) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating our colleague Mrs Willmott, because her report has to a large extent covered the serious gaps in the Commission's communication.
Dignity at work means health and safety at work.
It means carrying out studies on the prevention of occupational risks, and it means employers providing preventive medical check-ups.
It means lifelong learning, vocational education and training.
It means health and safety as key criteria for commercial agreements with third countries.
But if these proposals are to carry any weight, a basic requirement is, of course, continuous social dialogue, but above all, we need to confront the fundamental threats overshadowing the area of labour relations.
I am referring specifically to the spread of poverty among employees, the rapid growth of unofficial forms of employment, and the increase in working hours.
If there are no fully human-centred policies capable of reversing this new employment "dark agesâ, social clashes are inevitable.
(EL) Madam President, the measures proposed by the European Commission for strategy until the year 2012, are mostly superficial and concentrate on ensuring that competitiveness is not affected.
The target of reducing accidents by 25% by the end of the strategy period may look impressive, but in reality it is completely inadequate.
The target should be to lay the groundwork and reinforce the institutional interventions by the state, so that the tragic death toll of thousands annually - and similar numbers with serious health problems due to the quality of their working environment - comes closer to being eliminated.
The rapporteur focuses rather on the exploitation to which employees are subject, such as those working in hazardous jobs, women, temporary workers, immigrants, the elderly, and proposes stricter measures against employers, and guaranteed supervision.
One of the most significant contributions of the report is perhaps the finding that permanent employment is a requirement for combating accidents and work-related illnesses.
In addition, apart from accidents, more attention should be given to the causes behind the onset of mental illnesses, addiction, and the psychological hazards of the workplace.
What is needed, then, is a many-sided approach to all the factors affecting health and safety in the workplace.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that when I read the Community strategy for health and safety at work 2007-2012, which was presented last February by the European Commission, I was in many ways disappointed.
Even though the Commission set out in this strategy a relatively ambitious target to reduce the number of industrial accidents by 25%, the strategy contains only a very small number of concrete initiatives and recommendations as to how to achieve this target.
In addition, it focuses again mainly on industrial accidents, which are of course only one aspect of work-related health problems.
Occupational diseases are somewhat neglected.
This is, in my opinion, a step backwards.
On the other hand, I must thank and congratulate Mrs Willmott on her report on this strategy.
The report, unlike the Commission's document, contains many concrete proposals and recommendations as to how to achieve better results in the field of health and safety at work.
I am pleased that the rapporteur is also stressing the need to define cancer correctly and to express cancer numerically as an occupational disease, to specify the targets for the reduction of this severe disease.
Up to now only 5% of cancer cases caused by work were classified as an occupational disease.
I have greatly welcomed the incorporation in the report of my amendment, which I tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the need to secure for the general public free access to technical norms.
This is a problem employees of many Member States are constantly struggling with and one that should be rectified.
Madam President, if we are going to reduce workplace accidents, we need to know how they happen.
We cannot study all accidents and all near misses but, let me tell you, a 19-year-old Irish lad died on a construction site because his lighter Japanese bulldozer had heavy European shovels.
His death was registered as a construction death and the Irish Health and Safety Authority never looked any further.
So how can we save the next person that drives a tractor with mismatched equipment?
Because we do not know.
We cannot investigate everything, but we can look at all fatal and debilitating accidents, especially those in the most dangerous sectors like agriculture, fishing, construction and transport.
We need to break it down to make practical measures.
Also, aside from risk jobs, we have very vulnerable sections of the workforce - elderly, disabled and workers who do not speak the language of their present workplace.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I too want to express my sympathy following the tragedy that struck the workers in the Turin factory; I believe it is indisputable fact that there are too many deaths from occupational accidents in Italy because not enough is being done to prevent them and comply with the rules.
Responsibility for this is shared equally between undertakings, unions and inspection agencies.
We find undertakings that resort to illegal workers, especially from non-EU countries, or factories such as ThyssenKrupp, with their old-style industrial arrogance; those who should be defending the interests of the workers often consent to, if not connive in such situations, instead of being vigilant and quick to point out failings in the safety system to those in charge; finally, the works inspectorate and other bodies in charge of control and monitoring often fail to show much initiative.
We must promote safety at the workplace in the EU and in that respect the Willmott report is more satisfactory than the Commission proposal.
I believe that when we speak of work and industry, we must not confine ourselves merely to ensuring freedom of competition and competitiveness.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people are still dying at the workplace.
In an area where man should be able to demonstrate his ability to manipulate matter with force and creativity, to develop his knowledge and earn his living, we all too often find instances of death and threats to life and limb.
That is why there is such anger and bewilderment in Italian public opinion about the seven workers who died in the fire at the ThyssenKrupp factory in Turin last December and why we must ask ourselves what was not working properly in that factory, so that we can avoid these disasters.
We are responsible for such inadequacies in every place of work.
Today we have highly-advanced legislation designed to support an appropriate preventive policy, define the obligations incumbent on undertakings and deal with new occupational diseases in Europe.
What we lack, however, is adequate controls, inspections to ensure the laws are observed, staff and financial resources.
We still do not have a culture that values the importance of rigorous preventive services, that regards prevention as a continuous process rather than as a one-off obligation, that establishes a continuous dialogue between the parties concerned with a view effectively to developing high safety standards, and that can spot the emergence of new psychosocial occupational diseases.
In conclusion I also believe we must come back to the subject matter of the Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, which is a cohesive and innovative aspect, in relation to the commitment to reduce occupational accidents and diseases.
(CS) To start with I would like to thank Mrs Willmott for her very carefully prepared report.
It is stated that the Commission's objective is to reduce industrial accidents by 25%.
I do not believe this will be possible.
There is an insufficient number of work inspectors and they have insufficient tools at their disposal to make changes.
The influence of the trade unions is being permanently reduced; in many countries they no longer take part in investigations into the causes of industrial accidents and eradication of their consequences.
Further, there is the jungle that is the employment of workers by agencies, and there is also the pressure for constant expansion of so-called flexibility in the working time of employees.
This leads to employees working many hours and the accident risks are increasing .
(PL) Madam President, the draft resolution emphasises the social responsibility of companies for health and safety at work, while paying attention to the issue of honest competition.
It takes into account the great importance of dialogue between social partners, particularly the role of trades unions in improving safety in the work environment.
It also draws attention to the need for special treatment of small and medium sized enterprises in the strategy for improving health and safety as well as the need to provide ongoing training to employees.
The majority of accidents involve persons who are just starting work, who are lacking experience, as well as persons who have too little time for rest after work.
It contains important comments concerning the rehabilitation and integration in the workplace of persons returning to work after an accident, as well as requirements concerning non-discrimination as regards access to work for persons with cancer.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
(PL) Madam President, we have been debating the European labour market strategy in this house for some years.
We have many opinions as regards the direction our activities should take.
There are those who favour a profound harmonisation of employment legislation, others who defend the view that the natural diversity in European labour markets is advantageous for the EU economy.
As you know, my views on this matter favour the second view, with one important exception.
This exception concerns the regulation of health and safety at work.
I believe that, in this area, the active involvement of EU institutions is both justified and necessary.
Following the most recent extension to the EU we can see an even greater diversity of work conditions.
This diversity is both territorial and environmental in nature, as, whatever the country, the majority of work accidents and work-related illnesses affect such groups as migrant workers, young employees or older persons.
I do not want to imply that these are groups that are subject to targeted and conscious discrimination.
It is rather a consequence of insufficient education and lack of experience.
All the more reason for providing appropriate work and safety conditions for just these workers.
I would also like to point out that, in any Member State, we can see greater problems in complying with the highest safety standards at work in such sectors as construction, agriculture and transport.
It is in these sectors above all that small and medium sized enterprises are found and their financial, organisational and legal capabilities make it difficult for them to comply with high health and safety standards.
It is just these companies that require support from the European Union, from EU institutions and from the governments of Member States, and this support is needed urgently.
It is not just a question of sanctions and increased monitoring.
These instruments, which are of course essential, should be accompanied by investment in the education both of employees and employers as well as financial support for improved and safer workplace equipment.
(RO) We welcome the good intentions of the Commission; however, we are in doubt as to their effectiveness.
Accurate statistics concerning occupational diseases are required in order to maximize policy impact and to protect workers.
Existing data are incomplete, either misjudging phenomena or ignoring reality.
Women are the main victims of this shortcoming, primarily because they are more involved in informal, or "grey", economy.
In this sector, the effects of working conditions on health are not recorded at all.
The existing legal framework maintains an approach which lays emphasis on accidents and hazards in the so-called "heavyâ, male-dominated branches of economy.
We call on the Commission for a more careful consideration of the specific differences between male and female employees and for an assessment of the availability of data broken down by gender and data concerning the long-term effects and psychological consequences of employment.
To substantiate our request, we would like to invite you to take a tour of a textile factory.
Sight and hearing can be significantly impaired, and the prevalence of circulatory disease is high.
Statistics ignore the situation.
This is so-called "light" industry, where most of the workers are women, and wages are also low because there are supposedly no risks involved.
Thus, current statistics preserve the historical inequality between men and women, including the gender gap in payment.
(DE) Madam President, a Community strategy for health and safety at work is absolutely essential.
While technical health and safety measures are effecting rapid improvements, the meteoric pace of change in the working world poses new risks.
The problems and hazards involved in working with new chemical substances are self-evident.
First and foremost, however, the increasing pressure to perform which characterises the contemporary workplace creates not only physical problems but psychological problems too.
Insecure jobs and people's fear of losing their livelihood lead to psychosocial problems.
New potential for aggression builds up, new stress factors lead to mental abuse, and bullying becomes a common occurrence.
SMEs are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures, information, supervision and training.
Accordingly, this resolution is more important than is probably recognised.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
(DE) Madam President, health in the workplace must be given priority.
Our Parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are among the places where more action is needed.
Just take the ambient temperature in this chamber, which borders on a health risk.
I also believe in the power of good example.
A few months ago I was stranded in a hotel in Greece as a forest fire raged all around, and I must say that the hotel, a typical SME, had prepared for that eventuality in the most exemplary fashion.
Had not all the safety precautions been perfectly devised, well organised and properly drilled, many of the people there could probably not have survived.
That is why I believe that great importance attaches to this learning process to which Mr Ettl referred, this training and preparing for emergencies.
Incentive systems would also be useful in this respect; insurers, for example, could allow appropriate discounts on premiums to companies with trained staff, and social-insurance schemes could also offer relevant training courses.
- (SK) As a Member of the European Parliament and a physician, I welcome the Commission's plan to reduce industrial accidents within the European Union on average by 25% and I am aware of the need to implement more effective measures in all the Member States, among which there are huge disparities.
Besides sectors such as metalwork, the construction industry, electrical work or forestry, I would also like to highlight the high-risk jobs of doctors and healthcare staff, who in their jobs are exposed to huge risks of infection and AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis and many other infections.
I also regret that the reduction in the number of industrial injuries and occupational diseases in particular did not include, for example, migrant workers, workers with temporary contracts, workers with low qualifications, and women in certain companies, such as small and medium-sized companies.
I would highlight the provisions in some countries that successfully implement comprehensive rehabilitation after an accident as a condition for successful return to the labour market.
(RO) As ITRE rapporteur for this document, I have asked for the active promotion of involvement in European trade unions and I have called on the Commission to propose a legal framework that would encourage social partners to engage in cross-border bargaining.
The European Commission and the Member States could provide funding for training labour representatives which would defend and promote workers' rights to safety and health at the workplace.
We also asked all Member States to sign and ratify the UN Convention on the protection of migrant workers and their families and to coordinate the improvement of access to training, particularly for part-time workers and contract workers, to enable them to secure more stable employment.
I believe that Member States should enforce the measure required for difficult or dangerous work to be recognised as such and reflected in the social protection of a person both during employment and after retirement.
(RO) A European strategy on health and safety at work is a welcome initiative on the part of the European Commission.
However, I believe that further aspects should also come under scrutiny.
As one of the previous speakers very aptly pointed out, we should take into account that there is a special situation concerning immigrants on the European labour market.
A recent study of the European Commission shows that migrants are exposed to much higher degrees of risk concerning health and safety at the work place. This is due both to the prevalence of illegal work, and to other factors such as: lack of awareness of social benefit and pension entitlements in Member States, and problems in the cross-border use of health insurance.
Such matters fall within the Community remit, and the Commission should be closely monitoring the application of European laws, so as to improve the precarious circumstances of migrants.
Moreover, European funding could be used for training additional labour protection inspectors who would identify failures to comply with health and safety regulations at the work place.
Madam President, I would like to speak about needlestick injuries, because I was responsible for the 2006 report on this issue.
I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree with me that, where a risk is identified that needs to be tackled at European level, then there is a need for the Commission to ask expeditiously.
If he does agree, I wonder whether he can explain why it took a full year for the Commission to manage and assess the first round of consultation with the social partners on needlestick injuries, even though there were only 10 responses in that consultation.
I wonder whether he can also assure us that work on this issue will proceed faster in the year ahead.
One million workers a year are affected by needlestick injuries.
That means around one and half million will have been affected since the report was completed by Parliament.
Could the Commission please act a little faster in future?
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I thank all the speakers for their very positive contributions.
Indeed, every accident, every injury, every death at work, such as those which occurred last December in Turin in Italy, reminds us that more needs to be done to protect the working men and women of Europe.
It reminds us that more has to be done to achieve our ultimate aim: to make Europe a safer place to work.
The new strategy is aimed precisely at reducing today's unacceptable level of work accidents and occupational illnesses.
I would like to emphasise that, taking account of the available human resources, one can say that the current allocation of personnel will allow the Commission's departments to perform their duties properly in this area.
Within the framework of the overall deployment of human resources allocated to the field of employment and social affairs, the Commission will be constantly assessing the workload in the various specialised areas, and will allocate staff accordingly.
I would also like to mention, on the issue of needleprick injuries, that we are preparing a relevant proposal for an amendment to the Directive, which we shall submit in 2008.
Again, I would like to thank this House for this discussion and for approving Mrs Willmott's report.
We have seen proof, once again, of the European Parliament's strong policy support for the principle of keeping health and safety at work high on the agenda - for the benefit of the economy, and also as a guarantee that employees will return safe and sound to their loved ones after work.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I should like to thank my colleagues for their comments and to make just a couple of points.
Firstly, on the issue of cancers, it is necessary to revise the Carcinogens Directive to reflect technical progress and changes in scientific knowledge in the world of work.
It is important that we have effective binding limits for carcinogens, mutagens and substances toxic for reproduction.
Limit values should be based on scientific evidence, and I would urge the EU Scientific Committee to examine crystalline silica as a matter of priority.
I would urge colleagues not to delete reference to this and oppose Amendment 6.
Secondly, the report calls for nanotechnologies to be monitored and potential risks to health assessed, and I would urge colleagues to oppose Amendment 5, which seeks to delete this.
I fully recognise the potential benefits of nanotechnologies.
Nevertheless, the rapid growth of such technologies is outstripping our understanding of the potential occupational health risks: workers can be exposed to nanoparticles through inhalation, dermal contact and ingestion, and we cannot bury our heads in the sand and refuse to carry out research and assess whether there are any risks.
Thirdly, I would just like to reiterate the call for the Commission to bring forward a legislative amendment to the Directive on risks from biological agents at work in order to address the problem of needlestick injuries.
This needs to be done as a matter of urgency.
As I mentioned earlier, health and safety is a fundamental right included in the Charter.
We need a strong EU strategy to ensure that this fundamental right is upheld and that workers throughout the EU are adequately protected.
Each single accident and each work-related illness constitutes a breach of a worker's fundamental rights.
We all know there is a strong economic case, as well as good business reasons, for good health and safety in the workplace but, more importantly, the strongest argument has to be the cost to human health and the lives that can be saved.
One life every three and a half minutes - who can argue with that?
(Applause)
- (EL) The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Tuesday 15 January 2008, at 12 p.m.
in writing. - (FR) I should like to begin by congratulating the European Commission on its Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012, and on the work achieved by our Parliamentary Committee.
Every year, almost 500 000 people die or suffer permanent disability for work-related reasons, and we must applaud the European Commission's goal of achieving an average 25% reduction in work-related accidents in the EU.
I support the idea of increased activity by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao (Spain).
In this matter and, more generally, in the development of social Europe, I regret the fact that neither the report nor, moreover, the Communication from the European Commission stresses that it is essential to support the social partners; we must always remember that under the existing Treaties, with Articles 137 ff. of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) (and this has been confirmed by the Lisbon Treaty that is in the process of being ratified), legislative instruments are available to the latter to facilitate the development of European social law.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (debate)
(EL) On the agenda for discussion, we have the report given by Csaba Ãry on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the application of social security schemes to wage-earners, non-earners and members of their families moving within the Community - C6-0104/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, honourable members of the European Parliament, the document submitted to you today is the latest Regulation amending Regulation 1408/71.
This is the well-known Regulation on the coordination of social security schemes.
For more than 30 years, this Regulation has formed the basis for coordinating the national social security schemes.
In recent years, an effort has been initiated to update and simplify this Regulation and the Regulation implementing it.
Parliament has already approved the new Regulation 883/2004, and the remaining instruments which are required for its implementation are already under negotiation.
These are the implementing Regulation and the text of the Annexes.
Pending the entry into force of these new legislative instruments, it is necessary to update the validity of Regulation 1408/71.
This new technical update is therefore submitted to you.
It applies only to the text of the Annexes to the Regulation, and aims to take account of the changes made to the national legislations.
It is important that this text should be approved without delay, so that Regulation 1408/71 can be updated, ensuring legal certainty and observance of citizens' rights.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Mr Åry for the cooperation between our two institutions.
As he clearly stated in his report, a vote on this act on first reading will make it possible to adopt it without delay.
In this spirit, the amendments have been drawn up, including the technical changes made by the Council.
On the other hand, he has not included, at this stage, the discussions which can more fruitfully be held in the context of examining the implementing Regulation, for which the rapporteur is Mrs Lambert, or the text of the Annexes, especially Annex 11, for which the rapporteur is Mrs Bozkurt.
There are some who would like to seize the opportunity given by this report, to address wider issues - for example, trans-border health services.
Despite the obvious concern about these issues, I do not think it is advisable to examine them within the scope of the present technical update.
A limited but pragmatic approach to the technical update is a better safeguard for citizens' rights.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Åry for this.
The Commission is in favour of amendments 1 to 6, 9 and 11, which bring the original text into line with the Council's general orientation, and in favour of amendments 7 and 8, which regulate a particular difficulty which arose recently in a Member State, the Netherlands, after the health insurance reform came into effect.
On the other hand, the Commission is not in favour of amendment 10.
The imprecise drafting of this amendment does not allow proper management of the specific situations which it aims to regulate.
The amendment calls into question the rules of priority in the field of family benefits.
Such an amendment would have legal and economic consequences far beyond the Member State concerned.
Thank you for your attention, and once again I congratulate the rapporteur on his contribution and his excellent cooperation.
rapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, allow me to say a few words about the legislation before us and its significance, before I move on to the smaller matters surrounding the proposed amendments.
As the Commissioner said, it is true that this is very old legislation.
It was born in 1971 and has traditionally played a prominent role ever since, as a secondary regulatory instrument for the fundamental right of freedom of employment within the Union.
It cannot be denied that the right of free movement of labour recorded in the Treaty would be worth very little in itself if citizens looking for work in other Member States could not have access to the social security systems, or if the portability of rights could not be ensured.
In connection with movement within the Union, workers who take significant risks must not suffer any disadvantage with regard to social security and fundamental social rights.
Only then can free movement of labour play an important role in equalising the Union's labour markets, which the Union's economy needs.
On the other hand, we should also see and note that Regulation 1408, which we are now discussing, can only fulfil its function if we continuously harmonise it with national legislation.
However, questions on social policy, employment and movement of labour basically belong to and affect national competences.
This is why it has been, and is, necessary to constantly amend and supplement the legislation from one year to the next.
This is crucial legislation, since it looks as though we are just agreeing on different wording, but in fact this affects people, people's destinies and people's everyday problems.
Therefore, as legislators, it is still our duty, even if we know that this text will only be in force for a very short time because, as the Commissioner has already mentioned the new Regulation and the new Directive already exist.
They have already been born.
Until we produce the implementing regulation, the interests of legal security require that we continuously update and adjust the wording to changes in the national legislation.
A good example of this is the first proposed amendment, where in Hungarian law the concept of 'close dependant' was amended in the Civil Code, and now an opportunity has opened up for us to adjust the European wording to this.
However, this also related to the proposed amendments affecting the Netherlands, where likewise it very clearly concerns people's destinies, and where there is doubt regarding entitlement to various social benefits for the families of soldiers serving abroad.
This is clearly unacceptable and must be added.
We did, however, find a solution to this problem during the Commission's work, by accepting the verbal proposal by the Council and incorporating it into the text.
There is therefore no problem here, as I feel that the tenth proposed amendment mentioned has also borne a reassuring solution, since the Dutch government has undertaken to notify the relevant citizens in a clarifying circular, so there is now no need for this proposed amendment to be adopted by the Parliament.
There was, however, a need for cooperation, so I would like to thank the participants, my fellow Members who submitted amendments, the Council and the Commission.
Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, as Mr Åry has just said, mobility in the employment market is of the utmost importance.
In fact, the coordination regulation we are discussing today brings the adjustments to the laws of the Member States into line every year.
The Member States should actually have to test every law or every amendment to social security or tax law to check whether it is also Europe-proof.
Then there would not be too many problems. With a clear result, it would not be necessary to make adjustments later on.
Together with Mr Åry, I have tabled a number of amendments and I think really that Members should each look at their own Member States when the time comes for the annual adjustment to see whether everything proposed in the administrative consultation has in fact been brought into line with the real situation in Europe.
We have tabled two or three amendments.
The first two, Amendments 7 and 8, relate to health insurance for members of the families of military personnel resident in Belgium or Germany.
Dutch military personnel are not covered by the Health Care Insurance Act and so members of their families could not be insured either and therefore had to join a scheme that became more and more expensive.
The Dutch Government has written to the House asking the European Parliament to adopt the amendments, because that is the quickest solution.
The third amendment - Amendment 10 - concerns the Dutch law on child care.
A family that lived in the Netherlands and worked on the other side of the border was not entitled to a child care allowance.
That has also now been resolved by a change in the law.
That means that, through our perseverance, we have achieved quite a number of things for many people.
I am also grateful to my colleagues for not allowing themselves to be deterred by all the second reading arguments, but backing us up so that we have been able to achieve a great deal.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Åry, on his balanced report.
Secondly, I would like to stress how important it is for the European Union's various social security schemes to be coordinated and improved, and adapted where necessary.
It is quite clear that a number of what we consider to be essential amendments have been tabled to allow an informed debate as part of a process facilitating the approval of Mr Åry's report at first reading.
Social security questions in Europe clearly involve much more than the problems this report seeks to resolve and the associated regulatory practices.
The issue here, however, is to take account of the changes that have taken place in social security legislation in states such as Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands and Austria in order to ensure effective modernisation and adaptation.
Ladies and gentlemen, as we know, discussions are in progress in parallel on the introduction of the new regulatory system, particularly the negotiation of the respective implementing regulations.
We welcome the rapporteur's position in this case too, and we understand and share the view that only a limited number of absolutely essential amendments should be supported, as we said in committee.
These amendments seek to guarantee the necessary legal certainty so that the new regulation can best be brought into force.
I have meanwhile learned that Mr Åry has withdrawn the amendment concerned for the reasons explained.
In conclusion, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is most important is to help to ensure, in the field of social security too, proper implementation of the principle of worker mobility in the European Union, which was reaffirmed at the Lisbon summit and throughout 2006, the European Year of Mobility.
Without such mobility of labour and without proper coordination of the social security system, European workers will have limited opportunities to move in labour markets.
That is what we do not want, and we therefore support this report.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees citizens' freedom of movement and residence.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the freedom to choose an occupation and the right to engage in work.
However, we know that in practice there are still many obstacles preventing citizens from making full use of these rights in the Community.
Since 1971, the regulation we are discussing here has been considered the basis for guaranteeing social security for citizens moving from one Member State to another.
The regulation, as was mentioned, has been applied for more than 30 years and its provisions are amended quite frequently with respect to national legislation.
However, this regulation lays down the general principle that all national governments, social security institutions and even courts have to comply when applying national legislation.
Thus it is ensured that people who make use of their right to move to other countries within the Community will not suffer when different national legislation is applied.
Social security systems differ greatly from country to country and although the regulation is frequently amended it does not aim to unify systems but to generalise them.
Therefore, it is gratifying that in this way it is possible to protect the most vulnerable citizens of the Community, such as women, pensioners and the disabled as well as their family members.
I believe that this document helps to unify not only the EU Member States but also the citizens.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I earnestly urge you to vote for it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, freedom of movement, work and residence throughout the European Union are some of the most important benefits gained by our citizens.
For this reason their social insurance situation constitutes one of the most important issues, especially now, when there has been a movement of peoples such as has not been seen before in Europe, a migration much supported by all EU institutions.
I understand that, taking into consideration the implementation of the amended Regulation on social security schemes (at present the 1971 Regulation is still in force), we are trying only to change that which it is necessary to change and to adapt it to the changes that have been introduced in certain countries.
However I believe that we have not taken advantage of the opportunity that has presented itself and we have not amended the Regulation in accordance with the direction proposed in the new one.
Even though four years have already passed since the draft of the new Regulation was approved, it has still not come into force, and the old one is now over 37 years old.
It may be better to carry out thorough improvements to that which is already in existence than to wait for the new one, as time is passing and people are becoming impatient.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this.
I know that this often seems like a very technical piece of work, but these rapid annual updates are important because they offer transparency for citizens about their entitlements.
It also means that certain individuals can be covered more quickly.
I would also like to stress - as others have done - that this is a coordination, not a harmonisation.
Often that means that certain things which seem very reasonable are not necessarily acceptable within the coordination's very limited scope.
I think we also need to be clear that this coordination is not intended to undermine national systems and open them up to market forces - as I think we are beginning to see, particularly in the health sphere at the moment.
As others have mentioned, the implementing regulation for the update is in progress, but we already know that certain issues are not going to be covered.
I think we need to find a solution for these outside the scope of this coordination, and I would urge the Commission to look at this: for example, when tax revenue is increasingly being used to underpin social security systems and people working abroad find that they are paying tax to contribute to a social security system to which they no longer have access.
I would also urge - as Parliament did some time ago - that national practice come into line with the spirit of the regulation so that we do not find, as is happening in France at the moment, that certain individuals are now no longer able to access systems to which they have been paying because of changes in national regulations.
(CS) Commissioner, there is no doubt that it is necessary to approve the technical changes that are proposed in the annexes to this regulation.
By doing so we will harmonise the regulation with the new terminology in some countries.
However, I would again like to point out that European legislation has already for several years contradicted the rulings of the European Court of Justice on more precise specifications of rules regarding the claims of patients to reimbursement for the cost of healthcare provided abroad.
The contradiction is most marked with regard to hospital care and extends to all judgments: I would stress that it relates to all of them not just those cases where the Council has already achieved consensus.
It is true that patients have their rights upheld if they turn to the European Court of Justice, but this legal status is not acceptable.
I would like to remind you again of the wasted opportunity to amend by an appropriate method the claims of insured persons when preparing the new, simplified Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.
An opportunity to amend the principles set out by the European Court of Justice in the Services Directive, which came up two years later, was also wasted.
Now another year has begun and we are making only technical, not conceptual changes.
The new implementing regulation may solve this issue, but it does not look that it will solve all matters, because the Council did not agree on all issues.
In addition, the situation may be complicated because DG SANCO is now presenting a proposal for a new directive on patient mobility.
That is why the Council can expect controversial negotiations.
One topic that causes controversy is the dispute over subsidies.
We can also expect further delays as regards the establishment in law of the citizens' right to have hospital care reimbursed.
There are differences of opinion over the level of reimbursement and conditions of authorisation by an insurance company in one's country of origin.
In my view, this situation is very undesirable from the point of view of legal certainty, accessibility and citizens' understanding of the law.
Some countries are solving the problem by not informing their citizens about the claims granted by the judgments of the European Court of Justice.
I am convinced that it is necessary to solve this problem as quickly as possible by amend Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.
We should not rely on the controversial new directive on mobility from DG SANCO to secure, without further delay, compliance with the judgments.
(NL) Mr President, I thank Mr Åry for his excellent work.
In the short time I have to speak, I should like to underline one point.
Not everything that is wrong with the coordination of social security systems can be blamed on the legislation.
Many of the problems that occur are caused by the implementation of the rules, something for which the Member States themselves are responsible.
A number of those practical problems have come to light during the work on the Åry report.
That is precisely the case when it comes to coordination; not only must the legislation be correct, its practical application must also be consistent with it.
I therefore welcome the fact that from time to time the Council Presidents consult with Parliament, for instance on Annexes XI and VI to Regulation No 883, on which I myself am rapporteur.
It is certainly of the utmost importance that the work by the Council on this regulation and the annexes should be completed within this Parliament mandate.
I wish future Council Presidents every success with that.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to support Mr Åry's report.
It is very good that the EU is coordinating social security schemes, as, in the enlarged European Union, millions of persons work beyond the borders of their own countries.
The most numerous of these are my own countrymen, Poles, of whom over 2 million now work in various Member States.
From one side the fact that workers can move about freely is encouraging, but, from another, we are saddened by the ever-increasing number of instances of foreign workers being treated badly.
In some countries instances of criminal treatment of Polish workers have come to light, forcing them into slave labour.
Polish workers are becoming victims of racially motivated attacks.
This has happened in the United Kingdom, and, most recently, in Germany - the Polish media have described cases of brutal attacks on Poles in the German town of LÃ¶knitz in Mecklenburg.
These are serious events and we would expect all Member States to take more steps to protect foreign workers from exploitation and persecution
(HU) With the collapse of Europe's borders and changes in lifestyle, there are several million European citizens who were born in one country, have worked in one or more other countries and would like to spend their retirement in yet another country.
They pay their social security contributions in another place than where they will reap the benefits later.
Equality of competition conditions also requires that social security services are harmonised.
In the long term, it is therefore inevitable that a standardised European social security system will be created, including a pension system, health insurance and welfare benefits.
A working group of the Hungarian Socialist Party has recommended that this vision be incorporated into the long-term programme of the Party of European Socialists.
Harmonisation will naturally take time and legal disputes, but I am sure that, in the Europe of the future, the future belongs to standardised social security.
(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues.
For a united Europe, harmonisation of social legislation and coordination among the EU Member States in respect of social security schemes is key, since freedom of movement is one of our core values.
Anyone wishing to work in an EU country needs to be well aware of their rights and responsibilities; similarly, Member States need to protect the social rights of their citizens and ensure most favourable working and living conditions.
The social security status of citizens working in EU countries has a direct impact on Community welfare and on its economic performance.
In Bulgaria, as one of the new Member States, the issue of social security is particularly topical.
I believe that harmonisation of social security at the European level will ensure clearer and more simplified rules for European citizens.
I support Mr. Åry's report and urge you to support it by your vote.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, the point about this document is that it will be approved quickly, with a view to strengthening legal certainty for citizens.
We know that the regulations on modernisation and simplification are under approval, and therefore the present proposal would lose much of its point if we were to delay it.
On the need to incorporate the recent decisions of the Court of the European Communities into our legislation, I would like to say that this is a technical matter and must be discussed within the framework of discussion of the Regulation to be enforced.
The Commission has to a large extent already taken account of the Court's recent case-law in its proposal for trans-border healthcare, which is to be discussed soon in the Collegium of Commissioners.
A favourable vote by the European Parliament on this document will enable the Commission to concentrate its efforts in future on updating and simplifying the texts.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us before the new texts begin to be enforced.
This effort will in the long term facilitate exercise of the rights of citizens moving within the European Union, and so this fundamental aim of European unification will take on a more concrete form.
Allow me once more to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done.
rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
To close, it is perhaps worth summarising a question hiding in the background to this debate - several people have mentioned it, including Mrs Lambert and Mrs Bozkurt.
As a matter of fact, while I was preparing this report, we never discussed any questions of content, because we always agreed on it.
What we did discuss was where it is the competency of European legislators and where it is the competency of national legislators.
I would like to assure you that in this case we managed to strike this very fragile balance.
We therefore spoke to the Commission and the Council about all the proposed amendments.
Sometimes a debate emerged eventually, and sometimes frequently, but we found the solution.
Let this be a lucky or a good example that we can even work together from time to time if we need to.
The fact that we do need to is evidence for us, but I also feel we should not doubt that the citizens of Europe also need us to.
For my part, I have not tried in the report to recommend far-reaching changes to the text, simply because we are waiting for reports by Mrs Bozkurt and Mrs Lambert on Regulation 2003.
I therefore feel that the legislation remains in force for now - we have perhaps improved on it a little - but we will continue the debate when we produce the implementing regulation, and I feel that this is right and proper.
I would like to thank the Council, the Commission and my fellow Members again for their cooperation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The Regulation that we are amending (No 1408/71) plays a very important part in achieving one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, that is, freedom of movement.
Free movement of labour in the European Union must not be restricted either directly, by restricting the professional categories open to the nationals of other Member States, or indirectly, by undermining the social benefits to which non-national employees are entitled.
For this reason, the regulation proposed by the Commission with additional amendments made by Parliament will clearly specify when citizens may enjoy the special benefits granted by their State, under what circumstances these benefits may be exported, and whether other social schemes apply, so as to ensure fair treatment for non-nationals.
Moreover, if we are to extend the categories of employment contracts used in Europe, we need a common understanding of what sole trading or self-employment entails.
Not least, I believe that this report helps to safeguard the social rights of citizens working in another Member State.
Removing obstacles to the recognition of social rights will lead to more mobility within the Union and increased employment.
Consumer credit (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report by Kurt Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer credit and repealing Directive 87/102/EEC (09948/2/2007 - C6-0315/2007 - 2002/0222 (COD)).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, ladies and gentlemen, obtaining credit is a different matter from purchasing goods.
The legal complexity of the transaction is far greater, and established national financing practices and legal traditions play a far greater part.
Accordingly, public trust is often crucial in matters relating to consumer credit.
Against this backdrop, harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually.
As the weaker party to the contract, the consumer must undoubtedly receive legal protection, but at the same time the guiding principles in this field, as in the law of obligations in general, must be freedom of contract and the personal responsibility of grown-up people, not prescription and paternalism.
National legislators must have enough discretion to guarantee consumer protection flexibly in their own countries and to deal quickly with awkward new developments in the sphere of consumer protection.
A body of legal provisions alone does not ensure that consumers are actually protected.
Impact assessments would have been essential, given that consumer credit affects hundreds of millions of people.
Legislation should be based on typical case scenarios and not on exceptions.
In this respect, I must first of all thank the European Parliament as a whole for rejecting the Commission's totally unacceptable initial proposal and for amending it substantially and decisively at first reading.
Secondly, I welcome wholeheartedly the new approach adopted by the Commission in its amended proposal dating from 2005, whereby only specific fundamental elements would ultimately be harmonised.
I must, however, criticise the Council's common position.
Instead of focusing on a sound practicable European solution, the representatives of the Member States have been introducing their own specific rules, defending them and compiling a litany of them in the compromise.
The result is a set of provisions that create far too much red tape.
That is no good to consumers.
Swamping consumers with information does not help them.
It generates considerable additional costs, which have a disproportionately strong impact on small amounts of credit.
Accordingly, my aim from the outset was to try to streamline the rules and give national legislators more leeway.
In this context I would like to thank my honourable colleagues, because all the votes in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection went in that same direction, and all the decisions of this House seem set to do likewise.
Let me just cite two key examples, namely the substantial improvements and slimmed-down provisions regarding overdraft facilities and the emerging arrangement on Article 16 in respect of compensation for early repayment.
In spite of these improvements, however, I believe that the emerging majority is only prepared to go halfway, no doubt partly influenced by the absence of consent in the Council and by the desire to bring the legislative project to a conclusion.
I nevertheless consider it imperative that additional improvements be made if the proposal is to be judged favourably in its entirety.
I wish to mention two other points that are important to me and to seek your approval once more.
Firstly, the threshold at which the directive starts to apply should be raised to EUR 500.
I am well aware that the value of that amount varies throughout Europe.
The point, however, is not that the directive should only apply once the EUR 500 threshold has been crossed but that national legislators should retain the option of applying their own provisions from the first euro rather than being bound to restrict their action to credit of 500 euros or more.
Secondly, consumers should have the option of waiving the prescribed explanations regarding pre-contractual information, one reason being that these explanations could hamper the internal market.
I do believe it ought to be enough to provide the consumer with a copy of the terms of the contract in advance in order to satisfy the pre-contractual information requirement - which is, incidentally, what the Commission envisaged in its own proposal.
That would limit the stacks of paperwork.
Unless these changes are made, I fear that the desirable aims underlying this directive, namely to open up the single market to consumers in Europe and give them a wider range of products and options, will not be achieved.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the vote in this House on Wednesday on the Consumer Credit Directive is a very important moment for Europe's 500 million consumers.
It will directly affect many people's lives, and it is about two critically important issues.
The first is about consumers being able to make better-informed choices when they take out credit loans: to pay for a family wedding, a washing machine or a new car - the things of life.
Second, it is about consumers getting more choice and a more competitive market.
It is also a very important vote for businesses, creating a single, simple framework of rules so banks and other creditors can do business more easily across borders.
We need to seize this opportunity to move forward.
It is clear that the status quo is not working.
The figures speak for themselves.
In Europe the average consumer credit interest rate varies from around 6% in Finland, the cheapest Member State, to over 12% in Portugal.
In Italy, credit rates are about 9.4%, in Ireland about 6.8%.
Europe's consumer credit market is fragmented, broken down into 27 'mini markets'.
And, in a European credit market worth EUR 800 billion, direct cross-border financial services make up only a tiny fraction - 1% - of all distance credit transactions.
Clearly, the internal market is not functioning.
Clearly, competition at EU level is not functioning.
The result is that consumers are being denied choice and more competitive offers, and competitive businesses are being denied opportunities to access new markets.
The Consumer Credit Directive is necessary to start to break open the potential of the internal market and boost competition and choice.
There are two main aims of the Consumer Credit Directive: to provide standards - comparable information - to consumers to make informed choices, and to give businesses a single set of standards to sell competitive credit offers across borders.
The Consumer Credit Directive focuses on transparency and consumer rights.
I will highlight just a few of the important common elements it puts in place.
Concerning advertising for credit loans: if there is a figure in an advertisement on credit, it will be mandatory to provide the same standard list of essential information all over the European Union.
Most importantly, for the first time, the annual percentage rate of charges will be calculated in the same way across the European Union.
This is a very significant step forward, so that consumers can see the real cost of credit using one single figure.
Concerning pre-contractual information: information given to consumers for credit offers will be presented in the same standard credit information form across the EU, and it will give all the key facts and figures - from interest rates to information on charges and linked insurances.
This will allow consumers to make a direct comparison between different offers presented in a standard, comparable way.
The Directive also sets out two essential rights for consumers.
Once they have concluded the credit contract, consumers will be able to withdraw from the credit without having to give any reason and without any charge.
This right, a new feature in almost half of the Member States, will apply to all consumer credits in the European Union.
In addition, the Consumer Credit Directive confirms the consumer's right to switch, and this must be a very stable policy line - not only in this area.
The right to switch with the right to repay early at any time: this is a critically important issue for the Commission, to ensure fair compensation to banks and at the same time to safeguard the consumer's right to make a free choice and to proceed to a more competitive offer on the market.
This is essential if competition is to thrive.
I fully recognise that harmonising legislation in this very sensitive area is not an easy task, but I am convinced that markets are made by people and should be made to work for people, and I believe that we in Europe are in the business of putting people at the centre of the market, giving people the power to chose, giving businesses the power to compete, and getting the European market to work for consumers.
I want to emphasise that, in the modern world, it is not about pitching consumers against business, but building healthy markets where consumers can choose and businesses can compete.
I believe that the amendments put forward by the PSE and the ALDE Groups - with which the Council has agreed - constitute a fair and reasonable compromise.
In my opinion, this is the best option in the interests of both consumers and financial services providers.
I believe that the vote for this compromise package is a vote in favour of competitive markets, clear information and more informed consumer choice.
It is a modest beginning in the consumer dimension of financial services, where much needs to be done.
So I look to the Members of this House: you are the ones to speak directly, on behalf of European citizens; you have fought, for so many years, for the things that really matter to people in their daily lives.
The task is to vote to support an agreement today on credit rules that will provide real added value to Europe's citizens in that space where they lead their lives and to send a clear signal of Europe's willingness to roll up our sleeves and work in an area that greatly concerns our citizens and businesses, large and small, today.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by acknowledging the huge amount of work done by the rapporteur for our group, Mr Lechner, and also to pay tribute to both the Commission and the Council for the work we have done together on what has been a difficult and sometimes controversial proposal, which, as the Commissioner has said, has gone on over a number of years.
At its core - and here I agree completely with the Commissioner - is an extremely important proposal for Europe's consumers in the internal market.
Consumer credit is a really important mechanism for bringing consumers into the market place.
We want a thriving and innovative market; we want companies actively offering a wide range of products and services tailored to the need of consumers to buy specific articles, products or services.
But, above all, we want a well-regulated market in which consumers feel confident in accessing that market and knowing that they will have the information but also the safeguards of being able to see clear contract terms.
It is quite clear in financial services that good regulation encourages market activity, and that is what we have been seeking throughout this process.
However, the problem we have had with this Directive is the fact that the consumer credit market across the European Union is at very different stages of development: many countries, like my own, already have well-developed regulation.
The original idea of a maximum harmonisation would have meant that consumers in those countries would have been disadvantaged, and it has been trying to get that balance right that has occupied us.
I just want to correct one impression that I think Ms Kuneva gave, perhaps unintentionally: the package of compromise amendments on the table is supported with one exception only by this group.
We have tabled the same amendments; it is a consensual position across Parliament.
I think there is one aspect that we are still arguing about, but I am sure we will get there and then we will have a good and important package.
However, the important thing is that we keep monitoring the evolution of this market, ensure that it develops in a responsible way and deal with some of the problems that might arise from the evolution and development of that market.
I am confident that this House will rise to its responsibilities and we will come up with a good package tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and previously the Committee on Legal Affairs, have always recognised the potential benefits, to both businesses and consumers, of developing an internal market and consumer credit.
I was present during the gestation of this legislation and hope to be there tomorrow for the final delivery, as it were, of the new consumer credit baby!
The last five years of discussion and debate have demonstrated fundamental differences between the Commission and Parliament, and more specifically between the Member States, on the best way to achieve this, and I firmly believe there are lessons to be learned from that.
All proposals - even a modified Commission proposal - have to undergo a rigorous impact assessment to enable all parties and stakeholders to evaluate the merits of the proposals and to engender consumer confidence and business confidence.
It is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the Council was prepared to do this at the time.
However, our job today is to address the new text, which is a vast improvement on the original proposal.
It focuses on the essential elements and components for starting to open the market and for protecting the consumer.
Its benefits include enabling consumers to compare offers of credit, obliging lenders to assess the credit-worthiness of the consumer - which will be important in the fight against debt across the EU - and obliging lenders to provide explanations and, as a result of our amendments, all creditors will now be responsible for providing comprehensive and standard information in a simplified format.
I welcome the 14-day withdrawal right and the right to early repayment, which are good elements for engendering consumer confidence and encouraging them to look beyond their home market for credit offers.
This is not just about opening the market, and the fact that we now have free movement of labour and people across 27 EU Member States gives this law new significance.
For example, a Polish plumber working in France or Germany and borrowing from a credit institution there can now obviously compare the different offers on APR in the knowledge that he has the standard information enabling him to take the right decision.
Finally, I welcome the fact that the Commission, by exempting credit unions from this law, is not strangling small Community providers with red tape.
I also welcome the Member State flexibility there is now.
This has, for example, enabled a high level of protection to be maintained for consumers in the UK, which will now retain the right to joint and several liability for credit cards.
There is therefore enough flexibility in this proposal to make it work, and I would urge Members to lend it their support.
As chair of the Committee, I think that our work does not finish here ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is normally the time of year we all wish one another a 'Happy New Year'.
However, in the UK, and globally, the news this new year has been dominated by worries over the economy, and particularly over consumer credit.
It is not just a question of normal post-Christmas depression; we all know that it goes much deeper than that.
Credit is going to be a difficult issue for the foreseeable future, for both lenders and borrowers alike.
As legislators confronted with that global backdrop, we need to do something.
We need to stimulate the EU's market in financial services, while on the other hand ensuring that our consumers make sensible and informed choices, and that all the information and the comparators are available to them in order to do so.
Many of us in this House, and particularly in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs, have spent the last couple of years sitting on an enquiry by Parliament into the demise of the British insurer, Equitable Life.
We know what the consequences are for consumers, in the context of financial services, if we get the cross-border regulatory regime wrong.
In this instance we need such a regime and we need to get it right, particularly in view of the global circumstances we are facing.
This directive can help.
It can help Europe's market in financial services at a difficult time, and it can empower and assist our consumers in obtaining credit and doing so competitively.
My group has signed up to and put forward, with the PSE, a package that we hope will be agreed.
It seems to us that, at the end of the day, we are faced with an argument that is almost about one word, in one article, after seven years of negotiating and drafting.
It would be a pretty poor affair for this House and for Europe's institutions if we cannot overcome that and deliver this directive, which will, hopefully, bring to the European market all the benefits we have heard outlined.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - I support the need to update EU legislation in this area.
The last time we had a directive on this was in 1987, and certainly the consumer credit market has changed dramatically since then.
This EU Directive on Consumer Credit Loans seeks to introduce a greater level of competition into the EUR 800 billion consumer credit market.
It will bring legal certainty to consumers, which is absolutely vital if people are to shop around and look for the best product which suits their needs.
It will also help business to compete.
When you look at the differences in consumer credit rates around Europe - from 6% in some countries up to 12% in others - it surely is time that the consumer got a better choice.
These new rules will make the market more transparent for consumers and business competitors alike.
The main effect of this Directive will be to provide comparable and standard information to consumers across the EU who take out loans.
For credit offers, the information given to consumers, whether it is interest rates, numbers and frequency of payments, must be set out in a new EU-wide European credit information form.
So I very much welcome this.
I think that it is vital for consumers that they have confidence and that there is legal certainty in this area, but I believe that this will bring greater competition in this area and will, at the end of the day - as has already been pointed out - give more choice to consumers, and that the consumers will benefit greatly from this Directive.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must regrettably adopt a directive tomorrow which does not meet our own criterion of better regulation.
There has been no impact assessment, even though this is an entirely new proposal, in spite of the intervening enlargement of the EU with the accession of 12 new Member States, in spite of major differences between Member States in financing practices and regulatory systems and in spite of social disparities within Member States.
Instead of complete harmonisation, there was an urgent need to give the Member States greater freedom of action.
The Member States can respond quite differently and far more quickly today to the various new models that appear on the market on a daily basis.
The Member States are also better equipped to respond to a financial crisis.
They can regulate matters in a shorter time frame than it takes the European Union to act.
This is why it would have been wise to confine ourselves here to minimal harmonisation instead of trying to harmonise as much as possible.
That is the criticism we have to make of this consumers' directive.
Moreover, we also deplore the fact that numerous opt-out clauses have had to be adopted in order to get all the Member States on board.
This, unfortunately, has done nothing at all for the rigour of the provisions.
There is also, however, one exemption for which we would argue, and it relates to renovation loans.
In view of the formidable challenges posed by climate change, there is an urgent need to exempt from this proposal renovation loans secured by mortgage, which have nothing to do with consumer credit but should be treated as mortgage loans.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, when rules are laid down as to how an agreement between two parties is to be drafted, account must of course be taken of whether the parties have equal status or whether one party has an advantage over the other from the outset.
If one party has an advantage, this must be taken into account in the way the agreement is drafted and a formula must be devised which strengthens the weaker party.
When it is a case of consumer credit, which is what we are discussing now, it is the person needing credit who is in the less favourable position.
Unfortunately neither the rapporteur nor the compromise proposal take sufficient account of this responsibility, of consumers' rights and consumer protection.
This is particularly serious since it is invariably those with the least financial resources who seek purchase credit.
I also want to say that, despite the fact that we have a decision requiring gender mainstreaming in all our work here in Parliament, no gender analysis of this directive has been carried out, also despite the fact that we know that many women on the lowest wages are precisely those who often get caught in the debt trap.
I maintain that there must be a ceiling on the level of compensation to be paid in the event of the early repayment of loans.
I also maintain that a three-day cooling-off period is far too short.
Besides, I want minimum harmonisation, not maximum harmonisation.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I wonder if I might perhaps offer a few words of wisdom here.
I have spent most of my life in merchant banking, albeit not retail banking, and I have to say I do not regard it as the business of politicians to come between a consumer, or a lender, and a borrower.
I would not dream of trying to regulate on this subject, with all my experience.
I look down the list of people who actually serve on this committee and in this Parliament and I do not see a great deal of experience there, so it is a question of the blind leading the blind.
I think that this place, which has not managed to audit its own books for nearly 11 years, commenting on this is slightly absurd.
The fact that you can actually have rules for Bucharest, London and Paris and consumers in those places is absolutely ludicrous.
Perhaps I could warn people like the UK Government that bailing out banks to the tune of 50% of their entire reserves is fundamentally wrong.
So, if I may, let me give one tip to the consumer: 'never a lender or a borrower be', and to governments, let me say: 'a fool and his money are soon parted'!
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur and, of course, the Commissioner too, who has played a highly constructive role in this complex matter.
Mrs Wallis referred to the fact that this dossier has been what I like to call haunting the corridors of the European Parliament and the other European institutions for more than seven years, and in my opinion these have not been seven years of transparent legislating or seven years of better regulation but a muddle that very few Members of this House have yet managed to untangle.
In this respect I do not believe we have done any great favours to the European consumers and citizens who have had to watch this backstage wrangling among the Member States, but if this final outcome provides greater transparency for consumers who wish to buy a car, for example, enabling them to make an informed choice between a hire-purchase agreement and a personal loan, I believe it will be useful.

Reference was made here to the fact that the European credit market is worth EUR 800 billion and that the differential between the highest and the lowest interest rates is about 6%.
There is, of course, a lot of mileage in this, and it is to be hoped that consumers will be able to benefit from the available scope too, but I have good reason to be sceptical.
The fact is that a consumer who wants to buy a digital camera for EUR 220 and then has to complete a ten-page credit form in writing will scarcely be able to comprehend all the risks involved in a credit transaction for EUR 220.
The result, in my view, is that much of what is meant well in this package will not ultimately help the average vulnerable consumer but will create such difficulties for consumers that they will even prefer not to buy anything on credit terms to avoid the daunting task of completing the extensive set of forms.
That remains my view, and I hope that the variations in interest rates will become more transparent for consumers and that this will be of benefit, although I still believe that the preceding process has been unacceptable.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I believe we must see this through so that consumers and banks know what will and will not apply to them in future.
I believe the compromise which we developed last week and which the Liberals have now endorsed too is a thoroughly reasonable one and that we have come up with a common solution which is tenable and consumer-friendly.
That is the main thing.
If I may take issue with Mr Schwab, first of all the form is not ten pages long, and secondly I consider it a very good thing that we have a common form in which the consumer must be told clearly and transparently the total amount of the credit, the term of the agreement, the rules governing the right of withdrawal and the applicable annual percentage rate, which might then be calculated on the same common basis in all Member States.
That is transparency, and this transparency is what we need and what is at stake in tomorrow's vote on the proposal contained in amendment 46.
I hope we can ensure that transparency really does win the day.
Forgive my saying so, but while the rapporteur has unquestionably worked hard, my group cannot condone this Parliament of ours being railroaded into a situation in which the Council suddenly appears to be consumer-friendlier than the European Parliament.
My group regards this purely and simply as an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why we must ensure that a fair balance is struck between the natural right of the banks to do business - a normal feature of any market economy - and the need to protect consumers by ensuring that they are given the information they need to choose the right form of credit and reject unfavourable options.
That is the way to go, and that is what we should adopt tomorrow.
(NL) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Lechner for his drafting and his constructive cooperation.
I should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Council, because it was a lengthy trialogue.
Unfortunately we were not able to reach a compromise, but we were only a hairsbreadth away from one, so I am pleased that on Wednesday morning we shall be voting on that same compromise and I am assuming we shall achieve it.
Why?
We have in fact been talking about it for seven years already.
If we want to have any political credibility with the market and our citizens, with consumers but also with the sector and the industry. it is important for us to take a decision at last.
A compromise is always give and take and of course there are aspects that could be improved, but that applies to all parties.
The fact is that a compromise is mixing water with wine and then you get a result and you have to be satisfied with it.
I believe that the present plan is in the interests of both consumers and the financial sector.
That is what we have to work towards, that is in the interests of Europe and the internal market.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which no doubt required considerable patience, but has doubtless brought him considerable satisfaction.
This report can certainly be counted as being one of the most controversial and most difficult compromises.
Its objective is to bring more closely together different regulations in various EU countries, which really are very different, and legislation in this area is largely under the control of Member States.
Harmonisation in this sector is quite simply impossible.
We can only try to introduce a partial convergence of requirements, and even this, as we have seen over the past months, has caused considerable problems.
I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur, that in an area as difficult as this Member States should be given as free a hand as possible.
This seems to be the only sensible solution to enable such a difficult and weighty report to be accepted by all interested parties.
It would appear that, in its present form, the text has been simplified.
What can be seen in all the work over this report is the lack of an analysis of impacts, and such an analysis would certainly have improved its quality.
Overall, this draft seems to me to be satisfactory.
Obviously this version is far from being ideal, but it has been adapted to the current situation in Member States.
This proposal will abolish financial and administrative burdens on consumers and will, in my opinion, introduce important provisions to protect the consumer, making it easier to obtain credit.
One of the most useful proposals is the introduction of comparisons.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally cannot share the enthusiasm for this text.
Important steps have been taken, but this text does not serve the purpose, which is to create a harmonised framework.
That harmonised framework has not been achieved on a number of points that we consider essential.
Let me explain.
There are two points that, as far as our delegation is concerned, are still difficult or very difficult.
The pre-contractual information package is reinforced and harmonised.
That is good.
But it is undermined by the various formulae that are allowed for the annual percentage rate of charge for opening credit.
I just need an explanation of how consumers are going to be able to compare those various formulae objectively.
Secondly, in the case of my country, Belgium, the position of consumers is likely to be weakened, in that the database has to be consulted but there are no related sanctions for the banks.
That could plunge people even further into debt.
I also think it is a missed opportunity for the banks themselves.
It is still a wasted regulation.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission's well-intentioned attempt to establish a functioning internal market with enhanced consumer rights in the realm of consumer credit.
The result of its efforts, however, must honour the pledge made to consumers by offering them a wider choice, better terms and conditions in the wake of increasing competition and less red tape.
Judged by that standard, the final draft directive on consumer credit is unsatisfactory in many respects.
Firstly, the prescribed standard information, which runs to some eight pages, is too extensive.
I doubt whether customers will actually use it to inform themselves of the detailed terms and conditions.
In practice, this is a tangible increase in red tape, for which consumers will have to pay at the end of the day.
Secondly, the provisions on early credit repayment squander the opportunity to let consumers share in any windfall that might accrue to the creditor because of a favourable change in interest rates after the lending date.
Thirdly, the compromise that has been reached will effectively put an end to overdraft facilities, which are standard practice in Germany and widely used elsewhere.
The public will deeply regret this and will have one more reason to gripe about the Brussels Moloch.
What counts is quality, not quantity.
(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Kurt Lechner, for the exacting work he did when drawing up this report.
He managed to simplify the Council's overcomplicated and bureaucratic proposal through new amendments.
I would like to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Kuneva at this discussion, which is important to European consumers, to draw attention once again to the important role of consumer organisations, which must be able to play their rightful role in every Member State and receive adequate support from the Commission.
To improve the quality of consumer protection, the individual consumer bodies require additional finance to be able to educate consumers and provide independent advice on consumer credit, notably to the most vulnerable consumer groups.
Commissioner, although you have achieved much encouraging progress for consumer groups and although your arrival gave the green light to consumer protection, I would ask for your help again in 2008.
- (LT) I welcome the appearance of this directive; it is a step in the right direction.
However, I would like to draw your attention - in particular the Commissioner's attention - to Article 16.
In my country, consumers do not receive any compensation if they repay credit early.
Now, when this article comes into force, consumers will actually pay more.
I find it hard to believe that this denotes consumer protection.
Surely, it is said that there are plenty of legal protectors in the article intended to ensure that consumers do not have to pay for this, but when we talk about legal protectors we mean legal games and not the real economy.
In the real economy, if it is possible to tax a consumer, he or she will always be taxed.
Therefore, I ask you to take care to structure Article 16 better in view of the fact that in many countries this tax is not applied at all.
Mr President, I think we have managed to get quite a good result in the recent negotiations.
What we have not managed to improve is simplicity.
I think that now there is far too much information for an ordinary consumer in Europe.
Whenever the Council members and Member States request more derogations from the standard information, it makes this whole directive more complex.
I think that standard information really should be standard.
It should be an EU level playing field.
Every time that we in Parliament or Member States in the Council say that we should have different adaptive rules by the Member States we make this issue more complex.
I totally agree with the Commission's objective.
Probably the compromise negotiations are headed in the right direction, but something should be done about the simplicity issue before this directive gets into the books and reaches consumers.
(FR) Mr President, colleagues, Commissioner, I should like to make just a few observations.
I think it is good for our Parliament's image to show European consumers that we have the protection of their interests in hand.
Mr Lechner's report certainly reflects a tremendous amount of work, on which I congratulate him, but I think that the task now, in the final stage of the process, is to strike a compromise that will enable us to demonstrate the importance that we as parliamentarians ascribe to the consumer.
It would be rather hard to swallow if the Council were portrayed at the end of the day as the consumer's best defender.
We need to find a compromise over the few words that divide us, in order to avoid a conciliation procedure which, I believe, would be in no-one's interest.
We also need to avoid taking retrograde steps, and the fact is that consumers in France, like those in Lithuania, are not financially penalised for early repayment.
We cannot present consumers with a situation less advantageous than that which they currently enjoy under national legislation.
If there are no other speakers, let me remind Members that they may use the 'catch the eye' procedure to ask for the floor again if they believe they did not complete their first statement.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, and to all Honourable Members for raising a lot of important and wise remarks.
Let me just comment on a few of them.
We believe that the threshold is set up very carefully.
Our common aim is not to deprive vulnerable consumers of protection by directive.
That is why we set up a threshold which equally embedded the interests of the new countries and which does not exclude most average credits in the EU-12.
It is also, we believe, a big advantage to have a standard info-sheet, which many of you have pointed out as one of the main positive steps in the directive.
This will be one of the biggest advantages and we will not deprive the consumers if we substitute it for the contract copy, because consumers cannot easily compare copies of the contract.
They often have difficulties understanding the contract copies - and this is borne out by Eurobarometer research.
As to full harmonisation - actually I would like to stress that this is 'targeted' full harmonisation.
The reason why it is better than minimum harmonisation, as some of you proposed to discuss even today, is that we think that it is necessary to lower market-entry barriers for financial services providers, and this is one of the main reasons why this proposal for a directive is going ahead.
Through this, we need to increase consumer confidence.
That is why targeted full harmonisation is the best way to do it.
The Commission would like to reassure Mr Harbour especially that it will monitor the market.
My services have launched a study to collect indicators and data on the present market.
A few years later we will use the same indicators and collect the same data.
This will allow us to decide on the follow-up.
To conclude, I can only repeat that in my view, going through the conciliation procedure would not help us reach a better compromise than the one you have on the table today.
Consequently, I very much hope that Parliament will be able to adopt this text at second reading tomorrow.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has emerged clearly in the debate that we have a common aim.
In particular, I can unreservedly endorse what the Commissioner said in her introductory remarks.
The only question is whether the draft that is now on the table can actually achieve our common objectives.
I believe there are a number of defensible opinions on this issue.
The uniform annual percentage rate of charges certainly represents unmitigated progress, as does the common uniform right of withdrawal.
Let me re-emphasise, however, that consumer protection is best served if we consider the whole picture, as the Commissioner rightly indicated, rather than tacking together all the provisions that apply anywhere in Europe.
More statutory provisions do not mean greater protection of consumers.
On the subject of interest-rate differentials in Europe, I must point out that I should have welcomed the presentation of an analysis of the extent to which these differentials might be due to divergent legal provisions and complexities in particular countries and whether it might be the case that interest rates are lower where legal rules are simpler.
I do not know the answer, but the question ought to have been examined.
Competition and general consumer education also serve to enhance consumer protection, but excessively convoluted rules do not.
Let me say a brief word on the trialogue.
I certainly held the view that we should thrash out our differences here in Parliament.
Far be it from me to thwart an agreement.
Nevertheless, since we always argue for transparency, particularly in the Council but in other forums too, I do not think it right that an informal body should hold these discussions behind closed doors.
Instead, each institution should initially express its opinion, motions should be tabled, and a solution should then be found on that basis.
Let me repeat once again that the draft has been considerably improved in the course of more than six years of deliberations - I want to make that abundantly clear - and Parliament has played a crucial part in the improvement process.
I also see this to some extent as an endorsement of my own work.
In my opinion, however, the draft is simply not good enough.
Be that as it may, it will enter into force.
I have no hesitation in thanking my fellow Members, the Commission and indeed the Council - which, in point of fact, has always provided very straight answers and detailed information - for their contribution to the performance of what has generally been a thoroughly gratifying and pleasant task.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008, at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Parliament's vote on this very important dossier means are now one step closer to fully implementing the four freedoms.
This directive will bring more rights and transparency to consumers when taking a consumer credit.
Comparing credit conditions across borders and choosing the best offer will now become much easier than before.
After five years of preparations, the directive will apply to all unsecured loans between EUR 200 and EUR 75 000.
I want to point out that it is important to set the lower threshold at EUR 200, since loans do not often exceed EUR 500, especially in the new Member States.
The consumer will benefit not least from all contractual information, a common method for the calculation of the annual percentage rate and a 14 day withdrawal period.
Balanced laws like this help us to achieve the approval of the citizens for the European Union.
in writing. - An EU directive on consumer credit has been talked about for some time, so today's debate on the directive is to be welcomed.
There is great hope that the directive will lead to consumers looking beyond their own national boundaries for loans - allowing them to shop around for the cheapest loan available.
It should, when implemented and taken up by EU citizens, lead to people availing of cheaper credit.
But this is the key to its success: firstly knowledge among EU citizens of the possibility of availing of loans across borders, and secondly a willingness of citizens to take up this option.
At present, it is clear that there is a reluctance among citizens to shop around within their own Member State for best value in loans, just as there is still some resistance among consumers to change banking institutions, though that may be changing slowly.
The success or otherwise of this directive depends on its effective implementation by Member States.
Only time will tell if it lives up to our expectations and provides greater choice to consumers, greater availability of consumer loans and most importantly lower costs on such loans.
in writing. - Consumer credits are an essential pillar of the internal market.
First of all, I think this directive is a first step and a good example of how the EU delivers concrete results, even in such a controversial issue.
Second, in my opinion in the longer term further harmonisation is needed once we have gathered experience on the working of this directive so as to make it easier for consumers to shop across borders and to give full legal certainty to businesses on their obligations when offering these credits in other Member States.
Third, I want to thank all the people involved for their perseverance in this process, which has lasted for years.

- Before the vote:
(EL) Mr President, my dear colleagues, as we know, the European Commission's original proposal included in a single Regulation the amended proposal for Regulation No 11 abolishing discrimination in prices and terms of transport, and the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.
The Commission's proposal was based on Articles 75, 152 and 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the stipulated procedure for adopting the Resolution was co-decision.
The colegislators - Council and Parliament - decided to split the original proposal into two separate Regulations: one for the amendment of Regulation No 11 on transport, based on Article 75 (3), which does not provide for any intervention by the European Parliament in the legislative procedure, and on which the Committee on Transport gave its opinion; and another Regulation concerning amendment of the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on Articles 95 and 152 (4b), on which the Committee on the Environment is to give its opinion shortly.
Today we are called upon to decide whether Article 75 (3) provides an adequate legal basis for amending the Regulation on transport.
The amendment to Article 852/2004, as we have said, will be discussed later.
The proposed Regulation which is submitted today provides for the deletion of Article 5, which ceased to be valid in 1961, and an amendment to Article 6, aimed at reducing the carriers' administrative obligations by abolishing their obligation to retain copies showing full price information, since this information is included anyway on the consignment notes and in the carriers' accounting systems.
This amendment makes it possible to check transport rates and conditions, and identify any discrimination.
So this is an amendment that corresponds exactly to what is provided for in Article 75 (3), second sentence, of the Treaty of the European Communities, and since the amendment to Article 6 is necessary to enable European authorities to check observance of the principle of non-discrimination in the field of transport under Article 75 (3) of the Treaty, the Committee on Legal Affairs made the point that Article 75 (3) is the only legal basis than can be used when amending Regulation No 11.

Voting time
The next item is the vote.
(For the results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on a point of order, under Rule 160 of the Rules of Procedure, our group has requested that we have roll-call votes today on everything, and I know that has excited some interest in the Chamber.
Just by way of explanation, not just this group but many MEPs from all groups are deeply concerned about the method of voting that takes place in here.
In fact, you yourself in the chair just a few months ago said we have made mistakes here, which, in a vote of this size, are statistically normal.
We would argue that when we are voting on legislation there should not be any possibility of mistakes being made.
Perhaps I would ask Members, when they are going through this lengthy roll-call procedure, to consider just how important voting is, and perhaps in the light of that we will get MEPs next month, when we vote on the EU Lisbon Treaty, to vote for an amendment to allow those 10 countries that promised their own people a referendum, the opportunity to do so.
(DE) Mr President, I have only one request.
Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure states that 'Normally Parliament shall vote by a show of hands'.
For this reason it would be right to examine whether the IND/DEM Group's motion to have all votes taken by roll call is consistent with the Rules of Procedure.
I believe it is not.
May I ask that this be done by tomorrow.
I believe we shall be voting today as stipulated in the voting list, but I would ask that the question of legal admissibility be reviewed by tomorrow.
(IT) Mr President, two things: I think the television camera set up here should be moved to allow Mr Donnici - and all of us - to see the presidency and other colleagues.
Let me also take this opportunity to welcome the decision by the European Parliament's Bureau to dedicate Parliament's press room to Anna Politkovskaya.
The House Rules of Procedure state that voting is normally to be by show of hands unless a roll-call vote is specifically requested.
When voting by show of hands it may so happen, not often but from time to time, and only from time to time, that either because MEPs do not raise their hands or because there is some confusion, the presidency makes a mistake when assessing the outcome of a vote.
Should that happen then, again frequently, an MEP will request verification and as a result the President holds a roll-call vote to that end and the situation is resolved.
This is all, therefore, provided for, and our votes proceed perfectly correctly 99.9% of the time.
In any event, the President of the Parliament received a letter from Mr Booth MEP noting this issue and requesting action to be taken on it.
This matter will be discussed at the Conference of Presidents and, of course by the working group looking at reform of the House's working methods.
This is in train.
Please be assured therefore, Mr Farage, that we are going to pay a great deal of attention to this matter and are seeking to ensure that things run more smoothly every day.
Mr Swoboda, we are going to vote today by roll call, which is also in accordance with the Rules of Procedure as a roll-call vote has been requested by a political group.
Today.
And from today we will take decisions.
Mr President, on that very point, during the last parliamentary term, a group chaired by Mr Corbett, from the PSE Group, submitted proposals to the House to the effect that, if more than 100 amendments were tabled at the plenary stage, then the report in question should be sent back to committee.
There have now been a number of occasions when that has not taken place.
I wonder if, when recommending to the Conference of Presidents that it look into these matters, you could also recommend it consider the very good recommendations which Mr Corbett brought forward during the last parliamentary term.
Mr President, pursuant to Rule 145, I would just like to make a personal statement.
Yes, I have written to the President of Parliament complaining about the voting, as you know.
I have updated him several times since then, because my request for full electronic voting was turned down by the committee.
Its response was 'no follow-up'.
I have, in fact, written several times.
The worst case that I have reported was overturned from 'rejected' to 'approved' by 567 votes to 17, with 18 abstentions.
That is why I have called this system ludicrous in the past.
It really must be dealt with.
Formal sitting - Grand Mufti of Syria
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a special honour and pleasure for me today, in this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament to His Eminence Sheikh Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria.
(Applause)
As I emphasised last week in Ljubljana at the opening ceremony for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Parliament attaches great importance to this year of dialogue between cultures.
I am firmly convinced, as are many others, that it is both possible and essential for people from different cultures and religions to live together in peace, both within the European Union and in the world at large.
Particular importance attaches in this context to our relations with the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East.
The fact is that the fruits of this dialogue will have a lasting effect on our common future.
Together we must build an intellectual and cultural bridge across the Mediterranean, embedded in mutual enrichment and shared values.
We build this bridge when we engage in continuous, honest and open dialogue in which we listen to each other, exchange our opinions frankly and develop mutual understanding.
Tolerance is at the heart of intercultural dialogue.
Tolerance does not mean indifference.
Tolerance means putting forward our own points of view and hearing and respecting other people's convictions.
Where we find it impossible to accept another person's point of view, it is still necessary to treat such views with respect, to exchange ideas and opinions peacefully and, wherever possible, to pave the way for joint action and thereby defuse tension.
We must stress the things we have in common, including the substance of universal democratic values. Foremost among these are human dignity and the defence of inalienable human rights.
In the course of 2008 and thereafter, the European Parliament will take several opportunities to engage in such talks.
Today's visit by the Grand Mufti of Syria represents the first of these opportunities.
Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, formerly Mufti of Aleppo, is regarded as an outstanding champion of inter-faith dialogue in a country where the religious communities in all their diversity still live and work together in peace.
This is clearly symbolised by the fact that the Grand Mufti is accompanied on today's visit by high-ranking religious leaders.
That was his express wish, and may I make special mention of Bishop Antoine Audo, head of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Syria, and bid him a warm welcome.
Your Eminence, it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address the European Parliament.
(Applause)
Grand Mufti of Syria. -
(The speaker spoke in Arabic.
Below is a transcription of the English interpretation.)
Greetings to you all in the name of our Creator, who created mankind from the same soil and through whose soul we have been able to become alive.
The source of energy that comes to us is from the one God, the Creator; we are his creation and, hence, I greet you as brothers on this planet, my brothers in spirit and in mankind.
Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members, I have come to you from a country which I had not chosen to be in, but heaven chose that I be one of its citizens.
This land, which we call the 'blessed land', the land of Al-Sham, which includes Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Israel, this land which has encompassed all the cultures of heaven: in our land, the Prophet Abraham walked, and the Prophet Moses lived happily there, and in our land Jesus (may God's blessings be upon him) was born, and from our land he was lifted to the heavens.
Muhammad, the Prophet, came also from Mecca to our land to be lifted into the heavens.
Therefore, I would like you to understand the meaning of that land, which was a source of light and enlightenment without which we would not have been Christians and followers of Abraham and Moses, and we would not have been Muslims and we would not carry the responsibility of conveying the divine message to the world.
Therefore, I thank you wholeheartedly and I thank the President of Parliament, who allowed me to open this cultural debate in a year which is the year of dialogue between cultures.
I say cultures, but really there are no separate cultures, there is but one single culture.
Cultures have had an impact and enriched the culture of mankind, and culture is from our own creation: we created culture.
This Parliament was not built by a Christian or by a Jew or by a Muslim, but it was created by man.
This is a symbol of culture, of its construction.
We all form one single culture, which is called the culture of mankind.
Therefore we, in our region, do not believe in a conflict between cultures at all.
It is a single culture in the universe, and it is not multiple.
However, different cultures can exist or co-exist.
(Applause)
So, let us look at where there is conflict between cultures.
Conflict exists where there is ignorance, terrorism and backwardness, but a cultured person, whatever his religion may be, will hold my hand so that we can build the culture of mankind together.
When man reached the moon, the Soviet Agency at the time and NASA were not all Americans or Russians, they were also Europeans, Italians, Germans, French, Belgians and Arabs.
They, together, built the civilisation that allowed mankind to reach space.
So let us have a look once again at the terminology or the term 'conflict' between cultures or civilisations.
This is dangerous because civilisation cannot be built separately.
Those who built the pyramids are our great-grandfathers, and those who built the pyramids in Chile are also among our great-grandfathers and therefore, as I said, civilisation is one.
A second point.
Does civilisation have a religion?
Or is it a human culture in which religion gives its moral values?
There is no Islamic civilisation, or Christian civilisation, or Jewish civilisation.
Religion gives civilisation its moral values, but culture is something that we built.
God created religion, but we create cultures.
This is what we have built, but religion is the work of God.
Do not, therefore, limit civilisation because it is the result of our work, whereas religion, as I said, is the work of God.
Who creates civilisation?
Mankind - you and I. Who are we, you and I?
Are you different from me?
No.
You are not the other party.
The animal might be the other party, but you are my brother or sister, whatever your religion or language, because my mother is your mother, my father is your father, and the land is our mother and Abraham is our father.
Therefore, let us create a new generation that believes that 'the other' is the animal.
But man, whatever his religion or wherever he comes from, is my brother or sister, and his blood is my blood.
His spirit is mine and his ideas are mine and his freedom is my freedom, and his culture is different from my culture.
So let us build civilisation together.
We do not believe, in our region, in the multiplicity of religions: multiple religions do not exist.
Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad came with one single religion - the worship of God and the dignity of mankind.
As for legislation and law, these differ from time to time and from period to period.
There can be many legislations, but there cannot be many religions.
Therefore, your God and our God are the same and single one and we all worship the same Creator.
Hence there cannot be religious conflict.
This brings me to say that there is no holy war.
I do not believe in holy wars, because a war can never be holy: it is peace that is holy.
(Applause)
So let us teach our children in schools, churches and in religious places and in the mosques that what is really sacred in the universe is man and not the Kaaba or the Masjid al-Aqsa or the Church of the Trinity but mankind - mankind is the most holy and sacred thing in the universe, and this is more important than any other sacred thing.
(Applause)
Why do I say this to you, ladies and gentlemen?
Because the Kaaba was created by Abraham, a man, and the Wall of Mecca was built by a Jew, and the Church of the Trinity was built by a Christian.
But man - who created man?
This is the creation of the Creator, and anybody who destroys the creation of the Creator should not be respected.
Any person who kills an Israeli or Iraqi child will be called upon to respond to his action before God because those children are the creation of God on this planet and we destroyed that creation.
Can we bring life back to those persons?
If the Kaaba were to be destroyed, our children could build it again and if the Masjid al-Aqsa were to be destroyed, we could reconstruct it.
If the Church of Trinity were to be destroyed, the next generation would build it but, believe me, if one man is killed, who can give him back his life?
Hence I greet and commend Europe that invited me to come to this place.
So I start with you and call upon you to ensure that the dialogue between civilisations has to be endless and open so that we create states based on a civil basis - not a religious or an ethnic basis because religion is a relation between you and God - but we must live together in this world peacefully.
I do not impose my religion on you and you do not impose your religion on me.
This is something between us and the Creator.
So, let us build a new generation that believes that the civilisation of mankind is a common work and that the most noble of all is mankind and freedom - after God, of course.
If we would like to see peace in the world, let us start from the land of peace: Palestine and Israel.
So we can tell people, as the Pope said years ago, rather than building the wall, let us build the bridges of peace, because Palestine is the land of peace.
Considering how much it costs to build that wall, we could actually allow Christian, Jewish and Muslim children to attend the same school and to live as brothers and sisters in a school of peace.
(Applause)
Yes, we extended our hands to you in Syria last year.
President Bashar-al-Asad extended his hands to the world and said 'I want a true peace'.
I will not carry a weapon today but I will always carry the words of peace to stand before the world and say, no more war after today.
The victor in war will be a loser if he is temporarily victorious because he killed people, but the real victors are those who become brothers to other people.
It is not land that is holy but it is man that is holy.
Let us make a holy world once man becomes the holy person.
Therefore, please do not believe the media, because the media on many occasions do not tell the truth.
Many of you have visited me in Syria and have come to my mosque, and I went with them to the churches and they saw how we live as one single family, and that we do not believe in simple cohabitation but in living as a family.
Whether we are Muslims, Jews or Christians we believe in the one house - the house of life.
I have lived, as you, as a Member of Parliament for 10 years in Syria and I felt, the moment I entered into Parliament, that I did not represent my political party or my group because I was independent; rather, I represented every person who has asked me to represent him or her and I represented every person who has not asked me to represent him or her, because he or she is my brother or sister, and I was a representative of everybody in the country.
So, do you represent your countries or political parties or do you represent the human being?
Please be representatives for us and your people, because mankind is unique in the universe.
Yes, you have to represent us on the issues of peace and truthfulness and belief.
The Islamic world today witnesses war in many of its countries.
This world must achieve peace, and it has always wanted peace and, if there are certain crises, that is because of injustice.
Christianity came to ensure peace, otherwise we cannot understand what was the mission of the prophets, such as Moses, who called for the achievement of peace.
Nobody wanted to kill anybody, and anybody who wants to kill a person would be contradicting his beliefs and religion.
Do not use religion for killing; religion is for peace and life.
Yes, this is my message from my country, from a land that was blessed by the heavens and where all the prophets walked and lived in.
Woman is a great person in our land, and she is dignified, whether she is Jewish, Christian or Muslim, although she probably faced injustice because of men.
Women participate at all levels of our country and the leaders of my country, including the President, call upon the participation of women in all fields of society.
This city is a title for peace.
I saw how it was built and I said that the miracle of the 20th century is Europe.
This miracle that witnessed the First World War and the Second World War, and then managed to destroy the Berlin Wall without shedding any blood - not one single drop of blood.
All Europe came together, and its people came together in one Parliament.
So, could you help us achieve such a parliament - a human parliament, a spiritual one, a universal one?
Please help us, because Syria and the whole Islamic world are waiting for you, whether they are Muslims or Christians.
Finally, since Damascus is the Capital of Arab Culture this year and you started the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, I would ask you to agree to holding a meeting for cultures in the Capital of Arab Culture, Damascus, to say that the world is at one and that we are extending our hands to Lebanon, because Lebanon has one people, and we should all help the creation of one Lebanon and one true Palestine, one true Israel, one true Iraq, a land of peace for everyone.
(Sustained applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, your applause shows that this House is at one with me in sincerely thanking the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, for his message of opposition to violence, war and terrorism.
Human dignity is central to him, and that is the basis for cooperation between cultures.
His is a tolerance which says that we have our own point of view, that we are not bound to embrace another's point of view, but we respect it and therefore live together peacefully in this world, recognising human dignity.
Thank you, Your Eminence, for your address to us here in the European Parliament.
(Applause)

Mr President, I rise under Rules 152 and 160 of the Rules of Procedure, concerning voting procedure and roll call votes.
It is obvious that the Rules of Procedure have been abused and used in a way utterly contrary to their intention.
Could I ask, through you, that specialists such as Mr Corbett and others look very carefully at what has happened today?
My understanding is that the President has the discretion to rule that any request for a roll-call vote be declared invalid.
That may become a necessity when we have heavier voting sessions in the future.
(DE) Mr President, in this House we have very liberal and, in particular, minority-friendly Rules of Procedure, and rightly so.
It is our wish and our duty to preserve them.
This, however, presupposes that the various groups exercise their minority rights properly and do not abuse them.
When that happens - as it has done today - we should rethink this practice.
Mr President, I must take exception to the two points of order just made.
The rules are absolutely clear on this.
Every group has the right to request roll-call votes.
No discretionary power is given to the Chair.
We have always accepted that, ultimately, in any democratic chamber the majority has the right to get its way, but what we have just heard is the most intolerant position that does not allow any opposition, that does not allow any dissenting view and, if my colleagues want to understand why the European Union is so unpopular with the voters out there, you need only consider your own intolerant attitude towards anyone expressing any view other than your own.
(Applause)
Mr Hannan, to my knowledge, all votes which have taken place this morning have been by roll call.
Therefore the Rules have been complied with meticulously.
Mr President, I wish to point out to Mr Beazley and Mr Rack, and perhaps to yourself, Mr President, that today is the first time since I have sat in the European Parliament that we can actually be confident that the results are right, because normally it is a farce!
So do not moan at us, we are helping you to tidy up this place so that in the future more of this work is done in committee and we are not given hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of amendments.
What we have done is entirely within the Rules and all of you - in particular those who believe in this place - should learn a lesson from it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I rise under Rule 171 of the Rules of Procedure and table the following motion on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament: in view of the urgent need to discuss the Rules of Procedure and their interpretation, I move that the sitting be suspended as of now and that all further debates, including the explanations of vote, be postponed until ten o'clock this evening.
(Applause)
Fourteen MEPs in the House have requested explanations of votes for each of the seven debates held yesterday and this morning.
Fourteen MEPs, each of whom has requested an explanation on each of the seven debates: ten are members of the IND/DEM Group, two of the PPE-DE Group and two are Non-attached.
If these explanations of vote take place now they will probably take up about two hours of our time.
Therefore I submit the following point of order to the House: either we take the explanations of vote and stay here for two hours more or we suspend the session now as proposed by Mr Schulz and hold the explanations of vote tonight.
(The House agreed to this proposal.)
Ladies and gentlemen, notification of the timing explanations of vote will be given at 3 p.m.
Voting time (continuation)
The next item is voting time.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Mr President, very briefly, I do not think you actually followed the Rules of Procedure correctly during the earlier voting session.
You said 'the voting is now open', but you did not ask 'have all Members voted?' before saying 'the voting is closed', and you did not read out the results.
I think you were out of order.
Mr Booth, the result of the vote is on the screen.
As you have asked for all today's votes to be roll-call votes, that is what we are doing; what I am trying to do is to make this form of voting as painless as possible for the House, if that is all right with you, Mr Booth.
Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes
(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Agenda
(FR) Colleagues, I have to remind you that 19 Members have requested time for oral explanations of vote on each of the seven reports that were adopted before lunch.
There are a further 10 individual requests for explanations of vote.
Theoretically the time required for explanations of vote would thus be 143 minutes, something more than two hours.
In order to be able to take these explanations of vote today, I therefore propose the following change in the order of business:
We would take the Commission's statement on waste in the Campania region, which is currently scheduled for 9 p.m., immediately after the Angelilli report on the rights of the child.
The explanations of vote would then be taken during the evening sitting, after the oral question on the status of elected MEPs in Poland.
The order of business would thus be as follows:
from 3 to 5.30 p.m.: Cashman report, Angelilli report, then the Commission statement on waste in the Campania region,
from 5.30 to 7 p.m.: Commission Question Time,
then during the evening sitting from 9 p.m. to midnight we would have, in order: the Pack report, the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, the oral question on the status of elected MEPs in Poland and finally the explanations of vote on those items put to the vote before lunch.
Mr President, on a point of order, for clarification of the Rules as they were ruled upon earlier today.
Under Rule 171, invoked by Mr Schulz, about the suspension of the sitting, it does not say - because we had finished the votes and were before an explanation of vote - that the rule could be invoked at that particular time.
If the sitting was then suspended, it is precedent in this House that, when you resume the sitting, you continue with the business, and continuing with the business - based on precedent in this House and what we have done in the eight years I have been here - would be the explanations of vote.
I am quite happy to come back here at whatever time is necessary to give my explanations of vote, because I want to do that for a number of reports.
I would ask you what the basis of the ruling on Rule 171 was, because I do not think that was in order; you know you are twisting the Rules, as well as I do here, to go against the democratic wills of some Members of this House.
It is a strange type of democracy when you are trying to silence a minority who are just doing what they are allowed to do within the Rules of Procedure.
(FR) Colleagues, allow me to remind you of a few basic facts about how we operate here.
The President can suspend the sitting at any time.
I merely have to get up - to rise from this seat - and the proceedings will be suspended automatically.
Rest assured, please, that I have no intention of rising from my seat, but do be aware that all it takes for the proceedings to be suspended is that the President should get up.
So my first point is this: the proceedings were suspended because it rests entirely within the President's power to suspend the sitting when he or she chooses to do so.
A second absolute rule is the following: this is the plenary session and only the plenary session has control - total control - over its agenda.
That is why I am proposing to you that you amend the order of business along the lines I have just suggested.
Should you not wish to make the changes I have proposed, then in that case - and only in that case - Mr Heaton-Harris, you would be right, we would work to the agenda previously agreed.
I will therefore now ask whether the Members are formally opposed to changing the order of business as I have just suggested.
We will formally hear the case against the proposal and then I will take a speaker in favour of it.
Mr President, it is undoubtedly true that you, as President, could leave the chair and the Assembly would be suspended.
However, that is not the basis on which what happened before lunch time happened.
That was on the premise of a proposal under Rule 171, from Mr Schulz, that the House be suspended.
The rule is quite clear, that when such a proposal is made there should be a speaker for, and a speaker against.
That was not the case, meaning that the proposal was irregular and should not have been put to the vote, and that the decision is not binding.
You should, therefore, now return to the agenda.
(FR) I would remind you again that the House is the sovereign authority here.
So the President in the chair is entitled to do as I am now doing, namely to call on two colleagues to speak, one for and one against.
That is a prerogative of the President.
Of course the House has to take a vote, but I believe that a vote was taken this morning, and electronically confirmed. I do not think that the result of that vote can be contested.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I only wish to acknowledge that the President who chaired the sitting this morning did indeed forget to ask who wished to speak for and against the proposal.
It is equally true, however, that a clear majority of this House voted that we should not debate or hear the explanations of vote now but at ten o'clock this evening.
Now there is a new proposal, and I wish to support it on behalf of my Group and, I think, on behalf of other Members too.
I believe the arrangement you have proposed makes good sense, and we shall see how the vote goes.
Moreover, as you said yourself, the House is sovereign.
The majority of the House will decide.
(Applause)
(FR) Colleagues, I have taken one speaker against and one speaker for the motion.
If someone has something to say at this point, it should be on a different matter, not to re-argue the for and against. If that is what you wish to do, I cannot give you the floor.
Mr President, on a point of order, this Chamber may be sovereign, as you say, but it nonetheless must follow its own Rules of Procedure.
The suspension or closure of a sitting is covered by Rule 171; I quote, 'The sitting may be suspended or closed during a debate or a vote.'
Now, this morning was not during a debate or a vote, it was after the vote.
Furthermore, Rule 163, 'Explanations of vote', does not allow discretion to the Chair to not hear them or to change the time.
It reads explicitly, 'Once the general debate has been concluded, any Member may give an oral explanation on the final vote for not longer than one minute'.
It is true that the rules of this House give substantial arbitrary power to the speaker.
But these are two items where no such power pertains, and this House chose - in the most flagrant way - to tear up its own Rules of Procedure rather than delay a couple of people from having lunch.
I have to say it is symbolic of the way in which the European Union is proceeding with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, nay, European Constitution, that you tear up your own rule book when it does not suit you, rather than tolerate an opposing point of view.
(FR) What I propose, colleagues, is as follows: clearly we are not in a position this afternoon, here in plenary session, to assess all the various arguments about the interpretation of this rule.
If Members wish to engage in recriminations, let them do so in writing to the President of Parliament.
I am sure that he will refer complaints to the appropriate committee.
What I am concerned to do now is simply to decide on the order of business.
I have made a proposal.
I have heard one Member speak against it and one Member for it.
I now put it to the vote.
(Parliament agreed to the request.)
(The order of business was thus established.)
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
(FR) The Minutes of the sitting of Monday 14 January 2008 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very kind of you to give me the floor 20 minutes after I asked for it, even though I am right opposite the presidency.
I want to speak for the record and for the sake of democracy in this Chamber.
The Presidency of Parliament and all the group chairmen must realise that two wrongs do not make a right.
What is politically useful is not always politically correct and after listening today to the Grand Mufti we have to decide in a manner that is clear and unequivocal for all of us whether we in this Chamber follow the democratic provisions of the Rules of Procedure or follow the interest each individual may have according to circumstances.
A mistake was made this morning with regard to Parliament's Rules of Procedure and we will not correct that error by voting today in an empty Chamber.
We are making another mistake to the detriment of democracy here.
I am not saying on behalf of the UEN Group whether it is important to discuss the waste in Italy at 9 p.m. this evening or at 5 p.m. tomorrow, or whether it is important for explanations of vote to follow the vote, as has always been the custom in this Parliament, when the vote is expressed as it should have been this morning.
I do ask you, however, Mr President - and you may cut me off, that does not interest me at all - what this Parliament's Rules of Procedure say?
Do you know?
In regard to this question, you want to reply to this deserted Chamber that it should vote on the basis of those who were given the floor and not those who wanted to express an independent view!
That is madness!
(FR) Madame President, I trust my tone will be as measured as your own was agitated.
I gave you the floor because I wished to know whether you were for or against approval of the Minutes of Monday 14 January.
You had nothing to say on that point.
I was, however, courteous enough to hear you out and I hope that our colleagues will be similarly appreciative of the manner in which you chose to address the House.
I shall take it, therefore, that there are no comments, as Madame President is not seeking the floor again.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)
Multiannual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency for 2007-2012 (debate)
