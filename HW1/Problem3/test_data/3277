It is clearly a very generous package, but at the same time it has to be a powerful package because otherwise it will not work.
The worst thing we could possibly do is make an offer which nobody takes up.
That would frustrate what the Commission is trying to do.
In that context I can tell Mr Miller that I am not supporting the two late amendments.
They will not be on the EPP voting list.
We have a consensus on that.
So we believe this is the right package, but I commend the way that Bill Miller has sought to tighten up some aspects, particularly those relating to Commission officials who may take the retirement package and then go on to take up other jobs.
Clearly it is not reasonable that they should effectively be rewarded twice at the European taxpayers' expense.
I hope the Commission will accept those sensible provisions that Bill Miller has put into the report.
Finally, I wish again to support the amendments that extend the application of this scheme to both the European Parliament and the political groups.
That is a recognition of our dual role.
We must not just hold the Commission to account for the progress of these reforms, but also look at our own management policies within this institution.
It is quite clear that we have to address exactly the same issues.
This is a once-off package that is not setting a precedent for the future reform of pensions policy.
You will recall that in my report I attached great importance to the need to reform the standing pensions policy to introduce a permanent early retirement scheme.
But this package is disconnected from that, and quite rightly so.
This is a very important step in the reform of the Commission and I am pleased to give it, on behalf of my group, our full support.
Madam President, having listened to Mr Harbour, it seems to me that we are not going to have much debate tonight, because the Group of the European Peoples' Party and the Socialist Group basically agree in their support for the Miller report and the proposals now being presented to us by the European Commission.
I believe that Commissioner Kinnock is demonstrating his great parliamentary experience by negotiating this rather complex issue in a very efficient manner and I will simply make an observation on what we might call Mr Harbour' s obiter dictum.
From the point of view of the Socialist Group, it is essential that the rights of officials be recognised, including acquired rights, as well as the existence of an administrative career path, and that it be recognised that officials of the European institutions are of high quality and have carried out very efficient work.
Therefore, the officials should not be pursued, as it appears these last minute amendments intend to do, but this Community administration should be rapidly transformed without abandoning the essential principles of recognising an independent civil service and recognising an administrative career path.
Of course, we agree with the proposals in the Miller report on the extending the facilities enjoyed by Commission officials to the officials of the other institutions, including the European Parliament, which I believe will take a favourable view of the amendments we are presenting, which, in summary, recognise the good work done by the Commission.

So it only remains for me to congratulate Mr Miller on his report and Mr Kinnock on the skilful, capable and progressive way in which he has dealt with this first administrative reform.
Madam President, the ELDR Group supports the reform set out in the White Paper and which we have been able to discuss with the Commissioner.
We look forward to receiving the concrete proposals from the Committee on Budgets and the other committees.
Like the previous speaker, we accept this proposal as a one-off measure, a necessary measure in order to take the reforms forward. We also believe that it is cost-neutral.
We are also pleased that the Commission has realised that the other institutions must have similar rights, that this will be included in the scheme and that it will be accepted.
When we compare our institutions, I would like to warn the Commissioner about one point, namely about accepting the promotion system which we have in the European Parliament.
I have heard that the Commission is interested in this, but I have unfortunately received indications that there will be no real assessment of the actual knowledge of various employees as the assessment is a "zero sum game" .
This is said by way of welcoming the continued reform work.
Madam President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for his painstaking preparation of the report. The shadow rapporteurs no doubt also had a hand in this.
Neither are my thanks diminished by the fact that the rapporteur has called 32 Members, of which I am one, a group of narrow-minded individuals.
Nevertheless you will of course allow me first of all to repudiate this description here.
On behalf of a minority in our group, I should like to express a number of reservations which we have on the proposal.
It is proposed, in the extreme case, that an official who has worked in the Commission for ten years and who is 50 years of age be given early retirement with an allowance of 65% of his salary.
We do not believe that a lucrative, generous early retirement scheme of this kind can be justified to the European taxpayer.
When we have spent the whole day talking about the Irish referendum in the corridors and when we are always talking here about proximity to the people, may I please ask who can actually explain to a pensioner who has paid into a pension scheme for 40 years why a 50-year-old A3-grade official should be given EUR 5 500 to go for walks in the country?
No one is able to explain to me why the Commission, which has 18 000 posts, is nevertheless not in a position usefully to deploy 600 officials who are obviously no longer productive.
Neither is anyone able to tell me why this should now be an essential component of this Commission reform.
I fear, you see, that there will be crafty, shrewd and smart officials who will succeed in benefiting from this golden handshake.
In the end the good ones will go, the bad ones will stay, EUR 16 million will be spent and everyone will be disgraced!
Madam President, at the beginning of this legislature, we all agreed, and we still agree, that certain sectors of both the Commission and the other European institutions need reform.
Inside the Commission, it has emerged that over 1200 posts needed to achieve fundamental strategic objectives are unfilled.
According to the Commission, part of that deficit can be made up by rationalising and redistributing the existing workforce.
That approach deserves support, but it anticipates that some members of staff are not capable of adapting to the new tasks.
To solve the problem, the need arises to give such staff incentives to choose favourable, mutually agreed early retirement as a unique, one-off package.
This hypothesis rightly recognises the past contribution of the staff involved, and gives them the option of alternative employment elsewhere.
The Union does not suffer economic overload and it is not obligatory to take the package.
To conclude, my verdict is positive.
However, I do not support the Ferber amendments.
Reform is an exceptional event and should be regarded as such.
I would like to express great appreciation of the rapporteur' s really excellent and influential work, and the same appreciation applies to the proposals from the heads of delegations, which extend that solution to all the institutions of the Union.
Finally, great appreciation is due to all the employees of the Union, those who choose early retirement and those who remain in working life, because it is also thanks to their enthusiastic work that Europe continues to advance briskly towards the future.
I begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and specifically the rapporteur, Mr Miller, for this very constructive report on the Commission's proposal for a time and numbers-limited early retirement scheme.
I know that the speedy drafting and consideration of the report owes a great deal to the enthusiasm and hard work of Mr Miller, and indeed of his shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour.
Whilst expressing gratitude to both of them I would also like to express my thanks to the House for agreeing to bring forward consideration of this report in plenary.
As several Members may know, that assists the Commission in its efforts to sustain progress with the reform and modernisation that Parliament has called for and to do so in good time, so that if everything else goes well it can to implement at least the first part of the scheme by the end of this year.
As the House may recall, in our reform strategy White Paper in March last year we announced our intention to undertake a reallocation of human resources across departments in order, specifically, to concentrate activities more precisely on core policy objectives and to achieve a better balance between the tasks assigned to the Commission and the resources available to it.
We then set up a Commissioners' group under President Prodi to make a thorough analysis.
That assessment showed that even after the rationalisation efforts carried out in 1999 and 2000 there was a shortfall of 1 254 posts in relation to Commission staff members assigned to priority activities.
In order to make a significant contribution to closing that gap we then specified the ways in which further rationalisation of activities, productivity gains and internal redeployment would enable us to meet two-thirds of those requirements from within the Commission.
In addition to measures which enabled redeployed staff to perform other higher priority activities, we also proposed that explicit termination of service arrangements should be made available so that over a two-year period the Commission could offer reasonable severance conditions to 600 officials whose skills are not easily adaptable to the changed and changing needs and tasks of the institution.
The purpose of the proposed regulation being considered by the House is, therefore, to authorise such a termination of service scheme for 300 Commission officials in the course of this year, and another 300 in the course of next year.
The proposal is based on the same mechanism that has been used in previous termination of service regulations related, for instance, to successive enlargements of the Union or to renewal of responsibilities in the on research directorate-general.
Application for inclusion in the scheme is therefore voluntary, but the new scheme differs from previous ones, particularly on the following major points.
First of all, candidates for early retirement will be selected solely according to the interests of the services.
Secondly, financial conditions are set at a lower level - 65% of final salary instead of 70% - than has been customary in all previous termination of service arrangements.
Thirdly, this early retirement proposal has a neutral budgetary impact.
The difference between the cost of the total remuneration of 600 officials before termination of service and the cost of the allowance they will receive afterwards will finance the recruitment of 258 new officials.
The 342 remaining posts will be given back to the budgetary authority.
These elements of the new scheme will help to ensure the achievement of the overall objective of gaining a better match between Commission tasks and resources.
It will also ensure that the ceiling of Heading 5 of the financial perspective is fully respected.
In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Miller, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 9, which asks for the expenditure for the early retirement scheme to remain non-compulsory.
We cannot accept that amendment simply because of the statutory reality that allowances for officials who have left the service are legally defined as compulsory expenditure.
Having made this point, I turn to the more positive and more complex position of the Commission on the other proposed amendments tabled by Mr Miller in the report.
I will come to the amendments by Mr Ferber later on.
The Commission can accept Amendments 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 and which are aimed at ensuring that the arrangements of the scheme are properly implemented, that the measures under consideration do not preclude the adoption of a new permanent early retirement scheme for all of the institutions.
As Miller said in his speech, these arrangements should be drawn up and adopted at the earliest possible opportunity.
The amendments that I have just listed are also aimed at ensuring that further single measures of this kind should in future be unnecessary and, therefore, precluded.
All of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are in line with the Commission's intentions as regards the implementation of the scheme and introduce improvements and refinements to the proposal that we originally submitted.
We therefore welcome them very warmly.
Since the Commission will soon be proposing the introduction of a permanent, flexible retirement scheme into the Staff Regulations, further single measures of this kind are highly unlikely to be necessary in the future.
The House will know that the most important political points in the discussions on this early retirement scheme that have so far taken place in the Council and in Parliament relate to the fact that the proposed scheme only concerns the Commission, which is committed to implementing the scheme in a budgetary neutral way.
In this context, I refer to Amendments Nos 1- 6, 12, 13 and 16, all of which seek to extend the field of application of the proposed regulation and require the participation of all European institutions and of Parliament's temporary staff in the early retirement scheme.
I understand the interest of Parliament and Council as employing institutions in this matter and, as Members of this House will know, I am not unsympathetic to their objectives.
However, I wish to say most emphatically that, if progress is to be made to everyone's liking, budgetary neutrality must be observed in all of the institutions that implement a scheme of this kind.
There are three reasons for that.
The first, very obviously, is the clear need for public understanding and acceptance. That in itself requires that any developments in this area should be budgetary neutral.
Secondly, if the Commission alone guaranteed budgetary neutrality, the adoption of the scheme by the Council would be very unlikely indeed.
Thirdly, heading 5 of the financial perspective provides budgetary means for all institutions.
The margins for the years to come, which the Commission has promised to respect, would be further reduced if budgetary neutrality were not common to all institutions.
Taking these realities into account, it is clear that the success and the acceptance of the whole early retirement scheme may well depend on all institutions' accepting budgetary neutrality.
In adopting Mr Miller's report, therefore, this House would need to confirm that its participation in an early retirement scheme will be subject to the same conditions as those applied by the Council and by the Commission.
I am sure that that requirement is well understood and supported across this House.
Finally, before responding to the two amendments tabled by Mr Ferber, I must say that I heard Mr Miller's comments on Mr Ferber's amendments and think that, whatever glorious future offers itself to my good friend Mr Miller, I can safely predict that he will not be made head of the diplomatic service.
In response to Mr Ferber's amendments, the Commission feels that Amendment No 21 would significantly reduce the effective scope of the measure by restricting the number of eligible candidates for early retirement.
Indeed the restriction would be so significant as to actually have an impact on the geographical balance of the scheme. That would clearly be unacceptable to the Commission and to the great majority of this House.
Amendment No 22 by Mr Ferber would introduce new conditions, notably a 50% tax so negative and complex as to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the Commission's proposals.
We cannot, therefore, accept that amendment either, and I hope that, on reflection, the honourable Member, Mr Ferber, whom I know very well and have every reason to respect, will understand and accept the Commission's view.
I am extremely grateful for the constructive approach taken in this report and, indeed, the improvements made on the original proposal, because it has received close and enthusiastic attention from Members of this House.
I am sure that that constructive attitude will continue to characterise our discussions on reform, since as honourable Members know, I regard the understanding and support of this House for all our reform proposals to be absolutely critical.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Universal service in electronic communications
The next item is the report (A5-0202/2001) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services [COM(2000) 392 - C5-0429/2000 - 2000/0183(COD)]
Madam President, it gives me great pleasure tonight to be able to present my report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to the House on universal services and users rights relating to electronic communications.
This is a further element in what is a most crucial package of legislation that is now being considered by Parliament to create a single regulatory framework for electronic communications.
It is so important for the future of the European economy as a whole that we get this package right.
It has been a privilege for me to have been able to work for the first time in my parliamentary career here on a major codecision text like this.
This is a complex text and the procedure for review has also been complex.
I would like particularly to thank the rapporteurs of the three committees who provided me with opinions, Mr Papayannakis, Mr Aparicio SÃ¡nchez and particularly Mr Caudron, where we worked together under the Hughes procedure and where the amendments that were passed by the Committee on Industry were received by my committee.
We did not vote on any of them, they were accepted by us in our report.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various committees I worked with for providing me with so much support.
Indeed, the final text before us has been the result of a lot of work by many people.
I am not proposing to accept any further amendments to the text, even though a number have come in rather late in the day from the Socialist Group.
I believe we have reached a good agreement on the text and I am not proposing to support any additional amendments in the vote tomorrow.
I should like to say a few things about the text itself.
It is a very comprehensive text because it contains four distinct measures.
There are the provisions relating to universal service itself, how it should be delivered, how it should be funded in an open and transparent way that does not distort the market place and a whole series of measures on users' rights, including some important new measures reflecting the new technology which is coming our way.
It has a number of crucial measures related to market intervention and the ability of Member States to intervene very directly in the market place, and to set retail pricing for example.
Finally, it also has some measures related to digital television, particularly a package of obligations related to "must carry" provisions for public service broadcasts.
I do not have time this evening to go through all of those in detail but I would like to observe that I have specifically asked the Commission in the text that we will receive at second reading to mark out more clearly those four aspects of the text.
At the moment it is quite complex, particularly the market intervention measures which are regarded as transitory measures by the Commission, a view that I share.
They are there for the time in which the market is still being directly regulated, but this whole package envisages a time when the entire market will operate under normal competition aspects.
Those transitory measures should be clearly identified because hopefully we will not need them in a few years' time.
My approach in considering this text has been to give strong support to the strategy behind the directive.
The Commission has not sought to enhance significantly the scope of the universal service remit and that is absolutely right.
In my work I have sought to clarify the text, to improve it in some aspects, but to be very selective about new provisions.
In the area of users' rights it has been important to strike the right balance between a text that will be agreed centrally at European Union level and detailed work that should be done in the Member States.
Believe me, colleagues, I have had no shortage of people wanting to complicate this text, wanting to add extra provisions.
I believe I have the balance right, particularly in the light of the fact that these provisions will apply to the applicant countries, where the technological base from which they start will be much lower than that envisaged at the moment.
I am confident that the proposals I put before you tonight are balanced and will stand the test of time.
They anticipate technical development.
They will be good for consumers because they sustain and develop competition.
They provide essential rights for consumers but they will allow a sector that is changing very fast to thrive and develop in the future without unnecessary and complex interference.
Madam President, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport takes a positive view of the Commission' s draft directive and the sensible report by Mr Harbour, whom I congratulate.
Some of the amendments contained in our opinion have been incorporated into the text, as he has said.
Others, however, have not been accepted, but have been accepted for voting in plenary by Mr Medina Ortega.
They are intended to improve the text from the point of view of electronic communications being considered as a general interest service.
The model of society developed by the Treaties has enshrined the predominance of competition and the market, but the thing that makes us proud of Europe, the thing that makes our social model unique in the world, is the compatibility of these principles with two irrefutable values or circumstances: our high degree of social protection and the strength and breadth of our general interest services.
People operating a communication network or service on the market are not dealing with any old product, but with services which have a high added value from social and cultural points of view.
Their universality and ease of access to them involve principles which affect democracy and human dignity.
The Committee on Culture' s amendments have several objectives: to further develop the obligation to transmit to electronic communication networks, to impose information and transparency obligations on the companies providing these services, to increase the protection of disabled people, particularly the visually and hearing impaired, as users of these communications and, finally, to separate, from a legislative point of view, infrastructures and content in the audiovisual sector.
I hope that the rapporteur and his group will be generous enough to accept these amendments.
Madam President, we agree with the rapporteur's description of the problem and thank him for that.
However, I think that we should not be too optimistic when it comes to competition.
Competition fosters - and it is only logical that it should foster - reductions in costs, consumer choice and discrimination depending on the customer's status.
We all know the ways of the market.
That is why, without wishing to embark on general theories, Madam President, Mr Harbour, I should like to say that the series of amendments which we have proposed is designed mainly to protect consumers not from threats from others, but from competitive conditions per se.
In other words, we want a universal service which is accessible to all and of the same standard for all.
For example, a service which allows everyone to get on to the Internet at the same speed anytime, anywhere, without discriminating between customers depending on where they are.
Without discriminating between customers depending on how they want to pay their subscription.
We have seen it happen.
We have also called for proper consultation with consumer associations when reviewing the conditions under which licences are granted.
We also want terms in contracts to be simple, familiar, comprehensible and comparable and for this to be compulsory so that customers really can change suppliers.
We already have competition.
If a customer is to be able to change supplier, he must know in advance of any changes in price for example, so that he can opt out in time. He must be able to keep his telephone number, which the Commission is quite right to propose, and he must be able to change company without incurring charges.
Account must also be taken of the need to warn customers about the dangers, for example, of mobile telephones.
Customers' rights must be clearly set out somewhere and they must be able to read and use them.
All this is not intended merely to make the Commission's life difficult, nor do we believe that it should be left up to each individual Member State.
We need general principles which specifically protect consumers because that is the way to make better progress here.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by praising the quality, breadth and importance of the European Commission draft directive.
I must say, however, that I regret that this text, which is, after all, an integral part of the Telecom package, has been withdrawn from the competency of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the benefit of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which, in my view, seems to be becoming an extremely bad habit.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, even if they are included in the same directive, universal service and consumer protection are two areas which are, admittedly, related and important, but they are different.
Consumer protection requires guarantees, clarity, simplicity and, above all, therefore, transparency.
The amendments voted in committee are a step in this direction.
Other amendments could have gone further still, if a majority in the committee had wanted this to happen.
Universal service is a much wider concept which has many other more complex goals.
Universal service requires a definition at a given time, but it also requires the means and mechanisms to ensure its development over time.
It of course requires planned funding.
Lastly, I would reiterate that it is independent of the legal nature of the company that provides it.
I welcomed the European Commission' s text, but I remain convinced of the need for a framework directive for all European universal services.
I would like to finish with a personal comment, by reaffirming that universal service cannot and should not be what could be called the fading leftovers of liberalisation.
It has, for me and for my colleagues, a value and an objective in itself, which is one of the conditions of social cohesion, which provided the basis of our Europe.
It should, therefore, be desired, defined, affirmed and chosen on its own merits.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr Harbour on his sterling report, but also Mr Caudron on his excellent contribution on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Madam President, this is a report of extreme significance, for it regulates the rights of citizens in relation to the duties of companies.
Certainly at a time when everything develops so fast, it is of crucial importance to have such a report.
Allow me to make five observations.
First of all, it is essential to have a level playing field.
That is why, of course, Article 13 is of major importance. It stipulates quite emphatically how alternative funding can be found for universal services if they were to create an additional burden for operators.
I believe that to be of crucial importance, certainly in cases where operators are in dire financial straits, as many currently are.
Secondly, Article 16 is important and, on that score, I am completely dumbfounded at the fact that the Socialist Group should table an amendment to confine the whole issue of number portability to the fixed network.
If there is one thing which has promoted, and has to promote, competition among operators, it is, of course, the possibility of number portability, and I would make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs not to adopt that amendment under any circumstances.
That would seem wrong to me.
I wholeheartedly agree that interventions in the market or in the price structure, such as we carried out with regard to international roaming, must form an exception.
But if you, the citizen, have to pay over the odds and are not given any information about prices for international roaming, which allows payment to be made between one country and another, then the only option available is legislation.
And it is precisely because we have threatened legislation that operators are now prepared to drop their prices, and that is, I believe, what this is ultimately all about.
A third fundamental point is caller location information where 112, our European emergency number, is concerned.
That is important, but I should urge you to mainly use this location information for relevant cases.
The protection of privacy is of crucial importance, and I am pleased, therefore, that that has been provided for in Article 22.
You may be surprised to find someone from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy raising the following point, namely that, from the point of view of cultural policy, Article 26, with its 'must carry' obligations, is of major importance.
But once again, I am astounded that our Socialist group would like to extend that 'must carry' obligation to cover commercial broadcasters.
In my view, that is a complete misunderstanding, and I truly hope that they are prepared to retract that amendment, for we must reserve the 'must carry' obligation for public broadcasters only.
Finally, Madam President, you and I enjoy watching all kinds of programmes, also using set top boxes, and if we then fall victim to, let us say, one large consortium, then it is no longer possible to do that.
Set top boxes must be compatible with each other.
A common interface is required for that purpose.
This is legislated for excellently in Annex 6.
We must pledge our support for this.
Madam President, the truth, and we have seen proof of it, is that it is often said by conservative politicians that we Socialists are opposed to the process of liberalisation.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
We fully accept a process which contains of good number of progressive perspectives.
One of them is that, when a sector is liberalised, the greater the number of companies amongst which the market is distributed, the more the concentration of economic power is being limited, and this is a progressive objective which these benches fully accept.
We cannot agree with monopolies which offer goods and services of lower quality and at higher prices than if they were offered within a competitive system.
But, while public monopolies are unsatisfactory, private ones are totally unacceptable and unbearable.
We therefore believe that services must be provided within a competitive system, but that that system must be subject to corrections in order to prevent a situation where the only people who have access to the services are those who, as a result of their levels of income or place of residence, are viable for the providers of the service, leaving out those who cannot pay the price for the services however basic they may be, or those who live in areas which are not viable for companies.
It is therefore necessary to impose universal service obligations, but naturally the discussion on the size and conditions of the universal service will have a high ideological content.
The Right insists, and always in defence of companies, that these universal service obligations should be as limited as possible.
The progressives must insist that the greatest number of services must reach all the citizens at accessible prices.
These considerations are reflected in this report.
Its rapporteur, Mr Harbour, has done a magnificent job, but I must not forget that he is a member of a political group whose positions seem more orientated towards defending the interests of companies than towards the operation of the market.
That is to say that, to use the American terminology, he belongs to a political group which is more 'pro-business' than 'pro-market' .
It is true that the report has positive aspects, and we are going to support those positive aspects without any doubt, but in other respects, it contains proposals which we find unacceptable.
To remove the reference, as in Amendment No 2 of the report, to the concern about the dominant position which the former monopolies maintain within liberalisation processes, seems unacceptable to us; to remove the Commission' s phrase that lays done that services must be provided at an accessible price, does not seem acceptable.
Neither does it seem to us acceptable to vote against, as happened in committee and which has been said will happen now, certain amendments which propose, for example, that a change in telephone service provider should not mean a change in the customer' s number and that, if it does happen, it should be done without cost to the user and at a more than accessible cost.
It seems as though, in these respects, the desire is to hinder competition and the appearance of new economic operators, in other words to defend the interests of monopolies and that is something we cannot agree with.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been interesting to draw up this report through a Hughes Procedure between two committees.
In most cases I believe we have succeeded in creating a certain cohesion between the committees and also with the previous reports on the same issue which were also mentioned earlier.
I also believe that the rapporteurs have tried to achieve such cohesion, particularly with regard to creating a bridge between the previously approved reports and this report.
That is excellent, but on certain points I believe we have not succeeded in this yet.
This is particularly true with regard to the TV standards which appear in some of the amendments.
We have also fought a great deal over the term "co-regulation" .
In this case I find it easier to and will accept what the rapporteur has put forward, but it does not sound quite as good translated into many of the other languages.
Co-regulation meaning an authority which in the final instance oversees the balance is acceptable, but some of the translations of the report talk loosely about common provisions, and that is not as descriptive.
Balance in this report is important.
I believe that, when voting tomorrow, we should ensure that there is a balance in the provisions between, on the one hand, 'must carry' obligations and financial compensation for those required to follow them and, on the other hand, compensation for the telecommunications companies which have obligations under the other regulations.
I also believe that tomorrow we must ensure that there is still a comprehensive directory service, something which we can only achieve if there is a financial benefit to operating such a service.
We must not forget this when voting tomorrow or in the coming Directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should first like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Harbour.
The report is excellent and, by tabling constructive proposals and also holding intensive negotiations with colleagues, Mr Harbour has really managed to strike a good compromise, which met with broad support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Single Market and will - I am sure - also find favour tomorrow in the plenary.
Much has already been said about the content of the directive and I only wish to focus on what I feel to be the essential points.
The first is the scope of the universal service obligations.
Firstly, the fact that the universal service is to include simple but not broadband Internet connections is to be welcomed.
In some parts of the Community it will not be possible for the infrastructure required for broadband connections to be rolled out or upgraded to the necessary technical standard in the next few years.
In addition, in some places there is still insufficient demand for these kinds of connections.
It should in the first instance therefore be left to market forces to offer these connections without there being any regulatory pressure to do so.
Competition on the local network and thus in providing Internet access has been made possible by the regulation on unbundling the local loop.
It is now important to apply this directive consistently as quickly as possible so that a sufficient number of broadband connections can be made available quickly and at a reasonable price.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has tabled one amendment, Amendment No 9 on Article 4a), which unfortunately, in my view, takes us in the wrong direction, namely by including high-speed Internet access in the universal service obligations after all.
It states that the Member States should prescribe particular data transfer rates based on the latest technology.
For the reasons which I have stated I feel that this amendment goes too far.
I welcome the inclusion in the directive of a future European regional code '3883'.
I believe that this is an information measure which will also promote our internal market.
I also welcome the provisions on number portability in the mobile sector.
This too has already been mentioned by Mr van Velzen.
I can only hope that Mr Harbour's report meets with broad support tomorrow. All in all it is a really good piece of work!
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, the whole Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the excellent report and I also want to thank all the other committees for their constructive contribution to this work.
We all know the importance of the entire Telecom package for the future competitiveness of Europe.
This report demonstrates a keen understanding of these fast-moving markets, their technologies and how and where they are developing.
In addition to this demonstrated technical and commercial know-how, Mr Harbour has included a number of amendments on behalf of an often-overlooked group of users in our society, the disabled.
I am very pleased to see the amendments put forward in relation to the disabled, which the Commission warmly welcomes.
The Commission shares the view that universal service is not just about getting geographical coverage right.
It is also about ensuring coverage of all groups in our society, including people with disabilities and special needs.
We are now working on a recommendation on web accessibility guidelines, which will help disabled people to use Internet services.
Due to limited time I will try to focus today on a few issues of special importance.
First, on the scope of universal service: the Commission supports the Harbour report on the proposed scope of universal service.
The key issues here, for example regular review of the scope of universal service and the financing of net costs using transparent and competitively neutral mechanisms, accord with the Commission's own approach to these key principles.
Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15 are genuine improvements.
However, the Commission cannot agree to add "effective" to "Internet access" as proposed in Amendment No 9, because of varying interpretations which could lead to market distortions.
The Commission welcomes amendments for the chapter dealing with the regulation of SMP designated operators, but cannot support provision such as "at least annually imposed on NRAs" in Amendment No 24.
The framework must remain flexible and NRAs must be in a position to react to market conditions as they develop.
The Commission finds persuasive the innovations suggested put forward in Amendment No 26 that persistent market failure to satisfy requirements of users and consumers may be addressed by retail remedies if wholesale remedies are ineffective.
However, the Commission would link any intervention to the general objectives of the package rather than to well-justified complaints.
With respect to the chapter on users' interests and rights, the Commission welcomes the support for the provisions of the directive and endorses Amendment No 31 to require operators to include prevailing tariffs in contracts with subscribers.
With respect to the implementation of a European telephone and numbering space, the Commission has already carried out a study.
We found that a European regional code would allow companies conducting business throughout Europe to use a single telephone number.
This would introduce competition between operators as well as create pan-European services and markets.
Therefore the Commission cannot support the proposed Amendment No 31, which makes the implementation of ETNS subject to completion of a further study.
The proposals in Mr Harbour's report relating to "must carry" provisions reflect the importance and sensitivity of the area.
His suggestion for remuneration of network operators is a welcome balance of the interests at stake.
However, the Commission believes that other amendments to this article duplicate other provisions in the package and are therefore not necessary.
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are welcome in principle.
In conclusion, therefore, as far as amendments in the report are concerned, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 to 20, 22, 27, 29, 36, 38, 39, 46, 49, 53, 57, 58 and 60.
The Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 2, 5, 7, 9, 11 to 14, 18, 21, 23 to 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 41, 42, 44 to 47, 50, 52 and 54.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 34, 40, 43, 48, 51, 55, 56, 69, 61 and 62.
In conclusion, the fact that the Commission accepts 50 of the 62 amendments in full, in part or in principle, indicates a most agreeable parallelism of thinking between Parliament and the Commission, which is reflected in the discussions that are taking place in the Council.
This convergence between the three institutions follows from a sense of a shared vision and commitment to which the European Parliament has an opportunity to make an important contribution in its vote tomorrow.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Structural business statistics
The next item is the report (A5-0181/2001) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 concerning structural business statistics [COM(2001) 38 - C5-0031/01 - 2001/0023(COD)]
Madam President, on the basis of a 1996 regulation, Eurostat has been compiling structural business statistics in the industry, construction and trade sectors for five years.
Since 1998, these statistics have also included the area of insurance services.
The proposal before us also seeks to obtain structural statistics in the area of credit institutions, pension funds, other financial intermediation activities which are covered by investment companies, such as leasing companies, mortgage credit, consumer credit and lastly financial auxiliaries, such as brokers, portfolio management...the list is endless.
This list of areas allows you to see the importance of extending structural statistics, which will enable us to evaluate the development of the internal market in financial services, as well as the effect of the introduction of the single currency on the development of the internal market and on competitiveness and internationalisation of the sector.
Given all the years that we have spent in this House debating the single market in pension funds, and all the months that we have spent examining the first proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, I do not have to convince you of the need for us and other political decision-makers within the European Union to have reliable information in this area as well, such as information on the number of pension schemes, the number of businesses with members working in another country of the European Union, even within the European Economic Area, but also the number of members, by sex, of these funds or retirement institutions which complement the second pillar.
I have presented some amendments which received the unanimous blessing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to ensure that all these breakdowns will not be optional, as the Commission proposed, but that they are compulsory, and that the data regarding employment will also be broken down by sex, since I am a member of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and I now always try to take a mainstream approach in my reports with regard to these issues.
I do all this to make sure that we are not badly-informed political decision makers.
As you know, political decision-makers who are badly informed make bad judgments and take bad decisions.
The Commission' s proposal contains a second part, which seeks to add two additional variables on environmental protection expenditure, on structural statistics on industry, the construction and trade sectors.
Reliable information on investments in cleaner equipment and plant and current environmental protection expenditure will be broken down by domains; the protection of ambient air and the climate, waste water management, waste management and other activities relating to environmental protection.
Data on investments will be compiled yearly, whilst the total current expenditure will be compiled every three years.
I would like to point out that a long transitional period is also planned and that small businesses may, in general, be excluded from the studies, because their impact on environmental protection expenditure is minimal.
I would also like to add that the data compiled by Eurostat are also used for sustainable development indicators.
As for the financial sector, excessive additional costs should not be feared because much of the data has already been collated due to careful monitoring of these sectors.
For other sectors, it has been planned to introduce these activities on a very flexible basis.
The first obligatory reference year and the deadline for transmission will be determined at a later date in line with the commitology procedure, which we hardly support, but which, in this case, seems to be the most reasonable and is, therefore, perfectly acceptable.
Madam President, this is a useful, even indispensable proposal and it is reasonable with regard to collating data; it has been well prepared due to the pilot studies. I would like to congratulate Eurostat for all the preparation that has been done and I therefore believe, Madam President, that Parliament will be able to adopt my report in the safe knowledge that a good and swift piece of work has been done.
Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Lulling for her work.
I believe she has done an excellent job on a difficult technical issue which has allowed the presentation of amendments which, as has been said, affect all the basic elements of the Commission' s proposal and introduce a series of criteria which we agree with.
She has insisted on the need to introduce references to the internal market, and not only to globalisation, when discussing this objective; she has also commented on the need to highlight specific problems and, in this respect, also the distinction between sexes, which she believes to be a 'mainstreaming' issue.
I believe that is something more. It is also a fundamental source of information for analysing the labour market and for providing us with data which may be useful to us in the future.
In summary, she has improved on the Commission' s text.
Mrs Lulling has also referred to environmental issues.
She rightly says that it is true that the additional statistics may mean limited excess costs.
This is not always the case when new information is required, but it is true that the timescales proposed for this introduction are reasonably acceptable.
For this reason, the Commission considers that the proposal presented, and which it expects Parliament to approve, are useful and we are therefore going to support them before the Council, which will take the final decision, and we hope that it will accept the fundamental elements of it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Silicone breast implants
The next item is the report (A5-0186/2001) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the petitions declared admissible concerning silicone implants (Petitions Nos 470/98 and 771/98) [2001/2068(INI)]
Madam President, as you have mentioned, in 1998, the Committee on Pensions received two extremely important petitions.
The first was submitted by a Belgian national, on behalf of the Self-help Group for Women damaged by Silicone bearing about 1 000 signatures, and the second was submitted by a British citizen requesting a ban on silicone breast implants.
At the beginning of 1999, following a study, the Committee responsible sent a reply to these petitions which could be summed up as follows: the results of currently available scientific evidence do not seem to justify a ban of silicone implants.
Attached was information on the position of third countries and European Union Member States on this issue.
In March 2000, the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research, sent the Committee on Petitions a working document on silicone breast implants.
This information on the status of research, along with international references from medical institutes, scientific organisations, universities and the medical press etc. lead to the following conclusion: there is currently no definite answer to the question of whether silicone implants are the cause of inflammatory reactions which indirectly cause an auto-immune response.
In other words, there is currently no scientific evidence that women who have received breast implants are more susceptible than others to serious diseases, connective tissue diseases, and that they have an abnormal lymphatic response.
Given the complexity of the problem and without wishing to end the investigation into such distressing petitions, Parliament requested STOA to carry out an independent scientific study and, in May 2000, Doctor Moreno presented his conclusions, giving three options.
The first option was for a status quo and no ban.
The second option was an outright ban on silicone breast implants.
The third option was not for a complete ban, but the adoption and implementation of critical specific measures to develop and improve information for patients, tracking and surveillance, quality control and assurance and fundamental research.
The European Commission, the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities were asked for their opinion and they chose the third approach.
In March 2001, Mr Liikanen, the Commissioner, confirmed that the Commission was preparing a communication on silicone implants, with a particular view to strengthening European standards and surveillance, to introducing a system of patient consent and to undertaking research and development.
Lastly, on 29 May 2001, the Committee on Petitions, having taken into account the complaints by the petitioners and the opinions of the committees consulted, who I would also like to thank for their thorough work and for their help, adopted unanimously, on the basis of STOA' s third option, a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow in Parliament.
Its main recommendations are that all patients should have access to information free of charge, any advertising for breast implants should carry a health warning, surgical operations should be very strictly monitored, a database on implants should to be set up, research and development should be undertaken and there should be a ban on breast implants carried out for aesthetic reasons in patients under 18 years of age.
Madam President, this is the first time that the Committee on Petitions has presented a resolution to the House which is a direct result of requests from the citizens of the European Union.
The Committee on Petitions is pleased to have thus fulfilled its role of an active listening post for its citizens.
Madam President, it is very late, there are very few of us here and I guess all of us are very tired this evening, but actually we are striking a blow in this debate for a citizens' Europe.
In the report by Mrs Fourtou, whom I congratulate, the Committee on Petitions is for the first time bringing a specific petition to the floor of the European Parliament.
I also congratulate Mr Miller, who gave a great deal of support to the petitioners on this particular item.
We have demonstrated that by petitioning citizens can get an item debated on the floor of the European Parliament and that the Commission will come to Parliament, as indeed it came to the Petitions Committee.
I thank Commissioner Liikanen for the initiatives that he has put forward.
A scientific study was inaugurated under STOA, Parliament's assessment panel.
All this was achieved by the free opportunity that all citizens have across Europe to bring to their concerns before this European Parliament.
The outcome of this report is a good compromise and one which I hope will command universal support across the House tomorrow.
Having said that, it is important to remember that while some citizens come here with their particular concerns, there will be many others who perhaps have a different point of view.
Recently a very well-known celebrated TV presenter in the United Kingdom said to me: 'always remember that there are people who need breast implants'.
This lady herself had to have a mastectomy for preventative cancer reasons and she has had a very successful implant.
So she said: 'do not stop it; do make sure, however, that if there are to be implants, they are safe.'
In the proposals from the Women's Rights Committee, the Environment Committee and the Commission, we have a compromise that I am sure we can work with and will be good for Europe and for a citizens' Europe.
Mr President, over seven years ago a woman walked into my office in Glasgow.
She had been turned away by a wide variety of authorities - elected members and health authorities.
Nobody would listen to her. They treated her somewhat as an eccentric.
I sat down with her and over a period of about three-and-half hours she convinced me that there was a problem with the whole question of silicone and silicone implants.
The result of that conversation, over seven years ago, is that I am standing here tonight talking about it - not on behalf of Mr Miller, but on behalf of that woman and the hundreds of thousands of other women who have since joined together in a vast network, not just in Europe but throughout the world, to petition against the use of unsafe silicone implants.
It is a testament to the citizens of Europe that they can petition this Parliament and actually get heard.
This is the first time that I can remember an ordinary citizen raising an issue which has reached the floor of this Parliament.
I congratulate Parliament and the Petitions Committee.
As I said, this was not only down to Mr Miller, though I have pursued it through Parliament.
This has been down to the women themselves who have bravely fought against scorn and ridicule from a variety of sources and who have continued fighting their campaign against silicone implants.
That campaign has continued for years and they are still fighting.
Many of them believe that there should be a complete ban.
However, most of them recognise that at the moment there is not enough evidence to ban silicone implants so they are happy to settle, at this point in time, for stronger rules and regulations governing this whole question.
Regarding a couple of points in the report, I am glad to see the call for a ban on implants anyone under the age of 18 for cosmetic purposes.
When we talk about the quality of the implants we also have to talk about the safety of the implants.
I cannot stress that too strongly.
We talk about the information to prospective clients undergoing this operation.
That information has to be available from independent sources.
It is not good enough for that information to come from the surgeon carrying out the operation.
We also talk about registration.
We have to know the number of operations taking place. We have to know the clinics that are taking these people in.
We have to know what surgeons are carrying them out. Until we do so we will not fully realise the scale of this problem.
This is a tribute to Parliament, but moreover, this is a tribute to the thousands of women who have been fighting for years.
It has finally been recognised that there is a problem.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important issue, and it is important that we observe Community competence.
I am pleased that we have come to conclusions, having looked at ways to make implants safer.
My group supports these proposals.
At the same time, we would strongly defend the principle of subsidiarity and what is to be dealt with by Member States.
However, the proposal does not respect the prevailing principle of subsidiarity on all points, e.g. point 3 on the design of care.
I would also like to give a warning about systems of patient registers.
If I may take the country which I know best as an example, I can say that we have recently had a discussion because a large number of patients have been surprised at the fact that sensitive medical information has been recorded and then used in an unacceptable way.
Therefore, we cannot support what has been said about an EU-wide register, either.
This is something which each Member State must consider very, very carefully.
With regard to the age limit, we should perhaps avoid making this matter into something of a forbidden fruit.
By setting an age limit, I believe we are making it even more attractive.
It is a matter which we must take measures against in some other way.
I believe that many of us feel it is rather ridiculous and dangerous to have implants, but we should not decide about this at European level.
It has been extremely interesting to read the reports ordered by Parliament and the Commission.
I can only say that it is very difficult in practice to apply the precautionary principle.
I believe the reports on the entire issue have shown us this.
It can be seen, for example, that we have been on rather shaky ground when trying to introduce a total ban.
Madam President, I wish to express thanks to you, the rapporteur and my Scottish colleague, Bill Miller, for bringing matter before the Petitions Committee.
The issue of silicone gel breast implants is a sensitive one and this debate, as many have said this evening, is long overdue.
That is why we in the Environment Committee wanted to see access for all patients to free comprehensive information drawn up by independent experts, clear, bold health warnings in advertising, and an end to the before-and-after-pictures frequently used in women's magazines.
We in the Environment Committee believe that all breast implant operations should be recorded in the EU and that, as a result, manufacturers should supply only to surgeons who use such a register.
The cost of breast implants should include precare, independent advice, alternatives, a cooling-off period and post-care.
Finally, there should be comprehensive national lists of registered private clinics and trained plastic surgeons.
I am glad to see that he rapporteur has taken on much of the Environment Committee's opinion and I thank her for that.
Madam President, first of all I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on the way it has followed up the question on silicone breast implants, which was put to the Committee on Petitions, and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Fourtou.
I would say that I was privileged to take part in this procedure and I highly appreciate the respectful and professional way the committee dealt with the issue.
It gave a chance to the citizens to come with their serious problems and concerns.
The committee wanted to hear the scientific opinion on the issue, the experts, and then draw its conclusions.
This is a new departure for our institutions and I hope it will pave the way towards closing the gap between the citizens and the European institutions, a problem which faces all of us.
The draft resolution has a strong independent scientific basis in the report drawn up by Professor Moreno at the request of Parliament.
The draft rightly distinguishes between measures to be taken at Community level and those that should be taken mainly at national level as part of health and consumer policy.
The draft resolution reflects the consensus between our institutions and Member States, with whom we have been discussing the subject over the last few months and who share our concern to improve the situation that was highlighted in such an impressive way by the petitioners.
The Commission will adopt a communication on breast implants within the coming weeks, before the end of July.
It is now subject to internal Commission consultation procedures.
Our communication intends to reinforce the implementation of the medical device directive on issues such as conformity assessment, standardisation, monitoring, clinical data etc. It also addresses recommendations to Member States that fall under the chapter of health policy, in particular on the highly important issue of informed patient consent.
Women have a right to the fullest possible information regarding the risks and benefits of breast implants before surgery so that they can take a well-informed, deliberate decision.
The Commission services had a meeting with the representatives of the petitioners, in particular concerning informed patient consent and we received a number of useful suggestions.
The Commission's communication will be sent to Parliament as soon as it is adopted.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Madam President, I would like inform you and this House that two citizens of my country, from my region - Castilla y LeÃ³n - have been held captive in Georgia since 30 November of last year.
Mr JosÃ© Antonio TremiÃ±o GÃ³mez and Mr Francisco JesÃºs RodrÃ­guez Cabal, who travelled to that country six months ago, have been held in an unknown location since then, and there has been no information from any source there.
Madam President, I would ask you to take note of this serious problem, which affects these two European citizens and their families, so that you may urge the Georgian authorities to immediately locate and free these two Spaniards, who are being deprived of their main fundamental right; freedom.
Certainly, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
First, we will look into the matter closely and then we will, indeed, consider how we can help your compatriots.
Preparation for European Council (GÃ¶teborg 15/16 June 2001)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001.
I call Mrs Lindh, President-in-Office of the Council.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, almost half a year ago, I addressed Parliament for the first time on the subject of the Swedish Presidency' s goals.
Since then we have had an in-depth and constructive discussion on future issues for Europe, the three "E' s" of Enlargement, Employment, Environment, openness and reforms, crisis management and conflict prevention, the future, democracy, development and human rights.
Unfortunately, I must express my regret that Parliament has postponed the debate which we were to have had today on human rights, which was an important priority for the Swedish Presidency.
The issues surrounding the future of Europe will naturally also come up at the European Council in Gothenburg.
First, I would like to say something about enlargement - Europe' s historic undertaking and most important issue for the future.
The credibility of the entire European Union rests on the completion of our work programme which, six months ago, was seen to be highly ambitious, by some even unrealistic.
EU Common Positions have been adopted on all nine chapters which made up the Swedish Presidency' s road map, including several difficult issues such as the free movement of people, acquisition of property and, especially, the environment.
We have been able to complete the chapter on the free movement of people with two applicant countries and on movement of capital with seven applicant countries.
The environmental chapter has been completed with no fewer than four applicant countries.
We can therefore talk about real breakthroughs in the negotiations.
The whole internal market area has fallen into place. The four freedoms, fundamental to the EU, can now be implemented with a couple of countries.
We have also laid a sound foundation regarding central issues such as nuclear safety, food safety and land transport and completed chapters which were actually to be dealt with in the autumn according to our road map.
We will be holding open negotiations in all areas with some of the countries which started negotiating last year.
As such, we can confirm the principle of differentiation.
Each applicant country is assessed on its own merits and controls the pace of the negotiations.
We held ministerial meetings with all the applicant countries on Monday and Tuesday.
They were all very pleased with the progress achieved during the negotiations.
At the same time, we could see clear concern among them following the referendum in Ireland.
Naturally, I and many others are disappointed with the referendum result there, but it is therefore even more important that the work on ratifying the Treaty of Nice progresses, as it is the very foundation for the enlargement negotiations.
It is also that much more important that the membership negotiations with the applicant countries are taken forward without any let up in the pace.
The uncertainty which the referendum may have caused and spread to the applicant countries must be dealt with by our showing even more clearly that enlargement will continue.
The progress we have seen during negotiations with the applicant countries would not have been possible if these countries had not implemented major reforms and put a great deal of work into meeting our requirements.
It could make and of course is making pro-EU governments even more open to populist attack if there is a sense that enlargement is about to stall.
I believe that we must draw three conclusions following Nice.
Firstly, the Gothenburg Summit must give a clear signal that enlargement will move forward.
Secondly, we all have a responsibility to send a clear message that the Treaty of Nice will be implemented and ratification will continue in other countries.
Thirdly, we must all become better at making our citizens feel more connected with the EU.
On this matter, we can also use the debate on the future of Europe to open up a general debate on Europe, and we all have a responsibility in this respect.
We discussed the issues for the future here in Parliament most recently on 30 May.
I would just like to add that the report for Gothenburg describes all the initiatives from Member States, applicant countries and institutions, especially Parliament' s resolution of 31 May.
With regard to the continuing process, we can also state that many people are in favour of a convention in the preparatory stage.
Many are also of the opinion that such a convention should be combined with other measures.
This is also Sweden' s view, and we should like to be able to highlight this direction in Gothenburg.
However, the exact make-up must be dealt with in Laeken.
In Gothenburg, we will also be addressing the Swedish Presidency' s third "E" : Environment.
We will be taking some important steps to adapt EU policy to ecological development, sustainable in the long term, by establishing concrete targets, concrete measures and an effective monitoring process.
In this respect, we will be building further on the Commission report which proposes, for example, measures against climate change and health risks and for responsible handling of natural resources and improved transport systems.
The EU is, in fact, the only global power able to push forward environmental issues and sustainable development globally.
It is therefore also natural for climate issues and the Kyoto Protocol to be brought up at the Summit with the US president in Gothenburg, which we will be doing.
At the same time, we know that if we are to be able to play a leading global role, we also have to put our own house in order.
This is also true of other international issues on which the EU is now developing its instruments and becoming increasingly coordinated in its action in order to be able to exert influence.
As such, the common European security and defence policy, ESDP, is one of our most important processes.
Conflict prevention, civil crisis management and military crisis management are all brought together into a single unit.
We are adding to the positive development of the military area by also expanding civil crisis management with police, in the judicial area and with civil administration.
We have also developed work on preventing armed conflict.
The Gothenburg Summit will receive a report on progress within the ESDP and a European programme for conflict prevention.
In this work, the UN is our most important partner.
At a working lunch with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in May, we identified a number of priorities for cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management in which our growing military and civil capacity will constitute a major contribution to the UN.
We are strengthening our cooperation in the field through joint fact finding missions and cooperation between special representatives.
The Balkans, the Middle East and Africa are particular priorities.
Naturally, we are also developing cooperation with NATO, which we have been able to see especially in the current crises in Macedonia and Southern Serbia.
In Gothenburg, we will also be discussing important foreign policy issues, including the Middle East where the EU has been highly active.
Swedish Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson has visited the region and High Representative Javier Solana has made a large number of consultation visits and is expected to present a road map for the EU' s continued involvement and work in the Middle East at the Gothenburg Summit.
We will be discussing the Western Balkans, where developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, continue to cause concern.
On the Presidency' s behalf and in cooperation with Mr Solana, we have been active in keeping the coalition government together, isolating extremists, keeping the reform process for improving the status and rights of minorities going and continuing rapprochement with the EU.
However, as we all know, the situation remains critical.
In Southern Serbia, developments are more positive.
This is also an example of the way we can deal with conflicts through close cooperation between the EU and NATO.
We are approaching the end of our Presidency, but we have a great deal left to do and hope to take decisive steps at the Gothenburg Summit - on enlargement, jobs and the environment and the EU' s global role.
We intend to be proactive and know that, in all the issues which we discuss, we will need the active support of Parliament.
(Applause)
Madam President, Minister for Foreign Affairs, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, the European Council will meet in Gothenburg.
There are many items on the agenda but I intend to focus on just two of them: enlargement and sustainable development.
However, another very important subject will also be discussed in Gothenburg: the outcome of the referendum held by the Republic of Ireland on the ratification of the Nice Treaty.
Two days ago, the General Affairs Council discussed this matter and the 14 Member States adopted a statement.
I would like to make a few brief remarks on the subject.
While not wishing in any way to interfere in the sovereign decisions of the Irish people, I am personally deeply saddened by the outcome of the referendum.
However, the enlargement process must not be held up.
As I will say again in a few minute's time, it is a historical and political necessity.
The Commission will therefore continue to do its full duty to achieve this goal.
Nevertheless, there is a political lesson to be learned.
Every referendum tells a story.
However, despite the fact that the poor turnout makes it difficult to interpret the result, it cannot be denied that, in freely expressing their will, the Irish people have reminded us once again that our fellow citizens do not understand our method for revising the Treaties - the method used at Nice - and no longer want it.
They have told us so in the most democratic way possible - by voting - but they have also told us so by not voting, revealing the indifference and confusion they feel about the issue.
It is not enough to repeat, for the umpteenth time, that we need to communicate more and better with the citizens of Europe and that the real issues are often distorted or misunderstood.
That is not the point.
We need to take on board the lesson the citizens are teaching us.
I am therefore pleased to hear that Minister Lindh does not intend to propose a repeat performance of cliques of advisers and governments meeting behind closed doors at Gothenburg.
It is imperative that we stop this way of working.
(Applause)
Therefore, at Laeken, we must lose no time in marking out the only way forward acceptable to our citizens, which is to set up a structure which is representative of the States and the elected members of both national and European parliaments: a Convention which will work on revising the Treaties openly, in the clear light of day, fully reflecting the great debate which is now taking place in all the Member States.
We have been starting to talk about Europe again - I am glad to say - for six months now: let us do it properly!
The Commission is ready to make an active contribution to this structure.
Let me now return to my two original topics: sustainable development and enlargement.
I would like to outline what I hope the Summit will achieve in these two areas.
Firstly, sustainable development.
At Gothenburg, the Heads of State and Government will discuss a new policy line based on the Commission proposal, which represents a radical shift in our way of thinking.
Indeed, it uses the Lisbon strategy to create an ambitious, yet achievable process for sustainable development.
Our proposal is based on the premise that sustainable development is not just about the environment but about ensuring that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection progress hand in hand.
Far from being contradictory, economic, social and environmental objectives are actually complementary.
This is the core of the European model of society which we want to build and preserve for future European generations: if we do not do this it will be difficult to integrate Europe.
Our proposal brings these objectives together in a single, integrated strategy that seeks to find long-term solutions to the issues which are of real concern to our fellow citizens.
Let me give you just a few examples of what we want to achieve at Gothenburg.
As regards social policy, our proposed strategy incorporates all the targets set by the previous European Councils - at Lisbon and Stockholm - targets to modernise the social security system, to combat poverty and social exclusion and to deal with the problem of our ageing society.
As regards climate change, our aim is not simply to implement Kyoto but to go beyond it.
This will be a long-term process which cannot be decided all at once, but the line we are to take must be clear and consistent right from the very beginning.
As regards agricultural policy, we unambiguously restate the European Union's latest objectives, focusing now on high quality, healthy food production rather than quantity.
Our aim must be to satisfy consumers while, at the same time, taking full account of farmers' interests.
As regards transport policy, we intend to break the link between economic growth and the indiscriminate growth in road transport.
Enlargement makes action on all these fronts all the more urgent and every single citizen must be involved in making the changes happen.
The Members of this House have a vital role to play here: you have local roots and have close links with the regional and local authorities that will be primarily responsible for implementing sustainable development policy on the ground.
You are therefore in the ideal, crucial position to be able to explain and discuss the initiatives and to facilitate their implementation.
This strategy for sustainable development is essential if we are to bring about a balanced, just society in Europe.
We Europeans - and I would stress this - are right to be proud of our social model, although we do seem to have lost the thread rather in recent years have ceased to be proud of it, but this may well be a reason why we need to modernise it so that it will work for future generations.
Moreover, the future of our planet depends on sustainable global development, and the best way for the European Union to promote this is to implement our proposals and lead by example.
Even the other continents look to us, although this may not always be apparent.
Moving on to my second subject: enlargement.
I have never ceased to stress that enlargement is our historic duty: the duty of my Commission, of course, but also, in my view, the duty of Parliament.
It must happen now for the time is ripe.
The single market, the introduction of the euro, the now tangible fruit of the reform of our public finances and the progress we are making in economic and social reform all combine to make this a very opportune moment for enlargement.
We must therefore make every effort to complete the process swiftly.
The Commission is conducting the accession negotiations responsibly and rigorously, fulfilling its mandate from the Council.
Its impartial, institutional role ensures that the process is not thrown off course by short-term political considerations.
We are keeping to the principles of differentiation and progress according to merit, allowing countries that began negotiating in 2000 to catch up with those that began earlier.
We are scrupulously following the road map drawn up last year and endorsed at Nice, and I am pleased to report that excellent progress has been made.
Moreover, I am truly grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the impetus it has given to these negotiations and for the contribution it has made to them.
The road map is therefore appropriate and must be continued.
Thus, I have every reason to believe that we will succeed in concluding negotiations with the best-prepared candidates by the end of 2002 and complete ratification in time for the European elections in 2004.
The Gothenburg Council should therefore note our progress and lay down the necessary guidelines for completing the negotiations.
The most sensitive chapters are now open. Basically, there are four of them: the environment, the free movement of persons, capital and services, the Structural Funds and agriculture.
I have listed them in ascending order of the difficulties they pose.
These are undoubtedly complex areas, but it is now clear that, in some cases, transitional periods will help to overcome some of the difficulties.
The Commission is therefore ready to propose the necessary technical solutions and the necessary political compromises.
What is needed now is flexibility on the part of all the negotiators and a strong political commitment to reaching agreement even in the most sensitive areas.
Flexibility and good sense now appear to be the qualities we most need on both sides of the table.
Ladies and gentlemen, the need for public support is clear.
Enlargement will increase the Union's population by 30%.
It will also be a much more diverse Union in many ways, and it will share extensive borders with large countries such as Russia and Ukraine.
Many of our fellow citizens are apprehensive about how all this will affect their daily lives - about its impact on employment, the environment, immigration and law and order.
The Members of this House have the crucial task of reassuring the citizens, explaining the problems calmly and objectively but also explaining the great benefits they will draw from the project to unify Europe.
Enlargement will be the driving force of our economy and the labour market for the whole of the next generation.
It will also be our one means of controlling the scourges that disregard national borders such as organised crime and the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings.
Together, we can do more and do it better.
The enlarged Union will be a stronger and more influential actor on the world's stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is not just a technical process and we must never allow ourselves to become so engrossed in the technicalities that we lose the overall vision.
The vision of the Europe that our children and grandchildren can inherit is a common future in a Union which will stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean.
But this is not all.
I want us to think in terms of a continent-wide Community of peaceful nations, consisting of the enlarged European Union and all its new neighbours, increasingly sharing common values and objectives.
This is not just a dream: the process has already begun, facilitated, as I said, by the Swedish Presidency's major contribution.
In Moscow, last month, the leaders of the Russian Federation and the European Union agreed to begin work on creating a common European economic area. They began to examine the real possibility of adopting the euro, in the future, for their commercial and financial transactions.
We intend, at the same time, to pursue a similar strategy towards Ukraine.
On this basis, the enlarged European Union and its neighbours will be able to find common solutions to common problems in areas such as transport, energy and the environment, research, development, immigration and the fight against organised crime.
Only a wider Community of the kind we are building can enjoy lasting peace, prosperity and stability.
Ladies and gentlemen, enlargement and sustainability are thus the two keys to Europe's future.
I am confident that you share my vision of that future and I am equally confident that Gothenburg will enable us to take significant steps towards making that vision a reality.
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. Because of the referendum in Ireland, the summit in Gothenburg will be even more important than we thought it would.
As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we think that, because of the present uncertainties, because of the confusion, because the central European countries are worried about their membership, the message to come out of Gothenburg must be that the central European countries are welcome in the European Union and that the enlargement of the European Union is now our top priority.
And we must say as much, loud and clear, to the people of central Europe.
Our group has long favoured the first new countries' being able to take part in the next European elections in 2004, and rightly so.
We must send out this message.
We must also be flexible.
We are currently debating the Structural Funds.
Some people want to keep everything they had in the past.
Others want to do away with the Structural Funds altogether.
The PPE-DE Group believes that those most in need deserve our solidarity, which is why we shall continue to need the Structural Funds in the future and why they must focus on the countries in the future European Union which are worst off.
Solidarity should not just be a slogan; it should be manifested in the form of specific deeds.
Yesterday I had a most impressive conversation, together with numerous colleagues from my group, with Bishop Alfons Nossol from Oppeln, formerly in Silesia and now part of Poland.
A minority of 300 000 people live there.
Since the demise of Communism in Poland, this minority has been able to worship in both their own and the Polish language.
These people in Poland, like the Hungarians in Slovakia or Romania, are looking towards Europe, hoping that we will not slam the door to our community of values in the European Union in their face and that we shall say: you are welcome, provided that you have set up the conditions needed by our community of values.
(Applause)
We also need to be flexible when it comes to freedom of movement, so that we do not create structures which are offensive to the central European countries.
Naturally, we need solutions that serve the interests of the European Union, but they must also be in the interests of the candidate countries.
I suggest that we make an effort to guarantee the flexibility needed here.
Now to Ireland. I think we should guard against meting out swift advice to Ireland.
It is up to the Irish government now to show the way forward.
In particular, I urge the larger Member States of the European Union, which have often erred in the past by thinking they could dictate to the small Member States, to hold back to start with and at least let Ireland respond.
Then we shall see what needs to be done.
(Applause)
Madam President-in-Office, you said - and it was music to my ears - that the Swedish presidency is now in favour of a convention.
We have come a long way together.
But please fight for it, especially if you fail to muster complete support.
Of course, the decisions will be taken under the Belgian presidency.
But if you are in favour of openness and transparency and two or three governments voice their opposition, name them openly so that they are forced to justify their opposition.
(Applause)
The American president, George Bush, will be in Gothenburg.
Our group values partnership and friendship with America.
We greet the American president and welcome him to Europe.
But having numerous common interests does not mean that we do not have differing views on several counts.
I urge you, Madam President-in-Office, and of course you too, Mr President of the Commission, to state in a measured but decisive manner that we Europeans want the Kyoto protocol and the reduction of emissions to be a success.
We urge you to represent this position clearly.
(Noise, heckling)
But I also say - one fellow member is famous for his heckling and I accept it gladly - that we do of course expect solidarity between Europeans and I am proud of the fact that it is our group, the governments which belong to us, which will be clearly expressing European solidarity in Gothenburg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
(Applause) Were it any other way, you would hear our voice.
But, with your leave, Madam President, one last word.
The American president is right on one count when it comes to reducing emissions. If nuclear energy is safe, it cannot be excluded from a reasonable energy mix.
That is why he is right on this count.
We do not think that nuclear energy, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, should be universally disparaged on ideological grounds, unlike numerous Socialist and other members.
(Applause)
Allow me to close by saying that it is developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which concern us most at present.
Madam President-in-Office, I urge you to continue your efforts, as you have in the past with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, to bring about a peaceful solution.
We cannot afford to fail here, and the fact that today's visit by the president of Macedonia, of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been called off should set the alarm bells ringing here.
I urge you to continue in your efforts to bring about peace, because if we are successful here, it will be a success for the European Union as a whole and a contribution towards a peaceful, free Europe.
Please help to bring it about.
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her assessment of the Swedish Presidency.
Sweden has proved herself and her Presidency has been successful in many areas.
I would like to stress that you have acted transparently, graciously and amicably towards Parliament.
With you, we have been able to begin to update our relations with the Council, which were still at the level of the Single European Act - I am referring to codecision and the presence of the Council in plenary sittings - I believe that this should be welcomed as a positive step in our relations.
Like you, I regret that lack of time has meant that we have not been able to hold the debate on human rights today, but, in any event, human rights are a permanent element of our political commitment.
I would especially like to highlight the progress made in relation to sustainable development and in the social field, one very important element of which has been, after twenty years, to unblock the directive on information and the participation of workers.
With regard to the Gothenburg Summit, we are all reeling from the shock of the Irish referendum, which is a significant wake-up call.
The French National Assembly yesterday ratified the Treaty of Nice.
France has always been a very colourful and controversial country, but this ratification has not attracted our attention.
However, in the case of Ireland, I believe that two issues arise which we must examine.
The current members of the Union and those of the enlarged Union, because that is now our perspective, must re-affirm the terms in which we see our common destiny.
This means, as from the beginning of this European Union process, that we have to find a balance between our interests - or if you like, our egotism - and solidarity between all of us.
I believe that that is what is in question and that is what we have to address very directly to all the Europeans.
Therefore, on behalf of my Group, I have asked the President of the Commission for a Commission statement on economic and social cohesion and enlargement.
Because it is not simply a question of discussing whether the Structural Funds are maintained for some and not for others, but rather of finding out, firstly, how we can all contribute, and the President of the Commission has recently talked about the suitability of a European tax.
The people pay, but they do not know what they are paying and it would be a good thing, from a democratic point of view, to relate funding to citizenship.
Then we would have to consider how we can strengthen cohesion and solidarity between all of us on the basis of the principles in the Treaties.
I believe that this requires the Commission to participate, by exercising its responsibility and its right of initiative.
Secondly, I will refer to the conclusions which you have presented to the Council.
In my relatively long political experience within the European Union, this is the first time that we have proposed conclusions to the Council which the normal citizen can read, because they are generally written in what the French call langue de bois, a totally cryptic style.
The proposal of the French Presidency does justice to what the European Parliament has said, to what the COSAC has said, and there is explicit support for the convention method - you are prudent and talk about a 'forum' .
However, in any event, I would like to say that if you see to it that we make progress in this direction, I believe that we can finally put an end to negotiation behind closed doors and move on to the democratic method by means of which all the constitutions of the Member States of the European Union are created, that is to say, openly and publicly, which, at this point in history, means via the Internet and the television.
That is how things are done.
Therefore, Madam President, I hope that you will make sure that the approach taken at the Gothenburg Summit, and consolidated at Laeken, will be one on which the European Parliaments, those of the Member States, the Governments and the Commission can all work together.
In that way we will be able to engage all of our people.
Madam President, I would like to make a final comment about the visit of President Bush.
The transatlantic relationship is a constitutional relationship, which is fundamental to both the United States and Europe and, indeed, to the whole world.
Now, we cannot hide our profound differences at the moment, which relate not only to the value of international commitments at world level, but to combating such an important factor as climate change.
We can make appeals for solidarity, but I would ask Mr Poettering to work with the current and future governments of his family, because it is not they who are supporting a united European position.
In relation to the anti-missile shield, to build new missiles can only lead to a return of the arms race.
In this respect also I would ask Mr Poettering to speak with his political friends in the governments in order to achieve a process of reducing tension, which is essential to the future of humanity.
Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to begin by acknowledging and congratulating the minister on the considerable number of actual results achieved by the Swedish presidency already, even before it formally concludes its work.
In particular, you are to be congratulated on the work and enthusiasm that you have put into the enlargement issue.
Your approach has been a breath of fresh air and will, I hope, reassure the candidate countries that we are indeed serious about this issue and have demonstrated as much during the Swedish presidency.
I also acknowledge and salute the defence which you, together with the European Commission, have mounted on the climate-change issue.
It is important that, in the transatlantic dialogue, we continue to champion the values and the desire for sustainability that we all share and believe in.
Your personal efforts and the work with the High Representative, Commissioner Patten and others, particularly in Macedonia, where the situation remains so explosive and difficult, show impressive commitment towards pressing ahead with a common foreign and security policy.
All of these areas and, of course, the work you have undertaken with the European Parliament on enhancing transparency, should be recognised as matters of importance and substance.
I acknowledge, of course, as you have reported, the heightened anxieties of the representatives of the candidate countries following the Irish "no" to Nice.
It is very important for me to state here today, particularly as an Irish European, that whatever the complex set of motives and reasons behind it, the "no" to Nice did not signify a "no" to enlargement.
Neither the "no" campaign nor the "yes" campaign made an issue of enlargement.
Indeed, it could be helpful before GÃ¶teborg - if it has not already done so - for the Irish "no" campaign as a whole to issue a single joint statement making it clear that their "no" campaign was not pushing for a "no" to enlargement.
I would encourage the minister to continue working towards a reassuring timetable in GÃ¶teborg.
Perhaps the shock of the Irish result will motivate those who a week or two ago were wondering whether this was necessary.
It has become more necessary now to reassure, act and deliver on the enlargement agenda.
With regard to the Irish result, I should like to make one or two detailed comments.
Members may be interested to learn that 50 000 fewer people in the Irish electorate voted "no" to Nice than voted "no" to Amsterdam.
The number of "no" voters in Ireland has not grown.
The critical question in Ireland is this: why did those who would normally have voted "yes" stay at home?
That is a serious issue.
Yet the number of "no" votes was smaller than before, not larger, and so in this regard we should retain a sense of proportion.
I welcome the fact that the Irish Government is now going to establish a national forum on Europe to encourage everyone to reflect sensibly on the challenge, the message and the means of reconnecting people with the European vision.
After that there will eventually be a second referendum.
It is important that we have this period of deep reflection.
I take note of what has been said in the General Affairs Council, namely that the Council will continue with the ratification process.
Indeed, paradoxically, the Danish instrument of ratification of Nice will be lodged in Rome today; the French, as we have heard, have also ratified the Treaty.
I hope that in GÃ¶teborg the Council will find the wisdom lacking in the statement of the General Affairs Council to include the European Commission in the search for a way forward.
In Ireland the Commission is regarded as an honest broker - someone who can always help when there are delicate textual and substantial political issues to be considered.
In conclusion, the real message that must emerge from GÃ¶teborg before all others - the first among equals of messages - should be clearly addressed to the candidate countries, and say: we are ready to do business.
I would ask the President-in-Office to continue to champion this issue and emphasise it consistently in GÃ¶teborg, especially with a view to enabling the Irish to say "yes" to enlargement there.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I would firstly like to draw attention to President-in-Office Anna Lindh' s statement that it was a pity not to be able to discuss human rights here today.
I also welcome chairman BarÃ³n Crespo' s small penance, when he regretted that this discussion could not take place today.
This is a very great pity as I know that Sweden is very dedicated to human rights policy and now this opportunity to enter into dialogue with Sweden has unfortunately passed.
Madam President, to my group Gothenburg is above all a summit on sustainable development.
We have waited for this for a long time and we do not want to lose this opportunity.
The theme of sustainable development must not be overshadowed by a prominent guest but must now be taken seriously.
In this context I must make a personal confession.
I was a little impatient when the Commission did not seem to be preparing its own proposal on sustainable development and in conjunction with the Stockholm Summit I said that President of the Commission Romano Prodi was ecologically illiterate.
Now I have to take back that statement as I have got to know the President of the Commission' s ideas on sustainable development and consider them to be very valuable.
He is proposing binding targets and he is ready to commit to binding action in order, for example, to break the link between economic growth and growth in traffic.
But unfortunately there is a risk that the summit will not be able to achieve this, i.e. set quantitative targets.
Here I am perhaps a little disappointed with the efforts of Sweden as the holder of the presidency, which could have taken things further.
The Kyoto Protocol is absolutely the key issue in Gothenburg.
I welcome the fact that President of the Commission Romano Prodi wishes to hold a discussion which already looks at the period after the goals of Kyoto have been achieved.
I disagree entirely with Mr Poettering, when he says that nuclear power must be included in the range of options.
There is no more out-of-date technology than this and I would like to warn against nuclear power enjoying a second coming in the guise of climate policy.
My group says a definitive no to this trend.
We want to focus on the alternatives.
Enlargement is also on the agenda at Gothenburg and my group would certainly like to emphasise that enlargement must continue irrespective of the result of the Irish referendum.
It must be clearly stated and signalled to the candidate countries that the Irish people in no way wanted to reject enlargement.
In my opinion, the result of the Irish referendum cannot, however, be ignored by thinking that we can continue as if nothing has happened. Instead it should be taken as a clear signal that the European Union must be democratised and citizens must be able to take part in drawing up constitutional issues.
These can no longer be addressed behind closed doors.
For this reason, we must make haste in adopting this convention model so that we are able to reach decisions on it before Laeken.
This means that candidate countries too must be able to be fully included in this process.
We need more democracy, more referendums, and more participation not less.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is too soon for any exhaustive analysis of the Irish 'no' to the Treaty of Nice.
Yet it is possible to make a few comments on it without too much risk of being mistaken.
The first concerns the official reactions to this bombshell, which took all the leading European figures by surprise.
In Luxembourg this Monday, the ministers apparently devoted half an hour or so to this event, which one of them described as merely a hiccup.
That is what I would call burying one' s head in the sand.
Surely the minister must realise that this rejection represents a new and serious symptom of the crisis that is profoundly undermining European integration.
Nearly three quarters of the Irish population said 'yes' to the Community when their country joined in 1972 and today the same proportion is refusing to say 'yes' to the EU Treaty of Nice - yet the national and European leaders did not even see it coming.
We are facing a problem that looms far larger than Nice and Ireland.
There were other warnings of the Irish 'no' , in particular the growing rate of abstention in nearly all the EU countries at the European elections. In my view, and this is my second comment, that 'no' vote is first and foremost the price of building Europe without the citizens and at a distance from them.
Where are the wide-ranging public and pluralist debates, at which everyone lays their cards on the table, on the issues at stake, the difficulties to be overcome, the values to be upheld and, finally, on the political choices that need to be made completely transparently and democratically?
There is one example that has a direct bearing on what happened in Ireland. At the summit, the states concocted, at breakneck speed, a defence Europe with imprecisely defined missions and which public opinion, in general, regards as unlikely to be independent.
They often glorified this new achievement in tones that the neutral countries in particular, although others too, perceived as militaristic.
So this backlash is hardly surprising.
The same applies in other areas, especially the economic and social area.
What are we to think of those leaders of the richest countries who nonchalantly cultivate the net contributor syndrome and raise the spectre of the renationalisation of agricultural aid and the Structural Funds, thereby fuelling the pernicious 'each for himself' trend?
At the same time, the federalist overstatement of the ongoing institutional debate has played its part in creating confusion in countries that want to protect their place, their role and their identity in a future large complex of which they can perceive neither the nature nor the contours.
Added to that, there is the less than engaging spectacle that the Fifteen offered the public in Nice, so that it is not surprising to find a general feeling of disenchantment if not the return of a populist and inward-looking trend.
That brings me to my third and final comment on a question everyone is asking: what should we do now?
First, in my view, we must respect the rules of democracy.
Whether we like it or not, the Treaty has not been ratified unanimously and we will have to make some improvements to it.
Next, this time we would do well to hold an in-depth debate with the citizens of all our countries on the kind of Europe to build and on the political, institutional and financial implications of our decisions.
Lastly, we must not let our opponents, who are ashamed of enlargement, use this crisis as a pretext to defer to an unknown date this pan-European project that is potentially great and splendid, but is obviously also complex and costly.
Here too, we need a responsible debate so that we can evaluate, in the clear light of day, the conditions under which we can all succeed. Just as there can be no ambition without effort, there can be no European project without solidarity.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to the Swedish presidency on the tremendous successes it has achieved on behalf of us all.
The European leaders in GÃ¶teborg will address two primary subjects, namely the enlargement of the European Union and how best to solve many of our environmental problems.
With regard to enlargement, it is most important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters, which to date have remained closed.
It is in the interest of all the contracting parties that the bottom-line issues that remain outstanding are debated, resolved and finalised.
I would like to make a few comments concerning the outcome of the recent Irish referendum, that was held on the Nice Treaty.
I am very disappointed at the result of this referendum in Ireland but I fully respect the outcome of this democratic process.
I welcome the conclusions of this week's Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers; they too stated that the will of the Irish people must be respected.
I firmly believe that the vast majority of the Irish people are committed to the enlargement process and I do not want to see the timeframe for the enlargement of the European Union to include countries from Eastern and Central Europe delayed as a direct consequence of the decision of the Irish people last week.
In Ireland we need time now to reflect upon this result in a calm and reasoned manner.
Ireland's future relationship with the European Union is a critically important matter.
Time for deliberation will be needed if we are to address the complex issues and concerns which arose during the referendum debate.
This referendum undoubtedly underlines the need for greater efforts to be made by all of us to explain European Union policies to our citizens and to involve the citizens of the EU more thoroughly in the debate about the Union's role and its future direction.
There are lessons for us all to learn from the results of the Nice Treaty referendum.
It is incumbent on the Commission and all the 15 governments of the Union also to reflect upon this result.
We must build a European Union that commands the good will and support and enthusiasm of the 370 million citizens who make up the membership of the Union.
I very much welcome the decision of the Irish Government, which last night established a national forum on Europe.
This forum will undertake the process of consultation and dialogue on EU policy with the Irish public on matters of concern to them.
This forum is also part of the debate on the overall future of Europe that is ongoing in all 15 Member States of the European Union in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
All political parties, the social partners and other interested parties will be represented on this forum, which is expected to begin its work very shortly.
Another very important matter is that Mr Bush, the President of the United States, will be in GÃ¶teborg later this week to meet EU leaders.
It is very timely, therefore, that this summit will be addressing key environmental issues which need to be tackled, both within the Union and in a more global context.
I was very disappointed when President Bush earlier this year stated that he wanted to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord.
The fact of the matter is that we need to reduce the level of greenhouse gases that are being produced in Europe and in the United States.
This is very important if we are to ensure a halt to the depletion of the ozone layer.
Madam President, the august Danish publication, 'Ugebrevet Mandag Morgen' has a leader with the headline, 'Thank you, Ireland!'
According to this leader, 'To try to get the Irish to change their opinion would be completely contrary to all the EU promises about the need for a wider public debate and for grassroots support.
The EU countries have jointly and unanimously decided upon the ground rules which clearly state that a treaty only comes into force once it has been ratified by all the Member States.
Following the Irish 'no' vote, Ireland cannot and should not ratify the Treaty of Nice.'
How can the foreign ministers simply let the ratifications continue?
The Treaty of Nice has come to nothing.
It is a constitutional violation to ignore a binding referendum, and it is contrary to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the principle of the rule of law.
We call upon all countries at least to take a break from the ratification procedure and to reflect upon the reasons for the 'no' vote.
It was not, of course, a specifically Irish 'no' .
We would also see a majority of 'no' votes in other countries, if the latter dared to hold referenda.
Nice is not, at heart, about enlargement but about shifting power from electors and elected representatives to officials and ministers.
Why should the electorate vote in favour of less influence?
Nor has the European Parliament been fulsome in its praise for Nice.
The initial judgement of the voters is: Try again!
Next time, the negotiations must be bottom-up instead of top-down.
The Irish 'no' vote was presented in the press as a 'no' to enlargement, even though the 'no' side too had said that the enlargement negotiations should continue.
Five countries may be admitted under the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the next group of countries on the basis of the places and number of votes stated in the Summit declaration.
The Treaty of Nice is only relevant to the 27th applicant country, and we are deprived of the right to a Commissioner.
There is nothing else about enlargement in the Treaty.
The declaration is a common position and not a part of the Treaty, and it has not therefore been thrown out in the referendum.
Let us now, rather, slim down the EU and create open, democratic cooperation that is close to the people.
I congratulate the Irish people on a courageous 'no' vote and call upon the Gothenburg Summit to respect the people' s choice instead of ignoring a referendum.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I will restrict myself to expounding three points.
Firstly, the environment: the Radical Party has been raising the matter of the greenhouse effect, the hole in the ozone layer and the related dangers for over 15 years now.
We feel that it is especially important that this matter is tackled resolutely and thoroughly in Gothenburg - as the Swedish Presidency intends to do - in the presence of President Bush as well.
Parliament will express its opinion later on and we shall see the political groupings going to the defence of the Kyoto Protocol.
We feel that it would, if necessary, still be possible to look into improving and fine-tuning the approach and objectives to be followed in order to avoid breaking the ties with our American allies, although they are the primary polluters of the planet, but we must certainly not give in to the temptation to perform further studies.
There is nothing left to analyse: studies have been carried out and they show that the planet is in danger and that it is therefore necessary to act and do so quickly.
The European countries should therefore put their hands on their hearts too and turn words into action.
I would also, Madam President, like to talk about transparency.
You have attached great importance to transparency, and so I have two questions.
The Irish referendum has shown that the system is absurd.
We cannot negotiate over Gothenburg or Nice in the same way that we negotiated over Westphalia when Swedish and other troops were fighting the 30 Years War.
Diplomatic negotiations have had their day: a European Union must be negotiated between citizens, between members of parliament, between players in internal affairs within our Union.
The Swedish Presidency could give the signal for this to happen.
Lastly, Madam President, I would just like to say a few brief words about the agencies.
Mr Persson is in danger of messing up in true southern Italian style if he distributes all the responsibilities at Gothenburg, maybe giving the Food Agency to Helsinki, to a country which, I would argue, is the least suitable location for it.
Practise transparency in this as well and, if time runs short, carry the issue over to the next summit to allow time for a more public, more open debate on the location of these major European agencies.
Mr President, the foreign ministers of the EU countries who chose to continue with the ratification of the Treaty of Nice on Monday, as though the Irish had never said 'no' in the referendum, opted for the worst solution.
In fact this risks confirming the view of many people that the European institutions under construction are deaf to the citizens' demands and that in the final analysis, beneath the ideological disguises, their real purpose is to confiscate the powers of the people.
The 'no' vote in the Irish referendum, like the 'no' vote in the Danish referendum last September, is a warning.
The people are turning away from a Europe in which they cannot recognise themselves.
To speed up federalism under these conditions would be the quick road to ruin.
The Gothenburg Council may still have a chance of getting things back on an even keel.
What should it decide?
First, it should decide to suspend the ratification of Nice by cancelling the General Affairs Council' s conclusions of Monday.
Secondly, it should send a strong signal to the candidate states, inviting them to join the Union immediately, without any additional treaty, by acceding to the intergovernmental part of the existing treaties.
It should then announce that the supplementary provisions on enlargement will be incorporated in the accession treaties.
Finally, it should convene another intergovernmental conference, this time with the objective of establishing a Europe that respects its nations.
This IGC would have to be based above all on the national parliaments and not on the new confiscation-based structure that is being invented just now.
That is what we propose in our counter-report on the Treaty of Nice.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned about the result in Ireland.
It is a victory for those who wish to stop and say no.
Referendums encourage short-term, self-interested views rather than long-term acceptance of responsibility.
As Europe stands on the brink of a highly successful age, its citizens are vacillating.
Reunification can increase freedom, security and opportunities and we can show solidarity with people who have suffered under Communist oppression and the destruction caused by a planned economy.
However, reunification is just as important to us, as enlargement is not only a historical responsibility but also a necessary injection and a win-win situation.
In Gothenburg the EU Heads of State and Government must therefore now set a deadline for enlargement and ensure that its road map is confirmed politically.
This is the clear message which I believe is needed.
But we should also examine ourselves.
Citizens, not only in Ireland, are questioning what the EU is doing.
We are poor at explaining the heart and the successes of European cooperation.
Many people wish to foist tasks on the EU which can better be dealt with domestically.
This threatens self-determination, while at the same the EU' s fundamental task of increasing freedom, ensuring peace, opening up markets and breaking down trade barriers becomes neglected.
Enlargement and expansion of the European Union requires focus, consistency and commitment from all those interested in making Europe a success.
There is another summit being held.
Sweden believes the summit with the US is a significant event and one that is important to the EU.
The leadership must focus on what unites us.
Understanding the interests of the US may ensure Europe' s reunification and ability to manage crises.
Working with the US to ensure peace and increased free trade must be the primary task.
George W. Bush is good for the US and good for Europe, and we welcome him to Europe.
I hope that both summits achieve concrete results and wish everyone the best of luck.
I would like to add my congratulations to the foreign ministers for ensuring that the Presidency' s six months, which started out looking rather grey will seemingly end a little more on the light blue side.
Mr President, the Gothenburg Summit will round off the Swedish Presidency which, as was mentioned previously, had an ambitious programme.
I would like to give the Swedish government full marks for its work.
I would like to talk about something not on the programme for Gothenburg and that is one of the "E' s" - Employment - which was tackled at the Stockholm Summit in March, but which was supplemented in the social area this week with a hat trick of successes at the last moment.
I would say that it was perhaps one of the most successful Council meetings in terms of social issues, as the Council managed to solve three issues: the issues of noise, equal treatment and, especially, informing and consulting employees.
The work carried out was excellent and important for the EU' s ongoing social initiatives.
I would also like to mention sustainable development and link it to the social issues, as much of the debate has centred on sustainable development and ecological issues.
This is the way it should be, but there is also a social dimension.
We have the issues of social cohesion between people and creating policies which reduce the divisions in Europe, not least the divisions between the generations.
We also have the issues of pension systems and how they will be developed in the future, and reducing the divisions between regions.
All this is required for sustainable development.
We need an economic policy which is not simply focused on short-term growth, but also on long-term growth.
Therefore, the ecological aspects must be included in all areas.
They must have an impact on transport policy, energy policy and agricultural policy as we develop a society sustainable in the long term.
The ecological aspects must also have an impact on us globally.
Internally, we will succeed in this through the methods we have used so far, but also through augmenting the Lisbon Process, by making the ecological aspects part of the process we already have in the social and economic areas.
But we must also act globally.
One opportunity will be the Gothenburg Summit and the summit with Mr Bush, at which the EU must stand its ground with regard to the Kyoto Protocol.
Of course, we want the US on board, but the EU must take the lead here. Even if the US does not want this, the EU must take the lead globally on this issue.
We must also focus on these issues with regard to trade agreements with the WTO by adding ecological and social aspects to the development of global trade.
Finally, I want to say something about the most important of the three "E' s" , which is undoubtedly Enlargement.
This is an historic opportunity which we must not let slip through our fingers.
I therefore share the view put forward by many others that, after what happened in Ireland, we must be even clearer in our dealings with the applicant countries.
The enlargement process must continue, we must set deadlines with the aim of applicant countries being ready to take part in European Parliament elections in 2004.
This must be clarified so that the first countries can join.
Each country must join on its own merits and as few exceptions and transposition periods as possible must be requested in as few areas as possible.
Sweden has achieved a great deal of success during its Presidency.
Now the focus must be on further progress and building on this legacy.
Finally, I would also like to say something about the common European foreign and security policy, on which the Presidency has worked very well and for which Sweden has received great praise.
Anna Lindh in particular has succeeded in positioning Sweden as a leading nation in this process by introducing preventive measures.
The fact that we now have a leading role in world politics, in the Middle East, Korea, etc., is to a large extent thanks to the work of Anna Lindh, for which I would like to thank her.
I believe that it was good to be so clear on the issue of a convention.
As it supports openness, Sweden must also support a convention, but not as the only method, but as one method of preparing intergovernmental negotiations next time.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to start on a completely personal note by thanking Mrs Lindh for the job she and Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten have done in Macedonia.
As a war baby, I am very conscious of the fact that peace is not celebrated with parades and that the arduous everyday work of maintaining peace does not gain huge headlines.
War is better in a media society.
However, I would like to thank Mrs Lindh for her excellent work so far.
The main theme of Gothenburg will be sustainable development, and in this context the Kyoto Protocol will be brought up.
President Bush is coming to Gothenburg.
Should those in power in Europe, including myself, not "put their own house in order" first?
Within the EU, we subsidise energy systems which produce the highest levels of carbon dioxide.
Should we not first, or perhaps at the same time, do something about this?
It is easier to negotiate once one has "put ones own house in order" .
The other major environmental problem in Europe is traffic.
There is also an EU project to create a good, environmentally friendly infrastructure in Europe.
The third and perhaps one of our greatest environmental problems is the common agricultural policy.
We are putting a little over EUR 40 billion into this area.
Around 5 billion of that will go into preserving cultural heritage and biodiversity, the rest is highly counterproductive from the point of view of the environment, so let us "put our own house in order" as we move forward.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, many important issues have been squeezed onto the agenda at the Summit: enlargement, the Middle East, a possible new WTO round, and so forth.
Remember that this summit was launched as the first 'green' summit.
Thirty years after the UN Environmental Conference in Stockholm and ten years after the UN Earth Summit in Rio, the Heads of State and Government have a historic opportunity, an undertaking and a responsibility to adopt a credible strategy for sustainable development for the EU.
However, this strategy must also form the basis for further global environmental responsibility and undertakings ahead of Rio+10 in South Africa.
The Commission' s proposal is an important first step, I would say a minimum step.
Much, much more is needed in order to achieve a real breakthrough for sustainable development.
Major changes must be made in economic policy, transport and energy policy, chemicals policy, and agricultural and fisheries policy.
As faith in the EU fades, as was shown in Ireland' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice, a fundamental debate is required on the future of Europe, a debate without preconditions in which European civil society can take part.
The summit must stake out such a path.
The summit not leading to a credible result on sustainable development would be another setback.
There must be a good result.
It is not just about us but about future generations.
I wish the summit well and hope for a successful, 'green' outcome.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Irish people on the result of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
One country in the EU has allowed its people to vote on the Treaty of Nice and they said no.
If more countries had been allowed to vote, the result would probably have been no in a number of countries, not least in Sweden.
The European Council in Gothenburg must make it clear that Ireland' s rejection will be respected.
This means that the Treaty of Nice has failed.
It is a case of the EU having to follow its own rules.
The right of Member States to say no to Treaty amendments is key to the fabric of the EU.
Without it, the national democracies lose control of the Union.
This is why it is unbelievable that the Swedish government can say that the Treaty of Nice still stands.
By doing so, it is ignoring the democratic rules.
If the Swedish parliament had voted no to a Treaty amendment, would we not want that to be respected by the other EU countries?
I think that is a question which the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs should answer.
The people of Ireland voted no to the Treaty of Nice.
That is a no to increased supranationality, more power to the larger EU countries, a no to new steps towards a European State and EU militarisation.
As such, it was also a vote for a better and more democratic Europe.
Ireland' s no was not, however, a no to EU enlargement.
Enlarging the EU will work perfectly well based on the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The influence of the new Member States in the institutions can be regulated in the Accession Treaties as was the case during the last enlargement.
Such a model can correct the discrimination which certain applicant countries experienced in Nice.
If Ireland' s no is not respected, the message sent out will be clear, namely that the will of small countries is irrelevant and referendums are only respected if the result suits the power elite.
It would be a serious matter if this were to happen.
I would also like to say a few words about the strategy for sustainable development which is to be discussed at the Gothenburg Summit.
The Commission' s proposal was unexpectedly concrete and good, not least considering its weak proposal for an Environmental Action Programme earlier this year.
The proposal contains a number of clear goals such as a continued reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, measures to preserve biodiversity, requirements to stop increases in traffic and abolishing harmful subsidies, for example for tobacco cultivation.
The risk now is clearly that the concrete elements of the strategy disappear during negotiations, while the rhetoric committing to nothing remains.
A compromise proposal is already being circulated, a non-paper from the Swedish government which looks exactly as I described.
I hope that the Swedish government will fight for and succeed in retaining the concrete content of the strategy.
Mr President, on 28 September last year the Danes plainly said 'no' to the euro.
Last Thursday, the Irish unequivocally rejected the Treaty of Nice.
That means the people of the only two countries that have been directly consulted have expressed, with equal force, the growing dissatisfaction of all European citizens with a Europe that is tending more and more to treat its constituent nations simply as remote colonies.
Alas, as happened after the Danish referendum, the Union is loftily ignoring the message sent out by the people of Europe.
I wonder how long the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission think they can go on founding their Europe on contempt for the people, whom they treat as nobody would dare to treat children today?
The Gothenburg Summit, to be held only six months after the Nice Summit, will have to take note of the Irish vote and the fact that the Irish people have exercised the sovereign right of veto that the governments did not dare to exercise in Nice. It will therefore have to declare the treaty null and void, failing which the people will regard Europe as an alien enterprise and will soon see it as their enemy.
The Irish referendum and, even earlier than that, the Danish referendum are evidence of a certain hostility towards Europe on the part of the European citizens, at least on the part of those who were able to vote.
I hope that this does not indicate rejection of the idea of Europe, just rejection of a certain type of Europe, this Europe which is being built up with frightening speed, a Europe which must not on any account become the European Soviet Union, a Europe which must be more than just a Europe of governments - it must be a Europe of peoples as well - a Europe which must not be a Europe of bureaucrats but the Europe of the citizens.
In this regard, I hope that, at your Summits, in the forthcoming Treaties, greater influence, more space, greater responsibilities and greater powers will be given to the one body which genuinely represents the peoples and citizens of Europe: the European Parliament, which is currently belittled by the Treaties and the procedures.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the real value of the Nice Treaty is that it ushers in a phase of genuine reform of the Union - indispensable reform if the Community is to be prepared for enlargement.
I shall welcome any more accurate timetable for enlargement to come out of Gothenburg, although to name specific candidate countries would be irresponsible, given the negotiating chapters still outstanding and the Irish vote.
The Irish vote demands sensible reaction and analysis, even if only 33% of the electorate voted.
This is not democratic fiddle-faddle.
Wrongly interpreted, the result of the referendum implies that the Irish voted against enlargement.
But what they voted on was the Nice Treaty.
There have been numerous setbacks in the history of the Union: Denmark's no, Great Britain's policy during the first BSE crisis, the resignation of the Commission and the illegal sanctions against Austria.
We must make a careful analysis of the reasons behind the Irish vote, which begs the question of what is wrong with the European project.
We do not just need a public debate on the reform of the Union; we need more democracy and greater transparency on an integration process which is becoming ever more complex.
The involvement of the national parliaments as the representatives of European democracy is a key point here.
Mr President, may I at the outset offer Sweden my congratulations on its effective presidency.
I will be forgiven for concentrating on the Irish situation.
The Irish people have spoken.
The answer is "no".
We must respect that decision.
Could I plead with the Commission, the Council and indeed the summit to be sure that decision is respected in what they say and in the signals they give.
They must analyse it and not treat it as an irrelevancy, sending a message that with or without Ireland they will proceed.
If that were the case, they would not need ratification from all 15 Member States.
If it is not the case, they must not treat the decision as an irrelevancy.
I say this to them as a passionate "yes" voter, because they are causing more damage with the post-Nice referendum signals they are sending than with any pre-Nice referendum signals they sent in Ireland.
Please be careful.
The complexity and the lack of clarity of the Nice Treaty allowed a huge range of issues to be tagged onto the debate during the Irish referendum, issues relevant and irrelevant to Nice, causing concern and fear among the people, which resulted in a huge abstention with a paltry 34% turnout, of whom 54% voted "no".
In other words, 19% of people entitled to vote voted "no" and signalled an unwillingness to proceed with enlargement, because that was what Nice was about.
Please believe me when I say that I do not believe that the Irish people wish to deny the accession countries the opportunities and support that we as a small under-developed country have experienced and put to great use over the last three decades.
Our government was obliged by a Supreme Court decision to spend as much money telling the public the reasons to vote "no" as the reasons to vote "yes".
The media was likewise obliged to give as much coverage to the "no" campaign as to the "yes" campaign, without challenging the irrelevancies, despite the fact that all the major political parties, farm organisations, trade unions, press editorials and even the Conference of Bishops urged a "yes" vote.
There was an assumption that the outcome was a fait accompli.
Perhaps that explains why our government did so little, took the electorate for granted and was content to mine the Eurosceptic vote for the forthcoming general election, with several ministers in recent months giving very ambivalent signals.
Commissioner Solbes Mira's reprimand angered middle Ireland and raised fears of Europe meddling in our tax affairs.
Statements from Mr Jospin and Commissioner Prodi during the campaign did not help, but the responsibility for investing time and energy in the campaign lay primarily with our government, and it failed.
The "no" campaigners, starting from behind with nothing to lose and no one correcting the irrelevancies and, worse, the scare-mongering, beavered away.
I voted "yes" and I resent the implication that by doing so I am pro-abortion, anti-neutrality, pro-NATO, pro-nuclear power, pro-euthanasia.
The list is endless - take your pick.
They are all issues worthy of debate, but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty.
We need time to reflect, to analyse the outcome, to learn from it, to respond to the legitimate fears and concerns and, above all, to try and understand why 65% of the electorate stayed at home.
Was this an indictment of the European project or a mid-term wake-up call to our political establishment?
The jury is out.
Following our government's announcement last night of a new multi-party national forum to explain and discuss the European project in general and Nice in particular, I hope a more informed, reassured Irish electorate will allow our government to ratify the Nice Treaty in the next twelve months or so.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I very much hope that Gothenburg will be an opportunity for the Swedish Presidency to present a proper review of achievements.
I hope that the Gothenburg Summit, following the Stockholm Summit, at which full employment was once again confirmed as a European priority, will, on the home stretch too, make a major contribution to the sustainable development strategy.
But there is no denying that the Irish people' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice could cast a major shadow on the success of Gothenburg if the Summit hides its head in the sand or proceeds with business as usual.
I should like to say the following to Mr Poettering: the signal that we Socialists expect from Gothenburg is not just that enlargement is a priority, but that it is enormously important for Europe to be strengthened, and that must be done with the full and democratic involvement of the people.
Those two things are not incompatible.
Obviously the Irish must be allowed to work out their own solution to the problem that has now arisen, but the low turnout in the referendum and the negative results are not simply an Irish problem.
They are symptomatic of the dangerous gap that is opening up between European policy and the public in all Member States, not just Ireland, because of the lack of democracy, the lack of transparency and the lack of dialogue.
I am grateful to Mr Prodi for making it clear that Europe cannot be built by diplomats behind closed doors, and I particularly welcome the commitment of the President-in-Office of the Council, who is advocating a convention.
I do therefore ask you to make sure it does not become a watered down version.
But I also ask that you urge the Member States to step up the public debate on Europe' s future and on enlargement.
It really might be a little more than the Member States are now reporting.
On the other hand, I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I also hope the Gothenburg Summit will be a red and green and not just a green Summit.
Mr Andersson has already mentioned the political breakthrough achieved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on Monday on the right to information and consultation, safety and health at work, more equal opportunities for men and women, all areas that relate to the quality of work which is so important to the Swedes.
Besides that, I sincerely hope that Gothenburg will give a clear mandate for the introduction of a European strategy on poverty, social exclusion and proper, decent pensions.
I think that if Gothenburg can demonstrate that, then it will show people that the European project is worth fighting for.
Mr President, the talk is of a Danish solution for Ireland.
That is perhaps the only way out, but it is a tragic solution that will lead to the country' s marginalisation and to its acquiring the status of a colony.
It will be cutting itself off from influence but nonetheless complying with the decisions taken.
It is muzzling itself and shooting itself in the foot.
That is the fruit of the anti-European campaign run by nationalists and left-wing romantics and supported by reactionary Britons and former Danish communists who have always opposed European cooperation.
Mr Bonde has voted against every scrap of European cooperation.
He presents himself as the apostle of democracy and transparency but, until 10 years ago, he supported the most secretive system the world has ever seen and taught at the party schools in the East German dictatorship.
Do not listen to him!
Let us instead mobilise the large majority of citizens here in Europe who are happy to cooperate but who are dissatisfied with one thing or another and who cannot oversee what we are doing because the treaties are unreadable and unclear and because we too, here in Parliament, interfere in every conceivable matter, with the result that people cannot see an end to it.
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice is dead and must not be given the kiss of life.
To do so would be to show contempt for the voice of the people, not just in Ireland, but throughout Europe.
The rejection of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people is not a rejection of enlargement.
No one campaigned against enlargement on the "no" side.
We want to show solidarity with the people of Eastern Europe and to give them the cohesion funds and agricultural funds that we ourselves received.
What people were asked to decide on in Nice are new ways of running the EU, which are unacceptable.
I should like to caution and warn EU ministers in GÃ¶teborg to consider carefully the effect that a second resounding defeat would have for the Nice proposals.
They should think carefully about the effects on their own electorates who are watching with increasing disenchantment the distant and cumbersome European superstructure.
The intergovernmental method of negotiating EU treaties where leaders wheel-and-deal behind closed doors on matters of importance for all our citizens has come to an end and is now also dead.
A new method has to be found which leads to results that are understood and accepted by all of us, involving national and regional parliaments and, indeed, civil society.
The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism.
It is an indication of a serious rethink about Europe across the continent.
I woke up one morning to find that Irish soldiers were being sent to the Rapid Reaction Force.
I did not know how that decision was made.
None of our citizens knew how that decision was made.
We voted "no" because of those kinds of problems.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice is still not such a bad Treaty. It is certainly well-balanced as far as the balance of power in Europe is concerned.
So why do the people of Ireland seem to think otherwise?
It seems to me that, quite apart from their specific reservations, the Irish 'no' is an expression of a Europe-wide phenomenon.
The public in the Member States are sceptical about the workings of the EU, or even totally indifferent to them.
That comes home to roost at critical moments.
And Friday was certainly not the first time.
