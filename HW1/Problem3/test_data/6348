a reference period of one working day, not one week, to avoid extending the exposure of workers to noise and the damage caused by it.
These positions are contained in the relevant amendments tabled by the European Parliament, which is why I supported them, but are not included in the Council's common position.
Finally, we need control mechanisms to ensure that these measures are put into practice.
. It has always been the position of my group to work towards a safer working environment for all workers and in the past we have been very supportive of realistic initiatives that achieve this end.
We, in common with many other members had many concerns with the contents of this report, in particular the wide ranging requirements on the employer and the dubious emission levels.
For these reasons we were unable to support many of the amendments put forward and indeed we were disappointed that many amendments were given the support.
In particular, we were very happy that the amendment to exclude the music industry was adopted.
This is most welcome as I and many Members had the impression that this was not the appropriate place to deal with a very specialised sector of industry.
We must also welcome the willingness of the Council to take on board many of the amendments proposed by Parliament in its first reading and we hope that the goodwill shown by the Parliament will be reciprocated in the future.
On a personal level, I did not participate in the vote as I had such grave reservations with regard to the content of the report and many of the amendments and as a former musician I did not think it was right for me to vote.
In general our group is pleased with the outcome and hope that this new realism will continue in this.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague to tighten the Council's common position on exposing workers to noise.
No workers should be exposed to such high levels of noise that they are unable to have a conversation: you only get one pair of ears and to protect them is vital.
Moreover, it is better that measures to combat noise pollution and harm are preventative rather than curative and that the onus is placed on collective rather than individual responsibility in this domain.
So that this directive is as effective as possible, we should work with existing tools and avoid duplication.
Therefore, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work should be used to its maximum capacity.
This will facilitate and promote the exchange of best practice in terms of acceptable noise levels.
Moreover, it is logical that this directive must be far-reaching to include those employers and employees who are self-employed, since these make up a significant share of today's workforce.
Mr President, I voted for the MÃŒller report, and I say so with great conviction.
I support Mrs MÃŒller's cause and hope that the appeals made to the House by Mrs Jackson, as well as her statements, and also the assurances given by Mrs Banotti, the Quaestor, about settling the matter of this unacceptable and unbelievable interference - not only for the sake of our parliamentary work but also, I believe, for democracy as a whole, for the development of parliamentary debate - will achieve their aim as soon as possible, so that interference of this kind - which even included death threats - cannot happen again, in other words so that those responsible can be suitably reported and such things can never be repeated.
I am confident that Mrs Banotti will handle this.
Mr President, I regret the vote that took place today.
It is a major blow to the public's right to choose alternative forms of medicine, the right to try and avoid relying on pharmaceutical industries and their products.
Last night Commissioner Byrne rejected the idea that the pharmaceutical industry had anything to do with this, but I wonder why they are so interested in getting this through if that is not the case?
He clearly tried to give the impression that those opposing this were just spokespeople for the industries that produce food supplements.
That is not the case.
We are clearly in favour of people's right to choose.
That right has been taken away from them today.
Some Members of this House took a ridiculous approach in saying I should be recommending that people eat more oranges and vegetables.
Take the example of pregnant women. They would have to eat a lot of broccoli to get the amount of folic acid they actually need, so such an argument is ridiculous.
What has happened here today has played right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry, which will now have more customers because more people are going to fall ill.
It is also an assault on individual Member States' policies.
If the Member States do not have a lenient policy in their countries they should change it and not force the rest of us to drag our standards down to theirs.
Mr President, I supported the amendments to the MÃŒller report, though every fibre of my being wanted to deliver a body blow to Dr Rath - spelled r-a-t? - and his minions, who have placed this Parliament under siege not just for the past few months, but for a year.
I would also join with Ms McKenna in saying that vitamins - which I personally, as a nurse, do not regard as a food supplement - are on free sale in our country and that I have never yet heard of anybody overdosing on vitamin C or any other vitamin.
For that reason - regretfully, because I would have done anything to defeat Dr Rath's purpose - I voted for the amendments which, unfortunately, were not passed.
I agree with Ms McKenna that so far the free sale of these products - which, I repeat, I do not regard as food supplements - has not caused any problem, and I see no reason to interfere with that sale.
Mr President, may I just say that the whole discussion on this directive shows that there is an urgent need to make laws and rules clearer.
There is a huge misunderstanding about how this is to be interpreted, when Article 4 makes reference to annexes and other things.
I urge us all to support better regulation.
Mr President, the European Parliament has decided against the right of European citizens to be able unrestrictedly to enjoy natural medicines, which are completely free from side effects.
People have tried to make us Members of Parliament forget a simple truth, which is that nobody in human memory has ever died from taking vitamins, whereas the same can certainly not be said of the products of the multinational drug companies' sophisticated laboratories, as shown by the Lipobay case.
There are tens of thousands of cancer patients who are treating themselves effectively with vitamin therapy associated with natural substances such as the amino-acids lysine and proline.
In upholding the demands of a powerful lobby of the multinational drug companies, this directive therefore goes against a substantive right and the widespread interest of European consumers.
It is not for nothing that a board member of the second largest multinational drug company, Mr Bolkestein, sits in the European Commission.
Nobody mentions that he is certainly not unfamiliar with this directive, which, in one fell swoop, kills off the healthy small and medium-sized dietary supplement enterprises and the freedom of four hundred million Europeans to choose their treatment.
We are in favour of all measures which contribute to aligning national legislation, particularly in this field, provided that the result constitutes an improvement for consumers.
But here this is not what is motivating the rapporteur and the authors of most of the amendments: instead, it is primarily, if not exclusively, the interests of the capitalist groups who manufacture food supplements.
This is so obvious that, for example, the French employers' organisation in this sector sent a fax to all of the Members of the European Parliament with the openly cynical title: 'The French food supplements industry thanks in advance those who represent it in the European Parliament for voting in favour of the directive.'
Well, those who 'represent' these people can vote for this report and the directive!
As for us, we have only voted for one single amendment, the one which rejected the whole text.
Many people in Europe take vitamins and mineral supplements.
It is therefore appropriate, as part of European consumer policy, to avoid any abuse of these substances and to ensure that the products offered to consumers are of high quality.
This recommendation meets these aspirations, in particular by proposing an adequate European legal framework which does not hinder the free movement of these products, while guaranteeing increased health protection for the consumer and accurate and appropriate information on the products available.
One of the factors which is crucial to the safety of these products is the maximum quantity of minerals which they contain.
That is why setting maximum limits for the quantities of vitamins and minerals authorised in food supplements is important for ensuring that they are taken in moderation.
This is because scientific opinions show that absorbing excessive quantities of certain vitamins and minerals may have undesirable or harmful effects.
In addition, the list of these substances should not be set in stone because other products with nutritional or physiological effects could be incorporated into the provisions.
On the basis of the experience it gains in this field, I should like the Commission to present to the European Parliament and the Council additional proposals, accompanied by appropriate legal measures, on other nutriments and substances which can have comparable effects to food supplements.
I voted in favour of Mrs MÃŒller's report and I should like to highlight the quality of the work done by our rapporteur.
I am delighted that this House is finally speaking out on such an important issue.
Today it is a question of ensuring that the products concerned do not present a health risk by guaranteeing that the labels provide European consumers with clear, accurate and appropriate information about the products.
It is desirable to set a minimum level of vitamins and minerals which these products have to contain so as to guarantee that the food supplements contain them in sufficient quantity to justify the stated objective of the product.
Once we have agreed the principles in accordance with which the maximum and minimum quantities are to be set, the adoption of specific limits for each nutrient, on the basis of the opinion issued by the Scientific Committee for Food, is a purely technical matter.
Let us not forget that absorbing excessive quantities of some vitamins and minerals can have undesirable or harmful effects.
That is why it is necessary to guarantee the safety of these products, amongst other things by having labels with precise instructions on the use of the product and in particular the quantity that may be consumed.
The European public will thus be able to have peace of mind when choosing vitamins and mineral supplements from the huge range of products currently available on the market, without having to worry constantly about damaging their health.
. (NL) Last year, all EP Members were inundated with e-mails on food supplements and vitamin preparations.
Both a scientific theory and an economic interest underlie these.
The theory of Linus Pauling, who became renowned for his protest against nuclear arms, is interesting.
However, the economic interest of Mathias Rath, who dispatches products from the Netherlands to customers in Germany, where his products are banned, cannot justify an adaptation of the law.
These food supplements should be subject to the same rules as other contentious products which are consumed by the public in the expectation that these will benefit their health.
Government intervention is only justified to protect people from harm.
On-going debates, lack of scientific certainty and permanent differences of opinion on the effectiveness of substances cannot be resolved by legislation which from the outset lumps together anything which deviates from established medical science under the umbrella of fraudulent practices.
I note that many people use these products and that they consider any ban imposed by a bureaucratic government to be unnecessary and patronising.
Under these circumstances, the EU should confine itself to controlling harmful substances.
Since it would be preferable if the EU were to redirect any other measures to the national legislator, who can react more effectively and more quickly to changes in public opinion, I vote for rejection.
I have voted against the report. In my view, there is no legal basis insofar as the EU is not entitled to legislate within the area of public health.
It is national legislation that should deal with issues of food supplements, not the European Union.
Nor has the EU taken any initiatives to regulate legislation within areas in which very serious abuse takes place, for example those of alcohol and drugs.
The fact that an attempt is now being made to do so within the field of health foods - something that would have consequences for people's self-medication by means of vitamin supplements - raises a number of fundamental issues.
In whose interests is this to be done?
Why should it be done specifically within this area?
How would it affect the individual citizen?
Which manufacturers would suffer, and which benefit?
These questions demand answers, and no satisfactory answers have been given.
Mr President, I would like to state that I voted for the Paulsen report and above all for Amendment No 10.
I basically believe that we need to pay close attention to hygiene regulations and enforce them very strictly, and that standards need to be raised accordingly.
Nevertheless it does not make sense for us to destroy reusable waste - and that is what catering waste is - and by destroying it to create further costs for the public, when we could in fact make use of it in a sensible way.
I am pleased that the European Parliament has agreed with this approach, even if it has been by a narrow margin.
I hope that as things proceed we will also get the necessary agreement of the Commission that reusable waste should not be indiscriminately destroyed, which also involves extra costs, but that it should be possible to use it and recycle it.
Mr President, I am very grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to table an oral amendment and to explain what is behind it.
Unfortunately, it did not scrape past the required 314-vote mark.
That is a pity as far as the amendment is concerned, but it does not alter the fact that in compromise Amendment No 25 Parliament has called on the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal.
That means that the codecision procedure will be invoked and that we can deal with this by means of a regulation of our own.
I wish to call on those Member States that have not so far called for a ban to make sure that these substances, which are dangerous if they are not properly treated, are properly disposed of.
I expect that during the transitional period until a regulation governing all this is submitted, the Commission will use its control functions to make sure that we do not have a repeat of the disasters that we have already experienced - foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever - which can be caused by untreated catering waste.
I have always attached great importance to health and consumer protection.
I should like to make two essential remarks on the points which I advocated in the parliamentary committee.
The European Union's decisions must be consistent.
In the interests of efficiency, it is therefore appropriate not to have a proliferation of regulations on the same subjects.
In laying down provisions for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 already subjects animal by-products from slaughterhouses handling ruminants and cutting plants handling meat from ruminants to rigorous and controlled health rules.
Consequently, to ensure consistency and the correct application of the rules, there is no reason to include these facilities in the scope of a second regulation with the same objectives.
The European Union's decisions must also be possible to implement.
In fact we already know that, because of treatment and disposal capacity (incineration or landfill), measures which have to be implemented at too short notice cannot be applied at Community level if they cover effluent - whether category 1 or category 2 - from wastewater treatment plants at slaughterhouses, which are often shared facilities.
These shortcomings mainly came to light when the ban on animal meal in animal feed was imposed, forcing the Member States to store large quantities of animal meal while waiting for it to be incinerated.
Adding several million tonnes of products to be disposed of or treated before processing would impose further constraints on storage because it is not possible to treat or incinerate them as required.
And we know that storage can involve health and environmental risks.
It is therefore necessary to put in place an adequate timetable allowing this to be managed at Community level in a way which is well thought-out, safe and respectful of the environment.
. I would like to commend the rapporteur Ms Paulsen for her work on this important report.
The BSE crisis of recent years must never again threaten European consumers, farmers and the beef industry.
I believe that great credit is due to the Commission for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each and every one of the issues surrounding the original crisis.
The Commission and the Member States have taken the necessary steps, with the full co-operation of the farming community and the beef industry, to guarantee safe farming and food production practices and a safe product for the European consumer as well as for our vital export markets.
Many actions and measures taken have brought with them great sacrifice and we must remain conscious of that.
This particular proposal aims to establish a single legal framework to clarify conditions for treating animal by-products.
Most importantly, the only by-products which should end up in animal feed, and consequently the food chain, are those by-products which would be fit for direct human consumption.
In other words, if you can't put a spoon of the stuff in your cup of cocoa at night then you shouldn't be feeding it to the pigs either.
As a Member of Parliament representing a largely rural constituency, and coming from Ireland, the Member State most heavily dependent on agriculture, I fully endorse the stringent thrust of this proposal.
I strongly believe that there must be a complete ban on the feeding of swill to pigs.
We have seen the damage that can be wreaked from a more lax approach.
I am also convinced of the need to ban recovered vegetable oils from all feed uses.
There is great merit in the rapporteur's suggestion that household catering waste be exempt from the provisions of these regulations with regard to transport, identification etc and that they be covered by national rules and the Framework Directive on Waste.
As regards the issue of waste water from slaughter houses, I believe that this must be reviewed as it covers a huge quantity of material for disposal.
Defining 'sludge? in the Annex might help clarify the situation.
In conclusion, I would like to assure the Commissioner that he has the full support of Parliament in this important area of food safety.
In this regard I would urge him to exert some pressure on the Council to come to a final decision as to the location of the all-important Food Safety Authority.
Protection of European consumers, and of the integrity of the food chain, remain at the heart of the concerns of Members of this House.
In establishing the single market, which is its stated aim, the report on cross-border exchanges in electricity seeks, first and foremost, to open the market in electricity to competition and de facto, even if it does not admit it openly, to privatisation.
This means awarding the prize of supplying electricity to more than 300 million Europeans to large private groups.
Not content with this, but perfectly consistent with this approach, the rapporteur recommends passing on the costs of opening up the national networks to the private sector to consumers throughout the European Union.
We are resolutely opposed to privatisation of the generation and supply of electricity, as we are to the privatisation of all public services, which the Member States and the European institutions are so keen to achieve, because this policy can only be to the detriment of the interests of both the workers in the sectors concerned and the vast majority of consumers.
We condemn this policy of demolishing public services, whose sole aim is to satisfy capitalists' appetite for profit, whether it is acknowledged as such, as in the Mombaur report, or whether it is veiled - ineffectually - by environmentalist considerations, as in the Turmes-Rapkay report.
We therefore voted against these two reports.
Energy is not a marketable commodity like any other!
How many times have I already said and repeated that?
Account must be taken of the need to guarantee security of supply and the volume of investment this entails.
The provision of essential public services and its impact in terms of regional planning must also be taken into account.
In spite of all this, following the request made by the European Council at its Lisbon Summit for rapid progress towards the completion of the single market in gas and electricity, the Commission has presented a communication, a draft regulation and a draft directive designed to speed up the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market with a view to the establishment of an entirely open market in 2005.
At the Stockholm Summit, the Member States approved this acceleration, with the exception of France, which is strongly opposed to the adoption of that date.
The Commission wishes to speed up the opening of the electricity market so as to give non-residential customers a free choice of supplier by 1 January 2003 and to extend the same opportunity to all electricity consumers not later than the beginning of January 2005.
In the case of gas, free choice of supplier is to be available to non-residential customers by 1 January 2004 and to all consumers by the start of January 2005.
This is utterly irresponsible and unacceptable.
It is the distortion of an ultra-liberal Europe that I am resisting.
Given the balance of power in the European Parliament and in Europe, it will be an arduous struggle.
To this end, I have signed a compromise amendment to Article 19, tabled by Mr Herzog and Mr Savary, which alters the deadlines and conditions for open competition and insists on scope for cross-subsidisation to guarantee equality of charges for residential clients.
This is why I voted against the report in the final vote.
France should uphold this position at the Barcelona Council.
I would first like to state that there was not a majority in the committee in favour of the part of the report on a Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity, the part for which Mr Turmes was responsible.
If there had been just a Turmes report instead of the Rapkay-Turmes report we now have before us, it would not have seen the light of day in plenary.
We are of course in agreement with the three major objectives of the process of liberalising the electricity and gas industry, and our message to the Barcelona Summit about this was clear and undisputed.
It is as follows:
1) we want to ensure that consumers are free to choose their suppliers;
2) we want to guarantee that all suppliers have fair and transparent access to all networks;
3) we want to see a binding system in all Member States in order to underpin the objective described in point 2.
However, Mr Turmes felt that in his part of the report, which covered the electricity industry, he should set out his entire ideology and the Greens' wish list in this area, which have nothing to do with the actual subject matter.
His report therefore misses the point.
Like my colleagues, I voted against these parts of the resolution.
Because we are now involved in the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council, Mr Turmes has, with his Red-Green wish list, not done a great service to the subject at hand here, by which I mean a reasonable and balanced liberalisation of the EU electricity market.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) The promotion of international trade in gas and electricity leads to more problems in the field of the environment, consumer protection and price stability.
This is a comment in connection with the Mombaur report.
As transpired yesterday - much to the chagrin of the spokesperson of the PPE-DE Group - the rapporteurs Turmes and Rapkay have made proposals to moderate the effects of the Mombaur report.
Their intention is noble, but difficult to implement, because it aims to combine two incompatible objectives.
They accept more emphasis on market forces, which centre on growth and profits, while trying to protect the environment and consumers.
I welcome their attempt to give customers a percentage breakdown in their bills and in information leaflets explaining the origin of electricity and the effects on the production of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, and to apply this to imported energy.
I also support financial measures to promote investments in total energy and windmills.
I am less keen on the importance being accorded to attempts also to liberalise biogas and to ensure that environmental obligations do not restrict competition between companies, although this may be a concession to the majority in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Although I reject the circumstances under which this proposal has been made, unlike my group, I gladly support it in the absence of anything better.
. I welcome the move to shake up Europe's energy markets: this will make markets more open and accessible to all.
If the final directive contains many of the useful amendments proposed by the Industry Committee, European energy consumers will operate in a considerably more favourable climate than they do at present.
Bills will contain more basic information and consumers will be better informed of exactly what they are paying for.
Even more significant for European consumers will be the proposed non-discriminatory access to networks for different competitors.
Basic economics tells us that more competition for networks should result in an eventual decrease in prices: good news for some consumers who, in the present system, end up paying over the odds.
This is equally goods news for small energy companies who are sometimes deterred from further expansion owing to high market entry costs.
Gas and electricity are basic necessities, not luxury goods, and this directive will be a triumph for most European consumers and some producers of energy.
. (NL) In the past, electricity was generated and distributed on a small-scale, and organised for each municipality or province under the remit of the administration elected for that region.
Now, we are on our way to the generation and distribution by international concerns on which democracy has no effect whatsoever.
The drawbacks have meanwhile become glaringly obvious in America, especially in the power cuts in California and in the bankruptcy case of Enron.
But in Europe too, the adverse effects are already being felt.
The Dutch energy companies, until recently in the hands of municipalities and provinces, have made considerable investments in the environmentally-friendly generation of electricity.
This clean production is now being considered too expensive, and dirty electricity is being imported via the cross-border connection network, which originates from pit coal, brown coal and nuclear energy.
This connection network was installed some time ago to allow Member States to help each other in the event of disaster and in cases of peaks in the use of electricity, but its capacity is now being used completely for the purpose of international trade.
This is why I disagree with the purport of the Mombaur report on cross-border electricity trade, even if through the proposals by Turmes and Rapkay more attention is paid to keeping track of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, to promoting windmills and total energy, and to consumer protection.
These objectives will ultimately not be compatible, which is why I am voting against the proposal.
. (NL) Airports are built in densely populated regions and attract extra economic growth, as a result of which an increasing number of people end up living in their vicinity.
Consequently, aircraft noise has become a plague to an increasing proportion of the population.
The more a region is forced to rely on air traffic for its transport needs, the greater the burden becomes in terms of damage to health.
The only ways to combat this nuisance are to restrict air traffic to long-distance flights, to create greater distances between airports and residential areas, to accord lower priority to economic growth or world trade and to ban noisy aircraft.
Clearly, America and the Third World have different views on noise pollution.
The Third World is too poor to consider matters of this kind, and in affluent America, company profits are more important than any other considerations.
Anyone truly wishing to restrict noise pollution in Europe should not be content with the agreement that was recently concluded on a global scale within the ICAO, but should set higher standards themselves, if necessary.
The proposal to withdraw the aforementioned Hushkits Regulation from 1 April onwards mainly aims to avoid a trade war with America.
I share the view of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Blokland, that this proposal does not go far enough and that it continues to permit exceptions for too long a term.
I will be voting against the proposal.
. I fully support this report on the Commission communication, which aims to improve information exchange between the EU and its citizens.
Anti-EU campaigns in countries such as Ireland have clearly demonstrated the need for a positive communication strategy.
Moreover, the practical policy prescriptions outlined in this report show that the EU is serious about becoming closer to European citizens and countering the common perception that it is run by an elite bureaucracy.
Focusing on issues which affect people's daily lives, such as food safety, the euro and justice and home affairs, will ensure that citizens fully engage in the debate about Europe.
Moreover, the focus on decentralisation in this communication exchange is pertinent: regions vary dramatically across the EU and local authorities are attuned to regional needs and issues of local importance.
They are clearly the best placed to disseminate information about the EU.
Similarly, it is vital that regional TV should be involved.
Finally, the call for more Internet use in the information campaign will ensure that this campaign is not only cost-effective but environmentally sound, too.
Since the European Parliament is the European institution closest to European citizens, it would make sense for it to become the institution around which this information campaign revolves.
On behalf of my group, I should like to inform you as to why we have voted against the report.
First of all, because of the poor quality of the report.
It is a very confused report and it is very difficult to make sense of it.
A second reason is that religion, fundamentalism and the violation of human rights are lumped together, which is unacceptable to us.
A third reason is that the European Union is given a number of inappropriate assignments, including the setting up of a free university for women. In fact, we do not want a separate university for women; we want co-educational universities.
These are the reasons why we have voted against the report.
Mr President, I voted against the report before us because it does not live up to the expectations created by the title.
The main focus is on religious fundamentalism, with other forms of fundamentalism only being given a brief mention.
Even if religious fundamentalism is the most significant form and stands out from other forms, it is nevertheless essential to recognise all forms of fundamentalism if a meaningful debate is to take place.
The threats posed by fundamentalism are growing in a way that the events of 11 September suggest involve an enormous contempt for humanity.
However, to do justice to the situation we cannot limit ourselves to religious aspects alone.
Just as people obsessed with a fundamental order are to be found in all walks of life, this way of thinking is also prevalent throughout society.
The logical consequence of recognising this can therefore only be that we should examine this whole area and not concentrate on just one form of this phenomenon, even if it is the form with the most adherents.
Mr President, during the vote one of my Dutch colleagues remarked that part of the report did not make sense in Dutch.
I had difficulty in finding any of it that made sense in English!
This report has taken political correctness to a whole new level.
It is counter-productive to approach such an important issue as religious fundamentalism with a tirade of political fundamentalism of the kind that this report is largely made up of.
I am particularly critical of paragraph 29, even as amended, which considers the separation of church and state to be the most acceptable form of government.
I do not have to remind you, Mr President, that in my country, if not in yours, the head of state is also the head of the established church.
That is a system that works very well indeed.
I hope Parliament is not calling on the Queen to abdicate, so that maybe we can elect President Kinnock in her place!
The Izquierdo Rojo report on women and fundamentalism, which has just been adopted by a slim majority in spite of our having voted against it, is a prime example of a good initial idea that has been completely perverted in the course of the discussion process.
It was originally a matter of reaffirming our desire to ensure that women's rights are rigorously respected throughout the territory of all the Member States at a time when huge influxes of unassimilated immigrants are prone to import practices that are degrading to women or are tantamount to cruel torture, such as female circumcision.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament ultimately shied away from naming the plague that besets us, namely floods of unassimilated immigrants, often from countries with an Islamic culture.
Faced with this predicament, Parliament has taken refuge in sanitised statements or, even worse, has issued sweeping condemnations which seem to apply to all Europeans without distinction and which imbue everyone with an unwarranted sense of guilt.
The same is true of the concept of fundamentalism itself. Under that heading, the report blithely lumps together the rigorous practice of Christianity, a religion that places the individual at the heart of society, and the rigorous practice of another religion, Islam, which subordinates the individual to the community.
But these are not the same phenomenon at all.
To crown it all, the European Parliament recommends that the forthcoming directives on the right of asylum, based on the Treaty of Amsterdam, provide for reception of women from all parts of the world who suffer from 'fundamentalist persecution'.
Had it been consistent, the report would have called at the same time for the abolition of the budgetary stability and growth pact!
The report has the merit of condemning one of the most odious aspects of the oppression of women in the world by taking a stance against the integration of church and state and the regimes that practise it.
We voted in favour of the condemnatory paragraphs and of the measures to assist women who are forced to flee from countries where women are the victims of systematic barbarism.
On the report as a whole, however, we abstained.
Although the report rightly condemns Islamic fundamentalism, it is considerably more discreet about the other forms of fundamentalism, notably the role of Catholicism, of which women are victims both outside and inside the European Union, in countries such as Ireland and Portugal or in some of the German LÃ€nder.
Prohibiting women from voluntarily terminating their pregnancy, in other words denying them the right to use their bodies as they please, is one example of a sexist and oppressive attitude towards women.
And the good resolutions adopted by the European Union against misogynous practices and the excesses of Islamic regimes would be more credible if the Union first put its own house in order by prohibiting discriminatory practices against women in its own Member States.
The European institutions have taken it upon themselves, with the complicity of the European governments, to impose such a retrograde step as nightshift work for women.
Why do they refuse to impose throughout Europe the fundamental right of women to self-determination, including the right of voluntary termination?
I must warmly congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo on her excellent own-initiative report, compiled as a result of the hearing on women and fundamentalism held on 23 January 2001.
Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can appear in many guises.
It can be religious, political or ideological.
We do not stress often enough that women are the chief victims of fundamentalism and that this state of affairs frequently arouses utter indifference.
While the European Union has to condemn this phenomenon in third countries, it must not presume to lecture the rest of the world, because it is confronted with fundamentalism within its own territory.
This is confirmed by the massive floods of e-mails that have inundated Members of the European Parliament and in which we are being urged to reject this report on the grounds that it is 'a threat to the dignity of women and to the right to life of every human being until his or her natural death'.
On the contrary, I support the demand contained in this report for promotion of equal rights for women, particularly the right of women to exercise control over their own bodies and to decide when they wish to start a family, to determine their own lifestyle and the nature of their personal relationships.
It appears equally imperative that the Member States should adopt legislation outlawing any practices that endanger the health or the physical and mental integrity of women, such as female circumcision.
Who could fail to recall the human misery into which the Taliban plunged the eleven million women of Afghanistan in 1996?
Imprisoned behind their chadors, deprived of education and care, subjected to public floggings, they endured an existence beyond the bounds of human dignity in order to survive.
It is our duty to exert pressure on the new government in order to ensure that the political wind of change sweeping through Afghanistan is translated into a genuine improvement in the position of women.
The struggle for the recognition of women's rights should be an integral part of the foreign policy of the European Union.
I am thinking here of the way in which we implement the MEDA programme and the LomÃ© Convention.
The human rights clause is too often allowed to remain a dead letter for fear that its implementation would jeopardise the success of particular economic or trade agreements.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has given us many avenues to explore in the fight against fundamentalism.
The main line of approach I wish to highlight is that of the secular state, in other words the clear separation of religion and public affairs.
This is a fundamental principle.
In addition, the modernisation of political life must mean granting women their rightful place in the machinery of public administration.
Nothing can justify the violation of an individual's fundamental rights and freedoms and which issue from that individual's inalienable dignity.
I am therefore against fundamentalism as the expression of a way of thinking that denies a person - man or woman - their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny, and It is my view that the European Union must, with every means at its disposal, uphold and promote respect for human rights wherever they are violated.
I cannot, however, accept the implicit censure of religious values and actual religion that the Izquierdo report makes, under cover of its censure of fundamentalism - and not only in relation to Christianity.
It is one thing to freely espouse religious principles that accord with respect for human rights; it is quite another to impose rules of behaviour that entail the negation of individual dignity and the infringement of such rights.
It is one thing to support the separation of Church and State, a position I fully share because it is the basis of the democratic system, but quite another to deny the Church and religious communities their right to freedom of expression in the name of secularity - in other words their right to interpret, according to their way of thinking, the facts of public and political life that govern citizens' lives.
By adopting this report today, the European Parliament has done the cause of the freedoms we wish to promote no favours, because behind the censure of fundamentalism there is in fact a new form of fundamentalism that they are trying to impose on us: secular fundamentalism, which is just as deserving of censure as any other, in that they all deny the freedom of the individual to choose his or her own model in life.
This is the reason why I voted against the report.
. I abstained on the amendments and voted against the final report because I am deeply concerned about the lack of balance within this report.
Implicit in this report are western cultural values which make a presumption against the rights of women in Islam.
I would question the wisdom of this parliament in producing this report and in doing so pass judgement on other cultures and their values.
I believe this report was based on an external view and with very narrow and limited experience of Islamic lifestyle.
I am deeply committed to equal opportunities for women everywhere, however, I believe it is crucial that women in different parts of the world can establish their own concept of freedom which takes into account the variety of different cultures and values they hold.
The Members from the National Front will vote against Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's report.
There are undoubtedly good elements, such as the principle that fundamentalism must not be fought with other types of fundamentalism of an opposite kind (recital M).
But the report also contains bad things and some very bad things.
First of all, it is astonishing to note that this report, which was originally devoted to Islam and women, has now been renamed.
The reason for this was undoubtedly to avoid shocking anyone and to comply with the sacrosanct dictates of political correctness.
Moreover, to create a stronger sense of guilt among us, recital A recalls that 'the concept of fundamentalism originated in the 1920s in the USA, where it primarily referred to Christianity'.
The eleven million Afghan women who were banned from all public places, deprived of education, barred from professional activity, deprived of care and exposed to beatings and floggings in the years when the fundamentalist Taliban ruled their country have a different story to tell about the origins of fundamentalism.
In this report, the European Parliament presumes to lecture us on moral theology.
On what authority?
With what qualifications?
How can it put religion and fundamentalism, the exercise of spiritual and temporal power, on the same footing?
The report systematically equates religion with fundamentalism in utter disregard of reality.
The report, in fact, is a hotchpotch of hackneyed ideas, all of which have the same purpose, namely the inversion of decent values and the promotion of decadence.
What can I say, for example, about paragraph 33, which calls on the heads of Christian churches to legitimise lesbianism?
This report is also yet another stepping stone in the pro-immigration policy pursued by Brussels.
In fact, by some sleight of hand, paragraphs 18, 19, 21 and 24 use the fight against fundamentalism as a pretext to demand greater flexibility for governments to grant asylum to women from countries where fundamentalism is rife as well as using the framework of a preventive policy to secure the rapid social integration of the immigrants, refugees and minorities who are resident in the territory of the European Union.
For these reasons, and many others besides, we must reject this report and resist any attempts by Parliament to replace it, under cover of the struggle against religious fundamentalism, with another report, which may be even more arbitrary than this one and which is the fruit of the fickle convictions and hostility to the natural order that characterise the present majority of this House.
- (DE) It is vital for us to deal with this topic thoroughly, because many women suffer from fundamentalist discrimination.
However, the report before us does not do justice to these problems and creates the impression that fundamentalism is the hallmark only of certain religions.
The political, social and ideological fundamentalism directed at women with such devastating consequences for their quality of life has been ignored.
Narrowing the scope of the report in this way is contrary to the Christian ethical order of values.
This one-sidedly anti-religious approach means that an opportunity to deal appropriately with this important subject, "Women and fundamentalism", has been missed.
The report is unbalanced, contradictory and undifferentiated, and accordingly totally undermines the battle against discrimination against women.
Freedom of religion and protection against discrimination are key aspects of fundamental rights that cannot be played off against each other, and that is why I voted against this report.
When the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was given permission to draw up an own-initiative report on women and fundamentalism, we had reason to hope that this report would serve not only to reiterate our condemnation of the fact that millions of women in the world are deprived of elementary human and civil rights, which we know only too well.
We also nurtured the hope that this report might provide a valuable contribution that would push things in the right direction wherever a push was needed.
Regrettably, our rapporteur and those who followed her lead have squandered a great opportunity; this is illustrated, incidentally, by the fact that the report was adopted by only 15 votes to 7 in the Committee on Women's Rights, while the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was adopted by 18 votes with 11 abstentions.
The two women rapporteurs are members of the Socialist Group in this Parliament.
The uncooperative approach of the rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and indeed her obstinate determination not to listen to reason and to throw everything into the one pot, if I may say so, means that I cannot vote in favour of this report; for one thing, it indiscriminately accuses all religions for practising a pernicious form of fundamentalism, and another, more important reason is that it seeks to manipulate this resolution to define details of the asylum and immigration policies of the European Union.
This is unacceptable and I am afraid that, through her obstinacy and the tone of her report, the rapporteur has done a great disservice to the women who are victims of fundamentalism and, hence, to this House too.
.
(NL) All people are equal, but there are always people who have an interest in denying this. This leads to slavery, racism, colonial wars, child labour, subsistence wages for workers, underpayment for raw materials and the withholding of equal rights for women.
In order to maintain their position, some privileged parties draw on quotes from the Bible or the Koran which are supposed to justify their misconduct.
Only in the past few centuries have women in different European countries acquired the same rights as men, such as the right to vote, the right to work, rights to equal remuneration, access to managerial roles, the right to dissolve a failed marriage and equal rights of inheritance.
There is still a rearguard of men who are opposed to this.
New to us is the increase - through immigration - of the number of men originating from cultures who oppose gender equality.
Some of them keep their daughters at home, marry them off and penalise them for looking for contact with boys independently.
I fully endorse the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities not to use family law from the countries of origin as a basis, not to support the States that discriminate against women and also to bring women who are persecuted on grounds of gender under the asylum law.
The report on 'women and fundamentalism' addresses many important issues.
It is indisputably the case that women in large parts of the world are at present denied their rights and suffer oppression in the name of what we call religious, political or ideological fundamentalism.
As Christian Democrats, we vigorously condemn these human rights infringements and condemn the treatment to which women have been, and are, exposed in, for example, Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.
However, the report contains such basic shortcomings that we cannot, in the end, support it.
For example, there is no definition of what is meant by fundamentalism.
Even though it can more or less be inferred that what we are talking about here are violent and repressive regimes or forms of, in particular, religious belief, the report does not successfully distinguish between what, in that case, is to be viewed as fundamentalism and what are to be regarded as ordinary religion and religious institutions.
On a number of occasions, the report states that religion is something private and that religious institutions should not interfere in 'the public and political life of the state'.
We believe in a vigorous civil society, of which the churches too should be a part, and do not wish to remove any right to participate in ongoing public debate.
I abstained on this report.
I believe that it is important to guarantee women's rights.
Fundamentalism exists in all areas of society and not only in Islam, an idea constantly repeated in the report.
The report is one-sided and condemns only a few states that do not recognise women's rights.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.58 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on Transatlantic relations including steel import tariffs.
Almost six months to the day after the events of 11 September, one can only be extremely surprised that, in the progress report on transatlantic relations which has been drawn up by the Presidency of the European Union, such a relatively small part has been devoted to the lessons to be drawn from those events.
One might have thought that the tragedy of 11 September would prompt the countries of Europe to engage in some soul-searching on the reasons why the international Islamic terrorist network chose Europe as a location for the bases from which they struck at the United States.
So what particular facilities do our countries offer, and how can these be rooted out?
What consequences should be drawn from the exploitation of asylum procedures by terrorist networks, etc.?
Our police forces have certainly worked hard in close cooperation with the U.S. authorities.
Their enquiries have revealed the extent to which terrorists have set up bases in our countries.
When it comes to analysing the significance of 11 September, on the other hand, a considerable gulf is developing between the two sides of the Atlantic, with one side regarding it as an isolated operation and the other as a manifestation of the new global terrorist scene, dominated by hyperterrorism.
The communication from the Council indicates this.
The effective measures to deal with the nature and scale of the common threat is not its main concern and a very minimalist response seems to be envisaged.
There is only a vague mandate to draw up, sometime or other, an agreement on mutual judicial assistance.
This, Mr President, is a strange and dangerous divergence which may well seriously encumber transatlantic relations and our own security.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely disappointing that when we talk about the transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States, we should also have to mention a steel war.
This is extremely disappointing because we assumed that President Bush would be one of the main champions of the market economy, and not that he would belong with the campaigners for protectionist measures.
It would, of course, be understandable if he were to take such measures for electoral reasons, but based on his undertaking to act in favour of free trade, this is, naturally, an incomprehensible attitude which we must unreservedly condemn.
It is all the more disappointing since we have just started the fourth ministerial meeting in the framework of the Doha world trade talks, now being overshadowed by a measure of that kind.
And that is not the last we have heard of it, for if I understand it correctly, the United States wants to adopt the same line for agricultural products too.
Mr President, this is completely the wrong route to take.
In the case of steel alone, I should like to point out that my country, the Netherlands, has made considerable efforts, together with your country, to restructure the steel industry.
This has, both directly and indirectly, led to thousands of job losses in both our countries.
This means, therefore, that we would have to pay the price for the lack of restructuring in the United States.
In my opinion, the European Union has tabled sound proposals to consider whether a kind of fund could be set up to help restructure the steel industry in the United States.
These proposals have, of course, been dismissed, which means, therefore, that we cannot make any more headway, and that the high costs of steel in America - certainly not simply due to the expensive dollar, but also, of course, due to the social security schemes and pensions in the steel industry - have, in fact, been passed on to us.
In my view, Barcelona should be used to launch a diplomatic offensive, alongside the normal measures which you, Commissioner Lamy, have to take, obviously, by threatening the United States with countermeasures.
However, what matters is that we should also use Barcelona to launch a diplomatic offensive in order to make it clear to the United States that protectionist measures of this kind only lead to major disruption in free trade and with it, to a huge upset in the creation of jobs.
It is exactly the opposite signal from the one we need: we all want to create more jobs globally.
Yet, what is happening now is the reverse.
I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council - and I am pleased that the Council is here today - at least to ensure that initiatives are taken in Barcelona.
Mr President, the Socialists have always formed part of a movement for worldwide peace.
After the Cold War, they spoke out for multilateral agreements which were intended to reduce, both in terms of quantity and quality, weapons systems, particularly nuclear weapons, to a minimum.
Europe has opted to use the peace dividend to bridge the poverty gap.
Today, we are facing over one hundred regional conflicts in the multipolar world, which mainly claim civilian victims, and often too we are confronted with financed illegal trade in arms and in raw materials, such as oil and diamonds.
Our strength was, and still is, conflict prevention. States are crumbling in Africa.
Warlords very cunningly join forces with international terrorist networks, and intense cooperation between all Member States of international rule of law is the only answer.
Europe must be an independent, critical, yet outspoken, partner of a multilaterally trading United States.
In this light, unilateral US policy should be condemned - as Mr Patten and Mr Solana did, rightly so - while joint action should be supported.
Of great importance and urgency to the Middle East is a joint project to be set up immediately between the EU and the UN, as was mentioned this morning.
We should then like to grant priority to the fight against international terrorist networks and to the situation in Iraq. However, we should like to do this via the UN, and not unilaterally.
We would underline that all these initiatives are not in the context of an old fashioned kind of anti-Americanism, but are based on the recognition that all good-willed people need each other.
Nobody can regulate the world on their own.
The rumours in the Los Angeles Times that the Pentagon is forging plans to use nuclear weapons against seven States, including Russia and China, are of great concern to us in particular.
This contravenes international treaties which aim to commit all countries to a reduction in nuclear arms, in the knowledge that we now have the capacity to kill each other many times over.
We would ask the Commission and Council to lodge an urgent and forceful protest against the build-up of a fresh and dangerous nuclear arms race.
We still believe that the best way to achieve security is to bridge the chasm between rich and poor, by means of which we want to create a world which forms common ground for all people of goodwill, as opposed to international terrorists.
We would like to see this initiative of Europe and the United States take shape, also specifically in Monterrey, when the 0.7% is activated.
The transatlantic relations between Europe and the US are once again under intense pressure.
Europe and the United States are adopting increasingly threatening language with each other on a variety of topics.
Only last week, President Bush unleashed a fresh trade war by restricting steel imports by means of import tariffs.
The European Union was right to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation about these Draconian measures.
Although our trade disputes with the US only concern one to two per cent of our trade and investment flows, they can cause a great deal of damage to our mutual relations.
Trade disputes are always catching the headlines and undermine the political relationship, which is already very fragile at this time.
Each new trade dispute is one too many.
Consequently, more efforts must be made to nip potential conflicts in the bud as a matter of urgency.
Transatlantic relations desperately need new positive impulses in the interest of us all.
Mr President, the Greens have spent more than a decade endeavouring to expose the myths at the heart of the free-trade theory.
Now we know for sure, as we have always suspected, that the rhetoric of the US and its major corporations was a sham.
Far from being at the centre of a development agenda to help poorer nations out of poverty, the US tariff barriers reveal how that country uses trade rules to gain access to other people's markets, while protecting its own industrial interests at home.
The US view is clearly that free trade is a one-way street for a superpower: good for US exporters, but not so good for US domestic industry.
Contrast that with the unequivocal lectures given by the US to developing countries at the WTO meeting in Doha, to the effect that, by liberalising their markets, they will automatically reap the benefits of globalisation.
Poverty eradication and sustainable development are somehow automatically meant to follow, yet poorer countries have known for a long time that this is often far from the case.
Perhaps the one good thing that could come out of President Bush's unilateral introduction of tariffs on steel imports would be a much-needed serious debate about the flaws and weaknesses inherent in the free-trade model, because there is growing opposition to the global inequality inherent in its diktat that every country must put international competitiveness above all other domestic concerns.
The reaction against this ranges from Indian farmers calling for an increase in tariffs to protect themselves from cheap food imports, through to steel workers, including fully restructured UK steel workers, who find that they will now still be unable to compete with Romanian steel exports.
However, there are some retaliatory actions that the EU should consider, which will send the right signal to the US.
I would like the Council and Commission's views on them.
For example, since the US has refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol because of the perceived impact this would have on US business, the EU should levy an energy tax on all US-manufactured goods.
Or we might consider the issue of a complete ban on all imports of US-produced GM foods, since US pressure exerted under free-trade rules has prevented EU ministers from reflecting popular opinion by banning such foods from markets here.
The time is long overdue for the EU to call Mr Bush's bluff.
Mr President, it is perfectly understandable that we should wish to examine the state of transatlantic relations in the light of the current situation.
Let us begin with the decision to tax steel imports at rates of up to 30% and to impose quotas.
As the main exporter to the United States, the Union is the primary target of these measures.
And yet European steel imports have fallen by 33% since 1998, and so they are not the cause of the problems in the U.S. steel industry.
Coming on top of the differences over hormone-treated beef and GMOs, these measures are likely to have serious economic and social repercussions for the European steel industry.
The Commission would therefore be well advised to bring a complaint before the WTO, as Mr Lamy announced, as well as to apply retaliatory measures without delay against US exports.
What is more, this latest decision by the Bush Administration testifies to a strengthened desire on the part of the US Government to adopt a unilateral approach in numerous domains: on the commercial and economic as well as the cultural and military fronts, and this last front is the focus of deep concern.
The New York Times has just published a report indicating the existence of a secret Pentagon plan targeting Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and North Korea and even Russia and China.
The plan apparently envisages the possibility of using nuclear arms for offensive purposes, for example in the framework of an Arab-Israeli conflict.
To quote John Isaac, a leading figure in the voluntary sector in the United States, Doctor Strangelove is alive and well and working in the Pentagon.
This lurch by the American superpower, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, towards a permanent war footing poses an intolerable threat to the entire planet.
The United States is redefining its role in the world around one single obsession, namely its own security.
But in this world, right cannot be exclusively and invariably on the side of the Americans.
It was impossible not to be concerned at the words of John Bolton, Under Secretary at the Department of State, who fired this broadside during the Conference on Disarmament, and I quote: 'Our policy is, quite simply, pro-American' and 'The United States ? will meet this threat with every method at our disposal'.
This policy, which entails a 15% increase in the military budget, equivalent in monetary terms to the entire state development aid provided by all OECD member countries, along with the planned anti-missile defence system, is liable to provoke a new arms race.
The fight against terrorism, on the other hand, involves identifying its roots and seeking real solutions.
And again, the United States is obstructing progress towards a fairer world by refusing to ratify several international conventions, such as those on the rights of the child, disarmament, biological weapons, the International Criminal Court, climate change, the Kyoto process and a host of others, not to mention the failure of the United States to adopt a sufficiently impartial position on the Middle East conflict.
We can no longer be silent on the death penalty, a crime perpetrated by the state, where it is administered by a superpower that seeks to impose its order and its values on the world.
We want nothing to do with that particular value.
Numerous people, including US citizens, reject that vision of the world and aspire to globalisation based on solidarity.
This was one of the messages that emerged from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Europe must take heed of the ardent hopes of those who are exhorting us to play our part in the pursuit of that goal.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, transatlantic trade relations have often come under strain.
We have been able to resolve many trade conflicts in a professional way that satisfied both sides, but only because we have accepted binding rules for free and fair world trade within the framework of the WTO, and also because the WTO is the only international organisation that has a dispute resolution system that also provides for sanctions.
However, with the punitive tariffs the United States is now imposing on steel imports, they are abandoning the common ground that we have so far occupied under the WTO.
It is extremely hard for us Europeans to understand these measures, as they primarily hit our steel products.
Almost half of Europe's steel exports to the USA are affected by these punitive tariffs.
What is more, we Europeans can expect to suffer twice over from the American measures, because of diverted trade flows.
That is something we are not prepared to accept.
We will not support the Americans' game of playing off their workers' interests against those of our own workers.
Over the past few years, the European steel industry has had great success in carrying out restructuring, but this has involved enormous job losses, making this a very painful process.
It must be clear for the United States that it is not in their interest to undermine confidence in the WTO's system of multilateral rules and its impartial conflict resolution system at the beginning of the Doha Round.
In the case of bilateral contacts with the USA, the European Union needs to firmly demonstrate to our American partner that this serious and unwarranted interference in free world trade will not be simply accepted, and that we will make use of the mechanisms currently at our disposal.
Why is the Commission not considering using the mechanisms available to it in accordance with the decision of the WTO panel on US export promotion and taking countermeasures?
I believe it is now necessary for us to make that clear to the Unites States.
Mr President, behaviour which is apparently irrational usually has an explanation.
President Bush's decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational.
The tariffs are a flagrant breach of world trade rules.
There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports.
US steel has been uncompetitive and in deep trouble over a long period; it has not become so suddenly.
Tariffs will not solve the US steel problem, but they will badly harm America's allies.
They will destroy American jobs in other sectors and they will damage world trade relations.
Knowing all this, why would President Bush take this irrational decision?
We know why.
He wants to buy votes in steel-producing areas come November and is so desperate to do so that he will gladly sacrifice his international credibility - and we in the EU and others elsewhere in the world are meant to pay the price!
Talk about collateral damage!
Of course, this cannot be tolerated.
We do not subsidise steel, we do not dump steel.
We went through terrible times to make our steel competitive.
Our market is open.
There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers.
Remember, this is the President who thinks he can provide world leadership.
Global leader in military power he may be, but he is a global dunce in citizenship and respect for others.
Commission: take him on.
You have all of us behind you and you have the tools to ensure that you can act both legally and effectively.
Go for it!
Mr President, I am dismayed at the United States' belligerency towards the free market in steel, particularly since free trade has been the hallmark of the USA since the 18th century.
I am appalled at the concomitant weakening of the all-important transatlantic alliance that this creates: an alliance that is the world's greatest force for peace today and one that gives unrivalled opportunities for prosperity to the world's 1 billion poorest people.
But since the European Union and the USA share essential values, I cannot believe that the US seriously intends to follow this destructive course of action.
I therefore see this as a purely political manoeuvre - President Bush placating domestic and special-interest lobbies.
We must be tough and then we will succeed.
The cause is good.
The arguments are correct.
I firmly support the Commission and the Council of Ministers and I believe that with EU backing and pressure, the World Trade Organization will act correctly and throw out the US position, and that President Bush will welcome this.
Mr President, the events of 11 September ought to have strengthened transatlantic relations by virtue of the emotions they unleashed and the solidarity displayed.
On the contrary, it appears today that relations have been weakened.
The North Atlantic Alliance, which took the decision to invoke Article 5 of its charter for the first time, is in crisis because the Americans did not see the need to enlist the aid of its organisational structure in the war in Afghanistan.
NATO is mulling over this manifestation of unilateralism, and no one within the organisation wishes to see it as proof of the Americans' indifference towards their European allies.
I too support this view and share the ensuing frustration, but I do not subscribe to the overall conclusions drawn from it.
I have always been a proponent of the idea that the prevention and management of crises by the international community should be regionalised.
Our experience at the start of the Balkan crisis showed us that sending in troops from all corners of the earth, from Vancouver to Vladivostok and from Moscow to Buenos Aires, for all its huge symbolic value, was not an efficient way to proceed.
Effective intervention in the maintenance and restoration of peace in specific parts of the world depends on familiarity with the culture and history of the country in crisis.
This is what prompted the international community to support the establishment of a pan-African peacekeeping force, for example.
It is also what prompted the Americans to base their operations in Kabul directly on the provision of support to the Afghan forces who were opposed to the barbaric dictatorship of the Taliban.
As I said in Brussels in 1993, the primary mission of NATO is to intervene in European territory and on the fringes of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, in order to guarantee and develop peace and stability throughout these areas.
Within the Alliance, I believe it is legitimate that the Americans, who are aware of our prosperity, require us to assume an increasing share of the burden of maintaining a European defence system that has hitherto fallen almost entirely on them.
I believe that Europe must prepare itself to take over a leadership role which the Americans are willing to transfer to us gradually.
To this end, the governments of the Union must possess the necessary will and must provide the necessary resources.
Do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Europe is finally ready to assume this role?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on what was said this morning.
I believe that transatlantic relations are regularly subjected to crucial tests.
What we are experiencing now is nothing new; it is not a new conflict.
Steel is an old chestnut.
As many Members have already indicated, we need to proceed with sufficient toughness.
But we should also be guided by reason, wisdom and far-sightedness.
The President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out that our relations are historical ones and that we have many values in common, but that we need to shift from a crisis situation to a process of dialogue.
I would certainly support him in that.
However, this also means that the Council needs to consider new initiatives.
It was the Spanish Presidency that established the new transatlantic agenda.
I believe that the Spanish Presidency should also undertake an analysis and a review and present new proposals at the next summit.
I would like to ask what work you have done on this so far and what the nature of the Spanish Presidency's proposals will be.
We need an update, as James Elles said this morning.
We need an EU strategy that goes beyond what we have at present.
The Commission proposal is good, but it does not go far enough, and it does not cover all factors.
In particular, it does not include a sufficiently clear EU strategy.
Commissioner Lamy said today that he is investigating several areas, including intellectual property and the auditing of accounts.
In my own report, which I shall be presenting on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy together with James Elles for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall be presenting some proposals on this.
In particular, you will be interested to see that economic relations are very close and that in many sectors it is already fair to talk about a transatlantic market.
That does not of course mean that trade conflicts can just be glossed over, quite the opposite.
A small delegation of us will be in Toledo on Monday, and the topic of relations between the USA and the WTO will be on the agenda.
I would be grateful if you could briefly say something more about our approach at that meeting.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, can anyone tell me what has been happening in the United States since Mr Bush took up office?
With a straight face, he has proclaimed unilateral measures, measures which a) are counter-productive to transatlantic relations, b) do not conform to WTO agreements and c) will lead to a wave of protectionism in the world.
A 30% import tariff on steel, mainly aimed at the European Union, is a great injustice.
Has our European steel sector in recent years not been restructured very successfully?
We do not have overcapacity now.
Due to the import restriction in the United States, the price of steel will increase over there, upon which the urgent restructuring of the American steel sector can be funded.
However, the outcome for Europe is an increase in imports through dumping on our market, which translates into falling steel prices, with all its implications, particularly for employment.
A company such as Corus in the Netherlands and in England will be hit extremely hard, for this latter scenario will lead to a huge number of job losses.
I would like to ask the European Union, and especially Commissioner Lamy and the Presidency, what does it intend to do about this?
Mr President, I was Minister for Steel in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 1989 and was responsible for an industry which was over-manned, uncompetitive, riddled with old-fashioned practices and heading for disaster.
When it was privatised, it experienced a traumatic time with the loss of plants and jobs, and morale was at rock bottom.
However, it had to be endured to secure any future at all.
We do not want that to happen again because an outside agency such as the United States has seemingly broken WTO rules, especially since the US itself should restructure old plants, rationalise employment and pension practices so that its own industry is improved, but not at the expense of European industry.
I find it disturbing, to say the least, that Romania is one of the countries exempted by the United States of America.
Romania is home to Sidex, closely connected to Ispat, the firm controlled by Lakshmi Mittal, which gave Tony Blair and the Labour Party GBP 125 000 for their general election campaign and then lobbied President Bush harder than anyone else to impose 30% tariffs that would protect his United States and Romanian steel interests at a potentially deadly cost to British plants and jobs.
Just whose side is Tony's crony on?
It does not appear to be British and European workers, since Mittal will make an estimated USD 1 billion from this deal.
That GBP 125 000 gift was a real steal - a cheap and cynical investment that will literally pay dividends.
Therefore, the Labour Government is not our answer - the Commission is.
We must support the Commissioner in his determined attempts to protest and, if necessary, retaliate - but carefully.
We need the OECD talks to continue and to produce success.
How about some targeted action against products from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia?
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the transatlantic relationship is very important: it was a priority of the last Spanish Presidency and is again under the current one, and we must therefore do whatever we can to preserve it.
What is happening is that, like any relationship, there are two sides to it, and we are now seeing that the Bush Administration is strongly tempted to act on its own; that is, to practise the Frank Sinatra doctrine: 'I'll do it my way', both in politics - I only have two minutes and I cannot expand on this - and in trade.
Trade never used to be an area that tested this relationship: we considered trade disputes to be an exception, while trade benefits were the rule.
Now, however, they have gone too far, on both steel and another product that is less talked about: clementines.
The cases are different: clementines affect just one country (the region, by the way, where Commissioner Solbes comes from) and steel affects us all.
Both cases go against the WTO rules without any justification at all and, what is more, they imply self-punishment by the United States.
We have to withstand both the indirect damage - I believe traffic diversion measures can be taken - and the direct damage.
There are several possibilities: one is to take action within the WTO, but that will take time and, in the long run, we shall all be dead; there is also the possibility of laissez-faire, of doing nothing, because the derived industries that import steel inputs will become less competitive and therefore we will be able to take over from them; but what I believe we must to is act immediately.
The provisional measures that can be adopted are within easy reach, covered by the panel judgment on the Foreign Sales Task Corporation, and therefore we must act immediately.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, in a well-known passage in Julius Caesar there is a sentence that reads: 'The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings.'
I think this quotation is particularly appropriate to this moment, because the seriousness of the problem does not lie so much in the protectionist measures that affect the United States as in the reaction that the European Union must have to these aggressive trade moves, relations in which the steel and clementine issues - referred to by my good friend Mr Westendorp - are not just isolated incidents but have their causes and their consequences.
Mention has been made in this House of the ban on imports of hormone-treated meat; the banana war; the export aid declared illegal by a WTO panel; the discussions that took place when the competition policy and certain mergers were implemented by Commissioner Monti; and the aid for certain American products.
What worries me most in this love-hate relationship, however, is not so much what has happened but what the future holds, which is that the Republican administration is on the point of succumbing to the temptation of protectionism, as shown right now in two cases: steel, which has been explained enough - and on this I fully endorse what my colleague Mr Atkins has said - and clementines, which have also been mentioned by Mr Westendorp.
In the latter case, as this House knows, the United States unilaterally closed its borders on 30 November.
The Spanish government and my Parliamentary Group brought these events to the Commission's attention on 12 December and the Commission then took immediate action.
Thank you for this promptness.
In addition, on 14 February the Spanish government requested that, in view of the breakdown of the talks that had been entered into, action should be started within the WTO.
What I am asking right now is that the same efficacy that people are trying to demonstrate on the matter of steel should also be demonstrated in the case of clementines. This is an even more flagrant case because, while in the first case it is a matter of imposing tariffs, which in my view are abusive and completely illegal, in the second it is about an even more drastic measure: the closing of borders.
This matter really does need to be taken to the WTO, but they will only reach a solution to this conflict, in the case of clementines, once several harvests have passed, and I therefore call for immediate compensation and reparations.
What we must do is make the United States sit round a negotiating table and work out a solution to the steel and clementines issues, by setting in motion the forceful measures to which my good friend and compatriot Mr Westendorp has referred.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, in the wake of 11 September the United States seemed to want to engage in a policy of broad partnership on an international scale.
It paid off its arrears to the UN and held consultations with the Europeans and many others.
However, since the State of the Union address, a hard unilateralist line has come to the fore.
This change of course appears to create the risk of serious aberrations, judging by the Pentagon report on the revision of US policy on the use of nuclear weapons, which could include the possibility of a first strike against Russia, China and many other countries.
This creates a difficult and disturbing atmosphere for transatlantic relations, which is compounded by the recent decisions on steel.
At the present time, it is important that Europe should reaffirm its role as a major partner whose friendship and solidarity depend on reciprocity.
This is essential if we want a balanced relationship between Europe and the United States, but it is even more essential for the stability of the world.
Europe must emphasise the impossibility of dealing with the instability, the dangers, the imbalance of today's world by merely wielding a big stick; it must emphasise that we also need to gain the upper hand in the struggle for peace, that we need to devote the same energy today to the fight against inequalities in the field of development and to defusing hotbeds of tension like the Middle East as has been applied to the struggle against terrorism.
As far as steel is concerned, Europe must take a firm line.
It is right and proper to issue a reminder, as Commissioner Lamy did this morning, of the need to submit to multilateral disciplines.
It is also crucial that we do not hesitate to ensure that other governments comply with rulings that the WTO makes in favour of Europe.
It will be obvious that I refer here to the Foreign Sales Corporation.
And so I should like to ask the Commission if it has the intention of applying the retaliatory trade sanctions that the WTO has authorised us to impose, given the decisions that the United States has just taken on steel imports and the violations of trade agreements that the United States has already committed through its use of export subsidies.
Relations between the European Union and the United States are inextricably linked.
We have strong bonds rooted in our respective pasts and we share many common values.
The strengthening of our long-standing transatlantic relationship is to our mutual benefit.
However, this has to be a relationship based on equality and mutual respect.
In America's hour of need, after the 11 September attacks, Europe responded with unstinting support and solidarity, and rightly so.
Regrettably, though, the same sort of solidarity and cooperation has not been reciprocated in US foreign policy.
Prior to 11 September, it was absent on the issue of Kyoto.
It is non-existent with regard to a common approach on the Middle East, which is our most critical contemporary political problem, and on which the US unfortunately adopts a partisan role.
It was cast aside by the recent decision on the part of the US to impose import tariffs on steel.
Furthermore, the return to US unilateralism - especially evident in its perceived intention to extend the war on terrorism to Iraq - displays contempt for our role in international affairs.
It would seem that for the US, the transatlantic relationship is simply one of convenience, to be used when it suits, but ignored when US policy and interests take priority.
All these experiences, particularly those in recent days, underline how essential it is for the EU to strengthen its foreign policy role, including its defence and military capabilities, so that a proper equilibrium can be established in our transatlantic relationship.
Mr President, this week in Barcelona the European Council will gather in order to seek to build upon the Lisbon Process.
At that meeting, we will be pressing for more action to be taken in relation to deregulation, for more liberalisation, ensuring that we learn the lessons of employment flexibility.
There are those of us who have felt ever since we have arrived in the European Parliament that there is a lot of rhetoric in this place about free trade, but that there is also a great deal of protectionism with Member States here in Europe.
The entire agenda in Europe of taking forward a uniform competition policy and bearing down on state aid is geared towards ensuring that we have free trade.
In those circumstances, those of us who count ourselves as the best friends of the United States are hugely disappointed by the action that the US President has taken.
It is not putting it too strongly to say that, in a sense, we feel betrayed by it.
I do not link this to our support for the United States following the events of 11 September.
The events of 11 September were so horrific that they should not be linked with any sort of agreement in any other policy area.
But for those of us who have been pointing to the United States as an example of a deregulated and liberalised economy, it has been a shattering blow to see the way in which President Bush, faced with the difficulties that his steel industry is encountering, has gone for protectionism.
What is even worse is to read in the Financial Times today a justification of this action from Robert Zoellick, the US Trade Representative.
I feel sorry for Mr Zoellick, whom again we would regard as a friend of British Conservatives, because I must say that article destroys any credibility that he had in terms of discussion of trade issues.
The United States representatives watching this debate need to know that, while we may have heard from the usual suspects in terms of anti-Americanism, those of us who are friends of the United States feel very badly let down indeed.
Transatlantic relations are now in stormy waters.
The dingy of the European Union is struggling hard to cope with the waves of American power display.
The steel crisis is mainly political.
President Bush is backed internally by his electorate.
Retribution or a political reaction were not likely from the outside world, which opened up the opportunity to pass on the problem of unemployment to the outside world.
The European Union dingy is now wearily following a course of legal procedures.
We must take full advantage of all the options and means available to us within the WTO.
Our retaliation must be convincing.
But even so, it does not give much hope of a positive outcome in the short term.
Our boat should be big enough to weather the storms. But we also need good helmsmanship.
A political crisis does require a political answer, and we must deliberate upon this.
Meanwhile, I should like to urge the Commission, and above all, Commissioner Liikanen, to take political action internally.
We must build a solid ship.
We hardly have a steel policy left, let alone a steel strategy.
We are on an ocean without any rescue boats for the workers.
If there is anything to learn from the steel crisis, it is that European steel policy should be restored.
Mr President, we can all stand here today and condemn the actions of the US Government in imposing these unjust, illegal and completely unfair tariffs on steel products imported into the USA.
We all know that the tariffs have simply been put there for short-term political advantage and we regret it for that alone.
But we must also stand united behind some clear, firm and serious action.
We must show we mean business.
The Commission must now act swiftly within the WTO to overturn these tariffs.
We must see safeguarding measures brought in to prevent a flood of cheap imports from damaging our own industry.
Those measures must be implemented in respect of all non-EU sources of steel in the form of quotas based on 1998 import levels if we are to do a proper job in protecting our own industry.
I do not recommend fighting fire with fire in this circumstance.
Instead, we must dump a large cold bucket of logic, common sense and international law onto the head of the US Government and bring it to its senses.
Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has listened very carefully to all the speeches made during this debate and we have taken very good note of the positions expressed.
As the Foreign Minister has already stated in his introductory speech as President-in-Office of the Council, our commercial policy is a common one, and the European Commission has full autonomy and authority to make whatever decisions are appropriate.
Accordingly, I believe the Commission has, on behalf of the European Union, taken a firm stand on the steel problem, a stand that was publicly expressed and unanimously adopted by the Council of Ministers last Monday.
I therefore believe we must trust the Commission's ability - as I have said - to deal with this matter, protest as appropriate, call for suitable compensation and use retaliatory measures, while fully complying with World Trade Organisation rules.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council believes that our most powerful option is to call on the United States to comply with the rules that all the founders of the World Trade Organisation have set for themselves.
It is therefore very important that the European Union should set the example that we are the first to comply with not only the procedures but also the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
The clementine issue has also been mentioned - another trade issue with the United States that has yet to be resolved.
In this respect, the Presidency-in-Office can only say that it is up to the Member State affected - in this case Spain - to submit its claim to the Article 133 Committee and the Commission will act in accordance with what the Committee decides.
Everything seems to indicate that the measures adopted are disproportionate to the alleged threat from the so-called Mediterranean fly, which has been the argument used by the United States to ban the import of clementines.
These points will be assessed by the Article 133 Committee, which deals with such matters, and the Commission will be given a mandate to act accordingly.
With regard to other considerations that have been expressed here on the United States' lamentable tendency to act unilaterally in many areas, not only in these matters of trade policy but also in other matters of general policy, the Presidency can only agree with many of the positions expressed here. I therefore believe that the forthcoming EU-US Summit to be held in Washington on 2 May will be a good opportunity for the Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Commission to remind the United States' President that the spirit of the Transatlantic Declaration, which, as has been mentioned, was signed in 1995, binds the parties to maintain a spirit of cooperation, to seek common ground and not to seek ground that separates us and, in the fine tradition of the intense relationship between the United States and Europe, it is in the interests of both parties, the United States and Europe, to seek points of agreement and not of disagreement.
Positions that separate the United States not only from the European Union but also from the general current of international opinion are, of course, not at all helpful in finding points of agreement.
I believe this debate has been highly fruitful; we shall incorporate many of the opinions we have heard here into the general corpus on which we shall reflect in order to prepare the forthcoming transatlantic summit, and so I should like to thank you, Mr President, and this Parliament for all the ideas that have been put forward in this debate.
Mr President, I should first like to point out that the Commission also believes that our relations with the United States are essential, but that must never stop us from firmly carrying out the actions needed to defend the Union's interests.
Today's debate has drifted towards the existing conflicts between the United States and the European Union, particularly the steel dispute, although other matters have also been mentioned.
The major problem facing us is what we should do.
According to some of you, the best formula is to establish a link between the steel dispute and other trading problems with the Union.
Really, though, as our strong point is upholding multilateralism, it is reasonable that we should attack that contradiction by applying multilateral rules.
We do not think it is a good solution and it is not the one that best serves the Union's long-term interests.
Others amongst you have suggested linking this issue to other matters; the Foreign Sales Act has been mentioned, as has the matter of hormones.
Again we wonder whether seeking a package solution dependent on a political debate is the formula we should be using.
We believe that the strength of our position with the United States lies in the need to comply with what has been agreed multilaterally.
This must be the road we take; we therefore consider that the first decision, without any question, is to use all existing procedures within the World Trade Organisation, and by all procedures we mean not only those that will take a long time to implement but also the necessary retaliatory measures, but all this must be done through the World Trade Organisation.
This may, of course, make it necessary for us to implement specific safeguard clauses which, I may say in advance, we intend will affect developing countries as little as possible, since our opinion on safeguard clauses is not to close off our markets but to maintain our traditional trade relations with our suppliers.
Clearly, the possibility some of you have suggested of making restrictive voluntary agreements to reduce exports is not compatible with the World Trade Organisation.
With regard to the clementines case - the President-in-Office of the Council has already referred to this matter - I shall only point out that we are negotiating with the United States in an attempt to find a solution to the problem before the next harvest.
Clearly, in this case too, just as in the last one, we are prepared to use all the legal resources established in the World Trade Organisation.
The Commission has been pleased to see the broad consensus among the European institutions regarding the need to make multilateral institutions work and to tackle the challenges of globalisation by seeking the best of solutions with our American counterparts and seeking to ensure that the unilateral option is not the one chosen.
I endorse Pascal Lamy's comments here this morning that it would be fundamental to seek an agreement, as we have seen here, among all those supporting a new and positive boost to transatlantic relations.
However, that must not mean failing to tackle existing problems with all the means or all the facts at our disposal.
As you know, right now we are studying and working on various options, and any new contribution this House might make would be welcome.
Lastly, I should like to thank you for your unambiguous support for the firm line held by the Commission.
We hope that the resolution you are to vote on will strengthen the European Union's positions on this fundamental issue for us all.
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the Oral Questions:
(B5-0010/02) by Theodorus Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the Council on Modernisation of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 on free movement of persons and its extension to third countries' nationals legally residing in the European Union
and
(B5-0011/02) by Theodorus Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the Commission on Modernisation of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 on free movement of persons and its extension to third countries' nationals legally residing in the European Union.
Mr President, firstly I should like to apologise for the absence of our committee chairman, Mr Bouwman, who unfortunately is ill this week, so that, as Parliament's rapporteur on this issue it has fallen to me to introduce the question.
Parliament has long been aware of the problems concerning the legal base for the inclusion of third country nationals on the same footing as European Union citizens under the proposed simplification of modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
As Members know, this regulation seeks to coordinate social security systems between Member States for people moving and working across borders.
Some of the reservations I have heard voiced about the extension of this regulation to third country nationals border, at times, on the xenophobic rather than the rational.
You will be aware that the legal opinion provided by Parliament's Legal Services felt that Articles 42 and 308 of the Amsterdam Treaty, as initially proposed by the Commission, formed the appropriate legal base for this extension as well as for the regulation as a whole.
The European Parliament agreed, as did the majority of the Member States, and that legal base provided for the equal treatment of third country nationals legally resident in the European Union and for the full involvement of Parliament through the codecision procedure.
Additionally, this parity of legal base seemed to many of us to provide a strong signal in terms of the recognition of the contribution from third country nationals to the life of the European Union and certainly met the twin aims of simplification of the process and natural justice.
To me that parity was a clear signal of an inclusive Europe.
I and many others find ourselves at a loss, on reading the Khalil judgment from the European Court of Justice, to understand why this should materially change the legal base on which Council and Commission are now proposing the extension of the regulation.
The Khalil case, insofar as legal experts have explained it to me, involves people covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 already, should they be allowed to legally reside in another Member State and thus cross borders.
They are included under this judgment because they are stateless people with rights to social security equivalent to those of nationals in the state in which they now reside as a result of international historical agreements.
But no right of free movement is provided for by their inclusion under the regulation.
The regulation does not grant freedom of movement.
It maintains certain rights for those who move through coordination of social security systems.
Council's statement last December and the Commission's new proposal do not explain the change in the legal base.
They simply state it.
It is an explanation that Parliament is now seeking.
What specifically in the Khalil judgment has led Council to its conclusion that Article 63.4 is the correct base, when this was not the majority opinion before?
Has the European Court of Human Rights case of Gaygusuz v Austria providing for nationality being no barrier to equal treatment to nationals in relation to social security not led to a conclusion of equal treatment in relation to the regulation and thus the parallel legal base?
And why should the European Parliament not be involved in this area which is directly relevant to the lives of so many people?
Hence our desire as well also to clarify the situation of workers in accession countries during any transition period when they will not be enjoying freedom of movement.
Council and Commission will also be aware of this House's concern for the complex situation facing cross-border workers.
The Belgian Presidency had put forward a number of proposals in this area, yet the agreement reached at present is only minimal, as parameter 8 concerning medical treatment shows.
So what are the prospects for further improvements for this group of workers?
We are also asking the Commission for its perspective on a number of issues where Council seems to be less enthusiastic about the Commission perspective as well.
We would also ask whether the increasing links between the tax and the social security systems are being addressed by Council and Commission, either within the context of the regulation or elsewhere.
We are all well aware of the desire of Council and Commission to see increased mobility within the workforce and, as a Member of Parliament's Committee on Petitions, I know as well that a number of those who work in other Member States find their situation made more difficult by the lack of effective information, but also by anomalies within the coordination system.
Many of us are concerned that Council appears reluctant to make free movement an easy reality.
We know this is a complex administrative issue, but many of the niceties of exclusion of certain benefits and complex rules simply appear as barriers.
It appears at times that it is easier to move ball-bearings around the European Union than it is to move people.
Mr President, on 6 February 2002 the Commission presented to the Council a proposal for a regulation to extend the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to nationals of third countries who, solely as a result of their nationality, are not covered by those provisions.
The said proposal is based on paragraph 4 of Article 63 of the EC Treaty.
The Council has agreed on the possibility of using paragraph 4 of Article 63 as a legal basis, as the Commission proposed.
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to adopt measures which define the conditions under which nationals of third countries, who reside legally in a Member State, may reside in other Member States.
The Council considers that Article 42 of the EC Treaty, interpreted in the light of the judgements of the Court of Justice - in particular the judgement handed down in the Khalil case C-95/99 - does not seem to offer a sufficient legal basis for this extension.
In fact, Mr President, it can be deduced from the Khalil judgement that the Court has not criticised the inclusion of stateless persons and refugees in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, based on Article 51 - currently Article 42 - of the EC Treaty, solely insofar as it involves a small category of people, in relation to which the Member States have made international commitments.
In fact, the Court decided as follows: 'The Council cannot be criticised for having, in the exercise of the powers which have been conferred on it under Article 51 of the EEC Treaty, also included stateless persons and refugees resident on the territory of the Member States in order to take into account the abovementioned international obligations of those States.
As the Advocate General pointed out in paragraph 59 of his Opinion, 'coordination excluding stateless persons and refugees would have meant that the Member States, in order to ensure compliance with their international obligations, had to establish a second coordination regime designed solely for that very restricted category of persons'.
Therefore, the Council believes that the applicable procedure for adopting a decision should be the one laid down in the EC Treaty.
If the legal basis adopted for extending coordination to third-country nationals turns out to be paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to give its opinion in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 67.
In relation to border workers, the Council has reached an agreement in principle in the field of sickness and unemployment benefits according to which the situation of former border worker pensioners will have to be studied.
According to the provisions of the current Regulation, the border worker may receive healthcare in the territory of the competent State, but does not enjoy this right as a pensioner.
For reasons of continuity, so that treatments already started may continue, the former border worker should be allowed to continue to receive sickness benefits in the territory of the State in which they formerly worked.
Finally, with regard to the unemployed worker, who during their last job resided in the territory of a Member State other than the competent State, the main objective is to incorporate them as best as possible into the labour markets.
Furthermore, it will be appropriate to guarantee the social protection of the unemployed while bearing in mind the financial aspects of the issue and guaranteeing effective control.
As regards the relationship between taxation and social security, this is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and not the Union.
It should be stressed that, in a general sense, the guidelines for employment for 2002 draw attention to the need to adapt the tax and benefit structures in such a way that they do not have a negative effect on participation in active life, particularly in relation to women.
Nationals of candidate countries who become Community nationals purely as a result of accession will be included, by virtue of that accession, within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
The possible exceptions to this principle, which could take the form, for example, of transitional periods, will be determined within the framework of the accession agreements, which are currently under negotiation.
Mr President, in response to the doubts raised in the oral question by Mr Bouwman, I would like to stress the following on behalf of the Commission: firstly, in relation to the legal basis, we agree with the view of the President-in-Office of the Council; in our opinion, the appropriate legal basis is paragraph 4 of Article 63 of the EC Treaty.
There is no need to read out its actual text, since the Presidency has already done so.
We believe that the Khalil sentence, of October last year, raises the inadequacy of the legal basis of Article 51 (currently 42) and obliges us to reconsider that of the Decision proposed in 1997.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the new provisions of Title 4, we believe that the appropriate legal basis is paragraph 4 of Article 63 of that Treaty, while bearing in mind that Article 308 of the Treaty can only be applied if there is no other legal basis.
You also ask for the Commission's opinion on a series of parameters proposed by the Council, specifically parameters 6, 10 and 11, relating to agreements between countries, unemployment benefits and family benefits.
With regard to the first point, the Commission believes that parameter 6 is acceptable, since this possibility is laid down in the current Regulation.
The Commission believes it positive that in the Regulation, unlike the current one, criteria are established to maintain these agreements, especially in cases which are more favourable to the person affected.
Secondly, with regard to unemployment benefits, the Commission regrets the lack of progress in relation to parameter 10, which does not provide any essential modification of the current provisions, above all because it does not offer any specific solution in the relation to the situation of border workers.
With regard to family benefits, parameter 11 does not correspond exactly to the Commission's proposal, but, in any event, the Commission considers it positive that that parameter intends to guarantee the beneficiary the maximum amount of benefits.
This parameter will improve the situation of pensioners and orphans in comparison with the Regulation, since these people will benefit from the same provisions applicable to the same category of family benefits as self-employed and salaried workers.
The relationship between taxation and social security is another of your questions.
It is true that Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 refers to the coordination of social security systems in the Member States.
There are no explicit rules for the coordination of these tax systems and this issue is largely resolved by the bilateral agreements on double taxation which have been reached by almost all the Member States.
The agreements follow the model of the OECD, which means that, in most cases, the income from salaried work (and also freelance work) is only subject to the taxes of either the country in which the work is carried out or the country of residence.
Therefore, if they are subject to the taxes of the Member State in which they work, that country has competence both in terms of taxation and in terms of social security.
The Court of Justice confirmed that, in the absence of harmonisation at Community level, the Member States have the competence to establish the criteria for allocation of fiscal competence in order to eliminate double taxation, but, in doing so, it is logical that they should respect the principles of Community legislation and, amongst others, that of the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
My final comments relate to enlargement.
Firstly, the negotiations with the candidate countries, as the Presidency has said, on Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in its part relating to Chapter 2, have provisionally been concluded - or have been concluded - with all the countries apart from Estonia, and this Chapter 2 also includes the coordination of social security systems.
However, the annexes are still under negotiation.
It has been entrusted to the administrative Committee for the social security of migrant workers, which will shortly present to the Council's working groups the results of its debates on entries, which the candidate countries have asked to be included in those annexes.
Finally, Regulation (EEC) No 1481/71 will be applied to nationals of candidate countries as soon as they accede to the European Union, since there is no provision for a transitional period in the field of the coordination of social security systems.
Mr President, I am both angry and sad.
Why?
Because I am not getting a straight answer from the Council or the Commission.
Within this internal market, we are in favour of the free movement of goods, people and services.
I have included people, for this is particularly a problem in border regions.
However, the answers that I am receiving are inadequate.
If I consider my own region, I notice that the labour market there can no longer function without workers from abroad.
Needless to say, we must make the conditions attractive for these people to come.
This means, first of all, that we must ensure that shop-floor workers who work in a Member State pay both taxes and social premiums in the same way.
I would therefore like to know whether it would not be possible to draft a kind of 1408 that applies to the fiscal status of border workers.
This is my first question.
My second question is directed at the Council concerning what is so nicely termed 'Council parameters'.
Incidentally, I very much regret that the Commissioner is not present, for he is truly competent in this field and knows how long this issue has been outstanding.
Studying these Council parameters - and, Mr Miguelez, I hold you in very high esteem - I note that what you have written in the Council parameters is diametrically opposed to what has been presented to us in recent jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice.
And I wonder whether you really believe that you can get this issue, in which Parliament has also been involved since Amsterdam in terms of codecision, approved.
For the aspects you mention, such as sickness benefit and child benefit, are incompatible with what has been pronounced, and the Commissioner will back this up.
So, with all due respect to Mrs Lambert, for she made some valid points on third-country problems, among others, which I endorse, a change is needed here.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had two reasons for asking these questions. First, to obtain some clarification, and second to get things moving in this whole field.
Clarification, because we Members of Parliament soon realised that the contributions made by Commissioner Solbes and the representative of the Council did not make it clear why the legal basis has been changed in Article 63(4).
It was simply stated, without any justification being given.
Since Tampere, we have taken very seriously the Council's announcement that the legal status of third-country nationals, that is to say citizens who live and work in the EU, who are legally resident here and do not come from one of the 15 Member States, should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals.
Europe's institutions want more clarity and transparency without waiting for the Convention.
However, these new proposals are creating more confusion than before, because, if we have to deal with two different legal bases, that is certainly very confusing.
It is also unsatisfactory because it rules out codecision by Parliament.
What a short-sighted strategy on the part of the Commission!
You know that up to now we have always been on your side when it comes to modernisation, to changing and improving things for Europe's employees, Europe's workers.
I think it would be not only very short-sighted but also a dangerous strategy to exclude Parliament at this stage.
It is of course possible for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to apply to opt out under Regulation 1408, and that would really be disastrous, because no one in this House could welcome a further social policy opt-out.
The result would be a patchwork quilt of a social policy which would certain not confirm and win the trust that employees ought to have in Europe's institutions.
So we are all delighted that the United Kingdom has stopped opting out of social policy.
Is this an attempt to reintroduce that?
The second reason for our question was of course to get the plans for reform moving.
I remember that an undertaking to update this directive was given in Edinburgh back in 1992. Please note - an update.
I would like to remind you once again that Regulation 1408 does not involve harmonising social systems, but is about coordinating the framework conditions, as it were, in order to encourage and support our citizens in making use of their scope for mobility in Europe.
Every couple of weeks there are fresh appeals from the Council and the Commission to young people, to workers, to the public in general, to take advantage of this freedom of movement.
However, I would like to say here that the framework conditions consist of some very complicated and unwieldy legislation.
In Germany we would say that is a book with seven seals, a closed book if you like, even for the initiated.
The 12 parameters that we now have before us do not add up to the qualitative improvement that we actually promised ourselves.
I naturally agree with the critical comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and also with the criticism that you expressed on behalf of the Commission, Mr Solbes.
The other point I should have mentioned was the time frame.
We had expected that the Spanish Presidency would have presented a methodical, reasonable and effective proposal by June.
Mr President, I agree with the Commission's and the Council's interpretation of the Treaties. Of course Article 63 is to be used as a legal basis for guaranteeing third countries' nationals freedom of movement.
Moreover, I have also in the past put forward the view that the actual legal basis was not perhaps the most important thing right now, for what is at issue is guaranteeing the rights of these people.
I think, however, that, in the long term, we must arrive at a situation in which Parliament also obtains direct influence on this area.
It will require a change to the Treaties, and I am ashamed to say that, during the negotiations in connection with the Nice Treaty, my own country resisted our obtaining influence over these matters because of the Danish reservation.
Moreover, I quite agree with Mrs Weiler that we must get away from a situation in which some countries are accorded reservations in connection with parts of such a policy.
We must all pull together.
Mr President, I can only say that I have taken good note of the observations of the honourable Members in this debate and that, naturally, the Presidency will consider this issue.
Mr President, I will try to answer some of the questions raised very quickly.
Firstly, the system of taxation and social security.
The tax system is the responsibility of the Member States and it is decided in accordance with the place of residence.
That is how it is and treatment varies depending on the Member State.
The social security system is regulated at Community level by means of Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 and is defined in accordance with the place of work.
We do not have fiscal harmonisation and that is the reason why the system I referred to earlier is applied, basically taking the agreements of the OECD into consideration.
The second point raised relates to what our objective is in relation to social security.
Our objective is, clearly, to apply the same social security system and the same rights to all citizens of the Union, but also for all legal residents.
With regard to the problem of the opting out by Ireland and the United Kingdom, as the honourable Member knows, it is true that the intention is to use the new legal basis.
Ireland has indicated that it is going to participate.
In the case of the United Kingdom, the issue is still open and it will be until the beginning of May, which is when it intends to adopt its decision.
Finally, with regard to the nature of the new text, it is intended to be more modern than the previous one, with a simpler and more accessible definition for users of the current legal system.
The new text is intended to include both the conclusions arising from the judgements of the Court of Justice and the various amendments which have been introduced since 1971.
It is true that there is a debate on the legal basis, but we believe, of course, that the one used is the correct legal basis in accordance with the current system, and it has clearly never been the Commission's intention to affect Parliament's rights in any way.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the report (A5-0062/2002) by Bruno Trentin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the state of the European economy - preparatory report with a view to the Commission recommendation on broad economic policy guidelines (2002/2014(INI)).
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a slow recovery in economic growth seems to be taking shape in both the United States and Europe, although the timescale and stability of this recovery are still uncertain.
Above all, the extent of the recovery already seems to vary greatly across the various sectors involved, and it is intertwined with restructuring and modernisation processes, which may be supported by heavy public investment and unacceptable protectionist measures, as is the case with steel in the United States.
The problem that the European Union is always faced with is how to prevent such a contradictory and non-uniform move out of recession from coinciding - because of a wait-and-see attitude of European governments and the Union - with a widening, and not a narrowing, of the innovation and competitiveness gap that already penalises Europe in comparison with the United States.
For this reason, the report I am tabling highlights the urgent need to adopt a proactive policy - at the Barcelona summit, let us hope - which is, above all, in line with the Lisbon objectives, a policy mix that makes the social agenda adopted at Nice an integral part of a coordinated economic and social policy centred on the objective of increasing the active population and achieving full employment.
This seems even more essential if one bears in mind the need to abide by the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, particularly that of keeping budget deficits down to within 3 per cent of gross domestic product, which only leaves rather modest resources available for a counter-cyclical economic policy in the individual States.
We therefore stress that it is not a question of concentrating new powers in Brussels but rather of making very selective choices and coordinating state intervention in order to achieve a critical mass, creating positive synergies of public intervention and private investment at a European level.
It is a matter, then, of choosing.
In the report we uphold the need to prioritise the revival of a policy of investment instead of an across-the-board reduction in the tax burden, except for further exemption from labour costs.
In the area of public and private investment, we insist on a resumption of the Lisbon strategy, which today, especially in some countries, is making disturbingly slow progress.
This means giving high priority to channelling Community resources and national investment into strategic sectors like research and innovation, lifelong learning as an integral and inseparable part of the structural reform of the labour market, and the creation of a European network of infrastructures and services, starting with telecommunications.
In addition, Community projects need to be better coordinated with governments' economic and social policy guidelines, and not only coordinated better but in good time - by the summer, in this case - so that they can affect the decisions of the national parliaments, which must be informed of the initiatives of the competent European Parliament committees in due time and be involved in them.
We must not just hope for coordination but promote it too, for instance by proposing - through the Commission - forms of open cooperation between different governments on common projects concerned with research, innovation, lifelong learning and active ageing policies, the latter being a prerequisite for achieving a reform of social security systems that is not disastrous for workers' pension rights.
Social dialogue must also be involved in this policy mix, based on the need to set out the guidelines and financing methods for the continuing education policy.
The participation of the social partners in defining a modern welfare state, turning it into a decisive factor in sustainable development leading to full employment, is one of the cornerstones of the European social model.
At Barcelona we must therefore reject any attempt to weaken collective bargaining and to remove from the Charter of Fundamental Rights a major part of its content.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation.
But I would also like to say a few additional words about the report.
In Lisbon, a high-flown declaration was made that we would become the number one in the world.
It is now evident that things will not happen as quickly as some people had hoped.
We might now think that target was over-ambitious.
Perhaps we should be honest and totally forget it.
A lot of things are now attributed to 11 September and to the economic downturn in the USA.
It is certain that the tragic events of 11 September had an additional negative impact, but negative economic trends had already set in before then in Europe.
In particular, from a German point of view we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is the largest economy in the European Union and that countries that have far closer economic ties with the USA, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have far fewer problems than we do.
We should move away from that.
However, I fear that the Barcelona Summit has again proclaimed ambitious targets without us having done our homework first.
When all is said and done, Europe should not raise expectations that the European Union does not have the power to meet. Instead, the individual Member States should take the announcements they make there seriously when they return home, and should do their homework, for example in the case of flexible working arrangements and corresponding tax reforms.
I would also warn against repeatedly talking about coordination at European level. This kind of coordination could lead to additional illusory powers at European level.
Ultimately, however, it is hard to move things forward in this area.
What we need at European level is an offensive on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is SMEs that will create jobs in the future, and we assume that nine out of ten jobs will in future be created in companies with less than a thousand employees. It is important here to create framework conditions so that SMEs are not overburdened with bureaucracy and all the requirements that Brussels creates, and that in future the individual Member States should provide appropriate knock-on financing.
However, at the end of the day it is also important for us to adopt a clear position here.
This is also evident from the debate about the warning letter.
I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Solbes for having insisted on the 3% being strictly adhered to.
The discussions that have taken place in recent months about this have not only been damaging to the stability and growth market, but have also adversely affected Europe's reputation, its economy and the euro.
We should turn our back on this sort of behaviour and have faith in our own economic strength.
We should not be saying that America needs an economic upturn because it will benefit Europe - we should be able to achieve an upturn by virtue of our own strength and our own convictions.
Just a few more words by way of conclusion.
I have just heard someone talking about "coordinating state intervention".
I absolutely must warn against that.
The best form of social policy is a good economic policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report has, first of all, the extraordinary merit of placing the European Parliament at the centre of the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines for Europe in the years to come.
The rapporteur starts from a correct and appropriate premise and gives a rational presentation of the real causes of Europe's current recession and provides a logical suggestion for an appropriate remedy.
First of all, at political level, accentuating the need for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play an active and regulatory role in laying down the broad economic policy options.
Secondly, in terms of public finances, highlighting the need for a stable reference point from which to reaffirm the absolute need to fulfil the final objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is to have a budgetary deficit of less than 3%.
The rapporteur nevertheless acknowledges and recommends an appropriate degree of flexibility, which is necessary if we are to use public policies as instruments of economic recovery, without making the zero deficit in 2004 an obsession that is disproportionate to today's reality.
Similarly, at structural level, he suggests and endorses the use of instruments to improve the general economic climate, in particular in training, in access to public services, in the creation of a knowledge-based society or in the adaptation of the labour markets.
Finally, he takes up the objective of the Lisbon Extraordinary Summit and pursues this objective at the Barcelona Extraordinary Summit.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would firstly like to express our support for Mr Trentin's report.
It is a very well-produced report which has sought a consensus.
We have been able to work together and the result will reflect the efforts we have made throughout its drawing up in committee.
This report could not have come at a more appropriate time: the day after tomorrow the Barcelona European Council will take place and it will deal with issues relating to the assessment to be made and the commitments to be assumed in relation to the Lisbon process, as well as, clearly, a series of issues which the Liberal Group has always insisted on and which the Commissioner is sufficiently aware of and which I am not going to repeat: the need to liberalise the most protected sectors; the opening up of the markets; the emphasis on training and education: the provision of more resources for scientific research and technological development; that is, the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives.
We hope that clear progress will be made on this issue at this meeting in Barcelona.
I would like to point out that the report by Mr Trentin does not exactly establish a social dimension, which is also included in the Lisbon objectives and that, unfortunately, they are not taken into account and, therefore, I believe that the demonstrations which have been organised against the Europe of capital - of this Europe which we are building and which is a reality - lack justification.
Mr President, may I say that Mr Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council, very clearly identified the key words of the economic governance of Europe.
As he indicated, the three wells from which the Union draws its economic policies are liberalisation, privatisation and competition.
These wells, if I may say so, contain toxic water.
The dismantling of public services which were operating more or less properly has been the source of all kinds of social havoc and inefficiency: the railways in Britain, the postal and health services in France, electricity supplies in most parts of Catalonia, and so on.
In Lisbon the Council spoke of making the economy of the Union the most competitive in the world by the year 2010.
At what price?
At the price of all-out, dog-eat-dog warfare.
We are far from the pursuit of happiness which the most perceptive politicians of the late eighteenth century regarded as an inalienable right of human beings.
Instead, we have the prospect of permanent stress, widespread insecurity of employment, mass exclusion and perhaps, in due course, the same tragedy that has now engulfed Argentina.
In Biarritz, Gothenburg, Nice and Laeken, grass-roots society has demonstrated against such aberrations.
Tomorrow, in my own city of Barcelona, there may well be more demonstrations.
I believe it is essential to listen to the voice of protest, and I feel that the Trentin report pays it insufficient heed.
Mr President, may I express my thanks to Bruno Trentin for the quality of his work and for being a good listener.
In his diagnosis he clearly emphasises that Europe is not cyclically dependent on the United States and that the research and technological-innovation gap between the two sides of the Atlantic is liable to widen, with the Union clearly lagging particularly far behind in terms of public and private investment.
But how should we respond?
Our Committee wished to adhere to the principle of coordinating national policies, which it sees as one of the mandatory precepts of the Stability Pact.
But who can fail to observe the extremely poor results of this coordination?
Who can fail to see that the Pact, while providing Member States with a useful discipline as far as public deficits are concerned, does not begin to define the policies that are required if the development targets set in Lisbon are to be met?
As for the intensification of fiscal competition, it compels governments to cut public spending, even on essentials.
And who can also fail to observe that the Member States will not let the Union acquire budgetary and fiscal instruments that would enable it to support a policy of investment and development?
This is why, unlike Mr Radwan and contrary to the letter of the report, I believe we cannot continue to operate within the bounds set by the present treaties.
It will be necessary to go beyond the coordination stage and try to extend the powers of the Union.
The broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact must be reviewed if we want to adopt a truly cooperative approach, and we must press for the Union to obtain the budgetary and fiscal instruments without which it cannot pursue real economic policies.
Accordingly, our Parliament should seize the present opportunity to take a historic initiative by formulating proposals for submission to the Convention on the Future of Europe.
It would be a cruel disappointment and, I believe, a political error of the first magnitude if the Convention did not try to strengthen the European Union and its powers in the sphere of economic policy at this precise time when some large question marks hang over the development and cohesion of our Community.
Mr President, Mr Trentin's work deals very clearly with important matters for the future of the Union, and it does so by appropriately combining economic and social approaches, in a context of involvement and participation, in order to maintain a social security framework, and of innovation as well.
One passage among so many seems significant, however: the one about the need not to wait for the effects of the American recovery.
Among the various reasons for agreeing with this statement is that we do not believe fully in the soundness of the revival across the Atlantic.
The reversal of the unemployment trend and an upturn on the Nasdaq contrast, in fact, with the sharp rise in oil prices, perhaps because of the winds of war blowing through the oil-producing countries.
Each of these aspects taken alone supports the points raised in the report before us, but they also support the need for it to have a wholly European focus, which includes maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact, because another perplexing aspect in the USA is, paradoxically, the increase in floating capital, perhaps as an intentional inflationary nudge to level off the huge public investments that have been made.
This is an aspect that Europe cannot allow itself, with fifteen economies that are sometimes profoundly different from each other.
Of course, the expectation is that as soon as possible the Union will achieve effective open coordination - in social as well as economic policy - with joint consideration of fiscal policies, but with the warning that without constant, real grass-roots participation there will be no economic growth that can be enjoyed by the general public.
The reference to greater participation by local players is explicit, as the second report on cohesion has shown, but from the standpoint of enlargement there is also a clear reference to wider enjoyment, or at least greater access to information regarding Community support, since the fact is that the EAGGF, for instance, has reported significantly low take-up rates in the Member States.
Similarly, what is needed for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, besides the hoped-for transparency about future action and the procedures for it, is the constructive requirement that the ways in which pre-accession funds are used should be better monitored, bearing in mind that in these countries, still coming to grips with setting up an own resources system, there are generally not enough funds available to support cofinancing.
It is, in fact, extremely difficult to justify scientifically, as the Union demands, the inclusion of environmental sites on the Natura 2000 list before the Trans-European Networks are built.
In the latter respect, more and better participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in Community plans and programmes would be welcome, as would their greater participation in transport policy, including attention to Community corridors.
In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that not only are the economic and social plans extremely opportune, but so is the harmonious and integrated way they are implemented, with a vision that goes from the new, near borders?
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am sorry, but I have to interrupt you now.
You have spoken for 22 seconds more than your three minutes.
Please stick to your speaking time.
It looks like Europe is not entirely happy with its latest toy, the 'euro'.
New areas of policy have to suffer interference from European institutions at the risk of being swallowed up by Brussels.
The issue that springs to mind is that of employment, which is currently in the limelight of the Brussels bureaucracy.
The report by Mr Trentin particularly mentions national areas of policy, such as education and labour regulations.
It is a report that pretends to deal with the economic situation, but, in fact, prescribes in a normative manner, that employment must be promoted through education and flexible labour in the Member States.
We are eloquently informed that the promotion of employment should be regulated from Brussels.
Education, scientific research and labour policy are mentioned as areas where Europe must play a coordinating role in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon process.
But how is Europe to do this?
And is Europe able to implement policy in those areas?
And maybe the most important question: do we really want Europe to have a say in this?
Education policy and policy allowing people to take part in the employment process belong with the Member States.
For it is they who know what type of education and what measures are needed to allow everyone who is eligible to do so to take part in labour and health care.
Precisely in the Member States, where the government and citizen are closer together, is it possible to let the wishes of those citizens be expressed.
In my view, these matters do not belong in a report on the situation of the European economy.
Let it be clear that I fully endorse the objectives of promoting employment, good education and a fair social system.
However, it is my firm belief that it is not the task of the European Union to contribute actively to policy-making in these areas.
It would therefore be wise if Parliament were to show restraint in this respect.
Mr President, six months after the attacks of 11 September, the United States is reverting to growth and job-creation while Europe lags behind, plagued by uncertainty and contradictory signals.
In this context, the Trentin report, which seeks to assist in preparing the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003, might have been expected to signal very vigorous reforms that could kick-start the European economy.
This is not the case.
All we see in it are reform proposals that are already very familiar, such as lifelong learning, support for research, completion of the market in financial services and the opening of the energy and transport markets, measures which will bear little fruit in the immediate future.
The report also contains the traditional call for close European budgetary coordination, which is said to release what the report calls 'positive synergies', whereas in practice it could well add to the rigidity that already exists.
For our part, we should like to take this opportunity to call first and foremost for a sharp reduction in taxes and other public charges, because these are the number-one problem in the countries where growth is slow.
This will inevitably be a major issue in the French election campaign in particular.
The European Union, of course, has no direct legislative powers in the realm of taxation.
This makes it all the more regrettable that Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira, in an article that appeared yesterday in a French daily newspaper, spoke out of turn by apparently stating that a candidate's promises to cut taxes were not backed by a corresponding pledge to cut public spending.
This comment is below the belt, firstly because our candidates' platforms have not yet been finalised and secondly because Commissioner Solbes is not the head of an economic government of Europe, there being no such thing.
He should leave the French electorate to decide for themselves.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my thanks for the positive atmosphere in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because not only this report but also those that follow - especially the legislative reports in the area of financial services - require a high degree of willingness to cooperate and need to be seen in the context of attempts to strengthen economic and monetary union as the motor of the European Union.
I therefore view the Trentin report in conjunction with the report already adopted on the economic consequences of 11 September.
We certainly always debated them together in committee.
I do not need to repeat that.
I stand by the Lisbon objectives.
Yes, they are ambitious - but we need ambitious objectives, because if we just tread water and are complacent we will achieve nothing.
However, we will only achieve these objectives if we do our homework.
That applies not only to the European Parliament but also to the Council and the governments of the Member States.
We need to get over this period of weakness, as it says in the report.
But to get over a period of weakness you have to take measures and not just wait. We have to recognise that we have a great deal to do and cannot just wait for an upturn in America.
We have to become independent from America's economy.
For me, that means we need a properly functioning internal market, in other words we must do everything to implement in good time the directives that have already been adopted, to eliminate obstacles to the internal market, and to achieve greater coordination in the internal market despite the variations in competence, in order to remove distortion of competition.
Our objectives are an action plan for financial services, structural reforms, observance of the Stability Pact and the principles of the social market economy.
Mr President, I would like to follow on from what Mr Karas has said, and refer to a level competitive playing field.
Yes, we certainly have an internal market, but we also have 15 sets of national circumstances within this internal market.
So there is not a level competitive playing field.
For example, there is not a level playing field between large companies and SMEs, because there are already wide differences in taxation between them, nor is there a level playing field between companies that operate globally and those that operate at regional level.
There is not a level playing field when you consider the system of taxes and charges in the Member States and how market access is guaranteed.
When we talk about wanting to become the most dynamic economic region in the world, that means that we have to increase our economic power.
In a nutshell, that means that we either have to rationalise, which is in the economic interest of individual companies, but not in our macroeconomic interest, as it of course involves job losses, or else we can increase turnover.
If we want to increase turnover, we need a market - we need customers.
Customers who must have money.
That means that we have to increase demand.
Demand must come from both public and private investment.
That means that people must obtain sufficient income from paid employment, if they are to be in a position to buy products in the first place.
It is no good having the very best, most well-designed, most durable and most keenly priced product if there are no customers who can pay for it.
I therefore simply believe that the contrast that is constantly made between economic policy and social policy is simply wrong.
Mr Radwan, you said that the best economic policy is simultaneously also the best social policy.
I would also like to turn that round: a good social policy is also a good economic policy.
I say that because there is a common denominator here, which is why investments have to be taken into account.
As I see it, education is not a form of consumption, but an investment in the future, because we have to develop new products.
To do that, we need a skilled workforce.
And that has to be built into this whole framework of investment activity.
Mr President, our old Communist friend Mr Markov has not come up with anything new either!
We are talking now about the Trentin report, which we unanimously adopted in committee, and which relates to the broad economic policy guidelines and to a decision-making process which in the first place concerns the Commission.
Parliament wishes to influence this process of coordination and opinion forming at a relatively early stage, without presenting a wish list the size of a mail-order catalogue.
However, this is not just a question of keeping ourselves busy: Article 4 of the EC Treaty specifically provides for this common economic policy, this coordinated economic and finance policy.
And, Mr Markov, that article prescribes the model as follows: "? in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition".
That is our principle, and that is why - not because it is what my group wants, but because it is part of the Commission's programme - the completion of the internal market and the further liberalisation of public-sector services are a priority, as is the fact that we need to equip ourselves for competition at world level, and the fact that we need to dismantle obstacles in the Member States and to tackle the process of reform.
That brings us to the question that Mr Radwan referred to: where does the Commission's responsibility end and that of the Member States start?
Where is subsidiarity appropriate and where do we need to act?
The only answer I can give is that whatever the Commission may bring forward and whatever Parliament may agree, in the past it has been more the Council, which is an amalgamation of the 15 governments, that has acted as a brake on this motor of European development, which has now of course become even more necessary than ever with the euro coming into circulation.
That is why this debate and Parliament's decision only make sense if we specifically call on the Member States to respect their commitments and not to lag behind.
That means that in the larger Member States, in which there is an especially big backlog of reforms, national reforms will have to be tackled.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Trentin for his interesting report.
Even though it contains a clear endorsement of the stability policy, the report, as I interpret it, is characterised mainly by attempts to find new avenues, create openings, relax the rules and bring about greater freedom of manoeuvre.
I also think that the amendments by the social democratic MEPs extend those lines of thought, in other words in the direction of creating a little more scope for expansion and innovation.
That is positive, for I believe that Europe's economy, which is still characterised by high unemployment, growing social problems and stagnation in important areas such as education and research, requires more expansion, dynamism and innovation.
Anyone who follows the politico-economic debate in the European Union will see that it is greatly concerned with rules, control, prohibitions, cohesion, coordination, discipline and such like.
Really, it does not sound at all as if we are discussing a liberal market economy, but a rather bureaucratic and ponderous economy.
I believe that vigorous efforts ought instead to be made to stimulate the economy and to channel public investment into education and research, something that is really needed if we are to realise the Lisbon objectives.
Major improvements in the environmental sphere also need to be made and, as Mr Markov pointed out, purchasing power needs to be increased and care taken to create demand so that companies can dare to begin investing again and so that we can invest in quality and in initiatives that help enable us to comply with the ambitious Lisbon objectives.
That is unfortunately not what I see.
What I see is something resembling a straightjacket, characterised by stability, rules and discipline.
That is not enough.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Trentin report surely lays the initial bases for major future decisions on economic policy.
These bases do, however, need to be more incisive and detailed in the proposals, so that they do not merely stand as statements of principle but can be swiftly put into practice.
European leaders must apply themselves to rewriting the model for the social and market economy, bringing it up to date and rethinking it with greater emphasis on the social commitment.
Signing up in general terms to innovation, training and flexibility and then backing out at the decisive moment is becoming not only disrespectful but surely detrimental to the working class as a whole.
Today, to get out of this rut, class and corporate interests must be opposed insofar as they are not compatible with modern reformism.
Rather than taking to the streets - or rather getting the workers to take to the streets - the trades unions should be asking themselves how much the workers took home between 1992 and 2000, given the productivity achieved by companies, which was certainly substantial.
The proposal to turn employment around is based on a new bargaining structure and real pay flexibility.
The new bargaining framework may be a regional or territorial system, half way between centralisation and company-level bargaining, with the aim of strengthening pay flexibility at company level where productivity is created and the individual contribution is valued.
A large contribution may be made by company profit-sharing schemes, which allow ordinary shares in the company to be acquired up to a certain percentage of gross profits.
It has been found that the companies with the highest profits are also those that use profit sharing to ensure that their best staff are paid effectively.
In the USA, the companies that adopt profit sharing tend to have higher pay and higher returns.
The pay of those who join profit-sharing companies goes up, while those that leave have to bear a substantial pay cut.
Mr President, I am going to try to quickly mention most of the issues raised and I would firstly like to thank Mr Trentin for his report.
It is a good contribution to the broad economic policy guidelines which we are going to discuss and I believe that, in accordance with our fundamental concerns, the report focuses on two objectives: one short-term objective; how to consolidate the emerging recovery and turn it into a lasting growth in Europe; and secondly, how to deal with our problems of growth potential and make progress with the Lisbon objectives, an issue which is particularly attractive at this time, immediately before the Barcelona Summit.
I agree with the view of some of you that our difficulties did not begin with 11 September. We were already in a situation of less economic growth and I also share the view that the impact of the evolution of the American economy has been greater than we initially expected, but I believe we should acknowledge that the Union's action in terms of economic policy during this period has been correct.
The monetary authorities have taken advantage of the lower risk in the field of price stability in order to cut interest rates, and budgetary policies have supported the activity by means of the functioning of automatic stabilisers and tax reductions which have taken place during this period.
I do not share the view that we have had a procyclic policy.
We only have to look at the impact the automatic stabilisers have had in Europe in percentage terms.
Good handling of macroeconomic policy is allowing us to achieve good results.
I believe that we can now say that the slow-down reached its worst during the last six months of the year and that the main indicators demonstrate that we are starting a recovery.
We are currently working on the round of forecasts for 2002 and I can point out that, according to those forecasts, growth has been gaining momentum throughout this year and we believe it will come close to potential growth and may even exceed it by the end of the year.
However, there are two elements of particular interest to us: firstly, the trend in salaries, which has been extremely helpful during this period - both in terms of stabilising prices and creating employment - and we hope the same trend will continue.
Secondly, the need to take advantage of recovery for budgetary consolidation.
We believe that this is a fundamental element.
The difficulties we have had to face during recent months have basically stemmed from not having achieved a situation of budgetary balance or budgetary surplus during the previous improvement in our economic context.
And in this respect it should not be inferred from my comments - which some speakers have referred to - that I had any intention whatsoever of entering into an internal political debate, but that I simply wanted to point out something that I have said many times and that is that, in my opinion, any reduction in taxes to confront our budgetary obligations must be based on budgetary surpluses or must be counterbalanced by spending reductions.
That is all I have said, I have said it many times and I am saying it again, but I do not believe it is the only thing coherent with our budgetary commitments.
Where must we go in the long term?
The answer is unquestionably to increase our growth potential, that is to say, to implement Lisbon.
And those are the objectives we are also going to find again in the broad economic policy guidelines.
How can we increase our production potential?
In the report which the Commission has sent to Lisbon, we suggest some of the challenges we consider fundamental.
It is true that Lisbon is a programme for ten years.
We are currently considering what we must do over the next twelve months and, in this respect, we must define certain priorities which we consider essential to the labour market.
Mr Trentin has mentioned this issue and in his motion for a resolution he stresses the importance of continuous training, mobility, flexibility and safety, as well as the non-wage costs of the workforce, above all at the lowest end of the scale.
I completely agree with each of these points.
However, I would like to add one point.
I believe we also have to consider that work must be worthwhile; we must have a system which provides incentives for participation in work and, to this end, it is essential to modernise the tax systems and also the social construction systems, as well as the legislation on work protection in order to favour employment.
I believe that we must avoid unemployment traps which clearly have a negative impact on our situation.
Safety in employment must be based on training and qualification, and this is a fundamental active element for everybody.
Safety in work based solely and exclusively on rigid protection legislation may be an advantage in the short term, but there is no doubt whatsoever that it hinders modernisation and greater economic efficiency.
As the Resolution stresses, employment is not just a problem of wage costs, but it is also a problem of wage structures which are well suited to the productivity differentials in each sector of activity.
In our report we also refer to goods and services, and your Resolution also stresses the importance of integrated networks of transport and services infrastructures, as well as the need for rigorous competition policy and proposes that consumers be offered the possibility of choosing between different networks of services.
The Commission absolutely agrees with these contributions and we also point to the need to make progress in investment in priority infrastructure projects, an issue which we consider to be fundamental in order to stimulate our capacity for long-term growth.
In our recent report on the application of the broad economic policy guidelines for 2001, we point out that in some network industries, the older operators still maintain high market quotas, an indicator that the opening up of the market is still not as desired.
Therefore, it is essential to make progress in order to have more robust competition which will finally benefit the citizens.
A final particularly important point has been mentioned by Mr Trentin, and also by some others, and involves the need to pay more attention to the knowledge economy.
Your Resolution stresses the need to attach more importance to R+D. It is true that R+D is an essential factor for a sustainable increase in productivity and competitiveness, which are essential elements if we want to achieve the Lisbon objective of making our economy the most competitive economy in the world.
And it is true that progress has been made with R+D, but it is also true that progress in the financial contribution is taking place essentially in the public sector, although the greatest differences in terms of investment in this type of activity arise in the private sector.
This is undoubtedly a point which warrants attention.
I hope some conclusion in this respect will emerge from Lisbon and we will have to work to try to improve this situation, just as I believe we should work to make progress with the Community patent, an essential element for technological innovation.
Mr Trentin has mentioned other elements connected to the participation of national parliaments.
Nothing would please the Commission more than greater participation by national parliaments in this type of debate and you as a Parliament, and in particular the IMAC, have played an important role in the past in support of certain initiatives of this type, which have undoubtedly been enormously useful.
I will end by saying that the Commission considers at this time that the broad economic policy guidelines, the basic document on guidelines, must continue to function in accordance with what was agreed in Lisbon, and in this regard it is absolutely essential to accept any contribution that the European Parliament may present in order to improve these guidelines.
Your contributions, together with the debates which are going to come out of Lisbon, will be fundamental elements for defining our document, which will be presented, as usual, in April, so that it may be debated in the subsequent months.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes.
