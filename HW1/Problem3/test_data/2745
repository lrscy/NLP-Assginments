Armchair manifestos are largely absurd descriptions of social reality and will be completely unrecognisable to Europe' s enormous army of unemployed and socially excluded.
A similar remove from reality is reflected in quite a few places in this report.
We see this, for example, in recital F, which emphatically opposes the attitude that 'labour market considerations are subordinated to economic policy' .
The Treaty' s convergence requirements and such like may, upon examination, perhaps be seen as wishful thinking, but the only problem is that the Treaty is out of step with reality.
The other remark I have to make is that employment policy and labour market policy, in general, consist, in large measure, of just such political confessions of faith. On the one hand, this means that we are operating in an area where what is decided is not legally binding, and this, of course, gives free rein to a lot of fine words and good intentions.
On the other hand, we are, to a large extent, in areas for which the Treaty provides no legal bases for proper legal regulation. What, however, there is, at present, no legal base for, there may in future be a legal base for.
I am thinking, for example, of the reference to harmonisation of social arrangements, of tax policy etc. However, I would remind you that, in Denmark, we have a saying about all good intentions, to the effect that 'the way to hell is paved with good intentions' .
Mr President, we all stand for a higher level of employment, indeed for full employment.
But how?
There are considerable differences in how we answer the question as to how we want to achieve this objective.
Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal.
We must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees - or transpose such measures, as the case may be.
This means, though, that we, together, have to be consistent in ensuring that there is a durable improvement in the economic conditions for our small and medium-sized businesses.
Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them.
Their productive capacity must be improved, and that by means of easier access to additional finance on more favourable terms and a distinct reduction in the tax burden.
Mr President, unemployment is the most serious problem facing our European national economies.
Young people, women, older people and people with disabilities have a particularly hard time of it.
There is a lack of access to training, vocational and continuing education, retraining and, of course, work itself.
Society's weaker members must, though, be strengthened in a spirit of solidarity.
Mrs Weiler is right to draw attention to the 1997 Luxembourg Summit.
The Member States have been showing their true colours since the guidelines on employment policy appeared.
Progress has been made in lifelong learning, in the application of practices which have proved their worth, in the involvement of both sides of industry and in action plans for local and regional employment.
Above all, though, incentives for active jobseeking and for investment in research and development, the reduction of the tax burden on work and structural reforms are all still lacking.
In this report, I do not find long-term strategies, but rather feverish measures for dealing with periods of slack growth.
Not everything can be blamed on the tragic events of 11 September.
Predictions of growth must be substantially adjusted, for example Germany's from 3% in January to 0.75% this week.
Chancellor SchrÃ¶der will not reach his goal of reducing the number of unemployed to 3.5 million in the election year, since the figure is expected to shoot up to 3.8 million.
His famous steady hand is trembling.
An additional EUR 2.5 billion will be required for unemployment benefit and for the Federal Institute for Employment.
If Germany, the engine of growth, falters, the whole of the European Union will be affected.
It is high time that there were financial concessions for SMEs.
Taxes must not be raised still further, especially at a low point in the economic cycle.
Tax reforms must be brought forward and the Member States must become more active in the fight against the black economy and tax evasion.
I urge both sides of industry to make employment contracts more flexible and further modernise the organisation of work.
In doing this, I am counting on the expertise and commitment of responsible managers and employees.
Mr President, I should also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report.
When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful.
The level of employment has increased and unemployment has gone down, and that is indeed progress.
Now that the economy is in decline, the moment of truth has, however, arrived, and I believe that the need for a coordinated employment policy is even greater than before.
Even though the situation is encouraging now, we still see shortcomings, such as women' s low share of the labour market.
It is not just that women' s share of that market is much lower than men' s. Rather, women are over-represented when it comes to atypical and precarious jobs in the labour market, even in countries which have a very high proportion of women in gainful employment.
As has been observed in recent years, there are also problems when it comes to the older workforce.
It is really a pity that such a small proportion of the population between the ages of 55 and 65 are in work.
In this area, a range of measures relating to the working environment, skill development etc. is needed if we are going to be able to increase these figures.
There are also very large regional differences and, for groups such as immigrants and the disabled, levels of employment are still very low.
I welcome the discussion about quality at work and about not only creating more job opportunities but also increasing the quality of those jobs.
In this area, a long list of measures is, however, required. That applies, of course, to the working environment, and especially to the new problems arising in the working environment in connection with people being stressed, excluded, burned out and such like.
It also applies, however, to the issue of life long learning. I believe that this is perhaps the most central issue if we are to be able to obtain economic growth and create more employment opportunities in the future, and that is why I am supporting this universal right.
I genuinely want to see a framework agreement at European level in which the social partners agree to this right. I do not know whether that is possible.
Otherwise, the Commission will have to act. However, it would be the best solution.
This right to skill development must then be adapted at national level within different sectors.
Finally, a view of the open coordination method.
The open coordination method exists parallel to legislation in the areas of employment law and the working environment.
The open coordination method is good, but is lacking in the areas of democratic control and transparency.
We must free the European Parliament to exercise influence on this process.
The open coordination method has grown in importance over the course of a long period of time. It has operated relatively well, but there is a lack of democratic control.
Mr President, I join with Mrs Weiler in many of her assessments and conclusions, and also consider much of what has been presented by the Commission to represent definite progress.
Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report.
First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate.
I found that illusory from the very start.
The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded.
It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours.
Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society.
The second problematic aspect - one to which Mr Andersson has just referred - is the split development of employment policy.
There are, of course, some positive trends.
Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased.
Modernisation really does have winners.
The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU.
The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded.
The law on employment contracts is 'made more flexible' but in reality it is relaxed.
We see the promotion of the low-wage sector.
The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited.
It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on the quality of her report.
This House has been an enthusiastic supporter of the quantitative objectives laid down at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils with regard to the overall rate of employment, the rate of female employment and the rate of employment amongst the elderly.
Unemployment, as has already been said, is one of the most serious economic and social problems the European Union faces and, currently, one in twelve citizens is unemployed, with the worst-affected groups being women, young people, the elderly, the disabled and members of ethnic minorities.
The 2002 guidelines for employment must be accompanied in all aspects by qualitative objectives, hence the importance of adopting special measures for incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion for the least-developed regions which lack the appropriate structures.
One pillar of the employment strategy, the entrepreneurial spirit, calls for priority to be given to the creation and growth of SMEs, which have enormous potential for job creation, as we can see from the most recent data from Eurostat, which shows that micro-enterprises with between one and nine workers made the greatest increase in terms of job creation in the European Union.
The report quite rightly highlights reducing bureaucratic and tax obligations as a means of stimulating the creation and growth of companies.
Nevertheless, we must reiterate that active support must be provided for the creation of infrastructures to support research and development, vocational training and lifelong learning so as to ensure the quality and continuity of employment.
We all know that the European Union will only become a knowledge-based economy if all Member States make investment in human resources their absolute priority.
While the European Parliament deliberates on a report on employment policy, a report that sings the praises of competition, and claims that the social market economy has proved its worth, this same market economy has recently claimed a further 4 000 victims, 4 000 Moulinex workers who now find themselves jobless.
I am citing the example of Moulinex, because the decision has just been taken.
I could, however, cite dozens of other businesses scattered throughout Europe, from Philips to Siemens, as well as several airlines.
This is a tragedy for many thousands of employees, and a disaster for the regions that are affected.
I would like to express my solidarity with the workers of these companies and my indignation at the attitude of their bosses, who have become wealthy on the back of the workers. The latter are made to pay for their bosses' economic blunders, and they are now jobless, have no wages coming in, sometimes after they have been in employment for many years.
These workers have reaped no benefits whatsoever from their companies' periods of prosperity, and in no way are they responsible for their difficulties.
Both governments and the European institutions are helping to prolong this despicable situation, where workers are suffering to enable company owners to safeguard their assets.
The money needed to finance jobs must be deducted from the wealth accumulated by shareholders, past and present, and from the resources held by banks.
Without this political will, these great promises on employment policy are nothing more than idle talk.
So, I warn you, workers will not let themselves be pushed around forever; the greed of their bosses and the policies that favour their employers will eventually cause social upheaval.
This is what will require a genuine employment policy, as it is this alone that will force those who have made their fortune on the back of others to shoulder their responsibilities.
Mr President, further to the present evaluation of the employment process, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission, and of Parliament too, of course, to two points.
First of all, there is the method of coordination itself.
It has become a popular method in the social sector with regard to a number of themes which fall within national competence but which create common problems across all European countries.
It is therefore possible to put forward common goals.
However, Commissioner, the success of the method, given the fact that it is not a binding mechanism, relies on the moral and political pressure that can be exerted.
Media attention plays an essential role in this.
The employment process based on the open coordination method has now been running for some five years, and a dramatic decline has been noticed in the level of attention given to this.
Media attention has waned and, as a result of this, there has been less pressure on national governments to take serious account of the objectives and of the annual criticism levelled by the Council and Commission at their national action plans.
The open coordination method is only successful insofar as convergence stress continues to exist, and efforts will need to be made in order to sustain its existence.
The question therefore arises as to how the pressure can be kept up. In my opinion, this should be one of the crucial points in the evaluation.
The second point is best practices.
The different reports include best practices for national Member States.
The question is: to what extent is a policy being adopted to actually learn something from those best practices?
How many Member States have visited projects in other Member States?
How many best practices have been discussed in the different Member States?
It is one of the methods, even if the pressure subsides, to keep the employment policy going.
I would therefore ask for both these points to be looked at in the evaluation.
Mr President, this is the fourth public debate in the European Parliament on the Employment Strategy.
The Employment Strategy is just one part of the European debate, but this is the first time there has been a general downturn in the economy, the first time there has been anxiety and, however much we want to avoid creating fear or panic, the situation is clearly going to be more difficult and problems with employment and economic development are bound to appear at the beginning of next year.
Several honourable Members have raised the question of the Lisbon target, that is, is it feasible and is the proposal in question an adequate proposal now that circumstances have changed?
It is true that the analyses underlying our proposed guidelines are based on the excellent results for 2000, which possibly painted the most positive picture of employment and job creation in Europe in the last twenty years.
The situation is different now, however.
Can we continue within the same framework?
Can we continue with the same approach to the employment strategy?
Mr Schmid put this question very clearly.
I think that we should start from the following premise: thanks to the reforms introduced on the job market over recent years, the common, healthy, budgetary base in the Member States and the efforts made to achieve monetary union, the European Union is better placed than ever before to cope with a recession.
Let me just remind you of previous recessions, which were exacerbated to a frightening degree by differences and fluctuations between currencies within the Union.
So today, we are better, much better placed to cope with a recession.
The second point is that, obviously, if serious problems arise in the future, we have tools to deal with them in the form of monetary policy and interest rates, in the form of economic policy and the margins allowed within the Stability Pact.
But what is important is for us to maintain the employment strategy without chopping and changing.
It is important for us not to make short-term changes, but to keep to our objective and step up the implementation of the employment strategy.
It would be a huge reversal at this stage if the Member States failed to focus their energies on efforts to apply the employment strategy as agreed.
There are very specific policies which the Member States need to develop in relation to the targets for employment quotas, the need to incorporate policies on the quality of work, better management of change, especially corporate restructuring, investments in human resources and policies on equal opportunities, where, it has to be said, the results of our evaluation in the joint report on employment were fairly disappointing.
The Member States have not put enough emphasis on policies for equal opportunities.
No major changes have been made in the proposed guidelines, first, because we made changes last year, taking account of the message from Lisbon, and because we are currently in the process of a more general evaluation.
The changes which we propose include three basic factors.
The first is the need for national targets.
The Member States need to set national employment targets.
The second is the need for policies on the quality of work, and the third deals with the widening wage differential between the sexes.
Unfortunately, there is still a huge discrepancy, as much as 15%, between men's and women's wages for the same work.
As far as the European Parliament resolution is concerned, I should like in particular to thank Mrs Weiler for her very serious approach and to point out that your reference to the question of rationalising procedures, to cohesiveness between individual procedures in the European Union is something we fully endorse - we are planning to move on to a new framework for the package next year - and that we agree with you wholeheartedly on the need for cohesion between the general economic policy guidelines and guidelines for employment.
I would refer again here to the agreement between Parliament and the Commission and the view taken by the Council that labour issues should be dealt with within the framework of the guidelines for employment and that the guidelines for employment should be policies which are absolutely distinct from the economic guidelines.
There are numerous points on which there is consensus and agreement.
There is the question of the social partners and their role, there is the question of flexibility and security on the job market and, to reply to Mrs Van Lancker, may I say that the Commission is determined to submit a proposal for a directive by the end of the year, due to the lack of success of the social partners.
This proposal is being prepared as we speak. There is a common view on the need to work with the candidate countries, so that they can incorporate the strategies for employment, and to step up policies on sexual equality.
Your text contains proposals for changes to the guidelines.
The European Commission will examine a good number of them.
Certain particularly important points to which I should like to refer are: the lack of adequate information on the financial means available to the Member States in order to apply the strategy; the need for a framework between the social partners and the Member States for applying lifelong learning to companies; the need to combine the objective of promoting mobility with reductions in regional inequalities and for stronger measures to combat illegal employment - this links up with the issue of immigration to which Mrs Weiler referred in her personal presentation - and the need to deal with specific entry barriers to women on the job market.
Honourable Members, we are planning to submit a revised proposal to the Council over coming weeks which takes account of these questions.
I should like to offer you my warmest thanks because the open and highly interesting debate on the guidelines in Parliament has enhanced the substance and role of the strategy for employment in European policy in general.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 tomorrow.
Exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents
The next item on the agenda is the recommendation for Second Reading (A5-0320/2001) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Common Position of the Council [7914/1/2001 - C5-0293/2001 - 1992/0449(COD)] with reference to the adoption of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum requirements to protect the health and safety of workers from physical hazards (vibrations) (16th individual directive under Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC).
Mr President, the Council of Ministers has presented a common position on mechanical vibrations.
There are a great many good things in the common position. The best is that agreement on a compromise has been successfully reached in the Council.
This means that there is now broad recognition of the fact that vibrations constitute a health risk, when it comes both to hand/arm vibrations and whole-body vibrations. It is also good that all three institutions appear to be in agreement as to a method of limiting these vibrations.
The key to this method is the parallel introduction of action values and limit values that should never be exceeded.
In the Committee reading, we talked a lot about the limit values.
That is really rather a pity, however, for it is in actual fact the action values that are the most important for, when the action values are exceeded, the employer is obliged to do something and to take preventative action to change the way in which the work is organised.
It is precisely this method which offers flexibility and emphasises prevention rather than injunctions.
Moreover, I find it very annoying that it is precisely this flexibility and the emphasis on prevention that have not been recognised at all by the opponents of the proposal here in Parliament.
That is a great pity, in view of the fact that they themselves often talk about flexibility and prevention rather than injunctions.
However, there are, unfortunately, also less happy facets of this proposal by the Council of Ministers.
The Commission' s original proposal has been weakened in a number of ways, and it has therefore been necessary to table some amendments.
I will go through a couple of them.
Amendment No 1 is a reminder that we still do not have the directives concerning the remaining physical agents.
We know that the Noise Directive is on the way, but we are now waiting impatiently for the latter, and it would be appropriate if, by accepting our amendments, the Commission were, today, to tell us that they are as committed as we are to putting these directives in place.
We have been waiting for many years.
Amendment No 2 is crucial.
As I say, it is good that the Council could agree to set a limit value, but when you consider how high it really is, you can also understand how agreement could have been successfully reached.
The proposed 1.15 m/s2 constitutes a significant weakening of the original proposal.
The report therefore proposes a limit value of 0.8 m/s2.
We know from the internationally recognised ISO standards that it can be said with certainty that there are health risks with exposure of more than 0.8 m/s2.
It therefore makes more sense to set a limit value in which the protection of employees will, in actual fact, be something real.
There is no question of any tightening-up. All that is proposed is a return to the level proposed by the Commission itself at first reading, and there is no new knowledge to justify choosing another limit value.
Some MEPs have repeated again and again that there is not one single proof of the connection between whole-body vibrations and injury.
That is simply not the case, however.
There is a quite clear connection between strong vibrations and injury.
That is something that science is agreed about.
It is true that we cannot put clear figures upon the number of people who will be injured in the case of a specific limit value.
However, that is how it will always be when it is a question of people and their working environment.
In such cases, the precautionary principle must be applied, and this is also something actually laid down in the Treaty.
Amendment No 5 proposes shorter transitional periods than those proposed in the common position.
Clearly, these could be applied in practice out in the real world.
With the common position, however, we should arrive at transitional periods of up to 12 years, and it makes almost no sense to legislate for such long periods.
Finally, on behalf of my own Group of the Party of European Socialists and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that makes it possible to exempt agriculture and forestry from the limit values for whole-body vibrations.
We have arrived at a compromise whereby agriculture and forestry, like aviation and shipping, are given the opportunity to be exempt from these limit values for whole-body vibrations.
We have done this because we remained doubtful as to whether agriculture could, in fact, comply with these conditions.
Allow me to emphasise two things in this connection.
First of all, I think that the farming industry' s impact assessments have been very exaggerated and therefore not to be taken seriously.
It has been maintained that farmers would only be able to work for two hours a day.
That, I think, is wrong.
I believe in actual fact that, in preparing the assessments, it has been forgotten that the directive only applies to employees and not to people who are self-employed.
The second thing it is important to state is that this compromise proposal does not mean that we are giving up combating harmful vibrations within agriculture.
It simply means choosing another method, and it is worth emphasising that the action values must go on being maintained.
I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond positively to our proposal.
I also hope that we shall obtain wide support for the proposals here in the House.
The text before us is balanced and reasonable and fulfils the main purpose of this directive, namely to ensure flexibility in the workplace at the same time as ensuring that employees are guaranteed the necessary protection against harmful vibrations in the workplace.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive which is before us for its second reading, falls within the scope of measures that aim to improve the safety and health of workers. As you know, this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important.
We must, however, find a fair balance between, on the one hand, the need to protect the health and safety of workers and, on the other hand, the need to prevent this directive from placing excessive burdens on companies and particularly on small- and medium-sized enterprises.
If we adopt overly restrictive exposure limit values, it could, in practice, and technically speaking, turn out to be extremely difficult to abide by them; it could actually harm the interests of workers, either because this could lead to their working time being limited to two hours per day, or because if the limit values are not applied, the protection they do have could be significantly reduced.
Since this report only concerns the issue of vibrations, we must also take into account the delicate and hard-won agreement between the various national requirements, and we must not impose further excessive restrictions on the sectors and industries concerned.
And in this respect, I would like to say that our Committee was not able to complete its work due to an incredibly busy timetable.
We were unable to interview all the relevant people involved before the deadline, and this is something I regret.
For these reasons, our group believes that the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are a relatively acceptable compromise between the requirement for the protection of workers and on the competitiveness of European industry.
Nevertheless, our group considers that it is essential to include the derogation option for the agricultural and forestry sectors, since the current arrangements for servicing and replacing machinery in these sectors would not enable exposure limit values to be effectively applied.
On a personal note, and particularly with regard to the work that we did last week, I would lastly like to thank Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her cooperation.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, I hope that this spirit of openness, as part of our conciliation work with the Council, will enable us to agree on a halfway point so that the directive can be adopted within a reasonable timeframe.
I am going to deal specifically with whole-body vibration.
As has already been said, there is evidence that whitefinger can be caused by hand-arm vibration, but I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that whole body vibration causes tremendous health risks for workers.
There is a slight health risk, but even the ISO standards say that there is no quantitative health risk, and so without further scientific evidence, I think it would be crazy for us to put more burdens on industry.
I am glad that the rapporteur has eventually agreed that we need a compromise on agriculture, so I urge you all to vote for Amendment No 11.
This would exclude agriculture and forestry for five years and then it would come back to Parliament after further research and scientific evidence has been provided.
If we do not vote for the compromise in Amendment No 11, I believe that the harvest across the whole of the EU will not be able to take place.
If we do not vote for it, tractor drivers, for instance, will be able to drive their tractor for between 2 to 4 hours in any 8 hour period and that is if we get the 0.8 m/s2 that the rapporteur is suggesting.
Even if agriculture and forestry is taken back, we need to go back to the common position of 1.15 m/s2 instead of the 0.8 that the rapporteur is proposing, because if we do not go back to that, other parts of the industry such as engineering, mining, construction will have tremendous problems, so I urge you to make sure that you do not vote to put more restrictions on industry when we do not have a quantitative health risk demonstrated.
I hereby beg you not to vote for the rapporteur's position on this and to go back to the common position and vote for Amendment No 11 and against Amendments Nos 2, 4, 12 and 9.
Mr President, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done sterling work.
I have been active in an advisory role vis-Ã -vis works councils, trade unions and industry concerning conditions at work, among other things.
I have observed that, for some fifteen years, we in the Netherlands - but that also applies to other Member States in terms of best practices - have been working with the ISO Standard 2631, as recommended and followed by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt.
Only at the end did we decide to adopt the amendment by Mrs Hermange.
I actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry.
There are also other angles to be considered.
For example, the trade unions have stated that this is not simply a matter of exposure from a health perspective, but also a matter of symptoms of fatigue, for example.
Consequently, the standard should, from the point of view of safety - or, rather, the lack of this - actually be stricter than is now the case.
I have not yet heard this aspect mentioned here, and it should actually help us find a happy medium.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on her excellent work and, having said this, I would like to remind you that Article 31(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity.
This is a wide-ranging declaration, within the chapter on solidarity, which includes not only the measures taken against obvious risks, such as the risk of falling or risks faced when dealing with abrasive materials, but also those preventative measures used against risks that could go undetected by the majority of those who are not experts in this field.
These are the risks that those who work in mines, in construction and in the field of transport have to face on a daily basis, which, according to those who study them, affect up to 24% of European workers.
These risks originate from two different types of vibration: Hand-arm vibration, which is the cause of whitefinger, impaired feeling and grip, amongst other problems, or Whole-body vibration, which is the cause of back problems, lumbar pains and slipped discs.
It is worth remembering, Commissioner, that these measures should not be limited to including only physical causes, such as vibrations, but should also take account of electromagnetic fields, noise and waves and optical radiation, for example, and also bear in mind the transitional period needed to make the required adjustments arising from the adoption of these measures.
I am convinced that all employers and workers have a common goal, which is the improvement of their workspace and environment, so that the place in which they work is suitable.
A transitional period will be needed so that equipment can be replaced and procedures can be improved and adapted. Differences relating to technological development and type of activity, such as agriculture, will have to be taken into account, with a conviction that 'no-risk' does not exist and that the quest for safety is the responsibility of all those involved: workers, be they self-employed or employed, employers or local, regional or national administrations.
Mr President, in my two years in this Parliament I have never received such a barrage of letters of complaint as I have about this report.
I am talking particularly about whole-body vibration aspects, rather than hand and arm vibration.
These comments are not just from employers, large and small, in farming, quarrying, mining, engineering and construction businesses - to name but a few - who are rightly concerned about the very viability of their entire industries under these proposals.
They are also from ordinary employees concerned about their jobs if the rapporteur's amendments go through.
Recently published and well-respected scientific work from Germany, Italy and the UK, as well as the rapporteur's own country of Denmark, shows no direct quantifiable link between whole-body vibration and back pain.
I note that Mr Hughes maintains otherwise; not for the first time his own government disagrees with him.
The above comments from constituents have two things in common: their anger that Socialist MEPs should be proposing such amendments in the first place, and their sheer disbelief that such MEPs could be so out of touch with reality.
Let me be clear.
The above comments are nothing to do with health and safety, issues which all of us recognise as important.
They are everything to do with the rapporteur jumping to conclusions that are not supported by specific scientific evidence.
The UK government is strongly opposed to the rapporteur's proposed amendments which, it maintains, would damage industry and agriculture for no benefit.
UK Conservative MEPs agree, and we urge the UK Labour MEPs, who supported this report so resolutely in committee, now to support the common position, and meanwhile to support our compromise, tabled jointly by a number of political groups.
I urge you all to join us in voting for sound science and sound sense.
Mr President, this is really one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in this Parliament.
The benefits it offers are vague and speculative - they are unproven and unquantified, but the costs are real, immediate and massive.
Credible estimates suggest that the costs of implementation in the UK alone could range between EUR 15 and 30 billion.
The effects will reach into a wide-range of industries - not only agriculture, but road haulage, construction and many other areas.
I have been contacted by an exceptionally wide-range of business organisations and they are universally opposed to the measure and especially to those amendments which would make it even more repressive.
Those organisations include: the Confederation of British Industry, the National Farmers' Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Quarrying Association, the Coal Industry and JCB, the heavy equipment manufacturer.
It appears that the limit set by the directive would restrict a truck driver to six hours work, a tractor driver to two or three hours and a brush cutter to 15 minutes.
This will do huge damage to European economies.
It will cost jobs.
It has been pointed out that the average jogger exceeds the limit by a factor of 7 or 8, while even walking down a road could break the rules.
I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg!
The directive also places huge new costs and administrative burdens on industry in terms of measuring vibration levels and recording exposure.
There is a crying need, Mr President, for proper regulatory impact assessments to be applied to European legislative proposals.
If that had been done in this case, it would never have got this far.
Any possible benefits are far outweighed by the costs.
It appears that we cannot reject the whole proposal, but I appeal to colleagues to support amendments which would soften it and to reject amendments which would make it even more disastrous than it already is.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her excellent report particularly because it is such a difficult technical issue: It is not only that is a difficult dossier, but it has been before the Council since 1994 and only now are things on the move.
I consider that this legislation on vibrations will be a fundamental step to achieving better protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to risks arising from physical agents, but of course, we have to take into account the economic impact, the impact in the enterprises - the small, medium and large.
That is why we propose a step-by-step approach.
We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vibrations, notably neurological, vascular and musculo-skeletal disorders.
This is a particularly serious problem which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering for the people directly involved as well as for their families, and when we discuss costs, we must calculate the cost that enterprises have because of the health problems of their workers.
On your amendments, the Commission has worked very hard to maintain a high level of protection while, at the same time, ensuring that a compromise could be reached.
Although we consider that lower values more in line with the amended proposal would be more appropriate, we have accepted the Council's common position with a view to achieving a global compromise.
The common position increases the exposure limit values and exposure action values for the whole-body vibrations and introduces new provisions on transitional periods for existing work equipment in general and for equipment used in the agricultural and forestry sectors in particular.
For reasons of consistency, the Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 2, which decreases the exposure values for whole-body vibrations in the common position, nor the part of Amendment No 5 which reduces the length of the transitional periods.
However, the last part of Amendment No 5 would be acceptable if slightly redrafted.
Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 and 12 because they merely restate the principles of the employer's responsibility already contained in the Framework Directive without additional added value, nor Amendments Nos 9 and 13 since they either remove the possibility for Member States to grant derogations on whole-body vibrations in case of seasonal work or simply allow for the averaging of exposures which is already considered by the ISO standards to which the directive refers.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11 for both technical and political reasons.
Although the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed by Amendment No 1, we can only agree with the first part but we cannot accept the second part which foresees the commitment of both the European Parliament and the Council to continue with the adoption of other parts of the original physical agents proposal.
This is not a question of political disagreement.
This part of the recital contravenes the rule that the recitals 'shall not contain normative provisions or political exhortations'.
I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
These amendments clearly improve and clarify the text.
I regret that I have to reject Amendment No 6 as it stands.
Nevertheless, I could accept the idea of justifications to be provided by Member States on any transitional periods or derogations granted by them.
This should however be integrated in Article 14 (1).
Finally, let me remind you that the step-by-step approach we have used, starting with vibrations, implies that we should now push ahead with the remaining three physical agents included in the Commission's original proposal: noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.
To conclude, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
It can accept in part Amendments Nos 1, 5 and 6 and it rejects Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
Ladies and gentlemen, to judge by what I am hearing now, I think we will soon be needing a new Directive on noise in the Chamber during a debate!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.
Mr President, I wanted to ask you about the decision of the Bureau that was taken last night on the issue of a Staff Regulation.
I want to know on what basis that decision was taken.
I think that the House should be reminded that when the present Commission was accepted, it was accepted on the basis of the need for radical reform.
A decision was taken by the Bureau last night to adopt a rather more cautious approach than the one that has been adopted in plenary, but we did not want as in the past, we wanted a radical overhaul.
I wish to know why the Bureau has gone against the spirit of what was accepted in the plenary both on the van Hulten report and on the Harbour report and why, given the critical importance and interinstitutional nature of this issue, the Vice-President for Reform, Commissioner Kinnock, was not invited to speak at that meeting.
Could you, Mr President, give me an assurance that the Bureau will look at this again and also invite the Vice-President of the Commission to speak to the Bureau in order to amend the letter that was agreed last night?
I was at the Bureau meeting last night and I am not aware that the Bureau actually took any final decisions.
They took a decision to write a letter to Mr Prodi and therefore there are still ongoing discussions on this matter.
At the last part-session, I raised under points of order, this whole question and asked the presidency to give this House a comprehensive report about the state of reform discussions as soon as possible.
So far, we have not had this report and I emphasise here the concerns of my colleague Mrs Morgan.
In my report, that was passed by a very big majority in this House, we set the linear career structure on merit as the centre-piece of the reform.
But it appears from comments being made by one of the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament in the newspapers and not to this House, that the whole issue is now not regarded as important by the Bureau.
I hope I have the support of all colleagues in the House in saying that we still consider this the centre-piece of the reforms and we do not see any reason why Parliament should not follow a similar line to that being taken by the Commission in this crucial area.
The point made by you and by Mrs Morgan will be raised again in the Bureau.
I can assure you that it will be given proper consideration.
Mr President, can we take that as an assurance that no letter will be sent until the Bureau has met again on Thursday, because that is what I think the House would like to hear?
I cannot tell you the status of the letter.
I imagine that it has already been sent, so I cannot say that it will not be sent.
But the matter will be given full discussion when the Bureau meets again tomorrow.
Mr President, can I just object to the fact that the Thorning-Schmidt report and the Ghilardotti report are going to be voted on immediately after the debate?
Some Groups have not had a chance to look at the Ghilardotti report in particular and to debate them.
Can we at least, if this happens in the future, have far more warning?
We only heard last night that this was about to happen when it was too late for us to do anything about it.
This report has been scheduled for today since the agenda was drawn up.
We get a great deal of complaints from the press who say that we do not vote quickly enough after we have had a debate.
Therefore a balance has to be struck.
VOTE
Mr President, I see from Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure that procedure without debate applies when the committee responsible has not tabled any amendments or when all the amendments for deliberation have been adopted with no more than three Members voting against them.
This report has now come to us without debate, although the Committee took a vote on the Swedish candidate, Mr Tobisson, when more than three Members voted against him because he has no experience as an auditor whatsoever.
For this reason, I would like to hear your interpretation as to whether it is right that this matter can be voted on without debate, without the possibility of openly putting forward these points of view, as more than three Members have voted against a nominee.
I insist this matter be referred to Parliament' s plenary for debate there.
Of course every Member is allowed to vote as they so wish.
You correctly state Rule 114.
The committee has requested that this be put to Parliament.
We are now in a position where the Conference of Presidents approved this being put on the agenda of Parliament at the request of the committee.
Therefore the vote will go ahead.
(In successive votes Parliament adopted the nine resolutions)
Report (A5-0318/2001) by Didier Rod, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (COM(2001) 333 - C5-0411/2001 - 2001/2164(COS))
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, resistance to antimicrobial agents now causes hundreds of thousands of deaths the world over.
Diseases that we thought were under control, such as tuberculosis or the plague, are re-appearing and are posing a serious threat to human health, particularly in developing countries.
We acknowledged, by voting in favour of the Khanbhai report, that resistance to anti-malarial agents was one of the causes of malaria-related deaths.
But we now know that one of the true causes of the current situation in Europe is the incorrect use of antibiotics and over-consumption, not only in the field of human medicine but also in animal feed.
Reports on GMOs also indicate this...
I am sorry to interrupt you, as rapporteur, but it is not correct for a rapporteur to start making a speech before we take a vote.
If you have something pertinent to say about the vote, we will listen to you.
But if it is not to do with voting procedure I suggest to you that, as rapporteur, you have already had your opportunity of speaking to the substance of the debate.
That concludes the vote.
Report Theato (A5-0346/2001):
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of appointing nine new members of the Court of Auditors.
All nine candidates are well qualified to become excellent members of the Court of Auditors.
We would nonetheless remind the Member States that, in appointing candidates, they must take Article 247, Paragraph 2 of the Treaty seriously: 'The Members of the Court of Auditors shall be chosen from among persons who belong or have belonged in their respective countries to external audit bodies or who are especially qualified for this office.'
The Court of Auditors plays a very important role in relation to supervising the Community' s funds.
It is therefore very important that there should be enduring respect for its Members.
We have voted on these nine re-appointed and newly appointed members of the Court of Auditors with mixed feelings.
The EP' s role in this instance is marginal, since the Council is the designated institution.
We endorse this distribution of tasks in accordance with the Treaty.
However, the quality of the candidates should be paramount in the EP' s verdict.
We were bitterly disappointed in this respect, both in terms of some of the Member States and in terms of the majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
A few candidates are, in our opinion, clearly not up to the task and, in one instance, do not even meet the Treaty requirements.
A Member State that puts forward a candidate simply on the basis of a long political career, without the relevant candidate having qualifications in the area of accounts, should hang its head in shame.
But also in other areas, the level of candidates was very diverse.
For such a post with high accountability and a huge significance for community funds, only heavyweights in the financial-political arena should be put forward.
Since this has not happened in a few cases, we have given some the benefit of the doubt, but we were unable to give the weakest candidates our vote.
Report Rod (A5-0318/2001):
We shall not discuss the medical arguments put forward in favour of restricting the use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.
However, the report mentions the need to save money on health care costs.
Although this need could, generally, be justified, we nonetheless reject any argument for this.
We know only too well that, when it comes to making savings on medical spending, it is always the health care of the working classes, and particularly the poorest sectors of society, that suffers.
The result of these 'careful recommendations' , which governments usually use as a pretext to take restrictive measures, does nothing to affect the excessive use of medicine by the rich, whilst the poor are deprived of even the most basic levels of care.
We therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Report Schmidt (A5-0324/2001):
Mr President, I have made so many speeches that I have lost my voice.
Maybe I have delivered too many explanations of vote!
I voted for the directive on undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities because one way that pensioners get rich - I am not being serious here - is through reaping the benefit of fruitful savings.
In this way, if their savings bear fruit, as the directive proposes, pensioners will be able to follow the example of the great single-handed circumnavigator, Mr Francis Chichester - the father of our beloved fellow Member, Mr Giles Chichester - who celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday while sailing single-handedly round the world.
Report Jensen (A5-0319/2001):
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party voted for the Jensen report.
I would nevertheless like to tell Commissioner Diamantopoulou, who works so hard to help workers and to increase the number of jobs throughout Europe, that, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I believe that, if we are to have more jobs, we must reduce the cost of labour: we must, therefore, reduce the cost of pension services and contributions while still increasing the size of pensions.
We want less contributions and larger pensions, and that can only be achieved by careful, sound administration of contributors' money.
. (PT) We have supported this report since its first reading in February 2001.
Its relevance warrants our support once again and this is why we have voted in favour of it.
Developing, programming, monitoring and assessing the European employment strategy with the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities are important and essential objectives for fully and effectively achieving the strategic ambitions defined at the Lisbon European Council.
More and better jobs mean greater economic and social cohesion.
It is, therefore, crucial that cooperation between Member States is improved with regard to exchanging experiences and information and identifying best practices in addition to the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities, not forgetting the implementation of an active and transparent public information policy that takes account of the public' s requirements for transparency.
One particularly praiseworthy aspect of this report is the attention it pays to the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in the employment and labour markets.
Undertaking studies on the provision of childminding structures and of home assistance and care services is an essential instrument for assessing shortcomings in this field, initially and then putting into practice, in a later stage, an action plan designed to enable people to reconcile their professional lives with their family lives.
With regard to the budget and annual appropriations, we agree with the rapporteur' s position and fully support it.
Report Ghilardotti (A5-0325/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the Ghilardotti report.
Keeping employees informed is a very good thing, Mr President, but I tried substituting the word 'pensioners' for the word 'employees.
The result is a wonderful report: the European Union calls for pensioners to be kept better informed; the European Union wants improved consultation of pensioners.
The pensioners would be happy to know that there is a report addressing the issue of more information and consultation for pensioners, for it is still the case today that some European pensioners do not even know how large their pension will be the day before they start to draw it, they do not know at what age they will be able to retire and they find the documents presented to them totally incomprehensible.
I therefore hope that I will soon be able to vote in favour of consulting and informing pensioners as well as employees.
. This particular proposal can be traced over 20 years and today we should be reaping the benefit of the conclusion of intense negotiations and compromises, not only here in Parliament, but also in the Council and amongst the social partners.
The Common position offers the most appropriate means of ensuring that we can achieve the objective of guaranteeing that employees have real access to information and consultation, and also offers them an opportunity to have an input into the continuing operation of the enterprise.
Unfortunately, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs goes totally against the spirit of co-operation achieved up to now.
In particular, the issue of sanctions to be imposed at an EU level flies totally in the face of subsidiarity and competences of national governments.
All that has been gained is that this issue ends up in conciliation and brings us no nearer to achieving the real goal of securing information and consultation for the employees of the European Union over the running of their companies.
. Generally, I welcome the outcome of this vote, although I wish more Members had been willing to support the amendments dealing with sanctions against companies that fail to implement the directive's requirements.
However, there is no doubt that the measures agreed by Parliament will make an important difference for many workers throughout the EU.
Hopefully, thanks to the tighter definitions of the information required and the proposal for a delay for full consultation in the light of proposed large-scale redundancies and other potentially harmful changes, we shall avoid the situation where we see workers appealing to this Parliament to protect their rights and interests.
I also welcome Parliament's insistence on the rapid implementation of this directive for all Member States, whatever the current state of employee representation.
I trust that Council will now follow Parliament's lead.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Jensen.
The call to increase the EU's fund for job creation comes at a time when the EU is attempting to coordinate its employment strategies by the so-called open method of coordination.
This fund could do much to bolster these efforts and consolidate the work under way since the Lisbon dot.com Summit.
Moreover, the report also recognises the valid and worthwhile role that local and regional authorities can play in the process of job creation.
It is only when we work with such authorities, who have vital in-depth knowledge of regional employment needs and peculiarities at their disposal, that we shall be able to reap the potential benefits outlined in this report.
Report Thorning-Schmidt (A5-0320/2001):
Mr President, the pensioners who sent me, Mr Carlo Fatuzzo, here include a large number of people who have become ill as a consequence of exposure to mechanical vibrations throughout their working lives.
I therefore voted for Mrs Thorning-Schmidt' s report, although I know she would prefer me not to speak any more in this Chamber and has tabled an anti-Fatuzzo amendment which, I am glad to say, was rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I therefore call for working hours to be limited in places where there are vibrations which are unavoidable because of the nature of the activity to be performed but which are more frequent than the maximum permitted limits.
According to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, 24% of workers in Europe are exposed to mechanical vibrations.
These are mainly those working in the mining, building, manufacturing, forestry and transport industries.
Hand-arm vibrations cause serious and virtually systematic problems, such as the 'white finger' phenomenon in woodcutters and forestry workers; carpal tunnel syndrome, poor circulation and loss of feeling.
Whole body vibrations cause lumbar pain, slipped discs, as well as premature degeneration of the spinal column.
However, despite the fact that these problems are known to be harmful to workers' health, it has taken almost ten years for a European directive to be drafted!
The reason why this has taken so long is because the management in these sectors and equipment manufacturers are taking a stand, and they do not want restrictive standards, which would mean the equipment used would have to be replaced immediately in the light of technological developments.
Furthermore, businesses do not always use approved equipment.
And where they do, they do not necessarily inspect it on a regular basis, so the vibrations increase.
Above all, however, the conditions under which people are obliged to work are considerably aggravating factors.
The equipment concerned is often used by workers who are paid for their output, in terrible conditions of intensive work.
We must oblige businesses to pay for regular breaks throughout the day.
It is scandalous that workers continue to risk their health in order to earn a living.
Report Korhola (A5-0321/2001):
When the environment is respected as it is in Mrs Korhola' s directive, Mr President, we are all extremely happy.
Indeed, I have just returned from a visit of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to Slovakia, where we saw the progress made by this country in environmental matters, and I have to say that we were all happy campers, Mr President.
Just think, one evening, as I was about to get into the lift to go to the second floor, I saw Mr Bushill-Matthews and the usually impassive Mr Blokland rush into the lift, both extremely happy too, shouting in unison: 'Mr Fatuzzo, we cannot leave you alone with Mrs Malliori' , who, as we all know, is extremely attractive like all Greek women.
Even Mr De Roo, who places great store by silence, heard these utterances!
'Public participation' in 'plans relating to the environment' is something we are obviously in favour of.
However, this report is another of those indecisive documents, where the proclaimed good intentions do not hide the ineffective measures proposed.
If we consider current events in France alone, the Mont Blanc tunnel has been reopened despite the views of the people living nearby; the protests of those living in the RhÃŽne valley against the noise pollution caused by lorries using the motorway, or even against the route of the TGV railway line, have been disregarded, we can see how little importance the authorities attach to public opinion when it is voiced.
Apart from that, what control can the public now have over preventing a disaster, such as that of the sinking of the Erika, from polluting hundreds of kilometres of coastline?
What control can the public even have over preventing a disaster, which, unfortunately, is not only ecological, such as that of the explosion at the AZF factory, from happening again?
In reality, since the public does not have the right and the means to control the activity of businesses such as TotalFinaElf, nor does it have the possibility of banning any economic policy that is detrimental to society and to its own workers, 'public participation' comes across as a hollow expression.
We abstained from the vote.
Although this proposal for a directive makes some welcome amendments to certain aspects of Community legislation, it represents a reductive and inadequate view of the implementation of the Aarhus Convention, which has already been ratified by all of the European Union' s Member States.
Nevertheless, its contribution to the implementation of the Aarhus Convention in the Member States is very small, as is the implementation of the Convention in procedures and decisions at Community level.
The proposals contained in the Korhola report do, by and large, improve the document, although they do not sufficiently resolve all the shortcomings of the proposal for a Directive, which is why we have also voted in favour of other proposals that extend the report' s proposal, thereby helping to ensure that an opportunity is not wasted in the complex process of implementing the Aarhus Convention.
What has also become clear during this debate is that the importance of this Convention' s content and its ratification by all the Member States justify an extension of the debate, a broader and more inclusive discussion and a more appropriate and committed response from the Commission, and not the minimalist vision contained in the proposal it has submitted to the European Parliament.
. This proposal intends to ensure that opportunities are given for public participation at an early and decisive stage of environmental decision making.
This includes public participation and the drawing up of certain plans and programmes, greater participation in the procedure concerning the implementation of environmental impact assessment statements as well as in the putting in place of integrated pollution prevention and control measures.
Annex 1 of the Directive lists the instruments in relation to which the public for the first time are be given the opportunity to participate in the drawing up of plans and programmes.
Such provisions are to be inserted in the directives on waste, the protection of waters against nitrate pollution as well as being included in the hazardous waste, copper packaging, air quality and landfill of waste directives.
The main thrust of this directive is to ensure that information must be made available to the public within a reasonable timeframe.
The public must be given the opportunity to express comments and opinions before decisions are made.
It is important that the citizens of Europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a European Union level.
The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity.
We are also all aware of the environmental proofing of EU regulations and directives which is now constantly taking place.
I support progress.
I support economic development.
We must ensure that there is a balance between the protection of our environment and economic progress at all times.
This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House.
. I welcome this initiative and was very happy to support many of the amendments and the report itself in the final vote.
I deeply regret Parliament's unwillingness to really open up access to such decisions to the widest possible number of people.
The willingness of the largest groups to maintain the restrictions to the 'concerned public' , which will be defined by the Member States, is a surefire way to continue to leave certain people deeply dissatisfied and feeling sidelined.
At least we managed to support the rapporteur's proposals to have some definition as to what the 'concerned public' might be.
We have also managed to argue that the relevant authorities should make some response to show that the concerns of the concerned have been heard.
However, a frequent complaint is that objections were raised but nothing happened.
Parliament has given itself little room to manoeuvre in future negotiations with Council, so I hope we shall at least maintain the limited progress made today.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Korhola.
In an era where many citizens, from all sections of society, feel disenfranchised and marginalised, the call for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment is certainly needed.
This proposal, the first of its kind, could see everyday citizens involved in and having say about issues ranging from air quality to the protection of water.
The report makes concrete and practical recommendations as to how public participation in this domain can be realised; for example, information must be made available within a reasonable time-frame.
In addition, citizens would be entitled to submit their comments either orally or in writing.
The report addresses many of the tricky issues that have faced decision-makers since the demonstrations at Seattle, Stockholm and Genoa: it could lead to greater transparency and accountability since citizens could act as both a check on decision-makers' complete autonomy and they could be more informed of the decisions which are being taken in their name.
Effective public participation in the drawing-up of plans and programmes for the environment is of the greatest importance and, therefore, all means of disseminating information to the public are essential, particularly the Internet.
There are other areas directly linked to the environment, in which the public must also participate, such as the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the common agricultural policy. The Commission must, therefore, review its decision to consider general policy options to be non-binding and ensure that its proposals meet the requirements laid down in the Aarhus Convention on effective public participation.
It has become necessary to broaden the definition of 'public' as much as possible.
Inequality in access to adequate means of assessment for small and local voluntary groups compared with the resources of large corporations or public authorities is an important issue and must be taken into consideration.
Report von Boetticher (A5-0339/2001):
Mr President, while I was in the aeroplane on the way to Slovakia, I closed my eyes for a second, as frequently happens, resulting in interesting dreams which I have related in many explanations of vote. This time, I saw my daughter, Cristina - who, as we all know, has been striving to finish her degree in law for six years - graduating at last.
She had specialised in Community law and received a prize of EUR 1 000 for developing Community law, which is also what the von Boetticher report seeks to do.
I therefore voted for the report.
But Mr President, which was the dream: the fact that my daughter Cristina had graduated in law or the fact that we had, at last, succeeded in establishing the European lawyer, with a EUR 2 000 prize, which is what should happen in Europe?
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of this report because we agree that the EU should develop cooperation in the area of civil law for the benefit of EU citizens.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the regulation does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position with respect to the Treaty on European Union.
Report von Boetticher (A5-0333/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the second von Boetticher report.
How could I have voted against a report whose objective is to make it possible to move within the European Union more quickly and rapidly, providing for effective identity checks on the undesirables in our Union?
With regard to this report, during my visits to the Eastern European countries - Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary - lots of pensioners came up to me and said: "Mr Fatuzzo, we are pleased that the European Union is doing its best to make it possible for us to move freely within the Union but, even today, we are always being asked to show our documents, we are subjected to checks every few minutes and we have to prepare a large number of documents in order to be able to move from one part of the Union to another.
Please bear in mind that we are waiting anxiously for the day when we will genuinely be able to move freely."
We voted against this report because this report does nothing other than apply the Schengen accords, something we do not wish to approve, either directly or indirectly.
Whilst claiming to facilitate the freedom of movement of individuals within the European Union, the Schengen accords actually put up barriers along the path to achieving this freedom of movement, at least for those who are from countries outside the European Union.
We are in favour of total freedom of movement of individuals, whether or not they are from the European Union.
In fact, the European treaties guarantee the freedom of movement of capital, regardless of its origin, to the extent that they allow profits from arms trafficking, drug trafficking, even terrorism, to be laundered on European territory as long as the sacrosanct banking secrecy and business secrecy are protected.
Our vote expresses our opposition to a Europe built for capital, and not for individuals.
Report Goebbels (A5-0302/2001):
Mr Goebbels' report stresses the importance of the international monetary system for those who use money to attempt to boost their economy.
I voted for the report but I was unsure about one thing: I remembered that Neapolitan shoeshine, that penniless Neapolitan boy who, when he met a wealthy old industrialist in Ischia, was told: "When I was your age, I used to clean shoes instead of sitting here sunbathing.
Then I bought a taxi, then a public transport firm and then an airline, and then I became the owner of a satellite network."
"And what are you doing now?" asked the boy.
"Now I am sitting here, sunbathing in the sun of Italy and Ischia.
"And I," replied the boy, "what am I doing?!"
The Goebbels report on how to avoid international monetary crises is, on the whole, accurate, reliable and reasonable.
We are simply surprised that the report does not mention the euro once and that it does not reiterate the (very serious) argument that has been put forward before, whereby the euro, which is soon to become a major international currency, would control the dollar by forcing the US monetary authorities to abandon their policy of 'benign neglect' .
It is true that the dissident analysts believed, on the other hand, that a dollar/euro bipolar (or tripolar, if you count the yen) international monetary system risked being more unstable than the previous unipolar (or bipolar) system.
At any rate, this was an interesting debate, which should have fallen completely within the scope of the Goebbels report, having the added advantage of experience on its side, since the euro has been in circulation for almost three years, on the international currency markets at least.
Yet, the rapporteur carefully avoids this question.
Why is this so?
Simply because the theory of the euro having a stabilising effect, like that of the euro having a destabilising effect, was based on the same hypothesis, namely that the euro was to quickly become the second international currency, next to, if not equal to, the dollar.
This is far from being the case.
Not only is the euro not a major currency, but its value has depreciated, it is permanently on the verge of a crisis of confidence, and its international role is not progressing.
And, on top of that, we are heading towards unavoidable problems between the Member States!
If the European Union had not obeyed those with dogmatic views, if we had gradually developed the ECU whilst respecting the national currencies, the process would have been safer and more straightforward.
To sum up, the experience of the last three years confirms what we always believed: a wrong move in European monetary unification will actually make life much easier for the dollar.
In spite of the recent attacks, the good health of the latter also seems to be further evidence of this.
We understand why the rapporteur does not wish to dwell on the subject.
Following Mr Goebbels' excellent report, a motion has been tabled in the European Parliament that is too narrowly framed from the outset.
Moreover, the Commission' s representative expressed a position on its behalf, that is, firstly, false and, secondly, unacceptable, as it does not mention all the abuses now being committed other than terrorism, such as the international financing of the drugs trade and corruption.
Finally, a majority in Parliament, either inattentive or complacent, rejected many constructive amendments, including the creation of an Economic and Social Security Council, the need for better representation of all continents in global financial institutions, and the need to restrict financial transactions with Member States and off-shore centres which do not abide by even minimal international regulations.
Parliament has even refused to declare that 'financial speculation is one of the major causes of international financial instability' .
When democratic parliamentary institutions refuse to acknowledge the evidence, they cease to serve the common good.
The reason that I abstained was in order to highlight this, as I did not wish to counter the few positive effects that can still be found in the resolution after the report has foundered.
As the report points out, between 1975 and 2000, the world has gone through some 120 monetary crises, which the IMF defines as depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in the course of a year.
Regrettably, however, even in the knowledge that every such crisis involves enormous costs for the countries involved, as happened in the Asian crisis in the summer of 1998, the report offers no basic measures that could prevent the emergence of new crises with any degree of effectiveness.
Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows an enormous increase in international financial activity, which practically doubled in the 1990s, with trading on stock exchanges appearing increasingly disconnected from the real economy. This, combined with an increase in the speed of circulation in the financial sphere has heightened instability, thereby helping to increase the gap between richer countries and developing countries.
Despite the report' s considerations and criticisms, specifically regarding the lack of democratic accountability of the IMF and its use by the USA and the G7, does not offer much by way of an alternative.
On the contrary, it suggests from the outset that it is unrealistic to expect the creation, in the foreseeable future, of a United Nations organisation that would exercise full universal powers of regulation and supervision, when this is precisely the path that should be promoted and pursued in order to achieve fair and democratic international relations that provide solidarity and are concerned about development and the fight against poverty.
Although it is to be welcomed that the rapporteur acknowledges that starting from scratch on growth and on combating poverty will require cancelling the debts of the poorest countries, it is disappointing that he does not put forward any other practical proposals, such as a Tobin-type tax or abolishing tax havens and that the majority in this House has rejected every move in that direction.
The Goebbels report sets itself the ambitious goal of how to make the international monetary system work better.
But for whose benefit?
We are entitled to ask this question, when the rapporteur believes that 'the IMF is the only institution concerned about the smooth operation of the world economy' .
The victims of its structural adjustment programmes will be delighted to hear this, and will not be particularly convinced by the request to the IMF to henceforth allow for 'social aspects' .
It is also significant that the report chooses to disregard any tax on speculative movements (Tobin style tax) and the need to abolish tax havens.
However, I did not vote against the report, in order to support two specific requests, which we see as fundamental.
We are in favour of eliminating third world debt and we therefore support cancelling the debt of the poorest countries and introducing a standstill procedure for the others.
In this spirit, this procedure should not produce a restructuring plan, but should enable us to cancel an illegitimate debt.
In spite of all these reservations, these proposals are heading in the right direction and I do not wish to stand in their way.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
2002 budget
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, guided by the 'guidelines for the 2002 budgetary process' , approved on 3 April, Parliament has attached particular importance to improving the efficiency of the European institutions, with particular emphasis, in this field, on the Commission reform that is currently underway and on the quality of the budget' s implementation.
In this context, we must once again state our continuing political support for the reform of the Commission and mechanisms are being put in place to effectively monitor it, in an attempt to avoid both the delays that we have seen and those concerning staff regulations, in which we want to see the position opportunely adopted in the European Parliament resolution respected. These are the mechanisms of the long-awaited reform, which must be implemented by all the European institutions: an increase in the size of the external delegations, and also better coordination between the legislative and budgetary procedures, amongst others.
These are well-known objectives and we shall continue to work to achieve them.
At the same time, and with a view to improving the monitoring of the budget' s implementation, we expect the Commission to produce a definition of clear objectives for implementation and a timetable for this, and we will see how the timetable is being respected in the course of the year by means of sources of information that are now being made available.
It is not possible to effectively assess the implementation of a budget if we do not have both clearly defined objectives and the means of finding out whether these objectives are being met.
It is also widely known that the European Parliament attaches clear priority to producing a more detailed study of the budget' s implementation.
We feel it is important to be able to forecast the budget for the following year.
Indeed, the budget is, by definition, a forecast.
Equally important, however, as establishing the forecast for the following year is being able to see how this forecast is being put into practice and, in cases where this is not being done, to know the reasons why.
This will also contribute to making good delays in payments that have already been identified and to being able to pay out new commitments more rapidly.
We want to eliminate outstanding payments as far as possible and also to ensure that new payments outstanding, or new RAL, to use the commonly accepted term in this field, do not occur.
Increased operational spending will also be promoted, with corresponding reductions in administrative spending.
This is also related, as you all know, to a set of horizontal amendments, in other words, amendments that cover the whole budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets, and which are designed to provide an real reduction in the RAL, greater speed in making payments and also increased operational spending rather than administrative spending.
Along the same lines, we state once again our intention to only decide on the basis of the most complete information and, consequently, we hope to have the following information supplied by the Commission soon: on the one hand, and most importantly, the study examining the impact of the various measures that have already been adopted in the field of agriculture under the reforms laid down in Agenda 2000, as well as their budgetary consequences and also those of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, in addition to the prospects for changes to the agricultural budget.
The European Parliament cannot be a budgetary authority in name only.
In order to reach a decision on a given budget line and, even more, on a given category of the budget, we need full and up-to-date information.
It is clear that, at the moment, with regard to the last reform of the common agricultural policy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth and BSE crises, we need more information.
This is why we have been asking for information since at least March of this year, so that we can make an informed decision, both on the 2002 budget and on the Letter of Amendment.
As important as our concern to have information, we hope that new measures will be identified, which will provide a response to the situation arising from the terrorist attacks of 11 September, specifically concerning Europol and Eurojust in the fields of justice and home affairs. We would also like to see measures in the field of external action, on increasing humanitarian aid and a diversification of development cooperation, without, of course, undermining previously given commitments.
I think that we all accept that the situation arising from 11 September has changed many aspects of world policy and therefore, since the budget acts as a mirror for this policy and reflects this policy, there are bound to be budgetary consequences for the new situation.
The consequences of this new situation are being felt in 2001 and will be in 2002 and in the future.
We see these consequences chiefly affecting refugees, and the tragic problem they create, but they also affect concerted action in terms of the European Union' s external policy.
We do not want to be systematically faced with faits accomplis.
We can now, therefore, certainly forecast changes in these situations and these new situations must be reflected in the budget.
The budget must accommodate them although they must not endanger other commitments already given by the European Union.
We have the greatest respect for the 1999 provisions on the financial perspective but we also have great respect for social and political dynamics and where political dynamics are concerned, we cannot fail to draw the necessary conclusions.
We have also stated on various occasions that we will not accept new needs and new challenges being met to the detriment of longer-standing needs which are still as topical as they ever were.
We also have great expectations of the report to be drafted by the Secretaries-General of the institutions on the multiannual study of administrative spending on preparations for enlargement.
We even feel that, as a natural consequence of this work at a technical level, it could then be followed up at political level, with cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority.
At this level, therefore, we will be able to draw political conclusions from information that we obtain technically, which is already being done.
Continuing with a different type of issue, but which is also pending, in the case of the Commission' s proposal, we are waiting for the drafting, in the very near future, of the proposal to mobilise the flexibility instrument that will ensure the means necessary for the conversion of the fishing fleets that were dependent on the old Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
This flexibility instrument is a mechanism provided for in the Institutional Agreement. It has been used year after year and we are waiting to see the corresponding proposal for the year 2002.
In terms of sectoral objectives, I should like to highlight a few to which we attach particular importance, such as that of improving the European Union' s competitiveness, to which the priority of more and better employment has been linked. It is not sufficient for declarations to be made at European Councils and summits.
What we need is for these declarations then to be put into practice. More and better employment also means more and better support, more and better support mechanisms for small and medium-sized businesses, progress on the e-learning initiative, which we would very much like to see have a corresponding legal basis and also the consolidation of common policies in the field of asylum and immigration.
It is also worth making special mention here of the intention to support the competitiveness of Member States' border regions in the context of the forthcoming enlargement, as well as extending the benefits of the Leader programme to cover the future Member States.
All of these aspects are considered, in our guidelines, in the proposals for amendments that we have tabled on the budgetary proposals, and in the comments that we have included on the budgetary proposals.
Of course, we shall also continue to fight to improve the level of payments.
I know that this is something that the Member States often attempt to avoid, but the fact is that, if we want to see more effective European institutions, if, furthermore, we want their actions to have greater credibility, and if we want to see their results being more successful, we must have the necessary means to make payments.
I would also remind you that under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, in terms of the financial perspective, in 2002, the level of payments should stand at 1.08% of the gross domestic product of Member States and the Council' s proposals fall considerably short of this figure.
I shall conclude by expressing my complete willingness, in the period between this first reading of the budget for 2002 and the vote on it in December, to work together with the Council and the Commission in a systematic process to reach the most appropriate allocation of available resources and to find the appropriate responses to the challenges we are currently facing.
Hopefully, after the vote that will be held this coming Thursday, the European Parliament' s proposals will lie clearly on the table.
We would also like to see that our priorities are considered in all the discussions that take place between now and December and that they take account of what I have just said, which is that the position of the European Parliament and that of the Council must both be respected, so that, ultimately, it will be possible to use the best from each proposal.
What we cannot, of course, accept now is something that we have never accepted in the past: a dialogue of the deaf, in which some people state their wishes and other people accept what some people say they wanted.
In this specific case, and to ensure that real negotiation takes place, there must be respect for the positions of all parties involved, attention must be paid to everyone' s priorities and that a close look is really given to everyone' s priorities.
Only by adopting this approach will the discharge of the budgetary process be worthwhile. Only through this approach will we ultimately have any guarantee of success and only in this way can we have any hope that the budget will receive a favourable vote in December and be approved.
We do have strongly-held positions but we are also willing to negotiate and what we want is an in-depth examination of the proposals of all sides so that the final outcome is a balanced one.
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.
As Mr Costa Neves has finished his speech early, leaving us with a few seconds left over from the time he was allocated, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you something that will be of interest to you all: each second we spend debating here in Parliament costs us EUR 9.73.
I am telling you this so that you will understand that the reason I am so inflexible when it comes to the allocation of speaking time is this cost.
Mrs Buitenweg has the floor.
Mr President, you have once again pushed the boat out with this long conclusion, but perhaps I can once again try to finish my speech in less than ten minutes, and then the balance will be redressed after all.
This week, we are hoping to take a big step towards establishing the 2002 budget.
I, as rapporteur, have worked towards this for the past couple of months, and I have received a great deal of support from the MEPs of the other groups, Mrs Gill, Mr Ferber, Mr Virrankoski and the other MEPs, as well as from the rapporteur for the general budget, Mr Costa Neves. I expressly want to thank them all here for their pleasant and also very fruitful cooperation.
The trilogues involving the Council have also proved useful, and let me therefore count our blessings for once.
From this year onwards, the Council budget contains a special chapter dealing with the common foreign and security policy.
Since the Council now covers operational costs in its budget - which, unfortunately, do not fall within the remit of the Commission - such as for military planning capacity, it is necessary for democratic control to be possible.
It is also important to gain a clear insight into the administrative structures which are being set up, so as to avoid overlapping with Parliament offices.
That is not possible in a general Council budget if it is not clear how much is being spent on what and if Parliament does not give its opinion on those administrative expenses in general.
We are therefore pleased with a separate chapter since, in this way, Parliament can try to gain some control.
Now that we have chosen this path, I hope that the Council will approve a number of rational and very logical requests by this Parliament at second reading too.
For example, there is the issue of long and wild nights at the European Councils.
In the midst of all this wheeling and dealing, do Heads of Government still consider the financial implications?
I wonder about that.
During the meetings of the European Councils, the Dutch government is always equipped with a special calculator which closely monitors the implications for the Dutch contribution.
But who is accountable for the impact on the European budget?
A pertinent example of this is the Nice Summit.
In order to facilitate an agreement on vote weighting in the Council, compensating seats in the European Parliament were distributed lavishly.
Who will pay for this?
The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated a maximum of 700 seats; we are now sentenced to 732 seats and the buildings are not designed to cope with this number.
In the short term, the number of MEPs could run well into the 800s, and I had better not hear a squeak from the Council when it is presented with the bill for this.
An example of a totally different nature is the Balkans.
Whilst, in front of running cameras, billions were given for reconstruction with one hand, the Council took away development aid with the other.
In order to avoid any repeats, it would be wise to add a financial picture to the political conclusions at important summits.
How much is it all going to cost us and does it involve new money?
It would be a sign of honesty if this were presented along with political conclusions.
For example, the situation in heading 5 has changed dramatically since the Berlin Agreement because, in those days, no consideration was given to, for example, developments in the second pillar, the common foreign and security policy, the third pillar, Eurojust, Europol, or expenses for the European data protection supervisor.
I welcome these developments, but I would equally welcome an explanation as to where the funding is coming from and at what expense that funding will be granted.
A second subject on which I should like to ask the Council to adopt a positive stance, quite apart from the annual budget discussion, is our request to consider how we want to give the taxpayer more value for money.
During that trilogue too, Parliament talked in that context about setting up a political working party, which will enable us jointly to examine how we can give more value for money for, each year, we discuss the nuts and bolts and minor changes to the budget, but the institutions, once they are up and running, are not subject to thorough reviews as far as their objectives and working methods are concerned.
Despite this, we should have the courage to move away from the way things have developed and question, once again, whether all the institutions, for example, all the agencies, should continue to exist in that way.
We are making a start this year at micro level by asking all the institutions to draw up a list of negative priorities.
After all, we should not only add items to the European budget, we should also learn to scrap some of them.
Interinstitutional cooperation is another area where huge savings could be made.
In this respect, I should like to make a concrete proposal.
Since the Treaty of Nice, it has been mooted that the Council would need a new meeting place for its half-yearly summits.
But the impact on the taxpayer and on the quality of life in the Leopold Quarter if yet another huge building were to be erected would be enormous.
Let us therefore examine together whether some of the Council meetings could take place here in the parliamentary House, in Brussels or in Strasbourg.
Look around you, as you already are doing. It is a beautiful building, and you will understand that we would not mind if cooperation were to develop in such a way that Parliament were to meet in Brussels only, and we would be delighted to make this environment available to you.
Until such time, and until the seat issue has been solved in another way, we really are stuck with two buildings that need to be altered to cope with a larger number of MEPs.
The Bureau has drawn up a three-year plan which serves as an indicative framework for expenses related to enlargement.
The other institutions, too, are working hard to ensure that the effects of enlargement are ironed out, and we cannot wait for these adjustments until 2004.
It is not an option for us to be in the middle of activities, still, when the first new Members join.
This means, therefore, that more funding is required prior to the accession of the candidate countries.
The Committee on Budgets has noted that, by means of rigid budget management, it is possible, in the coming year, to remain within the self-imposed maximum of 20% in the category of administrative expenditure, although we have always said that enlargement and buildings do not fall within this maximum.
As for the subsequent years, however, I am not convinced that this will work again.
Even if the other institutions implement their plans in preparation for enlargement, and even if Parliament faces higher costs because, by that stage, preparations will have got well and truly under way, in my opinion it will then be difficult to remain within the established ceiling.
Berlin in itself does not, therefore, merit unconditional praise.
However, the intention to enlarge by spending tax money in an efficient, effective and desirable manner does merit such praise. Let it therefore be the guiding principle in the budgetary procedures which follow.
You will have gathered by now that I am greatly irritated by the Council' s stance, and despite this, I shall try to mention a few other elements from my report.
I shall, first of all, focus on what it does not say.
The report does not contain any judgment by Parliament of the basis on which expenses must be paid as soon as a new statute for Members has been approved, and that is something which I very much regret.
Precisely because Parliament wishes to retain the power to decide on its own arrangements and does not therefore want expenses to form part of a package involving the Council, it is important for us to indicate at this stage what we want.
I should particularly like to ask the PSE and PPE-DE Groups to endorse the position which was initially included in my report, namely that, once the statute enters into force, only expenses actually incurred will be reimbursed.
I would like to mention something which is in the report.
I am delighted that the institutions reacted in a quietly positive manner to the request by the Committee on Budgets to take part in EMAS, the EU' s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.
I should like to warmly congratulate the European Commission on the fact that it has already committed itself to this, and I hope that it will set an example for others, including the European Parliament itself.
There is still room for improvement on many levels, including in our House, for example with regard to differentiated waste processing and the use of environmentally-friendly materials, saving electricity and setting up a mobility plan for staff and Members alike.
Parliament has a model role to fulfil, and this also applies to realising sound environmental objectives. I would be grateful if we were to make a start on that next year.
Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community was signed in 1952, and was to run for fifty years.
It comes to an end next summer and there is no intention to extend it.
We are therefore to debate the last ECSC budget, now, with expenditure to cover the period up until 23 July of next year.
Thereafter its assets, estimated to be worth EUR 1.1 billion, are to be transferred to the EU' s general budget, to be invested safely and profitably.
Earnings from the assets are to be used for funding research in the coal and steel industries.
It has been estimated that around EUR 45 million in earnings per annum will be available for these purposes.
The ECSC has not attracted payments for many years.
Its expenditure has mainly been financed out of a reserve intended for funding under the operating budget.
The largest item of expenditure in the last six months of the ECSC' s existence will, according to a proposal by the Commission, be in respect of social aid.
Of that, most is intended to be spent on special adjustment aid in countries where production in the coal and steel industries has been wound down.
In many countries the industry has social problems associated with it, and, consequently, the Committee on Budgets has decided to propose that EUR 16 million more than the Commission originally recommended should be paid in adjustment aid to Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium with regard to the special problems associated with their steel industries.
When the ECSC ceases to exist, social aid for employees in the coal and steel industries will end.
The Commission has not promised to distribute special aid out of the EU' s general budget for social purposes in these industries.
When the ECSC ceases to exist, the social dimension it represents will not continue in another form.
The ECSC' s resources have been used to finance important research.
Although earnings from the ECSC research fund will be channelled exclusively into research after it ceases to exist, there will be less money available than there is now.
For example, early next year EUR 72 million will still be channelled into research.
That is a considerable sum compared with the EUR 45 million that represents the earnings from the ECSC' s net assets that will be used for research.
Consequently, we could say that the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community is coming to an end makes for a negative situation from the point of view of social action and research.
The Commission is charging quite a sum in compensation for earnings from ECSC funds under the guise of managing the investment of the ECSC assets and allocating money for research: EUR 3.5 million a year.
That will pay the salaries of more than 30 officials employed to manage the ECSC' s remaining functions.
The activities involved are so limited in scope that the officials seem to form just one group, which will not suffer from the ECSC' s cessation of operations the way the workers and researchers in the coal and steel industries will.
The Treaty' s cessation will have surprisingly little effect on the lives of the officials who have been attending to the ECSC' s banking business and are managing its effects.
This brings to light the inefficiency of the new organisation of the Commission' s functions.
There is a problem I wish to draw attention to, although it is not strictly relevant to this report.
The legal basis for the Coal and Steel Community Research Fund was established by the Treaty of Nice.
If the Treaty of Nice is not in force next July, there will be no legal basis for any subsequent management of the estate.
The Commission must adopt a position on this swiftly.
Finally, there is good reason to say a few positive words in memory of everything the ECSC has achieved, not least the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community has probably been one of the institutions that had an impact on building peace and international co-operation in Europe after the Second World War.
While it was in operation its Member States did not wage war on each other.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, you will be voting at first reading on the amendments to the draft budget as it was drafted by the Council in July.
I already had the honour of making an explanatory statement concerning this draft budget at the part-session in September.
I will therefore not enter into any detail today.
Instead, I should briefly like to outline the aspects which will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the framework of our dialogue.
I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful, so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone, but particularly to the European citizens, of course.
I should like to reiterate quite emphatically that the presidency would like to reach an agreement on the 2002 budget as early as November at second reading of the Council.
A few days after your first reading, the overall structure will be in place and the different positions will be known.
In November, we should consequently be able to put the finishing touches to the activities which will culminate in a sound budget for 2002.
In this connection, it seems useful to me to remind ourselves briefly of the guidelines which the Council used when it compiled the draft budget, in respect of which you will be proposing amendments in the next couple of days.
This draft budget is able to fund all policy components and priorities of the European Union, without imposing too great a burden on the Member States that work towards achieving stricter control of government finances.
At the same time, however, notably under the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspectives and of heading 4, it creates some leeway for coping with new priorities.
For that purpose, the Council has made sure that the different actions of the European Union are funded appropriately within the available financial means under the ceilings of the financial perspectives, in connection with which no changes have been made to the funds allocated to programmes on which a decision was made in the codecision procedure, whilst the extent of the commitment appropriations has been determined on the basis of implementation options.
In addition, the Council has paid particular attention to the development of payment appropriations by curbing and controlling their growth compared to 2001. In this context, particular consideration was given to the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with commitments outstanding and national budgetary requirements.
After these general considerations, I should like to broach a few subjects which will be on the agenda in the next couple of weeks and these concern, of course, agricultural expenditure.
As you know, the Council did not adopt the Commission' s proposal at first reading and has asked the Commission for a detailed analysis of the requirements.
During the conciliation meeting of 20 July, Parliament sided with the Council, and I have every faith that, once we have discussed the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, we will reach an agreement through which we will be able to cushion the effects of the different crises.
I think that I can already say that, at the moment, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in this connection, a solution is certainly in the offing.
As far as the other agricultural expenses are concerned, when the Council' s draft budget provided for an increase in the appropriations, although they were still slightly below those which the Commission had initially put forward in its preliminary draft, consideration was given to the effects which the decisions by the European Council of Berlin would have on the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy.
When we analyse the final appropriations to be included in the 2002 budget, we must obviously take account of the most recent data in the letter of amendment concerning agricultural expenditure.
I should now like to turn to a second point which, according to the Interinstitutional Agreement, is also pertinent, in the framework of the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, namely the financial implications of the delay in the fisheries agreement with Morocco, together with the funding and restructuring of the fishing fleet in question.
In July, the Council followed the Commission' s preliminary draft of the budget as far as the international fisheries agreement was concerned, and the Council asked the Commission only to use these appropriations for other fisheries agreements.
It is unfortunate that this position by the Council in July did not lead to an agreement.
With regard to the structural measures, heading 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council insisted on including this entire heading in the budget in the form of commitment appropriations in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999.
In this connection, I should like to point out that the Council, at the time of compiling its draft budget, did not have a full overview of the situation, and that it stated that it would review the situation in the light of the letter of amendment in the autumn, which is prescribed according to the Interinstitutional Agreement.
The Council will do this as soon as it has received the letter.
I would remind you that the appropriations for international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, fall within compulsory expenditure, whether they are indicated in the budget line or in the reserve.
As for the letter of amendment, to which some of our discussions in the coming weeks will relate, I should like to note that the Council expects a balance estimate for the 2001 budget year to be included.
This request is an illustration of the principle of good management, which means that the budget burden for the individual European taxpayers will, where possible, not become any heavier.
I know how much importance the European Parliament attaches to the expenditure under heading 3 of the financial perspectives.
That is why the Council has ensured that its draft budget sufficiently covers the priorities of the EU' s internal policy, notably the honouring of commitments concerning the funding of multi-annual programmes, in respect of which both our institutions have taken a decision.
I would also point out that, at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget in order to launch Eurojust and the SISII system for Schengen.
The Commission had proposed the budget lines for this in its preliminary draft.
In the current climate, these objectives are more topical than when we compiled the draft budget back in July.
In this way, the Council has created a margin of EUR 110 billion which is wider than the margin in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
This margin should be sufficient to cover priorities, some of which, including e-learning and immigration, will undoubtedly be mentioned by your rapporteur or, in any event, will be suggested at our forthcoming dialogue.
I would now like to turn my attention to the funding of the EU' s external measures, as included in heading 4 of the financial perspectives.
The Council has largely followed the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
The Council has also made an effort to allocate resources to the different priorities in the field of external measures.
For example, the Council has created a margin of EUR 100 million under the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspectives, which should enable us to shore up the priorities in this sector.
With regard to this heading 4 of the financial perspectives, I should nevertheless like to point out one particular aspect pertaining to the appropriations for the common foreign and security policy.
I very much regret the fact that, during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council, an agreement was still not reached with regard to the level of appropriations to be included.
That is why the Council has adopted the amounts in its draft budget which the Commission proposed in its preliminary draft.
I have to confess that I do not fully grasp why requests for a reduction in these amounts were made.
You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest as they are and are really the bare minimum to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage.
The wish to reduce these amounts at such a crucial time as in the current international crisis could particularly harm the EU' s credibility.
I do not believe that that is what is intended.
I should now like to move on to the administrative expenditure of the institutions.
When the Council compiled the draft budget, it was motivated by the wish to meet the needs of the institutions as much as possible, taking into account their specific characteristics.
In the draft budget, there is a surplus left over to the tune of EUR 53 million under the ceiling of heading 5 of the financial perspectives, which allows new needs in the field of administrative expenditure, notably for the budget of the European data protection supervisor, to be accommodated.
In this connection, the Council recently sent you its letter of amendment No 1 for 2002.
Despite this, I am of the opinion that each of the institutions represented here are acutely aware of the pressure which the ceilings of heading 5 are under.
A first step in this connection was the agreement that was reached during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council concerning a request to the Secretaries-General of the institutions to compile a report for the benefit of the budgetary authority by the time the Budgetary Council is held in November. This report should comprise a multi-annual analysis of heading 5, as well as proposals concerning necessary economy measures to prevent the maximum allocated to this heading being exceeded, also in the framework of enlargement.
In the light of this report, the follow-up action that needs to be taken should subsequently be determined.
I should already like to underline that a number of suggestions made a moment ago in connection with the report are certainly worth looking at further.
I should also like to mention another aspect concerning administrative expenditure, notably the Commission' s staffing requests.
The Council continues to support the reforms on which the Commission is working, and agreed at first reading to the creation of 78 new offices requested by the external delegations in the framework of decentralisation.
With regard to the other 239 offices, the Council failed to adopt a position on 20 July because, on the one hand, it requires more clarity concerning the decision on the regulation for the definitive termination of service by Commission officials and, on the other hand, it nurses the hope that your discussions on this matter will yield a solution which can accommodate our respective wishes.
I should like to finish this list of the different points which will be occupying our minds for the next couple of weeks by returning to a question with which you are all too familiar, namely the extent of payment appropriations.
First of all, I am delighted that the European Parliament and the Commission share the Council' s concern as to the commitments outstanding (in our Community jargon also known as the 'RAL' ).
The progress report of 30 June 2001, requested by the Commission in the framework of the previous budgetary procedure, is certainly useful in this connection.
However, I should like to point out that the vast increase in payment appropriations is not a cure-all for RAL absorption.
This is evident from the extent of the balances over the past budget years which were repaid to the Member States.
On the one hand, there will still be commitments outstanding as a logical extension of the split appropriations, while, on the other hand, the improved follow-up of the commitment appropriations, notably by an opt-out policy, is also an effective means of absorbing potentially abnormal RALs.
As to the extent of payment appropriations in the draft budget, the Council has expressed a preference for limited and controlled growth.
Indeed, the Council is striving to include payment appropriations which correspond to the actual implementation options.
In this way, we prevent the individual European taxpayers from being faced with too heavy a burden.
I have given you a brief outline of the points which will undoubtedly be the topic of discussion over the next couple of weeks.
The seriousness with which the Commission and the two arms of the budgetary authority are treating the start of this new budgetary procedure is obvious to me, and a source of real pleasure to me.
It is my wish for the budgetary discussions, after you have cast your votes in a couple of days, to be continued in the same spirit and, if possible, for agreement to be reached as early as November about a budget of the European Communities for the 2002 budget year which will provide us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union will be facing shortly.
Mr President, honourable Members, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, planning the Budget for next year demands flexibility and provision for the unforeseen.
Flexibility and provision for a rapid and appropriate response to new financial demands on the European Union and on a common European policy.
The current year has indeed shown what demands can be made on a budget, demands that cannot be planned for or envisaged in advance.
We had the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease, we now have the new Global Health Fund project that has come into being this year, greater demands are being made on our humanitarian aid, not only in Afghanistan, but also because of the escalating situation in the Middle East; Palestine's dependency on external aid, including from Europe, has continually increased.
The EU's budget quite clearly needs the capacity to respond to crises and to surmount them, and we have - I believe - managed in the past two years to draft the Budget so as to cope with this demand.
I am optimistic that we will manage it for next year too.
At this point, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the rapporteurs for the 2002 Budget, first of all you, Mr Costa Neves, but also Mrs Buitenweg, Mr SeppÃ€nen and of course the entire Committee on Budgets for the work you have put in.
Anyone who has seen the mountains of amendments that the Committee on Budgets again had to get to grips with this year, will know what is meant by hard committee work.
There is, though, a great deal of work ahead of us, and we have a long way to go. Flexibility and willingness to compromise are required of us all.
Of course, I know that the Belgian Presidency of the Council is endeavouring to pass a good EU Budget, which will fulfil all requirements.
I thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte, for re-emphasising in your speech this aspect - the willingness to negotiate - for I believe that this demand must also be addressed to the Council, that flexibility is necessary in negotiations and that what is said in the various sittings must not be merely a repetition of what was decided by governments in the capitals.
It is just at the point where the Committee on Budgets does not want to respond to increased responsibility and to greater demands with an expanding budget, that our proceedings need flexibility.
I intend now to discuss individual aspects of the European Budget, beginning with agriculture.
The Commission's preliminary draft for the budget, which we presented at the end of May, planned for a EUR 1 billion reserve to facilitate a response to the demands of the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease.
We have now moved on a bit, and the Commission will next week be adopting the letter of amendment.
Developments in the livestock sector have turned out, thank God, to be less dramatic than had at first been feared.
We have indeed managed to put aside EUR 400 million from the Budget in this year already for the costs of foot-and-mouth disease.
The consequence of this will be that we have to plan for less of an increase for foot-and-mouth in the Amending Budget for next year than had at first been feared.
This means that current developments make it possible for us to release the reserve we had proposed in May.
There are, however, developments in some areas of the agricultural sector that still give cause for concern from the budgetary point of view.
The key word here is 'wine' .
Here, there is a production surplus whose constant increase is reflected in the financial results.
Expenditure in this field has, in the meantime, doubled in two years, with the natural consequence that we have to observe carefully what steps can be taken to stem this overproduction and slow down the growth in the agricultural budget.
The letter of amendment that we will be laying before you concludes by saying that we can release the reserve and that we require less expenditure on agriculture than our calculations had originally provided for, so that a fairly substantial margin remains.
At this point, I must however state quite clearly that agriculture ministers must not take this margin to mean that there is plenty of scope for every kind of shiny new expenditure package; this year has shown how quickly such a margin can be required for things which could not have been planned for.
So, in my judgment, caution demands that we keep this margin in this area.
I might mention in passing that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Budget's various amendments and resolutions show its desire to look into the agricultural sector more deeply, including with regard to the Midterm Review, which is due next year.
We do have an agricultural aid programme for the acceding countries, which I would now like to mention briefly, namely the SAPARD pre-accession instrument.
I share your absolute dissatisfaction with this programme not yet having, so to speak 'arrived' , in the sense of aid payments being able to be made from it for agriculture, and with our still being at this preliminary stage in which the appropriate administrative structures are being set up.
Of course it is important to have absolute control, and certainty that nothing will go wrong, but if this leads to the other extreme of the programme not working at all, then that is not what its inventor had in mind either.
You have now, in this Parliament, come to the logical conclusion and said that a new stage in the programme is to be set up, in particular to finance information for the agricultural sector about the EU's future agricultural policy.
I must now, despite this, ask you to please reconsider this proposal, which would mean that we would have to create a new legal basis for this programme.
All of SAPARD's components would have to be reprogrammed, with even greater delays as a consequence.
That cannot be what you meant.
Hence my plea to you to negotiate it again with great precision, in order to find room in SAPARD for your demand for more information along the lines of the LEADER programme to be made available for rural areas.
On this point I must also address a few words to the Council: In your first reading of the preliminary draft of the Budget, you made substantial cuts in the means of payment for the pre-accession aid packages.
It is of course contradictory to say on the one hand that we want better implementation and a reduced backlog of payments, and on the other to cut funds so drastically.
So I must ask you to keep an open mind on the Commission's reasoning.
Of course we have to produce evidence that next year we will need the items we have proposed, but that we shall surely do.
Coming to the topic of enlargement, I, of course, have to mention the 'frontier regions' , as Mr Costa Neves, the rapporteur, has already done.
Of course we all know that the frontier regions, the regions that are at present situated on the borders of the European Union, will profit in the long term from the enlargement of the EU, because they will at last be frontier regions no longer.
Despite this, we also know, on the other hand, that there are problems with adjustment.
In order to absorb the impact of these, or, to put it the other way around, to work towards making use of the opportunities that will be available, the Commission has proposed this programme for the frontier regions.
The Budget provides for an additional EUR 150 million to be made available for transport infrastructure measures in the frontier regions and for a further EUR 15 million for cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises, an additional EUR 20 million from the INTERREG programme and EUR 10 million more from the youth programme, in order to promote this programme for school students' exchanges and so on in the perspective of enlargement.
Last year, Parliament had adopted, for the 2001 Budget, the new pilot project "Cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions with a view to enlargement".
I have to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that this was an excellent idea of Parliament's, as a great deal can now be done with this programme.
I welcome Parliament's statement that this project should continue to be supported, and I, of course, follow with interest, Parliament's endeavours to activate supplementary funds for this area as a whole.
Mounting demands on European policy, of course, also mean that greater demands are made on personnel and also on the Commission's staff.
For years, the Commission has faced ever-increasing tasks which have had to be dealt with without additional human resources.
Last year, this brought us to the conclusion that we would have to take stock by analysing our workload.
As a result of this, we presented a claim for 717 new posts.
The budgetary authority approved 400 additional posts for the Commission last year.
Let me take this as an opportunity to thank you again for this on behalf of the Commission.
We also ask for approval of the second tranche of 317 posts, however.
I would again point out that some departments are really not lavishly provided for.
To take only one example, that of Mr Vitorino's Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General.
It has 189 established posts.
The temporary posts bring the total to 215.
The Scoreboard for more intensive cooperation in judicial matters decided on in Tampere, is really not a bad thing.
Indeed, it is, of course, justified.
The post-11 September situation has now shown that it is in the field of more intensive judicial cooperation that joint action is required.
Not enough has yet been done about this at European level.
We must, therefore, make the effort to move forward in this area, which means, of course, a need for staff to work in this field.
I wish to thank you for your support for the Commission's reforms as a whole, which you have reiterated here today.
You have now tabled various amendments which you will probably adopt on Thursday, and the Commission, in consequence, will be asked for further reports, for example on the delayed presentation of the Budget.
We will of course do all in our power to satisfy this demand for reports.
I must also point out that the Commission has responsibilities as an executive, and so it is also necessary to find a balance.
I would, though, like to thank Mr Costa Neves for reiterating your offer of negotiations.
Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to use budgetary policy to react to crises and intercept the unexpected is of course particularly necessary in the field of foreign policy.
This was true when we had to work together to find the wherewithal for the reconstruction of Kosovo and incorporate it into the 2000 Budget.
Together, we managed it.
It was the case last year, when additional funds for Serbia had to be added to the 2001 Budget.
As I have already mentioned, we are now in a situation in which a contribution is to be made from the European Budget to the Global Health Fund.
We are talking in terms of EUR 60 million for this.
We will be presenting to Parliament the relevant proposal for a transfer, in order to use the fisheries reserve, which is still in this Budget, for this purpose among others.
When we sat together in our three-way talks last week, you supported making EUR 25 million from the emergency humanitarian aid reserve available for Afghanistan, EUR 7.5 million for Palestine and EUR 7.5 million for the Caucasus region.
That shows what current demands are.
I would like to return to one point in particular, which you, Mr President-in-office of the Council, mentioned: I refer to the funds for the common foreign and security policy.
Public opinion sometimes misunderstands this and takes it to mean that this is the only budget line where foreign policy is concerned.
On the contrary, of course other measures are of a foreign policy nature, that is quite clear.
We have, though, this specific line for the common foreign and security policy.
The Commission has proposed EUR 35 million for it.
Parliament proposed its reduction by EUR 14 million.
Now we have to give more careful consideration to precisely why.
Parliament does not, indeed, believe this to be an unimportant area; it is far more a question of how decisions are reached, of whether it is actually right that the Council should have sole discretion as to how the funds are applied.
We note - I note in my capacity as Commissioner for the Budget - that this principle, according to which the Council decides on the use to which funds are put and the Commission then writes the cheques out, does not work well, as there has to date been under-utilisation in this area, even though everybody knows what demands are made.
I believe we have to talk about the fundamentals of how future finance for the common foreign and security policy is to be secured, quite independently of the 2002 Budget.
In my judgment, it is not tolerable that the Council attempts to appropriate ever more operational duties in this area; we need, on the contrary, a common foreign and security policy that will also provide the necessary financial security.
There are a whole lot of related issues to be sorted out.
We must also consider the people's expectations in this area when we really thoroughly discuss, investigate and then define, what we want to do in future.
This demands a common response and, I believe, in many respects a stronger Community response.
To return to the Budget for 2002: the Commission had until now envisaged a EUR 125 million reserve for the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
That fisheries agreement has now finally collapsed.
In the letter of amendment that the Commission will be discussing next week and then presenting to you in due time, this reserve is released.
The funds will be used in part for other fisheries agreements, which have been extended. A large amount will become available.
I would say it would be a mistake to budget all these additional funds which have become available from the reserve, at this early stage.
I know we are going to need this money.
It is not a matter of saving this money but - and I urge this - not already allocating it all.
Why do I urge this?
Let me now make only one point: battle is at present being waged in Afghanistan against international terrorism, and the European Union is keeping humanitarian aid in readiness for the civilian population, and the amounts involved are not small.
The European Union will be providing a total of over EUR 310 million.
Let me also, however, point out that the USA was a great donor of funds for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan even before 11 September.
Now, though, we should already be thinking of what the period after this conflict will mean for the region and for the country of Afghanistan, and it is quite clear to me that this means the post-Taliban era in Afghanistan.
I think we can all agree that the European Union will then also have an obligation and a responsibility to build up a democratic society, a society that has regard for human rights and makes it possible to live with human dignity.
In this Budget, we should make provision in such a way as to enable us to meet this obligation financially as in other ways.
Looking back over two years as Budget Commissioner and on two years of Budget discussions with Parliament and the Council, I can truly say that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have together managed to meet well the demands made on the European Budget, and I am very optimistic that we will achieve this again for 2002.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, for his efforts to reconcile the different interests in this House.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to remind you that we are at the first reading stage, which, although this seems obvious at first sight, makes it clear that many of the balances and agreements we must achieve will be of a general nature and will have repercussions upon the final appropriations under this heading.
In this context, I would like to give a vote of confidence to the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, as long as he, of course, takes on board to the greatest extent possible the priorities set out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are balanced, given that they seek an equitable distribution between different geographical areas, and aim to respond to the European Union' s various commitments on the international stage.
The Commissioner referred to the finely balanced measures we have had to take in the last few years: Commissioner, we cannot continue in such an unmethodical fashion, we cannot continue to finance new priorities with the same resources.
I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives, but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made.
We will have to look for formulae that are more imaginative and more creative in this area.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has given its opinion: we want to strengthen the Commission' s administrative reform policy, particularly with regard to the decentralised management of external aid.
With regard to the proposals made by Commissioner Patten, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has expressed its strong support on this matter.
In conclusion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs gives its support and vote of confidence to the general rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, we affectionately urge him to pay very close attention to the objectives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has set out in its opinion for this 2002 budget.
. On behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would also like to offer my congratulations to Mr Costa Neves for guiding us so far and for the very good job that he has done.
I have been asked by my committee to raise a number of points, the main one being the amendment that we are retabling on the Court of Auditors.
As the House will know, the Court of Auditors asked for a number of new staff.
The Council recommended that only five new staff be granted and various positions have been taken on the additional staff requested and the money for them.
The Committee on Budgetary Control decided quite wisely, in my view, that we should take an apolitical stance on this.
We should ask the Court of Auditors to assess the performance of financial control systems in the applicant countries; improve the Court of Auditors' cooperation with the national audit institutions - which is a requirement of the Treaty of Nice - and establish more detailed specific DAS assessments - again, a requirement of the Treaty of Nice.
We would therefore be fairly apolitical and once those issues had been clarified, we would ask for the money to be released for the other posts.
However, in the Committee on Budgets a completely different amendment was tabled.
It is much more political, and we are very worried about the independence of the Court of Auditors in relation to the requirements set down by the Committee on Budgets, so I do hope that will be considered.
I have also been asked to say a word about implementation.
We have looked at the implementation figures and we will continue to look at them in the future and use them for future amendments to the budget.
You have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far.
We have also looked at tabling amendments.
We have an amendment coming through asking for money to be tied up and asking the Commission to tell us whether an evaluation unit has been set up in DG V.
Finally, we are very concerned about the future of the A-30 lines, or rather how they are going to be spent.
Those are the points that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to raise.
Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to emphasise one point, namely the PRINCE programme.
We see it as very important that the information campaign on the euro should be carried on for another half-year, for we find an information deficit here despite great campaigning efforts.
It is particularly marked among small and medium-sized enterprises, and this programme is intended to make good this deficit.
As permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I can say at the present time that the most acute problems have been resolved with the help not only of our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the general rapporteur.
We decided, on the basis of the facts, to consider the agencies individually.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for future reference.
The agencies carry on growing, as they have done for years.
Everyone who works in one seems to have a vested interest in the agencies' expansion.
To give an example, between 1995 and 2001, the personnel complement of the agencies increased by 366%.
We are creating another 99 posts this year alone.
I get the impression that many of the European agencies maintain to some degree a separate existence.
In the Budget procedure, we always have to deal with one demand - they say they need more money.
The consequences of this development are clear to see.
The agencies take up all the scope for other programmes, and at some point the Community ends up having to pay the pension costs as well.
We must make changes here.
No longer must the Budget be adapted to the programmes decided on by the Management Board, but the programmes must fit the resources provided by the Budget.
We need a working audit of the agencies, involving all the actors concerned on a permanent basis. In other words, Parliament's specialised committees must likewise carry out an evaluation.
We urgently need to examine the question of whether the services provided by the agencies are actually needed and then put to good use.
The Budgetary Control Committee, the Court of Auditors and all the other actors must be involved in helping us get a grip on the whole thing.
Over the coming weeks, I will be attempting to create a structure for this purpose, one which can be put to use in the next Budget procedure.
Mr President, I am going to combine my time as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry and spokesperson for the Socialists on the other institutions.
Firstly, I congratulate both the rapporteurs for successfully completing the mammoth budgetary task, and also the chairman of the committee, Mr Wynn, for getting through the votes in record time.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I am disappointed with the outcomes in this budget because many of the priorities which we highlighted have been totally ignored.
Let me single out three issues.
The e-Europe initiative, launched with much fanfare at Lisbon, highlighted how it would increase the competitiveness of European industry; increase employment opportunities; and acknowledge that a knowledge society is indisputably a fundamental prerequisite for future economic prosperity.
The extension of e-Europe to the applicant countries was again much heralded at Stockholm, but we are proposing not to extend this programme.
I would like to remind everybody that the Council and Parliament confirmed e-Europe as a priority.
By not supporting it we are undermining one of Europe's priority programmes and this will be to the detriment of the applicant countries.
We need to ensure, as the rapporteur stated, that rhetoric is matched by action, that the EU citizen is not left to ponder.
We have all these programmes; they are acclaimed; and then they seem to dissipate into thin air!
This applies equally to my second point on Save. This has been a parliamentary priority for a number of years.
Here we have a proposal to decrease the funding for the coming year.
An environmentally-friendly European energy policy is at the top of most people's agendas and it is important that Europe leads the way in our Kyoto obligations.
Therefore, to reduce programmes that promote sustainable energy consumption and impact on climate protection is extremely short-sighted.
The third area in which the Committee on Industry will be retabling amendments is the decommissioning of weapons of mass destruction, and waste management.
These are key to promoting a safer world.
This is even more critical in the light of the recent atrocities of 11 September and to ensure that states have a proper strategy for dismantling chemical weapons so that there are no opportunities for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands.
I would urge the rapporteur to rethink and support these amendments.
Moving on to the other institutions, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for the open and inclusive approach she adopted in arriving at the budget for the other institutions.
This year, as she said, Heading 5 was under tremendous pressure for a number of reasons, including the preparation for the forthcoming enlargement.
My group's efforts have been to continue to improve effectiveness, efficiency and transparency.
As far as Parliament is concerned, these are not just hollow words, but words of substance.
We have demonstrated our commitment to improving efficiency by staying under Parliament's 20% self-imposed ceiling, whilst absorbing the costs of preparations for enlargement of some EUR 18 million.
However, this will be extremely difficult in the coming years.
I would urge the Council to address this, so that the costs associated with the proposed enlargement are dealt with before we commence the budgetary procedure next year.
Furthermore, I welcome the three-year enlargement plan that the Bureau has approved.
At this stage, it is fairly sketchy and perhaps conservative - with a small 'c' - and not very radical.
This is a shame because enlargement offers a real opportunity to make Parliament more dynamic in its operation.
Some of the ideas outlined in this plan need to be developed further and we need to have a broader view of how things are done.
Yesterday we heard in plenary that Parliament was unable to look at the money laundering proposals, which were agreed by the Council, for another three weeks because of the need for translation into 11 languages.
This is extremely frustrating for everybody concerned, but what will this mean when we have 10 more languages?
We must address this issue because it causes us fundamental problems in terms of the image of Parliament.
It creates negative perceptions in the minds of European citizens, in that the European Parliament is seen as undynamic and unresponsive.
Whilst we are on the subject of radical thinking, I would like to make some suggestions to the Council to improve their own efficiency.
The under-utilisation of Parliament's buildings, for instance.
We have buildings in Brussels which are almost empty for one week every month, and a building in Strasbourg which is hardly used and remains empty for three weeks a month.
As the Council is consistently pointing out waste, here is an offer it cannot refuse.
It could share and make full use of our buildings by holding its meetings in our buildings.
I hope that will also benefit transparency in the way it works.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Mr President, we on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy this year can generally welcome the progress that has been made so far in formulating the budget for next year.
Looking back historically, we are doing a better job every year and this is certainly due partly to the work done by the rapporteurs.
Things are going along much more smoothly than they were, despite the fact that we are considerably squeezed for money because of external demands upon our budget.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Budgets has supported the view of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in restoring some of the budget lines which we are particularly concerned with, at least to the level of the PDB.
Also, it is worth mentioning that we look with approval upon the work that was done in terms of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets with regard to the tobacco subsidies.
They urge the Council to take a good look at this.
We urge the Commission to take a good look at this.
We know something must be done.
I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets acknowledges this.
Its proposals for a gradual reduction over a period of time of that subsidy make sense, and it is time the Council and the Commission started talking about this issue.
One particular success is on the issue of the budget line associated with the approval of orphan drugs by the medicines agency.
I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well.
This has been a very successful budget line since created last year together with the SAB procedure.
We were concerned about what the Council wanted to do in terms of the massive cut it demanded in that line, which was completely unjustified.
We are pleased about the restoration to an appropriate level of that budget line and we hope the Commission will also defend that point of view to the Council.
This is a budget line which does genuinely good work for the people of Europe and brings real and genuine benefits and it must be protected.
Finally, I would say that we have some concerns about the way in which the agencies have been handled.
I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate, but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Agriculture Committee wishes to address the Council and express its fundamental opposition to the cuts across the board that the Council is always making.
We see this, in political terms, as a rather unimaginative way of handling Budget guidelines.
We are working on the assumption that the letter of amendment will be the right basis on which to adjust individual areas in preparation for second reading.
Apart from that, we hold to our demand for agricultural expenditure to be made more flexible in future by enabling the transfer of funds from the mandatory to the discretionary division.
We know how complicated that is and how many changes have to be made, but we will carry on demanding this whenever budgets are laid before us, until our demands have been met.
The Commission's proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support.
That is needed. We are sure that we do not have to explain why it is necessary.
We also assume that the Commission will act responsibly if it becomes necessary to make use of it.
Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have just spoken about tobacco.
We too on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to return to the tobacco issue.
We are most dissatisfied with the inadequate use being made of money from the Tobacco Research Fund.
On the Agriculture Committee, we, too, are fed up with forever flogging a dead horse where this subject is concerned.
We have, on the one hand, the demand for preventative health education, and, on the other, the need to promote tobacco growing.
We must, though, face reality.
For as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco - and they are not the richest - and have no alternative crop to offer them, we cannot help them.
This sector therefore needs possible alternatives not only to be examined, but also offered.
Most of all, I would like to say something more about SAPARD: we are glad that the appropriations have been increased, but, like the Commissioner, we are critical of the way the Council has cut by EUR 100 million the amount of funds SAPARD is authorised to pay out.
This is not on!
It is absolutely not on!
Please, Commissioner, let there be no fear of a new implementation along the lines of LEADER.
Take your courage in both hands!
Let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee.
Mr President, to begin with, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for offering such close and constructive cooperation.
That does not mean that he was able to agree on all counts as far as the fisheries budget is concerned, but he listened carefully to everything we had to say and created, in any event, a basis for further collaboration, which we found useful.
The huge problems in the fisheries sector and the partial failure of the common fisheries policy have left their mark on the fisheries budget.
Clearly, the multi-annual orientation programme and the unilateral closure of areas have not proved successful.
Failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement with Morocco has led to an explosive situation along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, an area which is already facing major social problems in connection with illegal immigration.
It is for that reason that the Committee on Fisheries has asked for nearly EUR 200 million in order to be able to tackle these problems.
The rapporteur suggests including a token entry first and challenging the Council to meet the pledges made in Nice.
The Committee on Fisheries endorses this view.
However, the Committee on Fisheries is disappointed by the fact that the budget proposal for more money for quota control, which was desperately needed, has been watered down by a liberal amendment in the Committee on Budgets, while the original amendment did receive wide support from all groups in the Committee on Fisheries with this proposal.
In the capacity as shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE Group for the agricultural budget, I note that, of the original request for EUR 1 billion extra for food safety and animal disease control, eventually 580 million was left over, but what we say is: better some of a pudding than none of a pie.
In actual fact, we also regret to some extent the Commission' s failure to adhere to the original request for EUR 1 billion extra.
Fortunately, the PPE-DE position, that more money must be earmarked for animal disease control, has met with approval.
In general, we are of the opinion that, in order to restore consumer confidence, it is vital to bring the European markets, including those for beef, back to normal.
As a final point, I have to say that I am delighted with the fact that, with regard to foreign policy, the PPE-DE Group will be tabling an amendment for more attention for Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and I should also like to recommend this amendment warmly for further discussions.
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of whom I am speaking, put forward ten or so amendments to the draft budget with regard to the four Community initiatives (URBAN, INTERREG, EQUAL and LEADER), for safety and sustainability in transport and tourism.
Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September, tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union.
The World Tourism Organisation anticipates a doubling in the number of tourist arrivals up to a figure of approximately 720 million per year by the year 2020.
The 9 million people who already work in the tourism industry will be joined by a further 2 to 3.5 million between now and 2010, to reach 12.5 million people employed.
The Committee on Budgets, however, rejected our proposals.
Fortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has once again been able to put forward an amendment to this House so that, at European level, resources are assigned to stimulate the promotion, monitoring and evaluation of a tourism policy that is both ecological and socially sustainable.
I trust that the majority of my fellow Members here will have the sensitivity necessary to support this reaffirmed proposal with their vote.
Mr President, the budget of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport contains three important new features:
Firstly, a separate appropriation of EUR 12.6 million is being proposed for the implementation of the elearning initiative.
It is justified because IT studies have a key place in the EU' s strategy.
A considerable increase in the appropriation for IT teaching would also be wise, as if it is to be financed merely from the Socrates, YOUTH and Culture 2000 programmes this might put the implementation of the fundamental aims of these programmes in jeopardy.
We have to remember that information technology is a tool, not an absolute value.
The second new feature is connected with sport, which still does not have a legal basis in the Union.
Sport is mentioned, however, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the conclusions of the Nice Summit stressed its social importance.
The Committee on Budgets has approved a proposal for a EUR 5 million appropriation for sports club work to prevent exclusion amongst youth.
The third new matter in our Committee' s budget is the EUR 1 million appropriation for establishing a centre for monitoring cultural co-operation.
In my opinion, the co-ordination of cultural co-operation could be practised in association with the Council of Europe, which has much experience in the field.
Chapter A-30 again caused problems.
I am very disappointed with the work of the Committee on Budgets in item A-3042, which concerns the funding of European cultural organisations.
We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport had done a lot of work in connection with this point.
We took the Commission' s report on the funding of organisations into account as well as the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets' working party.
We, above all, tried to assess how money might be used in the best possible way from the point of view of European culture.
I cannot accept that the Committee on Budgets has interfered with a proposal that required the expertise of a special committee the way it has.
I warmly support the proposal contained in the report drafted by Mr Costa Neves for a legal basis and proper rules to apply to A-30.
Parliament cannot act as if it were in a 'grab as grab can' type of wrestling contest, in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Vande Lanotte, I would like to draw your attention to the three amendments tabled by Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The aim of these amendments is to enhance the information given to citizens and to stimulate the debate on issues relating to the future of the European Union, pursuant to Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice.
The aim of Amendment No 223 is to restore the commitment appropriations granted to the Prince-Programme, as proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.
The increase in these appropriations has, in fact, been reduced by the Council.
We feel it is inconceivable not to support strong investment to provide more information for the public on the euro, enlargement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, of course, on measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
All these subjects are extremely topical.
I would also like to reiterate that we are already involved in a period of reflection and consultation on the future of the European Union.
We also believe that it would be counter-productive to enter, as suggested by the Committee on Budgets, a part of these appropriations into a reserve.
