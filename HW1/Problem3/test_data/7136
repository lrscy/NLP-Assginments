His wife at home must be blind if she cannot see that there is quite some activity outside the marital home.
A great deal of pomp and flashing lights, a great deal of silver and porcelain, distinguished guests, one important engagement after another, and now even a meeting with GeorgeÂ W. Bush.
There is never a dull moment with Europa.
What kind of a figure does this Europa cut on the international stage, however?
Is she a strong, self-confident woman with the support of those around her, a woman who we believe to be capable of guiding us safely through difficult times?
Do we believe in Europa, or do we see a figure plagued with self-doubt, who does not know her role in this society, in this network of connections between individual countries?
What is it we want from Europa?
What do we expect of her?
We certainly have a clear idea.
We believe that Europa should protect us from poverty, should provide security, should ensure that we do not have to live from hand to mouth, but instead are able to put something aside both now and in the future, should not let others treat her like a child in the global village, and should set an example.
Expectations of Europe run high, but we do not believe it capable of meeting any of them.
This explains the great scepticism that registers on the Eurobarometer.
At the present time, Europe is completely incapable of meeting the expectations of the public â the Council gives it far too little scope to do so, and the Commission keeps it occupied with tasks that increasingly alienate it from the European public.
No one understands Europe.
What does it spend all its time doing anyway?
The essentials remain undone â that message, at least, is conveyed â and so discontent grows.
Europe urgently needs a new master plan with projects focused on the citizen.
It needs to become less ponderous, needs to develop an image.
This is impossible when the Council Presidency rotates biannually.
One goes, another takes its place; this is a âhalfway houseâ, not a safe home.
I know that things would be different if we had the Constitution.
This will not be the case in 2007, however â and so I ask that the Summit produce clear competences and greater efficiency for Europe.
If it does this, even the public will give the green light for the Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, typical statements contained in the Presidencyâs draft conclusions concern the EUâs need to listen to people and need to conduct a dialogue with them.
Statements of both these kinds envisage a situation involving two parties.
Who, then, are the parties that in some sense confront each other?
Curiously enough, it is the people of Europe and the establishment.
This means that political representatives do not in practice see themselves as representatives of the people but as a group or establishment in opposition to the people.
That is very unfortunate.
That is why we are always so surprised and shaken at the results of our occasional referendums in Europe.
The European party structure is completely out of date.
Europeans cannot vote for their own parties and, at the same time, communicate their deep euroscepticism.
That is something we must change in the future so that we do not continue with this undignified game.
An establishment must listen to the people and be prepared to conduct a dialogue with them.
The establishment must represent the people.
Â Â  Mr President, I have the growing impression that the discussion on the future of Europe has reached a dead end.
It is like the obstruction of a blood vessel which supplies the heart with blood.
If this situation continues, there is a risk of an extremely serious and extensive stroke.
I have the impression that the discussion on the Constitutional Treaty is precisely such an obstruction.
I am someone who supported the Constitutional Treaty and who still supports it.
I nevertheless lamented the fact that, as a result of the ambitions of certain politicians, it came to be known as the European Constitution, which led from a pragmatic discussion of what should be included in the treaty to a referendum for or against the European Union.
Although I lamented this label and these ambitions, I also acknowledged that such a treaty was necessary.
Today, it should be very clearly stated that this state of affairs is untenable.
It is not possible to vote again on the same document in these countries.
I appeal to you to remove this obstruction, allowing fresh blood to reach the heart, so that we may deal with serious problems such as the real liberalisation of the European economy, something which still has not taken place.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the subjects for the forthcoming Summit is the attempt to define the European Unionâs exact absorption capacity with regards to potential new members.
Further enlargement of the European Union depends on this definition.
It will be an important debate as this definition should not be the key which closes the future path to membership for the European Unionâs most important neighbours.
Fear of enlargement provides bad counsel.
We should, of course, aim to define the geographical borders of the European Community, but we also should remember that we are bound by clearly defined criteria that are supposed to be met by potential candidates for European Union membership.
We have to remember that the Union is an attractive project which gives hope to millions of our neighbours: Belarusians and Ukrainians.
Today, in Belarus, we support civil society.
The current dictatorship, backed by Russia, makes it impossible to pursue any other policy.
However, the Union should pay particular attention to defining clear European prospects for Ukraine.
The behaviour of the Kiev Government when attempts were made to use energy as a tool for blackmail in December, its solidarity with Moldova, for example the close monitoring of the Transnistria region and its good relations with Georgia show that Ukraine can be a real stabilising force in the region and can guarantee the growth of democracy.
It is an invaluable ally for the European Union.
I will now move on to the second issue related to the European Summit, which is the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency.
This is supposed to be an important institution whose work should support respect for human rights.
However, I would like to express my concern about the fact that there are attempts to limit its scope to activities in the Member States of the European Union.
The historic mission of the Union is that of supporting and promoting democratic ideas and governments.
Worldwide, many threats still exist outside the European Union.
That is why the setting up of a Fundamental Rights Agency should be used to send a clear message to the global public that the Union possesses an effective instrument to support all those who fight for human rights and basic democratic freedoms.
That is why I appeal for the activities of the Agency not to be limited to the territories of the 25 Member States.
The Agency needs to act in other countries as well, most importantly those which are covered by the European Union neighbourhood policy or by partnership agreements, as is the case with Russia.
Â Â  Mr President, there is an old saying that if you do not fight, you do not count.
Mr Barroso, I like to see you fighting.
I recognise that you are fighting for a new treaty.
I also like to see Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m fighting â you make a nice couple when you are fighting.
Let me tell you that we really need to fight now.
What is going on in the Council?
I know what is going on: maybe one day, through informal contacts behind closed doors, we will get a new treaty, as Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said today, but that was the old way of doing things.
Now we need to do it together with the people.
If we do not have the people with us, we will not have a new treaty.
That is why I am so happy to see that we together â Parliament, the European parties and the Commission â can have a true European debate with ordinary people.
Excuse me for saying so, but it is a hell of a job, because it takes time and energy and often you get very little thanks for it.
However, at the end you will make a difference in history, because the result will be a new treaty.
Therefore I just have two pieces of advice to give you. Firstly, we, together with the chairman of the group, have focused on the following issues.
We cannot do more to resolve international conflicts, especially in the Middle East, without a new treaty.
We cannot create more and better jobs and ensure better economic cooperation without a new treaty.
We cannot combat terrorism, trafficking and cross-border crime without a new treaty.
We need a new treaty in order to have low energy prices. We need a new treaty to have greater transparency.
Therefore, Mr Barroso, I recommend that you work harder, as you have said, on this declaration next year.
However, promise me that one of the major messages in that declaration next year will be that this European Union is not a competition amongst states, because that is what people increasingly fear.
They fear uncertainty and financial competition on lowering taxes, a sort of social dumping, thereby undermining the welfare state.
This European Union is a transparent and fair competition in the free market between firms, services and projects, which can contribute to our wealth.
That is a very important signal to send out.
The European Union is about people: putting people first, combining a new welfare state and a modernised version, for this regionâs prosperity.
My last point is that we need Bulgaria and Romania.
We need to have a clear signal, President-in-Office, when you meet the day after tomorrow.
We will meet in Brussels, with our leaders and prime ministers, and our message will be clear: we need Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2007. They deserve it and Europe needs them.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make three brief comments.
First, I do wonder, when we hold our debates here in Strasbourg, whether we should really be setting up the Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna in competition to the Council of Europe, a tried and tested instrument that is able to take on this task not only for the EU Member States but far beyond our borders.
I can really only encourage you, as I have also said to ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel in a debate, to make an active contribution to treating the European disease of 'agencyitis' effectively.
You could also send out a clear signal from your own country in that connection.
Secondly â and in this I almost completely agree with what MrÂ Rasmussen said before me â we obviously also need to defend our own values in the context of the enlargement negotiations.
I am rather worried that we are falling back into the mechanical behaviour that we have been experiencing here for the past 10 years and that we have criticised time and again in this forum.
Was it really necessary to negotiate a chapter with Turkey on Monday, despite the fact that some of the minimum conditions, specifically recognition of the Ankara Protocol, have not even been dealt with yet?
I wonder whether we are perhaps once again sending out the wrong signals by setting in motion a train that, 10, 12 or however many years down the track, we will still not be able to stop.
The Austrian Presidency of the Council could have sent out a clearer signal in this regard, too.
Thirdly, the European Union is founded on the Member States.
There is no single European people â and this goes for MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, too, who is now not listening â but 25 national peoples, as we are seeing at the moment with the football.
And we have a European Union that is founded on the Member States and not on a majority of the population expressing their opinions in referendums.
That really does need to be taken into account, otherwise this project will ultimately founder.
Â Â  Mr President, we complain that, in spite of our successes and achievements during 50 years of European integration, the European Union has become stuck in a rut.
We complain that it lacks a clear vision, that there is no agreement on what direction to take and what to do in the future.
However, we should admit that these criticisms and reservations expressed by the citizens are related to the current functioning of EU politics rather than the Constitutional Treaty, whose significance has not been sufficiently explained to the public.
After all, the European Constitution is a fundamental document which will allow the Union to deal with new challenges.
We are all aware that the Union cannot develop further on the basis of the existing Treaties, and not because these Treaties are âtoo restrictiveâ for 25 or more Member States.
These Treaties have a basic flaw in that they do not provide for the involvement of civil society either in shaping Union policies or in the decision-making process.
President Barroso, I would like to ask how many millions of signatures we would need to collect today, as part of a citizensâ initiative, in order for the Commission to hear the voice of the citizens.
At the moment you are not obliged to take account of their voice, but the Constitutional Treaty would give the citizens the opportunity to set up such an initiative and one million signatures would be enough.
I repeat, one million out of 457 million European Union citizens would be needed to set up such an initiative.
Does this mean nothing to opponents of the Constitutional Treaty who bandy democratic slogans about so enthusiastically?
President Barroso, it is with pleasure that I heard your declaration on the Constitution today.
However, these words must be backed up with actions and the most important task at the moment is to win back the trust of the citizens of Europe in the European project.
We have to do this in the old Union where Europe has become very commonplace because the citizens have had it for too long and also take advantage of pro-European feeling, or rather enthusiasm, in the new Member States.
In my country, Poland, 80% of citizens want more Europe and 60% want a Constitutional Treaty.
This is a good sign and I hope that during the European Summit these countries will make the right decisions, showing the way for Europe and the place of the Constitutional Treaty, so that we may overcome this impasse.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the European Commission, you have made a good speech today and I would like to congratulate you on it.
You have made a good speech, because I believe that you have managed to move people, those of us who are here and those outside of this Parliament who are listening to us.
You have argued that we should not allow ourselves to indulge in Euro-pessimism and I believe that you are right.
You have also said something very important: that Europe is not in crisis.
It is true.
Europe is not in crisis.
We must not allow ourselves to believe that.
It is also the case, however, that we must make an effort to explain why the Constitutional Treaty is important to peopleâs lives, because many people take the view that the Constitutional Treaty has not entered into force â which is the case â but nothing has gone wrong as a result; Europe has not fallen into the sea.
Many people are therefore tempted to say that the Constitutional Treaty is not so important, since nothing has gone wrong despite it not having entered into force.
In all of the campaigns that I have taken part in, I have never heard what all of the leaders who have spoken here today have said: the Constitutional Treaty is necessary in order for Europe to function better, in order to provide the people with added value.
We must make a huge educational effort to explain to the people what I have previously called âthe cost of not having a Constitutionâ: why not having a Constitutional Treaty has a negative impact on their daily lives.
As Mr Rasmussen has said, explaining these things is a tough task; it is a task that requires a great intellectual effort.
We must apply our grey matter, in order to explain it to the people through clear and relevant examples, but it is a necessary task.
I believe that Europe requires a huge amount of education today, but it also requires a degree of calm, a degree of political skill, and I believe that this Parliament, which has been a pioneer on many other occasions, through the Resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that we are going to approve today, indicates that direction.
Through a lot of education, I believe that we will be able to rescue the ship of the Constitution, get it back afloat, and ensure that the Constitutional Treaty provides the people with added value.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, MrÂ Barroso, that, during next Friday's Summit, you must go against what was claimed in Klosterneuburg and argue that the problem is not one of extending the period of reflection on the institutional issue, but rather of making swift progress both in improving and ratifying the European Constitution and regarding policies capable of improving Europeâs image among Europeans.
In fact, if the two countries that failed to ratify the Constitution did so for reasons quite different to those regarding the constitutional text, then it is really a question of moving more quickly on practical policies capable of changing Europeâs image for the better.
In order to do this, however, we need to go beyond the period of reflection on the institutional issue as quickly as possible.
The constraints that we come up against in implementing the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world are, in fact, mainly due to the intergovernmental, rather than Community, approach.
There can be no single currency without common economic and social policies and without a genuine form of socio-economic governance.
We must therefore clearly state that social and economic problems are resolved by a form of institution building that is in keeping with the Community approach.
If we do not want to destroy Europe, then we must state, as MrÂ Schulz did, that Europe needs the Constitution immediately.
Â Â  Mr President, the Euro-pessimism that President Barroso spoke about seems to be a much more contagious disease than avian flu.
It is serious, because it provides a good excuse for many political leaders not to face the challenges of changing Europe.
If it continues in this way, this situation will remind me more and more of the old Soviet joke from the 1970s: the Soviet economy was in stalemate and the train was not moving, so the order was given to draw the curtains, rock the carriage to and fro and pretend the train was moving at high speed.
Clearly we need a political solution, not in the form of first division and second division Europe, but with a new quality of political leadership that would be worthy of the founding fathers 50 years ago.
Can we really restore trust and generate inspiration among the voters if we continue to conduct our policies from one national election to another, finding in them a good excuse not to apply the common policies?
I think people can easily differentiate between far-sighted, compassionate and courageous leadership and the petty and patronising approach of those whose main aim is to retain control of the situation.
If the name of the Constitution is an obstacle, then I am prepared to change the name.
We could streamline the format, but we need to retain the substance of the Constitution, otherwise we cannot successfully apply the common policies of enlarged Europe.
We cannot apply the solidarity which is a guiding principle of all our efforts.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall talk about the PNR agreement with the United States, which the European Court of Justice has rejected, and about the framework decision on data protection, which unfortunately the European Council rejects every day by default.
My specific proposal is this: firstly, that if you go ahead and renew the PNR agreement on the basis of the third pillar, you only do so until 2007.
Secondly, that you then negotiate with Parliament changes to this agreement which safeguard fundamental rights and that you do so by applying the clause at long last.
Thirdly, that you proceed throughout in cooperation with the European Parliament and in a serious tripartite dialogue and, fourthly, that you immediately adopt the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar.
We shall be voting on Parliament's proposal today.
It is a very serious proposal and it is time you started working on it.
Keep the promises of the Danish Presidency to the European Parliament and pass it because, if you do not, I worry that the European Parliament will be forced to halt other important activities, even though they require first and foremost a European law for the protection of rights.
Â Â  Mr President, Parliament has been a consistent supporter of enlargement and, in particular, the timely accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
I trust, therefore, that the European Council this week will confirm its commitment to the accession date of 1Â January 2007 for those countries.
As the rapporteur for Bulgaria over the past six years, I have seen at first hand the progress that has been made in transforming the economy, the political system and the administrative structures of that country.
Above all there has been a change in attitudes and expectations.
People want a better life and now believe that it is achievable.
It is most important that we do nothing to undermine that confidence and the duty to the people of Bulgaria that we share with the Bulgarian authorities.
The resolution of Parliament makes clear that some concrete results are needed in the coming months.
Those are primarily the responsibility of the Bulgarian Government, but the Commission and the Member States must do all they can to help.
I know that the United Kingdom and some other countries have already provided assistance in the fight against organised crime.
I would ask for a reinforcement of that effort during the next four months.
Turning to other matters, the European Union is very good at giving lessons to others, but often fails to learn lessons itself.
We have heard much about the âperiod of reflectionâ following the failure of the Constitution, but we seem incapable of drawing the right conclusions.
The answer that we hear this morning is âmore Europeâ.
I do not know where that is coming from.
It is not what I hear from the people of East Anglia that I represent.
They want less interference from Brussels and they want the European Union to put its House in order and to carry out a more limited range of tasks with greater efficiency.
People want more control over their own lives.
They want accountable national and local government; they want security and prosperity and they want a Europe that differs from the outmoded project that unfortunately is still on the table.
Â Â  Mr President, those who claim â on one side of the House, notably â that the French and Dutch have said ânoâ and that this whole debate must therefore come to an end and we should never again consider changing the treaties are guilty of being far too simplistic and of only wanting to hear one answer.
When they say, as one of them did, âwhich part of the word ânoâ do you not understand owing to the French and Dutch results?â, we could easily turn round and say âwhich part of the word âyesâ do not understand from the 16 to 18 â if you include Romania and Bulgaria â other countries that have said âyesâ to this constitution?â
We are not faced with an issue of overwhelming rejection or of overwhelming acceptance, but we are facing a problem of divergence.
And what do we do in the Union when there is a problem of divergence?
We sit down, talk it through and try to find a solution acceptable to everyone.
That is how we make progress.
That is why it is right to take the time to have this period of reflection and to prolong it and look at what is possible.
It is also right to address not just the question of the text, but also the context â , the Hampton Court agenda, the issues that are close to people â and then, in due course, in a new context, we can decide what to do about the text.
Make no mistake about it: we will have to decide what to do about the text.
The issues that Treaty was intended to address have not disappeared.
They have not vanished overnight and need solving.
We will have to return to these issues, and it is quite correct to orient the period of reflection towards them.
It may be that in a yearâs time and in a new context it will be possible to retain this text as it stands, or with certain additions clarifying it, or with interpretations, or with additional protocols, or by rewriting PartÂ 3, as some have suggested.
It may also be that this is not possible and it has to be broken up.
The conclusion may be that we will have to live with the existing Treaties for ever more because it is now impossible to change them.
However, all this will emerge in due course.
Now is not the time to make that choice.
Now is not the time to say that we need to rewrite the text.
We will take that decision at the end of the period of reflection, and rightly so.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands, it is high time for Europe to pull itself together and to put forward some solutions to make the most of the content of its draft European Constitution.
Our Heads of State or Government will need to discuss some key issues for our future: energy independence, immigration, the future of the Constitutional Treaty and enlargement.
On each of those subjects, Europeans expect their leaders to give real answers and to have the courage to accept both the political and financial consequences of those answers.
The humanitarian situation amongst the immigrants flocking to the southern shores of the EU needs to form one of Europe's highest priorities, and it calls for a joint response in terms of reception of immigrants and asylum policy.
It also demonstrates the need for an in-depth re-examination of our development policy, which is evidently failing to meet the urgent needs of people in countries that we want, but are not managing, to help.
With regard to enlargement, I welcome the European Commission's wisdom in deciding to postpone the decision on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria until next October, depending on the progress achieved by each of those countries.
However, the Commission also needs to show similar perceptiveness with regard to Turkey.
I am very critical of the very positive signals just given to that country in the context of the accession negotiations, at a time when it still does not recognise Cyprus, one of the Members of the Union it wants to join.
Europe can only be strong if it is respected, and it will only be respected if it applies the same legal rules to all.
Finally, I would like to remind you that the criterion of absorption capacity has not simply been invented by certain Member States, but is one of the Copenhagen criteria.
We will be fooling the candidate countries if we lead them to believe that we are doing them a favour by allowing them to join a Union that is not in full working order.
We would be deceiving both the people of the current Member States and those of the countries that are working so hard to join the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, we are talking about the period of reflection and debate on the future of Europe, but given what we are discussing this morning, I believe that this a debate on the present of the European Union.
The future and the present become fused, particularly because it is essential to implement a Constitution in order to resolve the problems facing us today.
In that regard, I believe that it is essential that the Commission take account of the point in our resolution calling upon it to produce a report on the cost of not having a Constitution.
That is essential.
I would ask for even more: for the Commission to commit itself, Mr Barroso, to present that report to this House and to the Council immediately after the summer, in September or October, so that we can hold a debate with the citizens specifically about how, with the Constitution not in force, we can resolve issues such as illegal immigration, which has been discussed here.
We must continue with the process of ratification and eventually find a solution that can unblock it, but on the basis of this text, which is a good text: it is a text based on a consensus.
I believe that that is the objective of the European Parliamentâs resolution.
I have just one request for you, Mr Barroso: I have been happy to applaud you today; I can tell you quite honestly that this is the first time I have done so.
If you express the same arguments outside of this House, I shall continue to do so.
Â Â  Mr President, I too agree that measures should be taken to bring the European Union closer to the citizens.
I therefore support that Europe of results that the President, Mr Barroso, has mentioned today.
The failure of the referendums in France and the Netherlands did not just reflect domestic political issues, but also the fact that some citizens do not sufficiently understand or value the process of European construction.
We must increase the citizensâ faith in the Union, show them its added value, through more effective action on issues such as security, the effective control of migratory flows, job creation and so on. These are issues to which the European Council must pay the greatest possible attention.
We must also better explain how the Union operates and the objectives it pursues.
A few days ago, in Aachen, Prime Minister Juncker proposed that young Europeans should visit the war cemeteries so that new generations could fully appreciate the contribution that the Union makes to peace on a continent that has been so blood-stained by past wars.
I believe that the Union should also have a place in colleges and schools.
As the Chairman of my party, Mariano Rajoy, proposed a few months ago in Paris, a specific obligatory subject should be created in all colleges and schools in the Member States, which would cover the origin, the objectives and the operation of the European Union's institutions.
That kind of education aimed at young people is very important.
We must also explain another great success: the enlargement processes.
We must stress that the prospect of accession has been a powerful driving force in terms of the great political, economic and social transformations that have taken place in many countries, which have benefited both them and the Union.
I would like to end by referring to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, a resolution on which we shall approve today.
In recent times, these countries have been making spectacular progress in many areas.
They are undergoing those great transformations that I mentioned just now, and in particular I would like to stress the progress that Romania has made in areas such as the reform of the justice system and the fight against corruption.
If they continue with these reforms, I am convinced that both countries will join the Union on 1 January 2007 and I am very pleased that the next European Council will encourage them to focus their efforts on achieving that common objective.
Â Â  Mr President, we need a Constitution in order to respond to the challenges which the new millennium has brought for cooperation.
A Union of almost 30 countries cannot be successfully guided by rules established in the last millennium for a Community of what was originally six countries.
A Constitutional Treaty will be a rational response to the challenges that the public have set for European cooperation.
They have called for transparency in decision making, clarity in agreements and treaties, and power in matters which need to be dealt with together so that the measures taken are sufficiently effective.
If our citizens are to be treated equally, each Member State must have a right and an obligation to decide independently whether to ratify the Constitution.
Only then will it be time to draw conclusions on the future of the Treaty.
As the next country to hold the presidency, Finland deserves our appreciation for implementing this principle.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make three points.
The first point is that I think the speech made by Mr Barroso was excellent.
Right now we are getting involved in this vicious circle of Euro-pessimism and what we need is a heavy-duty injection of Euro-optimism.
We need to take a look at what we have achieved over the past 10 to 12 years and the results are overwhelming â everything from enlargement to justice and home affairs, CFSP, and, of course, the single currency.
Sometimes we have a tendency to lose perspective.
We must realise that the European Union is constant crisis management.
We go from one little crisis to another, but I think the bigger picture is a success story.
The second point I want to make is that right now I think we are facing a new generation of what I call âEU whingersâ or âEU whinersâ.
They are people, usually ministers, who go into a closed room, have a discussion, clap each other on the back and say âgreat decisionâ.
Five minutes after that, they get into the blame game, go in front of their national media and say, âoh no, what an awful decision the EU has just madeâ.
You cannot talk negatively about the European Union six days a week and then go to church on Sunday and say that the EU is a great thing.
Perhaps this could be the reason why the UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett does not want to see much transparency, because then people would see that some of the British positions are actually pro-European.
The final point I want to make is that we need a constitutional treaty.
The problems are not going to go away and we have heard that in the debate today.
We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights; we need a legal personality; we need a foreign minister; we need more qualified-majority voting and we need more codecision.
So we need to fix it, and hopefully we can fix it before 2009.
Deepening and widening go hand in hand.
Nice is not enough.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to mention three key issues regarding the enlargement of the European Union.
The first issue is the consolidation of the current round of enlargement, that is, are we using the same standard when we decide to allow new Member States to enter the euro zone?
That is, is the European Union going to ensure that the conditions for the enlargement of the Schengen area are in place by next year as far as the European Union is concerned?
That is, are we going to create the Fundamental Rights Agency, which has already been adopted by the European Parliament, or are we going to sabotage it instead?
These are important questions at a time when we have seen that for instance, for the first time ever, we applied a sanction against the will of a Member State in the case of Lithuania, a Member State applying for entry in the euro zone.
Why is a price stability policy desirable in the case of a country in the process of catching up?
Or should perhaps deflation be a term of reference in this case?
Also, was the perspective of a Maastricht criterion better in 1999 in an Italy indebted to the hilt, than it would be today in Vilnius?
Why are the ten new Member States lectured about inflation, through Lithuania, by those in whose countries the situation is progressively worsening, such as in the Spain of Mr Alumnia or the Luxembourg of Mr Juncker?
This is rightfully branded as a disgraceful approach by none other than one of the fathers of the euro, Professor LÃ¡mfalussy.
And can the esteemed Council and Commission take the strategic political decision of not recommending admission, without Parliament, who is usually so proud of its privileges?
How is the same standard applied in this case?
Secondly, are we really going to wait for the assessment of the Commission in autumn, regarding the date and conditions of accession for Romania and Bulgaria, if we have already extracted this through an exchange of letters?
Are we preparing to rush the accession of countries that are falling dramatically behind current Member States, and even behind the ten new Member States, as regards their economic and social indicators and the level of corruption?
What kind of Europe is this going to be?
What is the vision here?
Will this society comply with and apply the law when it is part of the European Union?
In countries where, for instance, there is no registration of the Roma or of land ownership, or where there are tens of thousands of abandoned babies?
And what about the largest indigenous national minority, the millions of Hungarian speakers?
Why do we not take a look, as regards this case, at our own Copenhagen statements about minorities, made in 1993, or at previous Parliament and Commission presentations, where minority rights and democracy used to have equal standing?
Thirdly, we must also address the standard and speed of individual negotiations.
When are we going to admit, in the course of enlargement negotiations, that the level of preparedness and European integration of Croatia is outstanding, and that it would present fewer absorption problems than, for instance, Turkey?
Without consistency and the use of the same standard, the prestige of the European Union will remain low, and it is clearly visible that by the unhurried building of the two-phase integration, it takes back everything that it has had to spend on the enlargement of the EU.
This is the real, but negative item.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish I was making this speech in a Parliament based in Brussels rather than in this Chamber, since the ongoing Strasbourg circus, now exacerbated by financial scandal, brings our House into disrepute.
I welcome, of course, the fact that Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the European Union in 2007, even if there are still issues to be resolved, such as the system â or lack of a system â for the protection of children in Romania, and the level of organised crime in Bulgaria.
However, delaying their admission by one more year would serve no purpose other than to send the wrong signal to their peoples and governments.
On the vexed issue of what to do about the EU Constitution, I agree with those who say it is dead in its current format.
Nevertheless, even those of us opposed in principle to a constitution, with a foreign minister, permanent president and binding charter of fundamental rights, accept there is a need for treaty adjustment in order to accommodate future enlargement beyond the Nice formula and to settle the increasing imbalance between small and large Member States in terms of voting rights in the institutions.
This matter can only get worse with the proliferation of mini-States in the western Balkans â as recently seen with the independence of Montenegro â all of which are likely to become full Members in the next ten years.
I would also be in favour of retrieving the proposed powers to increase the influence of national parliaments and of more transparency in the co-legislative process in the Council of Ministers, whose current behaviour is far too secretive.
That is why I particularly deplore the U-turn by the British Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, which completely contradicts both the views of her Prime Minister and the general thrust of reform and transparency in the European Union.
It is deeply regrettable that the British Government, unlike its Danish partner, is not cross-examined or mandated in the House of Commons before deciding on its voting position in the Council of Ministers.
The whole process of framing legislation would be empowered, both in the House of Commons and for the British people, if UK ministers went before the House of Commons and were asked which way they were going to vote in the Council of Ministers and then did so in a totally transparent and open fashion.
I would therefore say ânoâ to Mrs Beckett on her views on transparency in the Council of Ministers.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in view of the integration problems we are now experiencing in many EU Member States, and in view of the population trends and the huge problems we are having with illegal immigration and the associated problems of organised crime and trafficking, I welcome the fact that you want to put the focus of the forthcoming European Council on migration.
We need to be quite clear about this: if we want to avoid conflicts in the European Union in the long term, we must manage the influx of economic migrants, taking particular account of the assimilation and integration capacities of our Member States.
We must finally create a European asylum policy, and in this connection I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council, which has undertaken a great deal of preliminary work to ensure that refugees can be aided quickly, whilst at the same time preventing economic migration using asylum certificates and abuse of the asylum system.
We must also focus on combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, which, as I just said, are elements of organised crime.
This cannot be solved by regularisation, as we are currently experiencing once again in Spain: regularisation produces a suction effect, with all of the dramatic results and tragedies that brings with it.
What we need is a comprehensive strategy that must include the following elements: aid in the countries of origin, information campaigns via the mass media â including in the countries of origin â explaining the consequences of illegal immigration, and the establishment of a common external border protection mechanism using the visa information system, the Schengen information system and EURODAC, so that we can achieve the objective of maintaining the stability and security of the European Union over the long term.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all my warmest congratulations to the Austrian Presidency on the work which it carried out and on the fact that it put the European Constitution back into the limelight during its six- month term of office.
My warmest congratulations also to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, on the historic speech which he gave in the European Parliament today.
Mr Barroso restated the European vision today and revived our hopes for the future of Europe.
Well done, Mr Barroso.
Ladies and gentlemen, globalisation has given rise to numerous challenges, numerous problems and numerous pressures in the European Union: economic pressures, political pressures, inflationary pressures and all kinds of challenges.
If it is to be able to meet the challenges of globalisation, it has no choice but to 'constitutionalise' the Union.
Europe cannot function as it is functioning today and be expected to be in a position to address these problems.
No Member State can meet the challenges of globalisation alone.
That is why those talking with because the Constitution is dead need to tell us how they will meet these challenges under the present circumstances.
Europe needs to enhance its credibility and face up to the problems as best it can; this will then provide the basis for supporting the Constitution and defending it to the citizens.
This is our job, the job of all the institutions.
The various Member States need to stop passing the buck to the European Union and, where they stand to benefit, claiming national successes.
Finally, talking about credibility, I must say that it is not in Europe's interest to negotiate with Turkey, which does not recognise one of the twenty-five Member States and is occupying European territory.
It is not in Europe's interest to be lax towards this country, while we have done everything we can to be strict in our judgment of Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ President of the Commission, honourable Members, at the start of this debate, MrÂ Schulz told us that, along with the President of the Commission, MrÂ Leinen was one of the most important people in Europe.
I can absolutely go along with that, if we add the President-in-Office of the Council to the list: it is indeed true.
This public debate that MrÂ Corbett wanted, and the debates that have taken place in this House over the last few months â I would remind you of the highly constructive report from MrÂ Voggenhuber, the discussions in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and the discussions you have held here today â are actually taking place, and, when he says 'we must talk it through', I absolutely agree with him.
A very important debate has been held here today, and it is also going to influence the discussions of the Heads of State or Government, because it is important for Europe.
The President of the Commission has very clearly stated, just as I and many of you have, that we need to walk on both legs, that we need to continue with this twin-track approach of both producing concrete results and actions for our citizens and discussing the future of Europe and the future of a Constitutional Treaty.
I think this is essential, and it is a result that I will take away with me and report to the President of the Council in this form.
MrÂ Poettering and others have mentioned the Fundamental Rights Agency.
I would just like to go into that very briefly, because it is a subject very close to my heart, and I have the impression that there are some misunderstandings in this regard.
It is very much a matter of the European Union as a community of values, and as a union that defends human rights and stands up for them to the outside world, having an institution that can and does stand up for those values.
We think that this human rights agency would be a worthwhile institution, and, of course, that it would not compete in any way with the Council of Europe or any other institutions.
I really would ask you to take a close look at the proposals on the table, because it is precisely this competition that we are trying to exclude.
MrÂ Schulz also talked about human rights, about the issue of GuantÃ¡namo Bay, about shared values, and about the CIA.
It goes without saying that we also need to make these shared values clear to our partners and our friends.
The Council, many Member States and the President-in-Office of the Council have all made that very clear, and, of course, it will also be an important subject at the forthcoming Summit with the United States.
MrsÂ Frassoni and a number of others â to whom I am very grateful, because this was an important issue for the Austrian Presidency â mentioned transparency.
We hope that we will be able to produce a good package at the European Council.
There are indeed one or two other difficulties that we hope we will be able to overcome, for this is another topic which we agree with Parliament is very important to the people.
MrsÂ Frassoni also said that we have not been precise enough with regard to the relaxation of visa rules for the Balkan countries.
I would like to stress once again that we do, of course, have a very precise plan for issuing a mandate and that the Council's conclusions will also state that these negotiations will be concluded within the next year.
We know that this is extremely important for the countries in the Balkans.
MrÂ Voggenhuber, I cannot agree with you that, over the last few months, the Austrian Presidency has been holding these debates behind closed doors with experts and elites.
We have made a great deal of effort.
Perhaps we have not always been successful, but we have made considerable efforts to go out and talk to school children, students and the people on the streets in all kinds of formats and formations.
That is very important: we have tried very hard to do that, and I am sure that future Presidencies will do the same.
MrÂ Galeote referred to immigration, and in this domain, too, we are trying to achieve some very real results.
In future, we will also need to look into the issue of a list of safe third countries, and, of course, we also need a joint asylum policy.
There are a huge number of issues on which we need to work with our partners in Europe to draft a policy that is in everyone's interests.
The issue of minorities has also been brought up, and, on that subject, let me say that this was a particularly important point that the Austrian Presidency has also tried to address.
MrsÂ Resetarits once again talked about Zeus and Europa.
Europa was not just the lover of Zeus: she also had a family with him â they had three children.
Of course this family had arguments, but, as far as we know, they lived happily together, and I think that should serve as an example to us.
If I understood MrÂ Ferber correctly, he said that there are 25 peoples, and he related this to the football World Cup.
If I may interpret this as a suggestion that all 25 or 27 countries should, in future, still be able to compete in the European Football Championships, then I, as an Austrian, can only welcome that, because then we would finally be able to participate again.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I really think that this has been one of the most interesting debates I have participated in so far at the European Parliament.
Above and beyond the various points of view expressed, I have detected a real desire to push forward our European project and I have seen that there is a real interest in rallying together, in uniting: uniting the institutions, and also, because we need their support, uniting the Member States and the citizens of Europe.
We need to unite the three institutions because, let us be quite clear about this, we need all three institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
If the Constitutional Treaty had depended solely on the European Parliament and the Commission, it would already be in place, because the Commission adopted it unanimously and a very large majority of the European Parliament supported it.
However, we also need to be able to count on all the Member States, and, at the moment, not all of the Member States are with us.
That is why, if we really want to deal with this issue, we need to achieve a blend of ambition and realism.
We need to rally together all the Member States.
That being the case, as MrÂ Rasmussen and others have already said, and as MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m reminded us, it is not now enough, if we want Europe to make progress, to ask our diplomats to hold a meeting in a beautiful location to find the solution.
These days, we need to involve the citizens.
Thinking back to the past, I sometimes wonder whether the single market or the single currency, all the progress we have made, could ever have been achieved if we had had a referendum at each stage.
These days, if we want to move Europe forward, we need to do it with our citizens, which, it is true, is why things are much more complicated now.
True, it is much more difficult now, and it is going to take time, but it is absolutely essential: if we want Europe to make progress, we must make the effort to get all Europeans involved, and, to do that, we need to unite the European camp.
That is why I made this comment in my introductory remarks: we must not add to the traditional Euroscepticism of those who never wanted Europe the Euro-pessimism of those who want to move Europe forwards.
True, the various big European political families may express differing positions, but as soon as we agree on the need to push forward with our European project, we must be able to unite our camp to send a positive, confident message.
Those of us in this House today do not simply have the job of providing a commentary: of course, we can, and indeed must, analyse the situation, but the job of a leader, of a political representative, is to inspire confidence and hope.
That is why I think it is essential to have a programme that is able to unite the people around real results, and around projects with the aim of consolidating the great European project.
We could point to many of these results, and I am delighted at the energy with which the Austrian Presidency is working to achieve concrete results.
Indeed, we must say quite clearly that the Member States, who want aims, who want objectives, also need to give us the resources.
Very often, all the Member States agree, one day, that we need to do more at European level in terms of security and justice.
All the Member States tell us we need to do more to combat illegal immigration and to manage legal immigration.
All the Member States say we need greater cooperation.
But then, when the Commission suggests transferring certain competences regarding justice and the police from the third pillar to the first, I still see no unanimity from the Member States concerning this project and the resources necessary to run it properly.
The same applies to energy: today, there is consensus that we need a common energy policy, and a common strategy, but we need the resources to develop this common strategy.
That is why, as MrÂ Goebbels, MrsÂ Frassoni and others have said, it is important to achieve concrete results in terms of energy efficiency and to have programmes for renewable energy, so that we can really translate the objectives from the Green Paper for safe and competitive sustainable energy into practice.
The same applies to research.
One of the most important things we learned at the Hampton Court Summit was, amongst other things, that we need to do more at European level in terms of research and development.
That is why we put forward the idea of the European Institute of Technology as a flagship project to mobilise our efforts, and I hope that the Member States, who are in agreement on the objectives, will also be able to give us the resources to achieve them.
I therefore think, MrÂ President, honourable Members, that the European Council needs to reach agreement on the path to go down.
We must not simply extend the period of reflection, but move into a commitment period consisting in defining specific results for the near future in order to demonstrate the added value of Europe to our citizens, and at the same time to show them, as MrÂ Leinen, MrsÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo and others have said, what it costs us not to have an institutional solution.
We need an institutional solution, and that touches on the issue of enlargement, because the European debate very often sets those who favour enlargement against those who favour deepening.
I continue to believe, as MrÂ Juncker and others have said, that we need both.
In fact, enlargement is one of the fundamental reasons for deepening, one of the fundamental reasons that justify institutional reform: an enlarged Europe requires institutional reform as a matter of greater and greater urgency.
The right answer to our current difficulties is not to divide Europe into first division countries and second division ones, but, on the contrary, to try to rally all the Member States together: both those who are already part of the enlarged Europe and those who are going to join us shortly.
In this connection, I would also point out that we expect the next European Council to give a clear signal of its commitment to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 if those countries meet all the conditions we have set them, and which they have now been working for months to achieve.
I hope that the Council will do that.
Finally, as many of you, including MrÂ Stubb, have said, we need to keep things in perspective.
I know that negative nostalgia is currently in fashion: oh, how wonderful Europe was 10 or 20 years ago.
But, honestly, which Europe are we talking about?
Was it really better 20 years ago, when large parts of our continent were not free, when much of our continent was divided by regimes that were against freedom and democracy?
Was it really better 10 years ago, when the Balkans were the scene of bloody massacres?
Are the Balkans not part of our Europe, too?
Do we not want to extend the area of freedom and democracy to the Europeans in the Balkans?
That is why I do not share the depression or the pessimism: I think that, if you keep things in perspective, you will understand that Europe needs to move forward.
It is true that Europe has its problems, and that the issue of the institutions is a considerable difficulty, but we must not wallow in this negativity, scepticism and cynicism that is currently so fashionable.
We need to unite around common values, such as, I would emphasise, law.
Some of you mentioned GuantÃ¡namo, and, indeed, we must say quite clearly that absolutely nothing justifies having, as part of the fight against terrorism, a vacuum in terms of respect for human rights.
In such cases, Europe must stand up for its values and its convictions.
So, let us be proud of Europe.
Our partners in Latin America ask us: how did you pull it off?
We, too, are trying to advance regional integration â how did Europe manage it?
When we talk to our partners in Russia, China, India and elsewhere, they show great respect for an enlarged, powerful Europe.
Let us be proud of Europe.
Let us be proud of our values, and I think that, in showing this confidence and this spirit of togetherness, those of us who truly believe in European values will be in a position to resolve our current difficulties and to make progress with our project for Europe: a competitive, open Europe, but also a Europe founded on the idea of solidarity, a Europe that wants to master globalisation, not suffer it.
That is our great project for Europe.
Â Â  I have received seven motions for resolutions(1) tabled to wind up the debate under Rules 103(2) and 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30.
Â Â  â The statements delivered by the Commission and the Council are evidence that the next European Council will still fail to implement the much-needed measures to change what Mr Barroso has referred to as Europeâs âcrisis cultureâ, and that they do not want to understand the causes of the criticisms voiced by citizens of the Member States.
They sidestep the fact that the main reason for people's discontent is the current social crisis, which is dealt with only marginally in the proposed Council conclusions and postponed until a report is submitted by March 2007.
The Councilâs sole interest is to press ahead with liberalisations, the directive on completing the internal market in services and the common energy policy.
The main priority is the constitutional issue, which the conclusions document also omits, but which was the central â and virtually the only â theme of the speech given by the President of the Commission.
He stressed that the Commission believes we stand to lose by not moving the process forward, overlooking the fact that the democratic process led to the rejection of the European Constitution by the people of France and the Netherlands, which is something that the Community's institutions should respect.
By announcing new forms of propaganda, including the proposed Declaration on Political Europe, to be submitted next year, which all of the Community's institutions are to sign, the Council is following a path that fails to address existing problems.
Â Â  The future of Europe is a very important matter.
It is not true that a good European must be a federalist.
We can be good Europeans without being enthusiastic about the Constitutional Treaty.
Should the period of reflection be extended?
It certainly should, although we ought to make sure that this period is really used for reflection rather than for pleas, wishful thinking or creating the false impression that there is no alternative to the Treaty.
An extended period of reflection should be used to consider what Europeans really want, how a balance can be achieved between the large and the small Member States, between the new and old Member States, between richer and poorer regions, between the desire to be competitive and the dogma of the European social model.
This is not an easy task.
I am concerned that we will not be able to resolve these issues if we limit our reflections to the existing text of the Constitutional Treaty.
It is also important to be honest with Europeans.
Are we sure they will accept European Union enlargement achieved at the cost of strengthening the political dominance of the largest states of the European Union?
Did all current EU Member States take part in drawing up the Constitutional Treaty on equal terms?
A lot has been said about Europe needing to be closer to its citizens, that it should be easier for them to understand.
I hope that this wish also applies to the debate on the European Constitution.
Â Â  The European Unionâs Constitutional Treaty projected ambitions which the Union has not been able to realise to date.
The EU has failed in the strategy which was supposed to turn Europe into the worldâs most competitive knowledge economy, in the cooperation to combat bird flu and in the implementation of common foreign policy.
It is quite understandable that the people of Europe are questioning our aspiration of a fully-fledged Constitution if we cannot even manage to make sound agreements in all those other areas, or if we contravene the agreements that are in place, such as the Stability Pact.
We should be more modest.
Let us first carry out the institutional reforms that are really necessary.
Those changes, described in Chapter 1 of the Constitutional Treaty of 2004, would then have the character of an ordinary treaty and would obviate the need for a referendum in each Member State.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must also become a treaty document in time.
At the moment, it gives the current draft treaty its constitutional overtones precisely where the Union is not ready for them.
I personally would have liked to have seen the direct election of the President of the European Commission included.
In that way, though, we would at any rate solve the most urgent problems and support both the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
Â Â  I should like to extend a warm welcome to Mr K.P. Sharma Oli, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, who has taken his seat in the distinguished visitorsâ gallery.
Mr Sharma Oli has held meetings with the chairmen of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development, and this afternoon will participate in a meeting with Parliamentâs SAARC Delegation, whose chairwoman, Mrs Gill, is sitting here today in a wonderful shade of green.
We are very pleased that Mr Sharma Oli has taken this opportunity to visit Parliament and to tell us about the most recent developments in Nepal.
We trust that this visit will further enhance and develop relations between the European Parliament and Nepal.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I must point out an error.
The amendment deleting Article 14, which was adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, has not been included in the versions of the report for plenary, but the Tabling Office assured us that it would be inserted into the final version following the vote.
I just wanted to draw your attention to that.
Â Â  â Very well, we will certainly take note of that.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the intention of the oral amendment is to replace the word 'commitments' by the word 'agreements' in Article 8d(5).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, this is a very important vote.
The report has just been adopted by an overwhelming majority in plenary.
The Commission has paid close attention to our work and has given us its support, as it reaffirmed yesterday evening.
In contrast, we have received no support from the Council, which was absent from plenary during the debate on this report.
I would note that it is once again absent and that we are still waiting for its opinion on the report.
I would remind you that the Council made a moral commitment to this framework decision on data protection during the previous Presidency, and Parliament could feel betrayed if we did not have a firm commitment from the Council to adopt this framework decision by the autumn.
I would remind you that this adoption is extremely urgent, in view of the Court of Justice's decision regarding passenger name records.
I would therefore ask Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution in accordance with Rule 53(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is important for everyone to be made aware of the event that took place yesterday within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I could refrain from pointing it out and send a letter to MrÂ Poettering instead but, precisely because we are talking about discrimination, rights and equal opportunities, I am outraged as a woman, as an Italian woman âŠ
Â Â  â I must cut you off there, because this is not a personal statement at all.
Perhaps you could raise it at the end of voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok â who has been one of our political group's negotiators for this joint motion for a resolution â has asked me to table an oral amendment which has in principle been negotiated with the representatives of the other political groups.
This amendment would be inserted in paragraph 6, where it talks about âparticular attention to the fight against organised crimeâ.
It would be followed by âin the case of Bulgariaâ, because the purpose of the amendment is to respond to the report produced by the Commission in May, and it would be unfair to extend this demand to Romania when, according to the Commission, progress has been satisfactory in that regard.
That is the wording of the oral amendment, Mr President, and I hope that the House can accept it.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to invoke Rule 35 with reference to this vote.
Under Rule 35(1), for all Commission proposals of a legislative nature, the committee responsible shall verify the legal basis.
Rule 35(4) says that the committee should have disputed the validity of the proceedings regarding the period of reflection and the ratification process.
This is for two reasons.
First of all, under the EUâs own rules, any Member State rejecting the Constitutional Treaty has right of veto, and therefore it should be dead.
My second point â and the most important point to me â is that the European Constitution is unconstitutional in terms of the British Constitution in relation to Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and various other acts of ...
Â Â  â Mr Batten, I must cut you off there, because you are starting from a false premise: this is not a text of a legislative nature.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, may I just point out that the interpretation was slightly behind you with regard to taking that vote.
When you declared the vote open on the first vote, we were voting on the second part, because that was what the interpreter told us before you corrected yourself.
You then closed the vote before we had an opportunity to correct our own votes.
So, if possible, that vote should be dealt with again.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Crowley has asked to retake the vote on the second section of Amendment 2.
If you look at the numbers on your counting device, there is difference of 100 people who did not vote between part 1 and part 2.
There was a total of approximately 630 votes for the first part, and only 545 for the second.
Every now and again, because the electronic vote closes far too quickly, people do not get the chance, if they listen to the interpretation, to respond.
I would ask you to allow a little more time for this.
Â Â  â The vote has taken place and we must now continue, but I certainly take note of what you have said.
The fact remains that we will not restart the vote, because we never do that here.
That concludes voting time.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I well remember the grumbling from the Left at the application to extradite the lawyer Klaus Croissant, who was known to be not just the lawyer for German terrorists, but an active member of their network.
Today, Big Brother is on the move, and it seems that nothing can stop him now in this European judicial area.
The automatic transfer of sentenced persons from one European state to another is presented to us as being a big step forward.
In a way, it seems that nationals of the EU are treated worse than nationals of third countries, whom we insist on keeping in the State where they were convicted, in the name of avoiding double jeopardy.
You will allow me, in a Europe where thought crimes are on the increase, and where claims of national preference are equated with discrimination, legitimate discussions of aspects of history with revisionism, rejection of communitarismâŠ
Â Â  There is reason to commend Austriaâs, Finlandâs and Swedenâs initiative.
It is in principle a good thing to help speed up the transfer of sentenced persons to a particular state with which they have connections in some way and in which optimum social rehabilitation is believed to be a real possibility.
It is, however, worth pointing out that there is already a convention and an additional protocol from the Council of Europe on the transfer of sentenced persons.
The June List also believes that legal and police cooperation should be intergovernmental.
These issues must be decided on in the Council by unanimous decision and be subject to the scrutiny of the national parliaments, rather than being decided on by supranational institutions such as the European Parliament.
The June List has therefore voted against the report as amended by Parliament â â a report that, amongst other things, contains wordings promoting European criminal law.
Â Â  We wish to emphasise that the June List is opposed to engaging in propaganda in favour of a liberal approach to drugs.
We have thus voted against wordings along these lines.
All use of drugs, other than for medical purposes, is harmful and is something that society should have no truck with.
With regard to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, we believe on principle that there is no justification for the centreâs existence, since the Member States each have such different views on, and policies towards, the fight against drug misuse.
We have thus voted against the report on strengthening the role of the centre.
Â Â  . A regulation is being proposed to us that is designed to strengthen the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, to sort out its administrative and communication problems and to create new posts for officials.
Just how effective, however, has this ultra-European tool been at a time when drugs are a scourge that continues to destroy families?
Drug addiction causes people to fail at school, makes them unable to work, causes them to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals and leads them to die by suicide or from overdoses.
We need to see action taken, rather than having to read deteriorating statistics.
Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is right to propose going beyond the mere collection of data in order also to assess the policies of the Member States so that the latter might benefit from best practice.
This does not imply stripping Member States of their prerogatives and transferring these to the Monitoring Centre but, on the contrary, strengthening cooperation between the Member States.
In addition to the death penalty for drug barons, we also need to see a radical change in mentality in order to silence the left-wing ideology of the last 40 years. This has led to lax attitudes towards criminality which have been accepted wholesale by smug governments and have led to the poisoning of millions of people, the physical consequences of which also lead to permanent social exclusion.
Â Â  Since it was set up in 1993, the main tasks of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction have been the collection, analysis and distribution of transnational data on drug problems.
Thirteen years later, the results are not impressive.
Although a certain improvement in our knowledge of the drug phenomenon in all its many aspects here in the European Union is to be observed, no positive effect on drug use is to be seen.
Quite the contrary, in fact.
One thing is to be noted.
Today, it is no longer just the traditional drugs that are being taken. Instead, we are, to our consternation, witnessing the emergence of new markets for synthetic drugs and a situation in which drugs are produced more easily and more cheaply.
They generate more profit for the traffickers and also do more harm to the health of those who take them.
In reality, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is no more than a simple data base, devoid of any operational value.
In fact, all the figures made available serve only to disguise the failure of the various national policies for combating drug misuse.
It is high time that the Member States took their responsibilities seriously and stopped hiding behind bodies that are neither designed nor commissioned to act on their behalf.
Â Â  . The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was set up in 1993 and is based in Lisbon.
Its role is to collect, analyse and disseminate objective, reliable and comparable data and in turn to provide an accurate overview of the phenomenon in Europe.
If we are to establish an effective policy and measures to combat the problem, we need to be aware of its extent and nature.
Although a great deal of progress has been made, there remains much to be done in terms of enhancing the monitoring instruments and developing a genuine âcommon languageâ.
I voted in favour of this report on the Commissionâs proposal on the EMCDDA.
The main amendments will ensure that Parliament is involved in the codecision process, that the EMCDDA has a broader role and that the EMCDDAâs bodies adapt to post-enlargement Europe.
The EMCDDA must obtain more objective and comparable data and must channel its efforts into a thorough evaluation of drug-related policy and of trends in drug use.
I also wish to highlight the importance of improving the exchange of information on best practice in addressing drug issues and making that exchange more flexible.
Â Â  Mr President, even though the vote on MrsÂ Roure's report has been postponed, this has given me the opportunity to express my opinion on it.
In my opinion, the European Union encourages people's fears regarding the transparency of their personal data, for example when it approves the transmission of personal data to the United States, a country with poor data protection security by European standards.
We also need to ensure that personal data are adequately protected when it comes to the planned electronic identity documents for cross-border use, and, in my opinion, the proposed taxation of e-mails and text messages would be a monstrosity, because flat-rate contracts would require individual records to be kept and personal data collected for forwarding to the financial authorities.
I do not feel that any of this has been given sufficient consideration in MrsÂ Roure's report.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the resolution as a whole but have some important objections.
Firstly, the risk of pandemics should not be exaggerated.
Should an epidemic occur, the EU should have a coordinating role.
The main responsibility should, however, lie with the Member States.
The resolution places too much of the responsibility on the EU.
Certainly, there is a need to cooperate on making vaccines available in special situations ensuring, perhaps, that a vaccine is used where it is most needed.
We question, however, whether the centralised EU vaccine stores proposed by the rapporteur are the most efficient response.
Moreover, we see these as presenting many practical problems.
Â Â  . As the rapporteur â a Cypriot doctor who is a Member of our political group â says, confusion in peopleâs minds about avian influenza and pandemic influenza is massive.
Many people and authorities, he says, âseem to equate the arrival of A/H5N1 in Europe with the arrival of a pandemic virusâ.
He therefore suggests that improvements should be made to the Commissionâs communication in generic preparedness planning for public health emergencies at EU level.
He emphasises, as I did in a previous report, that the EU must lend technical, scientific and economic assistance to countries already affected and, in particular, contribute to raising global awareness and a global master plan coordinated at international, regional, sub-regional and national level with a proper road map and timetable.
The rapporteur has sought to improve upon the Commissionâs proposal and to clarify a number of points.
We therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  This report concerns an eminently cross-border issue.
There are thus good reasons for the EU countries to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken.
We have thus chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole.
We wish, however, to emphasise that isolated measures on the part of the EU are inadequate for meeting the challenges posed by a global influenza pandemic.
It is therefore extremely important that the EU act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation, or WHO.
We question individual points in the report, such as the need for the Commission to devise a comprehensive communication strategy together with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
We presume that the EU countries are by themselves fully capable of communicating successfully with the people, without the aid of EU bodies.
In the same way, we are opposed to the setting up of a common emergency supply of pandemic vaccines in the Community.
We believe that internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO should concern themselves with global world health issues.
We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting a significant political issue in order to extend the EUâs international political role.
Â Â  . I should like to begin by pointing out that the confusion in peopleâs minds about avian influenza and pandemic influenza is massive.
There is much to be done, therefore, in terms of communication.
As political decision-makers, we must honour our duty to protect the citizens.
We must ensure that the resources are in place to provide an effective response to any public health threat that our societies may face.
It has been well documented that the threat of a flu pandemic is a public health issue that concerns all of us.
That being said, the likelihood of it happening is open to question.
Given that the relevant authorities believe that the risk to human health is actually small, it strikes me as crucial to establish a targeted prevention and rapid response mechanism for public health emergencies.
This should include, as the report says, a targeted plan for coordinating action at all levels and accurate, accessible communication for all citizens so as to ensure that they are prepared for any eventuality.
I accordingly voted in favour of the Amadou report.
Â Â  Mr President, in his book âThe Constitution of Europeâ, Joseph Weiler wrote extensively about how, in the past, the Court of Justice would systematically increase the field of competences of the European institutions without there being any democratic legitimacy for it and without the Court having been given a mandate by the Member Statesâ governments in this matter.
Thanks to this notorious judgment of 13 September 2005, criminal law is now, in fact, also set to become a European competence.
As a consequence, the Court of Justice is wiping the floor with the competence restrictions of the European treaties.
The Court of Justice looks very much like a kind of judicial Absurdistan peopled by other-worldly judges who are no longer answerable to anything or anybody.
People are then surprised when our citizens, when they get the opportunity, show their displeasure by, for example, voting out the European Constitution.
Â Â  ) One of the most important new elements in the Constitution is the proposal that all EU laws be able to have common penalties attached to them.
It is perfectly logical for each Member State to determine, in the case of each law, what the price of breaking that law is to be.
That is something that the Council of Ministers has also done.
By means of an intergovernmental decision, it has unanimously determined the price to be paid for environmental crimes.
The conflict is not about the content but about the form.
The supranational European Court of Justice is not satisfied with being a court.
The judges also want to be legislators, and in this case constitutional legislators into the bargain.
What is more, they wish to legislate contrary to the unanimous decision of the Member States.
They are simply adopting a section of the Constitution that has been expressly rejected.
It is about as legal as the Beagle Boys deciding to empty Scrooge McDuckâs money bin.
What are the judges thinking of?
They should be defending law and order but are themselves breaking the law.
The Court of Justice could be put in its place by the parliaments of the Member States each deciding that this judgment is of no legal effect in their countries.
We should also have a democratic procedure for appointing judges.
Â Â  . This judgment acknowledges that the Commission, with Parliamentâs support, was right to annul the framework decision on environmental protection via criminal law.
It recognises that environmental protection requires concerted action to punish the most serious breaches.
Accordingly, its objective and its substance fall under the competence of Community action programmes on the environment (EC Treaty) and not under the provisions of the EU Treaty on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters.
In recognition of the fact that, broadly speaking, the Community does not have any powers on criminal matters, a useful precedent has been set whereby matters under the third pillar are communitarised and parliamentary control is strengthened in an area as sensitive as criminal law.
The consequences are enormous, in terms of both adopting future legal instruments and the legal instruments already in force.
These should be based on a new legal basis, the first pillar, which implies Parliamentâs participation as co-legislator.
A framework decision on the environment has been annulled but its consequences will be felt beyond this area, throughout Community policies and in fundamental freedoms when it becomes necessary to make use of criminal law measures to ensure their efficiency.
Â Â  The European Court of Justiceâs judgment of 13Â September 2005 constitutes a veritable legal revolution in what is usually called the Community legal system.
Indeed, this is the first time that the Court of Justice has pronounced on issues of competence in penal matters and that it has decided that, for the purpose of protecting the environment, the European Union can demand that the Member States provide for criminal sanctions in the case of serious offences.
In principle, penal legislation, just like the rules of criminal procedure, falls within the strict competence of the Member States.
Through this legal decision, a portion of the penal law of the Member States has just been brought within the competence of the Community and has been so without the formal agreement of the nations.
This also amounts to a harmonisation of penal law that the ânoâ vote delivered by the French and the Dutch in their referendums on the Constitution had implicitly rejected.
There is worse to come, however.
There is a risk of such jurisprudence being extended to all Community spheres and, in particular, to that concerning would-be fundamental rights. I am thinking of spheres such as the fight against supposed racism and discrimination of various kinds, data protection, the right to asylum or, indeed, policies on migration.
This development is not conducive to our freedoms, and it is most worrying.
Â Â  The report concerns the consequences of the European Court of Justiceâs judgment C-176/03, which gave the EU powers to adopt, under the first pillar, necessary sanctions under criminal law in order to guarantee that full effect is given to the provisions of the first pillar, in this case in relation to the environment.
The EC Treaty does not, however, contain any explicit allocation of authority in the matter of criminal law.
In view of the considerable importance criminal law has for the sovereignty of the Member States, the implicit transfer of this authority to the Community should not be permitted.
What is more, ArticlesÂ 135 and 280 of the EC Treaty state explicitly that the Member States are responsible for the application of national criminal law and the administration of justice.
In spite of this, the Commission has stated that there is no limit to the degree to which criminal law might be brought within the competence of the Community and that, in principle, all the areas regulated by the EC Treaty might be subject to such transfers of authority.
Through the Court of Justiceâs interpretation of the Treaties, the pillars are thus combined in a single institutional framework, which was a feature of the now rejected European Constitution.
The June List is strongly opposed to this undermining of national self-determination and has thus voted against the report.
Â Â  . Once again the European Court of Justice has determined that the Council has contravened the EC Treaty.
The Council tried to sidestep the involvement of Parliament in the legislative process by using a different legal basis from the one laid down in the Treaty.
It is therefore no surprise that it has been condemned by the judges in Luxembourg; indeed, it was easily foreseeable and is to be welcomed in every respect.
It goes without saying that all the institutions are called upon to analyse the judgment and to use it to draw conclusions for the future.
However, I do not understand what consequences the Commission is proposing.
Although the ECJ proceeded very cautiously and reiterated the principle that the EC has no primary competence in criminal law and therefore that the EC Treaty only provides supplementary legislative competence in criminal law for very specific matters, the Commission seems to think that it can derive a general competence in criminal law for the EC from the Court's judgment.
In the Council's wake, now the Commission, too, wants to take from the European Treaties competences that the Member States never gave it.
The Commission's approach is not only unlawful in many respects; indeed, it is also unacceptable in terms of integration policy.
Parliament has therefore quite rightly shown the red light to the Commission's proposals, in the form of MrÂ Gargani's report.
Â Â  The British Conservatives abstained on the Gargani report, since while we greatly appreciated the attempt by the rapporteur to strike the appropriate note of caution when trying to identify the proper application of the Courtâs judgment, we do not agree it is even necessary to consider whether or not there is a need to activate the clause.
We believe that more time is needed to consider what, if any, steps should be taken on the specific and immediate ramifications of this judgment before seeking to use it as a pretext for usurping national competence in criminal justice matters.
Â Â  â The report is in keeping with the ruling by the Court and the relevant Commission communication.
Like the European Commission, the report interprets this ruling as granting the authority to introduce criminal provisions in all Community policies containing binding rules, in order to ensure that they are applied.
This is a serious step towards the introduction of minimum criminal rules at EU level by the legislative institutions of the Union or, in other words, the 'communitisation' of criminal law.
Paragraph 4 in particular basically proposes the adoption of common criminal law in the EU, thereby depriving the Member States of their exclusive sovereign right to determine for themselves what sort of behaviour they consider to be a criminal offence and of their right to determine the type and limits of criminal sanctions.
In this way, one of the basic constituent elements of national grass-roots sovereignty is being seriously curtailed and one of the fundamental characteristics of the philosophy of the European Constitution, namely the precedence of Community law over national legislation and national constitutions, is being reintroduced through the back door, in order to directly impose on the people of Europe the will and strategic political ambitions of European monopolistic capital, which have now been raised to the status of law.
That is why we voted against the report.
Â Â  I am voting in favour of MrÂ Bondeâs proposal for an alternative resolution, because he criticises the fact that the European Court of Justice is trying to use environmental law as a springboard to enable the EU to assume power over large parts of criminal law.
I am not, however, categorically opposed to all types of rules under criminal law designed to combat cross-border environmental crimes.
These may sometimes be needed in order, for example, to deal with vessels out at sea that are ruining the environment.
Â Â  Mr President, when MrsÂ Åœdanokaâs report was being discussed, it was important for me that the amendments tabled for point 11 did not go through, as they had nothing to do with non-discrimination, and I therefore voted with the majority.
Â Â  Mr President, this month too, we can count ourselves lucky again with the umpteenth Utopian report against racism and discrimination, this time by Mrs Åœdanoka.
The document is, once again, a catalogue of politically correct commonplaces that are slowly but surely becoming this institutionâs speciality.
We are once again being inundated with the spectres of racism and discrimination, as well as calls for European legislation and for forcing the Member States to discriminate against the actual European citizens in favour of non-Europeans, who, according to this report, should not just receive the same political and social rights, but should, in many areas, also be given preferential treatment.
There is, in this House, an apparent lack of common sense if we fail to realise that true racism in Europe is fortunately a very marginal phenomenon, but that, on the other hand, our citizens are anxious about the undermining and erosion of safety, welfare and the cultural identity to which they are entitled.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted against the Åœdanoka report because we are yet again being faced with a list of proposals that do not offer a solution to the problem, but are, in fact, part of it.
We must finally stop seeing minority groups, such as immigrants, as pitiful.
We must stop attributing all their problems to discrimination from the outset.
This left-wing discourse has only exacerbated the problems.
What we need is a complete change of course.
We must emphasise personal responsibility and the need for immigrants to adapt to our rules, our language, our standards and our values.
The very fact that we in this House continuously talk about discrimination weakens the impulse for immigrants to integrate.
This may benefit the growing anti-discrimination industry, but is detrimental to the immigrants as well as the countries where they have settled.
Â Â  The June List is opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether based on gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or conviction, disability, age or sexual orientation.
We have therefore decided to support the report as a whole in order to demonstrate our support for all citizens of the EU Member States being able to enjoy the fundamental right of not being subjected to discrimination, even if we do not agree with all the wordings and have thus voted against these.
Â Â  I and my British Conservative colleagues are fundamentally committed to upholding equal opportunities for all.
However, we have abstained on this report since in places it is over-detailed and prescriptive, and where it does propose specific measures it is far from clear that these would help Member States to develop a coherent and consistent anti-discrimination policy.
Â Â  . The main proposals in this report bring into question three fundamental values of the European democracies.
- âPositive actionâ, which is the European Parliamentâs version of the âpositive discriminationâ dear to MrÂ Sarkozy, breaks with the principle of equality between citizens of the same country.
The measures proposed, such as âpriority accessâ to certain professions, constitute discrimination against our countriesâ nationals, who do not have the opportunity to have immigrant status.
- The âinvolvement of âŠ non-citizens in electionsâ, that is to say foreignersâ right to vote, destroys the very principle of nationality.
- The desire to give the same rights to homosexual as to heterosexual couples in all the Member States amounts to demanding the right for homosexuals to marry and to adopt children.
If this demand were met, it would shatter the foundations of the family, which is the basic unit of any society.
Alert it may be to the fate of immigrant populations and homosexual couples, but this report has not a word to say concerning scandalous forms of discrimination:
- discrimination suffered by tens of millions of honest people who are the victims of insecurity because they do not have the opportunity to live in protected parts of their towns;
- discrimination that, in France, deprives the millions who vote for Franceâs National Front of any representation in Parliament.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mrs Åœdanoka on her important report on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and opportunities for all, to which I lend my full support.
I particularly welcome the call for the Member States to take due account in their legislative practice of the various reasons for discrimination, with a view to bestowing a credibility on the Charter which has hitherto been weakened by the fact that the Charter is not legally binding.
The fight against discrimination must be based on education, the promotion of best practice and campaigns targeting the general public and those areas and sectors where discrimination takes place.
Awareness of the social impact of the phenomenon is probably the most effective way of combating discrimination.
Â Â  I welcome this report, which stipulates that the fight against discrimination must be based on education.
The report encourages the promotion of best practices and campaigns targeting the general public and those areas and sectors where discrimination takes place.
Given that discrimination largely stems from ignorance as regards other people, the report highlights the fact that the problem should therefore be tackled at source, by means of targeted actions designed to foster tolerance and diversity from early childhood; programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo and Jeunesse have a crucial role to play in this regard.
The report explains that positive steps should be taken to overhaul recruitment policies and practices in order to remove those that impede disadvantaged groups from participating and playing an important role in society.
I regret that the Commission is not planning at this stage to draw up comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination given that traditional national minorities urgently need a framework policy standard to create effective participation in decision-making processes concerning their identity, not only to overcome the double standards established by the Copenhagen criteria but also to combat a lack of any rules in the Member States.
Â Â  Legislation to combat all forms of discrimination is another example of would-be progressive legislation adopted by the EU in the social sphere.
In response to a Green Paper from the Commission, Parliament is today adopting an own-initiative report offering its vision of the measures to be implemented to combat discrimination, both in society and in the workplace.
As long ago as the year 2000, the EU was adopting two directives (2000/43 and 2000/78) forcing the Member States to provide themselves with legislative and judicial apparatus capable of curbing this phenomenon.
Although all the national legislatures have thus been considerably strengthened, work remains to be done, particularly work based on education.
Parliament is therefore putting forward a whole raft of initiatives designed to combat the various forms of direct and indirect discrimination, whether it be based on ethnic origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or religious conviction.
The idea is to promote better practices to avoid ending up with âpositive discriminationâ or the quota system advocated by some.
The EU has few competences in the social sphere, but it has to be said that it takes the initiative when it has the means to do so.
What we have here is an ambitious document that cocks an additional snook at those who strongly criticise Europe for not having a social dimension.
Â Â  . I have supported MrsÂ Zdanokaâs report because the European Union needs a strong European strategy of non-discrimination.
The fact is that, everywhere in Europe, we hear hateful words spoken and see despicable acts, including acts of violence, committed.
The European Union needs a strategy to promote equal opportunities in order to put an end to all forms of discrimination.
This European strategy may, in certain cases, involve the use of positive action.
I believe, however, that, as is explicitly stated in Article 2 of the report, positive action differs from any kind of positive discrimination.
Indeed, we would not be encouraging the fight against discrimination by creating a new form of discrimination.
Positive action, in contrast, makes it possible to draw certain disadvantaged groupsâ attention to specific measures of relevance to them, for example where recruitment policies are concerned.
Finally, Parliament again points out in this document that discrimination against same-sex couples, whether married or registered, must be prohibited in the same way as any other form of discrimination and, in particular, when the people concerned assert their right to move freely within the territory of the European Union.
Â Â  In spite of there being points in which the rapporteur wishes to give the EU too much power and in which national legal practice is brought into question, it is the positive aspects of this report, relating to non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, that predominate.
The report as a whole is constructive, and I am therefore voting in favour of it.
Â Â  Mr President, although we take the view that Romania and Bulgaria undoubtedly belong to the European family of nations and need to have a European perspective, we do not expect that the two countries will be able to resolve their many problems with regard to corruption and organised crime within a few months.
Particularly with regard to Bulgaria, you are very much mistaken if you cherish the hope that the country will be able to take more effective action against corruption and organised crime within its borders as a Member State of the EU.
The problems in this area may even get worse, and increase the burden on the other Member States.
The justified concerns and fears of the European public have not been taken seriously, and an enlargement avalanche has simply been set off with no reference to them, with a automatic path to enlargement.
I cannot accept that, and I have therefore not approved this resolution.
Â Â  I abstained from voting on the joint motion for a resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania because I am unclear as to the point of adopting a position on the matter at this stage.
I personally should have preferred it if, before expressing an opinion, the European Parliament had waited for the follow-up report to be presented by the Commission at the beginning of October of this year.
If, by any chance, the Commission then appeared to express serious reservations about whether 1Â January 2007 was the right time for one or other of these countries to join the EU, I really would not see the point of the motion for a resolution voted on today.
Parliamentâs going religiously through the motions is not, in my view, evidence of good democratic health.
Â Â  Let me be clear.
For me, both Romania and Bulgaria and for that matter, Turkey, could meet the criteria for membership of the EU.
What concerns me is that the former two still have some way to go, in my opinion, before they can join the Union.
There are problems with corruption and the rule of law.
It is important for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems, enhancing transparency, efficiency and the impartiality of their judiciary.
With Bulgaria, we also have continued widespread discrimination against the Roma community in housing, healthcare, education and employment.
They suffer from social exclusion.
I realise that on the basis of Parliament's position, we can only delay membership from 2007 to 2008.
At the moment, given the opportunity, I would have to vote to postpone Bulgaria's membership, and would have to consider my position carefully with respect to Romania.
Â Â  . The successive rounds of enlargement have been an unparalleled success in the history of our continent.
This is, broadly speaking, attributable to two factors.
On the one hand, there is the consistent will, readiness and ability of the Member States to bring in new partnerships into the project at any given moment, with all the benefits and the extra burdens that any round of enlargement implies.
On the other hand, this process has been successful due to the positive effects of the prospect of accession.
The history of Europe of the past 50 years has largely been the history of a continent that has gradually adopted western democratic values on account of the expectations of accession.
We must accordingly draw two conclusions regarding the prospects for Bulgaria and Romania's accession.
Firstly, the EUâs desire to proceed with this enlargement should be absolute and the final timetable should be established at the next European Council.
Secondly, it must be made clear that the accession will only take place when the conditions are properly in place.
Our demands are justified and have yielded results. This has been borne out by the progress made by Romania during the past year.
Â Â  â The pressure on Bulgaria and Romania is mounting to ensure their people are fully subject to the dictats of the ÎU, so that more onerous terms can be imposed which will make it easier for the plutocracy to exploit the workers.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ÎU is being pushed through along with the enlargement of ÎÎÎ€Î, the demand for the involvement of military forces and the concession of the sovereign rights of these countries to the audacious imperialist plans of the USA, ÎÎÎ€Î and the ÎU, at the expense of the people.
The continual adaptation of accession conditions to the for the purposes of the Lisbon Strategy, the reform of the CAP, capitalist restructurings and the EU's more general anti-grassroots and anti-labour policy is resulting in extremely poor terms for the workers, with sweeping changes to fundamental employment and social rights.
The people of these countries are realising day by day that they cannot expect anything positive to come out of their accession to the ÎU.
The European Parliament motion for a resolution supports the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the imperialist union and their concession to the plans of the ÎU and a more intensive anti-grassroots policy against their people, which is why the European parliamentary group of the Greek Communist Party will vote against it.
Â Â  In his last speech a few moments ago, MrÂ Barroso, perhaps unwittingly, put his finger on the problem.
He said that the European Union could not be enlarged and deepened against the will of the European citizens.
That is true.
It is just unfortunate that this conclusion was followed by nothing but a proactive pep talk, particularly as we are all familiar with the real sore points.
Allow me to list them for you: the lack of democratic legitimacy for the European project, the big questions about spending European money wisely and, above all, those accession negotiations with Turkey which our citizens do not accept, and never will, and for which we will never find a democratic majority among our citizens.
Europe cannot get back on track before something is done about that.
Â Â  Another wearisome debate dominated by the slow-learning fanatics of a failed and rejected Constitution.
They think that by repeatedly swearing allegiance to that which voters, when permitted, have repudiated, they will somehow resuscitate it.
In voting against the resolution I again stand on the side of the citizen who wants less not more Europe, states rights not Brussels control, and local not central power.
The degree of energy wasted by the political leaders of Europe in trying to foist an unwanted Constitution on our people is quite staggering.
Rejection may not be palatable, but it must be faced.
Â Â  . Mr President, I voted against this motion for a resolution because the German police took unprecedented action today against citizens of the Czech Republic.
The police refused entry into Germany for dozens of football fans who wanted to attend the 2006 football World Cup.
In my view, this runs counter to both the free movement of persons in the EU and the Treaty of Maastricht.
I believe that a number of my fellow Members will join me in asking the German Government to explain how it is possible that it can trample underfoot the basic principles of the EU's existence.
I have already submitted questions to the Commission and the Council in this connection.
Â Â  Essentially, I very much want to say that I emphatically refuse to see the draft Constitutional Treaty buried today.
Let us reject outright this pervasive and unhealthy preoccupation with failure.
Let us give ourselves the chance to make progress.
Let us continue with the process of ratification so as to attain the four-fifths threshold laid down in DeclarationÂ 30.
If we do so, the European Council will, as we know, have to tackle the issue.
It will then have rather more issues to puzzle over than it does at present, and in particular:
- that of whether and, if so, under what conditions, ratification might again be sought in those countries that rejected the Constitutional Treaty in referendums;
- and that of how to safeguard at least those parts of the document that make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, those that enable the enlarged Europe to operate more efficiently and, moreover, those that accentuate the EUâs social role.
Do not tell me that a majority of people are opposed to those aspects of the document. I do not believe that they are.
Admittedly, this would not please those who are past masters in the art of doubt and demoralisation.
I personally, however, wish to set in motion again the virtuous circle constituted by the process of European integration.
Â Â  . We voted against this motion for a resolution, because it emphasises support for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
The idea of pursuing the global commitment to the Treaty, which is at variance with the opinion expressed by the people of France and the Netherlands in the referendums of last year, is unacceptable.
How can we go on speaking about the need to deepen democracy when decisions freely taken by people in democratic referendums are not respected?
This kind of hypocrisy demonstrates the deep chasm between the people and the elites of the Community institutions.
We also object to the propaganda campaign in the form of a series of parliamentary fora to meet the deadlines, in which they call for a âconstitutional solutionâ, as the motion for a resolution confirms, when the 2009 elections to Parliament are called.
Greater attention should have been paid to social problems and to finding an across-the-board solution for the aspirations of the people, with a view to improving well-being, development and economic and social cohesion.
Â Â  We have today voted in favour of MrÂ Leinenâs draft motion for a resolution on the next step during the period of reflection and analysis in relation to the future of Europe.
As we have previously pointed out, we do not, however, believe that the Charter on Fundamental Rights should be legally binding.
Â Â  . I abstained in the final vote on the motion for a resolution on the future of Europe.
I consider this motion for a resolution to be superfluous and even counterproductive.
As a defender of the Constitutional Treaty, I expect all 25 Heads of State or Government to honour their signatures and submit the draft for ratification by their respective countries.
The people of France and the Netherlands voted ânoâ.
Before asking these Member States possibly to reconsider their votes, it is necessary that, after Finland, the other dilatory Member States express their opinions, beginning with the United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Portugal, Ireland and Denmark.
Europeâs future depends on the choices also of those countries.
The European Union cannot do without this debate.
Â Â  How many times will it be necessary to repeat in this House that the European Constitution has twice expired: once on 29Â May 2005 in France, and again on 2Â June in the Netherlands?
The French and Dutch ânoâ votes were clear and were delivered with full knowledge of the facts.
Because referendums were organised, people had a proper grasp of the document.
What they were rejecting were both the form (the superstate) and the content (the ultraliberal policies proposed), not to mention enlargement to include Turkey.
Have you heard?
Have you been listening?
Have you understood?
You have not even taken the trouble to do so, and the document put to the vote today is proof of the fact.
You are encouraging those Member States that have not already done so to ratify, preferably through parliamentary means, a document that no longer has reason to exist and to do so in order that the debate might really only take place between the initiated and in order that the two ârenegadeâ states might be constrained into voting again on a Constitution.
Plan D, whose implementation you call for, is in reality a plan for disinformation and is a denial of democracy.
The true democracy we seek in this case is not participatory or even representative.
It is referendum democracy, and that is what frightens you: giving back to the nations the voice that you took from them.
Â Â  With the referendums in France and the Netherlands, the draft Constitution was rejected.
Of that there can be no doubt.
Two countries said ânoâ in referendums and did so by large majorities and with high turn-outs.
The fact that the EUâs power-wielding elite is now trying to explain away this state of affairs is a democratic scandal.
Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how to get around the results of these referendums.
They have the cheek to come up with their own interpretation of the results in terms of dissatisfaction with existing governments in the two countries.
They are beginning to count how many countries have said âyesâ, in spite of its being clear that all the countries must approve the draft.
Seldom has the gulf between the political elite and the people on EU issues been seen so clearly.
Everything indicates that there would have been a ânoâ vote in Germany too if there had been a referendum there.
The same applies in, for example, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark and perhaps a number of other countries.
Democratic outcomes are merely setbacks for those who have lost the vote because they lack grass-roots support.
Let us now instead devise a new treaty that emphasises the EUâs intergovernmental cooperation.
Â Â  â The period of reflection has been used to convince the people to accept the so-called 'European Constitution' rejected by France and the Netherlands by 54.7% and 61.6% respectively and millions of euros from the budget, in other words of taxpayers' money, have been spent in the process.
Propaganda has been spread to the effect that the peoples of France and the Netherlands made a mistake and that the values of the capitalist EU come first, in other words the values of the free market and the interests of capital.
Voters, however, decided on the basis of their life experience and stood up against the anti-grassroots, reactionary policy of the ÎU and its governments, a policy which favours the plutocracy.
EU policy is being disputed and that is a good thing.
That is why other governments have been too scared to hold referenda and have sought approval of the European Constitution via the parliamentary route.
The attempt to reintroduce the European Constitution under another name shows disdain for the grassroots verdict and mocks the people.
The European Constitution is dead and to attempt to resuscitate it is to ride roughshod even over those principles of unanimity of the bourgeois pseudo-democracy of the ÎU.
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party will make use of this extended period of reflection to continue to inform and to reveal the inhumanity and barbarity of Euro-unifying policy and, at the same time, will call on the people to fight to overturn it.
Â Â  . Progress has been made in constructing a more coherent and united Europe, but there are still barriers to achieving many of the objectives we have set ourselves.
Aside from meetings aimed at examining the status quo, there has been no reflection on the Constitutional Treaty involving the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, aiming at considering the reasons and the criticisms of those who, in the wake of the ratification by some Member States, the rejection by others and the silence of other countries, highlighted the inadequacy of some parts of the text and the muddled nature of the text as a whole.
Europeans have growing doubts about the legally binding aspect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lacks important references such as protection of the family.
The issue of our roots also remains unresolved.
We do not want a situation whereby, in not wanting to know where we come from, Europe is not certain about which direction to go in.
Uncertainty gives rise to increased external and internal threats to the Union, as a result of international terrorism and uncontrolled illegal immigration.
The crisis in a society that is losing its reference points and values is causing many young people to adopt apathetic or violent attitudes.
The failure to facilitate development on account of the inability to manage the processes of globalisation and to give the necessary boost to a dynamic development model that addresses the problems existing at European and international level âŠ
Â Â  . Firstly, the debate on the future of Europe does not simply boil down to the constitutional debate, and nor does the debate on the constitutional treaty cover the entire debate on the future of Europe.
I do not believe that this is more glamorous and attractive to the citizens.
It is necessary, although I doubt how urgent it is.
It should certainly take place in full view of the citizens.
In my opinion, however, what is really needed is to update and consolidate the structural decision-making model of the EU within a framework that is democratic and that respects national identity and diversity, given that the EU in its current configuration finds it difficult to cope with the realities of life with 25 Member States, let alone 27, 28 or 29.
I feel therefore that the solution lies in a fresh debate when the societies that are most hostile to this proposal show that they are ready.
This may also take the form of restricting the âconstitutionalâ impulse to a more modest and realistic institutional reform that is vital to the EUâs new life.
Most importantly, though, there needs to be a response to what actually concerns the citizens, especially economically speaking.
There is a lack of policy, a lack of results and a lack of growth and jobs in an economy that is irrevocably in the throes of change.
The truth is that these challenges are, for our citizens, a matter of priority in relation to the Constitution.
Â Â  The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) recognises that the proposed Constitutional Treaty addresses many important issues which need to be dealt with in order for an EU of 25 or more member states to work effectively and democratically.
We have abstained on this resolution, however, because we believe it attempts to prejudge the outcomes of the period of reflection and because it could be seen as showing insufficient sensitivity to the democratic outcomes of the French and Dutch referenda.
We believe it more important for the EU to be delivering tangible benefits to its citizens before returning to the structural reforms for better decision-making.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order and to clarify what I said earlier on, during the vote on the period of reflection, in the split vote relating to paragraphÂ 2 of Amendment 2, you requested a roll-call vote but then changed your mind and said the first part of that split vote would be checked.
Unfortunately, the interpretation did not come through in time, so the vote that I cast for the first part should have been for part two.
I was against part two, but was in favour of part one.
I and many of my colleagues were caught in this dilemma.
Could the record show â I know you cannot go back and retake the vote â that those Members who voted did so in error.
Â Â  Certainly, votes can be corrected.
Having said that, I have received a number of reports from fellow Members to the effect that matters proceeded perfectly clearly, and I think it is sometimes rather too easy to blame the interpretation.
Therefore, you may, of course, change your vote; but, that being said, I consider matters to have proceeded perfectly normally.

Â Â  Mr President, what we are debating today, then, is the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy, an extremely important document from the European Councilâs meeting in Gothenburg five years ago.
We should have liked to have seen a more comprehensive review and, above all, a report by the Commission noting what has really been achieved during the last few years.
We should also have liked to have seen more ambitious long-term goals specifically set out.
The truth is, of course, that, in many areas, we have not made any clear progress in comparison with how matters stood in 2001.
Biodiversity continues to be impoverished and climate-affecting emissions are still increasing in the majority of Member States.
We have social divisions, migratory pressure at our borders and an array of problems in the field of health, for example resistance to antibiotics. These are all things that we must, of course, get to grips with in a way that takes account of the long term.
I wish to thank the Austrian Presidency for having involved MEPs in a meaningful way.
Horizontal in nature, this is a difficult issue to deal with, and it has to be asked whether we are sufficiently well organised, both in government offices and in the Commission and the European Parliament.
We are organised on a vertical and sectoral basis, but this is a horizontal problem.
We should reflect on this in the long term.
One of the main issues in this connection is the relationship between the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy.
Certain MEPs wish to combine these strategies in the long run.
What is important right now, of course, is to bring about the best possible coordination and for we MEPs to be involved in the process.
We think that the Sustainable Development Strategy should not, in the first place, be seen as an obstacle to, or problem for, growth and development but, rather, as an opportunity.
The world is crying out for intelligent solutions to, for example, our energy and transport problems.
This should be made a main issue in the Lisbon process.
A big advantage of the Commissionâs new proposals is that the international dimension is now included.
We see the EU leaving an ever bigger ecological footprint on the world, a state of affairs that we must, of course, do something about.
It also requires that progress in society be measured in a different way in the future.
We cannot only look at GDP growth, but must also consider a range of other factors.
Another logical consequence of the international perspective is, of course, that we must let the sustainability dimension influence our development aid very much more than we have allowed it to do so far.
Finally, I wish to emphasise the importance of research issues.
I have a number of questions for both the Commission and the Council.
How do you wish to strengthen coordination between the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy and, above all, how do you wish to ensure that there is more encouragement for the environmental technology industry and for innovations in this area?
How does the Commission wish to ensure that the sustainability aspects are better reflected in the budget than they are at present, especially in the aid budget?
Finally, we must get to grips with the problem of the EUâs increased ecological footprint.
Are you considering integrated measures of some kind to tackle this issue?
Â Â  This Parliamentâs procedures leave us in a position of weakness.
We are, after all, trying to influence the document that will go to the European Council this week, but in practice I assume that has already been written, finalised, translated into 20 different languages and our impact in this Chamber is likely to be somewhat limited.
Perhaps that is something to consider in future.
However, I wish to congratulate the Austrian Presidency, because it has at least made this a priority; it has tried to pull together the threads and it has looked at ways to take this agenda forward, which is welcome.
To me the big issue, though, is implementation.
Take one example: national sustainable development strategies have to be prepared in all cases by next June.
But what if they are not?
What tools, what mechanisms, do we have to ensure that Member States actually deliver on the pledges the prime ministers will agree this Friday?
We need more indicators.
There is a good suggested list here in Austriaâs draft paper, but it is simply not comprehensive enough.
We need specific performance tables; we need the opportunity to name and shame, to point the finger at those Member States that pay lip service to the idea of sustainable development, but do not match their fine words with deeds.
What we really need is for the Commission, as the independent arbiter, to be able to find mechanisms to put pressure on Member States which are so reluctant to rock the boat within the Council and to point the finger at one another.
Five years ago, when the Natura 2000 programme was being prepared, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, the then Environment Commissioner, used the fact that structural funds could be withheld unless the Habitats Directive was properly complied with as a means of encouraging the process.
That threat of withholding money from Member States brought about a dramatic transformation in performance and the submission of new ideas.
I hope that over the next few months and years the Commission will come up with mechanisms of that kind to really put pressure on Member States where it hurts.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to understand that sustainable development is the basis of our future.
If we forget that, the basis of our economy will also disappear.
It is a misconception that economic development and environmental protection would be in conflict with one another.
Our experience is quite the opposite.
Ambitious environmental protection promotes economic development, and this applies to both countries and sectors of industry.
Industry has called for the economic effects of environmental policy to be analysed.
The problem is that when an analysis is carried out, the results are not believed.
When, for example, analyses showed that the REACH chemicals legislation is economically viable, industry did not believe it.
Similarly, when analyses show that cleaning up air pollution pays off, the car industry lobbies against it.
We need ambitious targets, when, for example, it comes to saving energy.
The least we could do, and the cheapest option, is that we should decide to end aid that is harmful to the environment.
Aid for fossil energy in the EU amounts to more than EUR 24Â billion a year, which is four times more than that for renewable energy.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I wish to express our disappointment and displeasure about the lack of progress in developing and monitoring the sustainable development strategy.
We agree that the sustainable development strategy must include three core, interconnected objectives which have not only environmental, but also social and economic repercussions.
And yet the Council and the Commission appear once again to be more concerned, as far as sustainable development is concerned, with promoting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, despite its environmental and social repercussions.
Unfortunately, the Lisbon Strategy relates mainly but not solely to economic competitiveness and the creation of prosperous jobs, with environmental objectives coming a very poor second, while the sustainable development strategy needs to promote environmental and social objectives, rather than economic sustainability.
I should like to point out, given that a large percentage of the European population suffers from serious economic and social problems, such as poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, and the fact that the most deprived social groups often suffer the worst social and environmental conditions, including poor housing and health, that the framework for Commission action to review the sustainable development strategy is extremely reticent and weak.
The objectives being formulated by the Commission are extremely general in nature and therefore difficult to assess.
For example, the Commission has introduced the European year for fighting poverty and social exclusion, an initiative that we welcome, but has failed to formulate more specific initiatives and effective, enforceable measures which will allow real progress to be made.
Â Â  . Mr President, the strategy which the Commission has published sends out a positive message: it demonstrates that the Commission too has time for a sustainable society.
I can concur with the conclusion which the Commission has drawn in its document, namely that, if we want to work towards a sustainable society, we must seize the existing opportunities now.
That should also be the message to the Council.
If we want to make sustainable development a success, then there are many examples of measures we could take straight away.
I would like to remind you that we do not own this planet, but that we have the task of looking after it and saving it.
As a consequence, we will really have to change our way of living if we want to secure an existence for our children and grandchildren.
That is why we need an ambitious package of measures, and I would like to hear from the Council and Commission how they would like to work on it together with this Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for having made this strategy one of its key priorities.
I hope that, although our document comes slightly late in the day, the Summit will decide on something practical in this regard over the next few days and not confine itself to making token or rhetorical statements.
I should like to extract and highlight three key words that I consider essential from the contribution made by Parliament in the shape of the unanimous resolution on which we shall vote tomorrow.
The first word is integration.
The Lisbon and Gothenburg European Councils were held one year apart.
Five years later, the time has perhaps come to integrate them more, maybe even with a buzz word, with a new word such as , in such a way as to overcome this contradiction and this distinction between competitiveness and environment.
The second word is governance.
We genuinely need to give a strong boost to the Member States and, I stress, to what is actually taking place at a local and regional level, so that everyone, across the board, might play a leading role in implementing this strategy in practice.
Actions cannot only come from above, but this leading role also needs to be promoted.
Finally, the third word is monitoring.
I very much agree with the need to define a concise set of, let us say, multicriterial indicators, which measure the progress made towards sustainability on a regular and ongoing basis.
This is vital if we are to win over the citizens, who must have the opportunity to ascertain in practice the progress made or the difficulties encountered in pursuing our objectives.
I believe that this bottom-up form of monitoring is very important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, economic theory based on sustainable development abandons the approach grounded only in an analysis of GDP and employment in favour of an interpretation of a countryâs cyclical position.
Work is natural capital, the capital produced by people.
The European sustainable development strategy and the Lisbon Agenda must integrate the economic dimension with the social and environmental dimensions in order to guarantee long-term development.
For this strategy to be successful, it is essential to act at all levels of governance, from the largest international and national organisations to the local AgendaÂ 21, which in Italy too is at last becoming one of the most important forces driving the spread of a sustainable management model.
Acting at a local level is the key principle that makes it possible to pursue major objectives like preserving what natural capital is left, reducing human pressure on the world around us, and improving the efficiency of the end uses of products, for instance by promoting energy-efficient buildings and environmentally friendly urban transport systems.
The extension of Commission support to the system of so-called âgreenâ public works contracts is producing good results.
Nevertheless, in common with Members in other groups â and I am glad to have heard the speaker before me â I must highlight a number of aspects that I consider very important.
The Commission ought to be more specific and to stick to definite and therefore verifiable objectives.
That is the only way that all the actors in the sustainable economy will be encouraged to adopt an ecologically and socially compatible model.
There is still a great deal to do in Europe to ensure that our energy supplies are based on renewable sources, in order to protect the environment from pollution and from the excessive, irreversible exploitation of natural resources.
In this context I consider it essential for sustainable development indicators to be developed and improved: they need to be easily understood and accessible to the general public.
It is important to try to monitor all the outcomes.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European sustainability strategy is an important topic and a top priority for the Austrian Presidency of the Council.
In the past few months, 10 different Council configurations have dealt with the subject of assessing and implementing the sustainability strategy for Europe, in order to strengthen the quality of the strategy across the board, including with our own working group, 'Friends of the Presidency'.
We want the European Union to act as an international frontrunner, and to demonstrate its capabilities as, so to speak, a 'sustainable union' at international level.
That applies to the European Union with its central institutions, to the territorial authorities, to the regions and to the municipalities.
We want to send out clear signals promoting sustainable development.
It would be inappropriate to concentrate solely on economic growth, economic development and the Lisbon Strategy: it is not compatible with Europe's history, and I also do not think it is enough to act sustainably in the future.
We have the impression that, following the discussions, in general a text could be negotiated that is both balanced and politically significant.
In line with the instructions of the European Council of December 2005, we now have a single, coherent document that brings together aims, tasks, indicators and a whole range of specific actions for essential EU policy areas.
This renewed EU sustainability strategy should be clearly visible from the outside.
The document that the European Council will adopt in the next few days has no annexes, and is clearly structured, comprehensible and consistent.
This constructive cooperation, in particular from the Member States, and the intensive dialogues between the various parties involved have led us to the success that we hope will be achieved in the days to come.
We have had a whole range of contacts and positive conversations with representatives of the European Parliament.
We in the Presidency have tried very hard and quite consciously to include the central points brought up by the European Parliament in the negotiations â and, as far as possible, in the compromise as well.
You have frequently talked about how we need to view the issue of the link between the Lisbon Strategy and the EU sustainability strategy from the aspect of qualitative growth.
We want to send a clear political signal that sustainable development will not, as some intend, put the brakes on economic growth, but will actually support and enable intelligent growth in areas for the future.
That is what we need to do with this strategy.
The strategy repeatedly refers to issues such as renewable energy sources, environmental technology, 'greening' public procurement, resources and energy efficiency, the environment as a factor for more jobs, intelligent and innovative products and services and mobility solutions.
Growth cannot be an end in itself, but just a means to an end, and that end is improving the quality of life and of the environment in Europe, whilst maintaining long-term competitiveness.
If the people and the environment are doing well, then the economy will also do well.
Europe has always particularly distinguished itself in the past, and will continue to do so in future, by the way in which it runs its economy according to different criteria from other national economies in the world.
Regarding the relationship to the Lisbon Strategy, the two strategies, each with its own priorities and timescales, should continue to exist separately from one another, but support and strengthen each other.
The central goal is greater transparency and a higher status for the EU sustainability strategy at political level.
The two strategies should therefore be further developed and implemented in close coordination in content terms.
We want to make it clear that the EU strategy for sustainable development and the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs do not exclude each other, compete with each other or supersede each other, but rather complement each other effectively.
The EU strategy for sustainable development provides a comprehensive framework within which the Lisbon Strategy, with its new focus on growth and jobs, can act as the engine of a dynamic economy.
In our opinion, both strategies underline the fact that economic, social and environmental goals can strengthen each other and should therefore be designed, developed and promoted together.
Both strategies aim to support the necessary structural changes that will allow the economies of the Member States to face up to the challenges of globalisation, which affect all of us in Europe.
The aims and main content of the sustainability strategy, including in comparison to Gothenburg 2001, which will become the key challenges for sustainable development, are clearly laid out in the paper and in the strategy, and are also translated into concrete terms through targets and actions: climate change and environmentally-friendly energy, sustainable mobility and transport planning, sustainable production and consumption models, which will be an important guide for the future, management of natural resources, health, social integration, demographics and migration, which is probably one of the greatest challenges facing the continent and a major challenge in relation to the fight against poverty and for sustainable international development.
The new key challenge of sustainable consumption and production models caused a great deal of controversy, but has now been incorporated into the strategy.
One major success that has been mentioned by several speakers here is certainly the creation of a separate chapter in the strategy setting out implementation mechanisms for effective follow-up and for evaluating and assessing the progress made.
As you can see, we have put a great deal of energy into this sustainability strategy.
We have kept 10 Council configurations busy, and we have tried to resolve this apparent competition between Lisbon and sustainability, so I am very pleased that, taking your comments into consideration and following intensive negotiations with the Member States, we will be in a position to adopt this EU sustainability strategy within the next few days.
That is good for the quality of life in Europe, and it is a positive sign for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, the Sustainable Development and Lisbon strategies together address issues that really concern people.
European value and quality of life surveys tell us that citizens want prosperity, but they also want a clean environment, good health, social protection and equality.
The Commission put forward its proposal for the review of the European Unionâs Sustainable Development Strategy in December.
This has been the subject of in-depth debate in the Council, culminating in the adoption of a review of the Strategy at the European Council scheduled for tomorrow.
I welcome Parliamentâs input from January on the stocktaking and orientations for the review, and I appreciate the involvement of many of you in the stakeholder debate on this subject.
I look forward to working with you further on this, on the issues raised in the motion for a resolution amongst others.
Sustainable development is an over-arching objective of the Union.
The European Union Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy work hand in hand towards this objective, although they should be kept separate.
Together the strategies are an agenda for change, for Europe to adapt to a changing global context: new competitors, an aging population, and the impacts of demographic change, increased resource scarcities, climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem loss, for example. They aim to stimulate innovation, including behavioural change, create level playing fields and engage all.
The Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy are complementary.
The much-needed economic growth must be decoupled from environmental degradation and must better safeguard social cohesion to ensure it can be sustained.
At the same time, though, the worldwide drive towards more eco-efficient products and services creates opportunities for growth and jobs that we must seize.
For both we need to act.
By achieving results on sustainable development, we improve our chances of regaining citizensâ confidence in the European Union.
To achieve results, we need to focus and be clear about who does what.
This implies a certain practical distribution of work between the two strategies.
The Lisbon Strategy addresses concerns about medium-term economic performance, looking to stimulate growth and jobs and helping the European Union to adapt to global competition and increased pressures on resources.
To achieve this aim, the Lisbon Strategy comprises actions in a wide range of policy areas, many of which are central to sustainable development strategy, such as energy efficiency, environmental technologies resource use, and others.
The SDS addresses concerns about our prosperity, both in economic and quality of life terms, including issues that are more slow-burning, where time-lags mean that actions now have impacts into the long term.
A good example is climate change, but also unsustainable modes of transport, social exclusion, health and how we use our natural resources.
It also looks at broader global challenges and impacts beyond the European Unionâs borders.
But let us be clear: Lisbon and the SDS are mutually reinforcing.
The success of one depends on the success of the other.
The priority now is to achieve results.
There have been more than 20 years of debate on sustainable development, but progress in addressing unsustainable trends is too slow.
We must move from words to action.
Some say that we are not ambitious enough.
I disagree.
The Commissionâs revised SDS provides a new political drive for sustainable policies that apply to all policy areas.
We also welcome the priority given by the Austrian Presidency to the revisions of SDS and the draft conclusions that will be discussed at this weekâs European Council.
We are talking about a new drive aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are necessary for sustainable development.
The review of the European Unionâs Sustainable Development Strategy is about how we can do things better to get results: first, about how we design policy, including policies within the Lisbon Agenda; second, about implementing what has been agreed; third, about making sure that we involve all those who need to act.
The European Union institutions cannot achieve sustainable development alone.
The new strategy addresses some of the weaknesses of the previous strategy: unclear priorities, little ownership and absence of a clear monitoring mechanism.
It confirms the main challenges, but clarifies the objectives and sets out a new and more rigorous monitoring mechanism.
It includes regular reports from the Commission, which are to be submitted every two years, drawing on the latest Eurostat indicators.
It includes national strategies, to be updated to bring them more into line with the European Union Strategy, and it includes peer review of national strategies to allow mutual learning.
We need to learn from best practice and use every opportunity to multiply successful initiatives.
By clarifying priorities, we will also facilitate the coordination of the Lisbon and Sustainable Development strategies.
The renewed Sustainable Development Strategy re-emphasises the importance of an integrated approach.
The problems are interlinked and so are the solutions.
Good use of impact assessments that address the economic, social and environmental impacts of proposals is key.
Horizontal measures, such as getting prices right, investment and research and innovation, education and skills are also important.
The new strategy is about all of us assuming our responsibilities.
Involving stakeholders, businesses and citizens in delivering results is a priority.
It is also about all European Union institutions and Member States working for the implementation of the Strategy.
We believe that the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should play a more active role in helping to implement and monitor the strategy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I feel less optimistic than those who have spoken so far, because I believe that the document that has been produced is essentially a document full of statements, which includes many existing clichÃ©s, many arguments that we have all heard and which are leading to an increasingly weak and less respected notion of sustainable development.
Why do I say this?
Because I believe that the structure in the methodology â and, as well as a politician, I am speaking as an academic â is based on an error: it is based on repeating the old clichÃ©s and on not properly analysing todayâs sustainable development problems.
Firstly, it does not make it clear whether the document has European or world ambitions.
It does not make that clear.
Secondly, it conforms to Gothenburg, but not to Johannesburg.
Furthermore, it ignores problems such as the relationship between the economy and sustainable development.
Today, economic activities cannot be separated from sustainability, and if we want to link it to Lisbon, even less so: in other words, there can be no employment, there can be no possibility of development for the under-developed countries, unless we take into account what kind of economy is appropriate.
Certain economic activities are necessary in order to maintain biodiversity.
Have we considered what economic activities are required or the role agriculture plays in maintaining animals?
Have we taken account of the fact that, if we want to talk about climate change and development in Africa, we must talk about nuclear energy in order to resolve the problem of obtaining water through desalination and obtaining energy that does not pollute?
