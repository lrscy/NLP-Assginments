One thing is clear, however. The monitoring of compliance with EU laws and respect for the Union's values is not a process which should end upon accession.
The Liberal Group welcomes the date of 2007 along with a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania.
The steps which they need to take must be clearly outlined by the Commission in time for Copenhagen, so that they are clear on what needs to be done.
The recent reforms undertaken by the Turkish Government represent a real breakthrough and, while no date can be set for Turkey's accession until the political criteria are met, we will watch with interest the implementation of these reforms.
Turkey must be offered a pre-accession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment.
We must show the world that we are not an elite Christian club.
The question of Cyprus will also have to be resolved to smooth the way for Turkey's entry.
Here we look to Greece and Turkey to help broker an agreement before the Copenhagen Summit.
The prospect of the whole of Cyprus joining the EU would start the Greek Presidency on a positive note which we hope would conclude, in Thessaloniki, with a summit symbolising reconciliation.
In conclusion, the enlargement marathon is nearing the finish line.
Despite the exertions thus far, the participants must be prepared for a sprint finish.
Once they cross the line in Copenhagen, they will have little time to celebrate, the training for the next marathon begins - the marathon of meeting the acquis communautaire and achieving democratic endorsement of the enlargement process.
Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are preparing to take an historic decision.
The headlines of a Brussels newspaper yesterday said that in just over a year we will have to talk about the Twenty-five instead of the Fifteen.
This is in itself good news.
I think I speak for my group as a whole in welcoming all these European nations.
We shall have to rise to the common challenge of successful enlargement.
In order to succeed, however, we must address each and every problem if we want to avoid providing grist to the mill for people-pleasers or the shameful opponents of enlargement.
And there is the rub.
President of the Commission, I feel your presentation failed to address some serious problems.
Let us take as an example the Community acquis, the most taboo subject of all.
To you, and to many of my fellow Members here present, it is all or nothing.
Any candidate country that questions any part of it would be excluded from negotiations.
We all know, however, that some implications of the acquis will lead to acute, serious, dangerous social crises in these countries.
We will not solve these problems by burying our heads in the sand. Quite the opposite.
Transposal under pressure will solve nothing in the long run.
There are some States among the Fifteen that have obtained compromises on matters concerning their specific identity, and even among the founding countries of the Community, there are signed texts that are now being called into question again, such as the Stability and Growth Pact.
The citizens of the Union, meanwhile, as you know, are contesting the acquis even more.
The liberal structure of Europe, and the non-transparent way it is being created from the top down without the involvement of the people, is increasingly unacceptable.
Such debates are also taking place within the candidate countries, at the highest levels.
This is borne out, for example, by the essential conflict between the Polish Government and parliament and the Polish Central Bank, which is considered too liberal and too independent.
For her part, the President of Latvia goes so far as to express her feeling, and I quote, 'of colonisation' within the population with regard to the Commission's position on the agricultural chapter.
You are aware of all that, yet you say nothing.
I think that this is a mistake.
You cannot bring down a fever by breaking the thermometer.
There is another aspect that I would like to highlight.
Our counterparts in the candidate countries have told me about some unfortunate incidents.
Apparently, a Commission negotiator, when faced with a few reservations, settled the debate in substance with these words: 'either you sign, or you wait'.
What is achieved by the arrogance of the strong towards the weak?
You achieve a signature now and ill feeling later.
That is not the solution.
We need to talk about this.
I shall simply note a third problem, since everyone is familiar with it, but I do think we need to talk about it because overall success depends on it to a great extent.
This is the problem of funding for enlargement.
If my memory serves me correctly, the Commission, in 1999, set aside EUR 40 billion for the period 2004-2006, when six countries were involved.
The same sum is now set aside for ten countries.
How can that work?
And why are we not publicly reminding Member States which refuse the necessary financial solidarity that, over ten years, they, together with these countries, have benefited from an outrageous trade surplus of EUR 100 billion and that their companies are making substantial profits, the details of which we would like to know.
Forgive me for being so frank, but our only chance of achieving successful enlargement in future is to address real problems now.
Mr President, President of the Commission, the winds of change seem to be blowing in this Chamber.
Having lived through a few historic changes, I am a little disappointed by the cold wind blowing in this Chamber.
Exactly thirteen years ago today, the first demonstration which led to the fall of the Berlin wall took place in Leipzig.
You, Mr Poettering, with your usual skill, recalled Solidarity, with which we are all familiar.
I admit that as far as the Pope is concerned, you can have him.
I shall, nevertheless, mention two other groups of Polish heroes that you forgot: the Polish resistance that fought against Nazi barbarism and the Jewish resistance that also fought in the Warsaw ghetto against Nazi barbarism.
If we are talking about Poland and the fight against totalitarianism, we should mention all the Poles who fought against all types of totalitarianism.
Let us come now to enlargement.
I admit to being somewhat surprised, occasionally, by the condescending tone we use when speaking of the candidate countries.
Clearly, they need to reform.
Clearly, the change from a totalitarian culture to one of democracy and a market economy is difficult.
But what I would have expected, wished, imagined, dreamt of, from the Commission at an historic moment, is for it to say that as enlargement is an exciting historical project, we, as Europeans, should try to project ourselves into history.
What will the Europe we want be like in fifteen or twenty years with the Twenty-five?
And what are these petty debates taking place among the Fifteen today with regard to enlargement, when we hear what took place at the last general affairs meeting, with regard to giving two more seats to the Czech Republic, for example, or two more seats to another State?
When you think that we have still not managed to draw up a financial draft for agriculture, that we cannot draw up a financial draft for the Structural Funds ? and why?
Because the Fifteen today are afraid of history and are in fact creating a policy of selfishness.
Let us call a spade a spade.
Most of the governments steep themselves in history on Sundays, and on Monday they are afraid of what they dreamt the day before.
That is why we are unable to progress.
Mr Verheugen, as you said, you are asking for greater flexibility from the candidate countries with regard to financial problems.
I would like to say that I personally am asking for greater solidarity and passion for history from the Fifteen.
It is only through solidarity and passion with regard to enlargement that we will find the solutions to the more difficult issues.
In a word, I would have liked to have received an explanation today, not of the old debate - should we first reform and consolidate before enlargement - but of the sine qua non conditions for successful enlargement, reforms and the consolidation of Europe prior to enlargement.
This does not mean building a new barrier, but quite simply, Mr Poettering, making enlargement possible.
If Europe continues to operate as it does at the moment, with the right of veto of one country or another in certain situations, we are heading for disaster and we are going to miss our date with history.
That is the lesson to be learned. That is what I would have liked to hear so that we would be forced to act more quickly and carry out the process of the Convention in greater depth, with regard to agricultural reforms, Structural Fund reforms, reforms of the legal establishment in Europe, in order to make this establishment more democratic.
Lastly, this should have been clearly stated.
I myself am saying it on behalf of our group: what we dream of is, in ten or fifteen, or I do not know how many years, achieving social and ecological harmonisation across Europe, from Portugal to Hungary, from Poland to Italy.
Total social harmonisation.
I know that will take time, but is that our aim?
Is that our dream?
Or is it something we do not want, because we want to retain the differentiation between nations?
That is what I think is somewhat lacking in the speeches made by the Presidency and the Commission.
But that does not matter, history can sometimes force us to be more enthusiastic.
And you will see, you too, with your enthusiasm, will one day go down in the annals of history.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to say briefly to Mr Cohn-Bendit that passion is a wonderful thing but if passion is not based on pragmatism and common sense, it is wasted.
If Mr Cohn-Bendit has passion in abundance at the moment, perhaps he would direct some of it to his Green colleagues from my country who are trying to convince the electorate that they should vote against the Treaty of Nice.
If we want to be passionate, then let our passion be based on facts.
The fact is that if the ten applicant countries proposed by the Commission - for whose efforts I am grateful and I thank Commissioners Prodi and Verheugen in particular - are to be part of the enlarged Europe which Mr Cohn-Bendit is dreaming of, then please tell the people of my country, on behalf of the Green Party of Europe, that they should vote 'yes' to the Treaty of Nice.
We would welcome that.
There is little point in being all things to all people at all times.
Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts.
It is wrong of Green Party Members to say to the people of my country that the Amsterdam Treaty provides for the enlargement process which we are talking about.
It does not provide for the accession of ten new Member States.
If we must have ten new Member States, as we want to, and then perhaps Romania and Bulgaria as soon as possible and then Turkey in due course, then let us put the truth to the people that the Treaty of Nice must be accepted if that is to happen.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on the tremendous work that it has done in dealing with all the applicant countries and the fact that it is now in a position to recommend ten countries for accession.
I want to compliment Commissioner Verheugen for what he said in relation to Turkey.
It is important that this Parliament recognises that over the last year and a half, tremendous progress has been made in Turkey and this should not be forgotten.
Turkey's position today should not be seen as a rejection by the European Union in any shape or form.
As far as Cyprus is concerned, I am glad that Cyprus has made considerable progress and that it has been recommended to us.
I would also like to endorse what has been proposed to us by the Commission in relation to the political problem in Turkey and Cyprus, with the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey.
We should use all our influence to ensure that a role for the United Nations is accepted in this respect because there is no other way.
Finally, I would like to say to this Parliament, to my colleagues and friends, that despite the best efforts of those in this House who have been trying to confuse the issue of the Treaty of Nice in relation to my country, the Irish people totally support enlargement.
We will have a majority by the end of next week for the Treaty of Nice.
(Applause)
Mr President, Ireland is one of the two countries in which a majority of people would regret the EU's being dissolved.
The Treaty of Nice has been tested in the country which is most favourably disposed to the EU, yet 54% of the population voted against it.
It would, then, have been more natural to have asked the inhabitants of other countries whether they cared for the treaty but, instead, the Irish were asked to vote on it again, as in fact they are doing, faced with the threat that, if they do not, enlargement will come to a halt.
In all honesty, is there a single minister who would put the brakes on enlargement if the Irish were to vote 'no'.
Of course not. Enlargement will continue.
The situation is anticipated in the Treaty of Amsterdam in the form of a protocol which, by giving them a double majority or more votes in the Council, will compensate the five largest countries for the loss of their second Commissioner.
This outcome was negotiated on the spot in Nice.
It is not something to boast about, but it exists in a special declaration which is not part of the treaty and has not therefore been rejected, either.
It can be called into play, irrespective of whether the Irish vote 'yes' or 'no'.
I must also call upon the Brussels Summit to correct the figures.
It is a scandal that Hungary and Turkey are being offered fewer places in the European Parliament than countries with smaller populations.
The new weighting system is impossible to remember, even for ministers. Instead, a straightforward system should be devised which can be explained to the people of those countries that are shortly to vote on membership.
There should also be more flexibility in relation to the candidate countries.
The EU should not receive them like a steamroller that crushes everything they themselves have devised in the way of laws.
We should be content to lay down requirements concerning their conduct in the common market and allow them to retain their freedom in all the areas in which there is no documented common need for cross-border laws.
They should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to keep their national currencies.
Agricultural land in the Czech Republic costs 10% of that in Germany.
Why not allow the candidate countries to keep their laws concerning the purchase and sale of land.
What would the Czechs say if Sudetenland were to be bought up with German euros.
I come from that part of Denmark that was occupied by Germany.
Today, we have an excellent relationship with our neighbours, which I commend and consider to be a model for Northern Ireland and other areas with national tensions.
The Danish summer house protocol contributes to the good relationship between Danes and Germans.
Without this, the best situated houses would be bought up, because the price of a German summer house is several times that of a Danish one.
The transitional arrangements agreed with the candidate countries encourage unnecessary division and will give rise to many 'no' votes in the referendums.
My group has different attitudes to enlargement.
The Danish June Movement is heavily critical of the conditions we are offering the candidate countries, but those of us in this Chamber will vote in favour of them because we respect the candidate countries' own decisions.
We hope that the many new democracies can breathe some democratic life into us so that we might obtain a slimmer, freer, open and decentralised Europe for all.
With greater flexibility, Bulgaria and Romania could also join.
It is a little sad to see them excluded, because they have been left to languish in poverty for a far longer period.
Mr President, needless to say, we have always been in favour of a united and strong Europe in which each European people has its place and can retain its cultural identity.
This also applies to the peoples of Eastern Europe who, for decades, lived under the Communist yoke and who for decades were unable to count on the solidarity of anyone in this hemisphere, of not a single one of the political families in this hemisphere who are now, however, all holding forth.
I am therefore not opposed to the principle of European enlargement, provided that it is, of course, a European enlargement and not a small Asian enlargement to include a country such as Turkey, which does not belong to Europe, whether that is understood geographically, historically, politically or culturally.
I am, however, opposed to a hurried and dogmatic enlargement such as is being prepared for today and which, I fear, is set to lead to major social, economic, cultural and social problems.
Problems will arise in the current Member States, which will undoubtedly be faced with a major, fresh wave of immigration, but also in the candidate countries when their highly trained people, engineers, doctors, nurses, construction workers and many more will almost certainly, for financial reasons, leave their countries to find a better paid job elsewhere in Europe.
If the free movement of persons, goods and capital will, in reality, generate more poverty, more immigration, more crime and more uprooting both in former Eastern Europe and here, then the responsible politicians should really first consider a method of guaranteeing a more harmonious unification process.
Let us therefore take some time-out, let us go ahead with this enlargement, but let us admit: today, at this moment, the free movement of persons is not yet possible.
If not, we are in danger of placing a time bomb under Europe which may go off more quickly than we realise, or to use La Fontaine's words: let us ensure that Europe does not await the tragic fate of the frog who at one time dreamt of being able, very quickly, to turn into an ox.
Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like particularly to thank the Commission for preparing for this occasion so outstandingly well over recent months. It has put forward a proposal, based on all the analyses that have been possible to date, which is viable - so viable, indeed, that it will be possible, in December, to take the decisions to invite ten countries to join the European Union.
As the chairman of the committee responsible, let me say that we are making preparations to shape the parliamentary procedure as speedily as possible so that there is no delay on Parliament's part, and so that the date envisaged for the signing of the Treaties can be adhered to.
I am convinced that overall, Parliament will endorse a positive outcome.
This is a great moment, but this great moment does not mark the completion of the work, for the difficult negotiations will continue until December.
It must be clear that we cannot hold the accession countries hostage to problems we face in one Member State or another.
It must be clear to us that reforms must be undertaken in areas such as agricultural policy, but these reforms must not be framed in such a way as to give rise to an alibi for delaying the enlargement process.
The internal process within the European Union must be shaped in a way that ensures that there are no trumped-up new grounds for delay.
This is why we also call on the governments of the Member States to ensure that in those specific areas - such as agricultural policy and financing - where they have still not reached agreement, to do so as quickly as possible so that it is not down to us if there is a delay in the enlargement of the European Union.
As part of this process, for example, we must try to resolve the Cyprus issue in a way that ensures that there are no new tensions or delays.
I realise this is like squaring the circle, but I believe that this issue, too, can be resolved.
It must be clear that, outside the European Union, there is nothing by virtue of which any of the accession candidates has any right to influence the timetable for enlargement as it affects any country whatever.
There are many cases in which we too must have a clear awareness of this, regardless of the direction in which this is meant.
In my view, the accession candidates also need to continue their efforts, and I would like to thank the Commission for placing such emphasis on implementation through appropriate administrative and judicial structures.
The accession candidates still have a great deal of work to do before accession comes in 2004. Transposing Community law into national law is not enough.
Capacity to implement this law in practice is also required.
This means providing the necessary aid, but it also means making the necessary efforts.
These efforts cannot end in December, for otherwise, we will find ourselves in a very difficult situation.
This also means making it clear - also with regard to the Czech Republic - that we have a legal system which does not tolerate discrimination.
In future, no EU citizen may suffer discrimination on any grounds whatsoever.
The European Union is not there to settle old scores but to make a new start and break through the cycle of violence in Europe, and this means that everyone must be willing to make their contribution.
I hope that the relevant reports commissioned by Parliament will be duly noted by all sides and the opportunity taken to unite this with appropriate signals, gestures and actions so that it can work well in practice.
Let me just add one more sentence, which should really be the longest part of my speech.
We too still have our homework to do, for we are not yet ready for enlargement either.
For this reason, the Convention preparing the European constitution must be a success next year: this is a prerequisite if an enlarged Community is to function. We too are therefore called on to make a particular effort in this context.
Mr President, in its communication on the progress made in accession negotiations, the Commission confirms that Cyprus will be part of the first wave of accession, as decided at the Copenhagen Summit.
I would like to thank the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Verheugen, for this proposal which responds fully to the expectations of the European Parliament and which should surprise nobody.
Throughout the negotiation process, we have seen complete agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament over the fundamental elements of the Cypriot dossier.
It also appears now that accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus have been a powerful catalyst in the United Nations' efforts to solve the political problem of the island in accordance with the rules of international law.
Although nothing has been achieved as yet, and despite the threats of annexing and crisis from Ankara, the recent communication from the Secretary-General of the United Nations is still based on the idea that a political framework solution can be found by the end of the year.
Parliament, in its latest resolutions, clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU.
The Cypriot federal state must possess a central government as well as a parliament to control it, which is able to take all decisions within the framework of the Treaty, as well as participating in these policies.
It would also have to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the island's territory.
The awakening of civil society and the surveys carried out in northern Cyprus confirm that the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population is also in favour of a pro-European policy.
I therefore hope that vigorous political will will make it possible to overcome the remaining obstacles and that the forces of the Union will triumph over the forces of division.
In the absence of this policy, or if it were hindered by external interference, the Copenhagen European Council would have to take its decisions in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions.
Mr President, Commissioners, we in Flanders have been dreaming of being Flemish and of becoming European since the nineteenth century.
With the accession of ten new countries, the European area of peace and stability is growing, and so is the scope for human rights and democracy.
This is a reason to rejoice.
Candidate countries were given powerful incentives to bring about the necessary changes.
We, however, have not shown the same level of commitment to forcefully implementing the changes that are necessary to fashion this real Europe.
Former enlargements have shown that prosperity has increased, both in the countries concerned and for EU citizens.
Mr Prodi has stated that the costs will be reimbursed, but our citizens are not all convinced of this.
Quite the reverse. It will require courage and powers of persuasion to remove the feelings of uncertainty and fear, particularly at a time of economic decline.
Moreover, there are still flaws in the system.
Mr Prodi himself mentioned fraud, corruption and the trafficking in human beings.
The problems surrounding Cyprus and Poland's internal problems were also mentioned, and the discussion on Turkey is overshadowing everything else.
We should not arouse false expectations.
Hence the need for us to inform our citizens of what is at stake.
We as regionalists and peoples without a state are very sensitive to the problems that still exist with regard to discrimination against peoples and cultural minorities.
We are sensitive to the non-recognition of regional and historical realities in the different accession countries.
All of this raises the question of whether we still have the time and resources to put these things right before accession becomes a reality.
However, we are giving accession the green light today because a red light would be a sign of hostility, while we are, quite rightly in fact, dreaming of this area of peace and stability.
Mr President, enlargement is an opportunity for the European Union, probably its last opportunity, as the Union has failed in so many other areas.
Yet nobody, neither the candidate countries, nor, in particular, the Fifteen, is prepared to accept the consequences, especially the financial consequences, of enlargement.
Mr Prodi's Commission did not rise to the occasion and it is clear that the desire to succeed, to consecrate his mandate at the head of the European Commission took precedence over any other considerations.
We want to extend our family circle, but we have not extended the house.
On the contrary, since Nice, each party has retreated within its own private garden.
We therefore need to have the courage to say that the decision on enlargement must be postponed.
The principle is there.
But the decision must be postponed at least until the European Convention, for example, proposes a new common architecture for the twenty-five States and new operating rules.
The decision must not be taken in Copenhagen this December, but in Athens or Rome next year, which would not entail any delay in the accession of Member States should the decision be positive.
That is why I shall vote against the report presented to us by the Commission.
I congratulate the Commission simply on having closed the door to Turkey, a decision which is essentially just as incomprehensible as the decision to open this same door.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement will change Europe on a lasting basis.
That is why the quality of the preparations is so crucial.
The Commission has today given the green light for the accession of ten countries, but it acknowledges at the same time that not all the criteria have been fulfilled as yet.
In light of this aspect, the Paris newspaper Le Figaro reports its 'creeping and unpleasant sensation of jumping into a void without a parachute'.
I would not go quite that far, but numerous sensitive issues remain unresolved: financing, Cyprus, and the Bene? decrees are just some of the key words here.
I am extremely disappointed by the Czech Government's stance of declining even to talk about the issues.
Europe means talking to each other!
I am disappointed by the Commission's stance.
What kind of community of values will the EU become in future if it meekly accepts a law which assures impunity for murder?
I have spoken of rifts. They are offset not only by the advantages but also the opportunity to enlarge the zone of security and stability and overcome the division of Europe.
Enlargement is the political expression of reconciliation in Europe. That is our great opportunity.
Mr President, thirteen years after the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe and after a number of years of serious negotiation, we have now reached the penultimate stage prior to eight new Member States acceding from that region, and two from the Mediterranean Sea area.
The candidates which, all things being equal, will be taking part in the European elections as fully-fledged members in 2004, will soon be able to send observers to this Parliament, something to which we are very much looking forward.
The result presented to us by the Commission deserves warm congratulations, as especially does the person primarily responsible for this, Commissioner Verheugen.
We said in Parliament at the time that the loose ends should be few and short.
This is exactly what we are seeing in the transitional stage: loose ends that are few and short, except - understandably - for those that have to do with the environment.
Casting our minds back to 1989, we can recall the general enthusiasm that greeted the return to Europe of peoples who had long been oppressed.
This enthusiasm is still among us in copious amounts.
It is therefore all the more painful to see how at some ministries, this return has been reduced to nothing but a money matter.
Some hold the false, yet persistent, belief that the European Union, and particularly the addition of new Member States, would be costly and would require huge sacrifices on our part.
Some xenophobic instincts also persist, and are the subject of shameless speculation.
Communicating the truth, namely that the European Union only costs 1.27% of GNP and that, on account of internal savings, another 0.14% has been freed up for enlargement, that it has been settled in Berlin and fixed until 2006, in other words that the whole budgetary procedure is running smoothly, is a virtually impossible task.
If some of this does manage to trickle through, there will always be some Finance Ministry or other which, by sketching worst-case scenarios, combined with strong exaggerations and their own interpretation of the figures, is prepared once again to awaken latent fears, put enlargement in a bad light and even to use the candidate countries as bargaining counters in the political wrangle with other Member States about the review of agricultural policy.
This is transgressing the rules of decency.
The care that the Commission has exercised on behalf of the Council is manifested in various ways, one being the statement that the permanent, sustainable implementation of the negotiation results must be monitored for the time being.
In the coming years, there will certainly be reason to assist some new Member States, or show them the right way, particularly on an administrative level.
What they have already achieved is indeed to be applauded.
Such a clause was already used during the preparatory stages of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
We then introduced the well-known article which even provides for sanctions if a Member strays from its path in terms of rule of law and democracy.
This article applies to us all.
As has often been established scientifically, including by our former fellow MEP Mr Burenstam Lindner, enlargements always bring economic benefits to all parties involved, to the existing Members more so than the new ones.
More important, however, is the gain in terms of a fairer, more peaceful legal order in Europe and the establishment of a European community of values.
The contribution to this by new members may be significant in this respect too.
I hope that the same spirit which prevailed at the start of Europe's integration will also inspire the new and old Member States in future too.
Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's report shows a great deal of optimism but is also very realistic.
I agree with Commissioner Verheugen: much has been achieved, but many more reforms are required and we as parliamentarians in particular must study and evaluate the reports with vision, but also with precision and pragmatism, just as we must scrutinise the outcomes of the negotiations.
I would like to make one thing clear from the outset: without further efforts to establish the internal market, to integrate minorities - such as the Roma and Sinti - and enforce the rule of law, enlargement is unlikely to succeed.
However, let me also say, on this point, that it is down to us to behave in a way which is likely to build bridges.
Since the phrase 'Bene? Decrees' has already been mentioned, let me say that I am very gratified by the studies commissioned by this Parliament, which show that there are no legal obstacles to the Czech Republic's accession.
At the same time, I believe it would be conducive to the climate of the negotiations and the decision-making process if the Czech Republic could find the courage to clarify the situation, which would entail a reappraisal of the Bene? Decrees from a modern perspective - not as a demand or a condition, but rather as an offer.
Let me make one comment in my capacity as a former rapporteur for Turkey.
I understand that many people in Turkey, especially the pro-European forces, are disappointed by the Commission's proposals since they do not set a specific date for accession negotiations.
However, I understand and endorse the Commission's position, and I see a great opportunity for Turkey if it does not simply fixate on a possible date but is prepared to work with the European Union on building a genuine economic and political partnership with the EU until accession is possible.
The Commission's proposals are a starting point.
However, more can be done, and we can work on this together in the coming months.
I was asked today: what do I say to my constituents? What does the Commission's proposal mean?
I would say that it means a resounding 'yes' to accession, and 'yes' to accession in 2004.
However, it also means that it is up to the countries themselves to decide whether they want to fold their hands in their laps or whether they are willing to continue working on the reforms.
My hope is that all the candidates are willing to continue working on the necessary reforms.
Mr President, I would just like to thank Parliament for the immense, sincere support it has given us in our endeavours to make enlargement a reality at last.
Without Parliament's support, we would not have been able to achieve the objectives that we have, and as well as the European Parliament I would like to thank the parliaments of the candidate countries.
I have been present at many of the meetings they have held to prepare for enlargement and I can assure you that never before has there been such a deep-rooted, such a well-supported, such an important democratic process.
It bodes very well for the future that this enlargement is being launched with such strong, such unanimous, such fine democratic intention.
Mr President, in my former speech, I said how very grateful I was to the Commission.
I should also like to say a big thank-you to this Parliament and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which quickly reached a decision, with very broad agreement, to support this enlargement project.
Parliament showed the way and Parliament can now see the result.
Credit where credit is due.
I have heard many debates in this house, but never have I seen such huge consensus on a project as many-faceted as that to which we are here giving further impetus.
There was of course one dissenting voice and, since I am the only Dane speaking today, I should like to provide a little consumer information to Irish voters.
In Denmark, no one is surprised at the fact that Mr Bonde is now conducting a campaign against the new treaty.
He has conducted campaigns against all the treaties.
He adopted an oppositional stance during the Cold War when he was against everything that strengthened the Western democracies against the Communist dictatorships.
He was opposed to Danish membership of the EC.
He was in the opposition camp when we voted for the first time on the Maastricht Treaty, as he also was when we voted on it for the second time.
He conducted a campaign against the Treaty of Amsterdam, and now he is conducting one against the Treaty of Nice.
That is fair enough as far as it goes, but it is not fair enough if the Irish electorate is unaware that, in supporting Mr Bonde, they are supporting someone who is against the whole set-up and who has been opposed to every single aspect of European cooperation.
I just thought there was no harm in saying that.
My apologies.
We are delighted to see that negotiations with ten candidate countries will be able to be closed at the end of this year, for entry into the European Union at the beginning of 2004.
This satisfaction is, however, tinged with regret.
The accessions will go hand in hand with an inextricable muddle of several hundred derogations and transitional measures, and barely veiled threats from the Commission to the candidates: the possibility of sending a preventive warning letter to States that do not comply quickly enough, and even a summons to appear before the Court of Luxembourg.
Welcome to a disciplinary Europe!
If this is what we have come to, we would have been better off, as we suggested, with the accession of these States as early as 1990 to a European political confederation, with variable geometry of common policies, and gradual accession for some States as appropriate.
We would not then have been faced with the impossible equation of balancing a monolithic organisation with diversity; we would not now be forced to leave Bulgaria and Romania shamefully by the wayside.
Perhaps, however, this model will once again prove appropriate.
We should ask the Convention chaired by Mr Giscard d'Estaing to give it serious thought.
We will move on to the next item on the agenda, the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Iraq.
Mr President, I should like to thank you for the opportunity once again to discuss this very topical and difficult subject with the European Parliament.
As I said during the last questions on Iraq on 3 and 4 September, this debate comes at a time when there is a lot of international attention and debate on policy in relation to Iraq.
When I was last here, I reported in broad outline on developments in the situation since the Gulf War.
I emphasised that the EU's position is clear.
It was expressed in a declaration by the Presidency on 20 May of this year, stating that the EU is calling upon Iraq to comply with the resolutions without delay including, specifically, the resolution whereby the weapons inspectors would be able to return, as anticipated in Security Council Resolution 1284.
In this connection, the EU is well disposed towards the meetings between representatives of the UN and Iraq.
We unreservedly support all the efforts on the part of the Security Council and the UN Secretary-General.
This attitude was confirmed at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 30 and 31 August in Elsinore and also at the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 30 September and 1 October in Brussels.
The EU also welcomes the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1409 of 14 May, that is to say the resolution on the revision of the oil for food programme.
With what I have just said in mind, I want today to talk mainly about current developments in connection with Iraq and to concentrate on the Security Council negotiations concerning a new resolution, as well as on the negotiations with Iraq concerning the return of the weapons inspectors.
The permanent members of the Security Council are currently engaged in negotiations concerning a new resolution on Iraq, based on an American draft.
The United States wants to see a resolution that tightens up the demands made of Iraq in earlier resolutions, making them more specific; that sets earlier deadlines for Iraq's compliance with the demands; and that provides a mandate for a possible military intervention in the event of Iraq's not meeting the demands.
The United States has stated that it wants the weapons inspectors to have unconditional access to all areas, including the so-called presidential palaces.
Two subjects are absolutely crucial, namely the issue of a renewed mandate from the Security Council on the use of force, and unconditional, free and unfettered access by the weapons inspectors to all installations and areas in Iraq, including the presidential areas, which is to say the palaces.
We in the EU are satisfied with the Iraq issue's remaining on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
The hope is that the Security Council will reach an agreed position on the matter.
On 30 September and 1 October in Vienna, the chief UN weapons inspector, in the form of the Swede Hans Blix, together with the Director-General of the IAEA, Dr El Baradei, who is responsible for the investigations into Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, met representatives of the Iraqi Government to discuss the practical arrangements in connection with the unconditional return of the weapons inspectors.
Agreement has apparently been reached on a range of issues, based upon the demands made of Iraq in the Security Council resolutions already adopted.
The issue of access to the presidential areas is still unresolved, however.
In addition, there are outstanding issues concerning the ways and means of the weapons inspectors' return, such as the way in which the Iraqis are to be questioned by UNMOVIC, that is to say the UN weapons inspectorate, and the way in which UNMOVIC is to report back.
The weapons inspectors will presumably not be sent to Iraq until a new resolution has been adopted and accepted by Iraq.
It is still too early to establish the content of a new resolution. It is crucial, however, for an inspection regime that is effective and credible to be established.
The EU attaches importance to going down the UN route, both in order to secure broad international support for the disarmament of Iraq and with a view to the credibility and effectiveness of the Security Council and of multilateral cooperation.
Against that background, it is encouraging that, in his speech yesterday, the American President, George Bush, again emphasised the United States's readiness to go down the UN route.
So much has been said.
I should like here finally to say that it would of course have been better if this debate had taken place at a time when Mr Solana could have been present. Since Parliament insisted, however, on debating the matter in any case, I accepted the President's earnest invitation to take part in the debate.
Mr President, I have already spoken twice about Iraq in this Chamber.
My last intervention was just one month ago, on 4 September, right after the informal meeting of EU Ministers in Elsinore.
Since then, Iraq has, for obvious reasons, remained the most important topic of international debate, though there is not all that much of substance that the Commission can add to what has just been said, or, frankly, to what is reported daily in the press.
The most encouraging development since I last spoke was President Bush's speech which I heard at the UN General Assembly on 12 September and the Presidency referred also to the speech that he has just made in Cincinnati.
It was important, of course, because Mr Bush signalled the American administration's wish, if possible, to work through the UN framework to tackle the threats posed by the Iraqi regime.
From all corners of the globe, leaders of the world welcomed the US decision, and virtually everyone has put strong pressure on Iraq to comply with UN Resolutions.
Of particular relevance was the extent of the renewed diplomatic efforts of the Arab world to press Iraq to allow the resumption of the inspections.
These growing pressures have clearly helped drive Saddam to offer the return of the inspectors, even if his offer needs to be treated with a good deal of scepticism.
We have been here with Saddam Hussein before, watching him in due course resile from promises made and commitments given, behind a smoke-screen of ifs, buts and maybes.
The European Union has warmly welcomed President Bush's decision to deal with Iraq through the UN system.
As a Union, we believe this is by far the best and incomparably the most effective way to take things forward.
There is no real alternative to the UN system of values and international rules that was set in place and agreed by world leaders to preserve global security.
It offers the best hope of avoiding the potentially disastrous consequences of a spread of unilateral actions allegedly to 'solve' regional disputes.
Working through the UN confers legitimacy and a sense of moral consensus on the actions that it is sometimes necessary to take.
Also in the last couple of weeks, one of the EU Member States - the one as we say coyly that I know best - has made public a detailed assessment of Iraq's possession of chemical, biological and, possibly, nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.
This report has shown the risks that these weapons pose to regional stability in the Middle East.
A number of eminent institutes have also shared their assessments of the threats to global security posed by the Iraqi regime.
They all agree on Saddam's attempts to rebuild his capabilities in weapons of mass destruction, taking advantage of the absence of the inspectors over the last four years.
I would like to point out, incidentally, that these inspectors had previously done a better job than they are sometimes given credit for.
There may be room for debate about how imminent a danger is posed by this armoury of lethal weapons, but I do not detect any serious dispute about its existence.
Currently, discussions are taking place with and between EU Member States on the terms of a new UN Security Council Resolution designed to pave the way for a completely unconditional return of UN inspectors to Iraq.
As honourable Members well know, there are various options under consideration, some of them at the instigation of Member States.
As the Presidency made clear, European Ministers last discussed the situation of Iraq on Monday 31 September at the General Affairs Council.
They reiterated the position set out one month earlier in Elsinore, including the overall aim of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the need for the unconditional return of UN inspectors with unfettered access to every part of Iraq, and the need for the situation to continue to be addressed along the UN Security Council track.
Against this background of intensified international diplomacy, I believe - and I hope the Parliament shares this view with me - that the following considerations should be uppermost in everybody's minds:
First, over recent weeks, leaders around the world have continued to repeat their calls for a multilateral response to the challenge posed by Iraq.
They have clearly argued that the alternative of a unilateral response would be very unwise.
And it is not just world leaders; our citizens clearly believe strongly that this is the right way to solve the problem of Iraq.
Recent polls in Europe and the US, as well as public demonstrations, show that citizens would like any decision on Iraq to be taken within the framework of the United Nations system.
Second, the main reasoning behind any UN intervention is the perception that the international community is confronted with the possession of weapons of mass destruction by a dangerous regime.
There is a genuine and justified worry about both use and proliferation.
In addition it has been suggested that these weapons could be supplied to terrorist networks, though some notable public figures, for example Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor to President Bush Senior, have expressed scepticism on this point.
Others still have argued that there may be some links between Iraq and terrorist organisations with global links such as Al-Qa'ida.
I am not aware of any convincing public evidence on this point, but perhaps I have overlooked something.
The resort to the pre-emptive use of force is not a new idea.
The international community for example decided to intervene in Kosovo on humanitarian grounds.
The concept of humanitarian interventions was supported by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in an outstanding speech three years ago.
Through the action in Kosovo, the international community made clear that it was no longer possible for world leaders to hide behind the concept of national sovereignty to do whatever they wished within their own borders.
It was recognised that people too have rights, not just the states in which they live.
That seems to me to be a welcome advance.
However, what is clear from the debates going on around the world is that we need to develop some kind of framework of international law to address such circumstances.
Iraq cannot be seen in isolation from other equally sensitive cases.
Should we not look at the principles to guide our international action and identify the circumstances that may justify international intervention when there is a clear and present danger, either within a sovereign state or outside its borders?
The view of international law that has more or less prevailed since the Treaty of Westphalia - as students of the work of Dr Kissinger will know - is no longer wholly valid.
But I find it difficult to believe that any acceptable alternative view should not rest principally on UN mechanisms and procedures.
Third, I am sure that those who are considering the need for a new resolution will be taking into account all options and scenarios.
The international community needs to address how to frame a UN Security Council resolution or resolutions on Iraq.
But they also need to think about what to do in case of non-compliance.
This is a general issue of the utmost importance since it is related to the credibility of the multilateral system.
We need to preserve the authority of the UN and the Security Council whose resolutions we have seen defied again and again.
In this case, it is defiance by Iraq, but there are others in a similar situation of non-compliance.
We have now reached the point when such lack of compliance with UN decisions needs to be addressed in an objective, serious and coherent manner.
I hope that as events unfold in the coming months, we see a re-assertion of the authority of the UN with beneficial effects for Iraq, for its region and indeed for the whole world.
We may then, in addition, be able to focus our efforts more constructively on the continuing bloody crisis in the Middle East.
I cannot say that I find any alternative outlook anything other than profoundly disturbing.
President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened extremely carefully to the statements by the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten and I would like to point out one thing, as a preface to the speech I am going to make, and that is that, regardless of whether or not Saddam Hussein's regime has weapons of mass destruction, I would like to express my conviction that this regime is a danger to international peace and security, and this is no fantasy, as demonstrated by the invasion of Kuwait and the repeated and defiant violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
This does not mean, of course, that the European Union and the international community must react in an unmeasured and disproportionate way.
I believe that we must be very careful in seeking a response, since it is clear that any response of the international community, supported by the European Union, could have repercussions for relations with the Arab world and also, as Mr Patten said, very clear and direct repercussions in terms of the conflict in the Middle East.
Mr President, the initiatives I would suggest on behalf of my political group clearly follow the line put forward by Mr Patten.
Obviously, for a system of values such as that of the European Union, which enshrines peace, understanding, harmony and solidarity, force should be the last resort.
In this regard, we must of course exhaust all political, diplomatic and commercial avenues; but we must also, Mr President, guarantee free access, unrestricted and unconditional, for the United Nations inspectors, so that they can fulfil their mission of verifying whether or not there are weapons of mass destruction.
And it is also clear that we must take account of the need and the determination of the international community so that, in the event of non-compliance with these United Nations resolutions, the international community and the United Nations itself can respond appropriately to verify and demand compliance with those resolutions.
This issue of legitimacy, or the need for the legitimacy of a ratification by the United Nations Security Council, for taking military action, is precisely one of the issues we debated yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs when we voted on a resolution on terrorism.
And it was very interesting because, during the vote, Mr Robinson, the Secretary-General of NATO, appeared, and in response to the question of whether it was necessary to have the backing of the United Nations for action by his organisation, he told us that, while it was desirable, he believed that a mandate from the Atlantic Council was sufficient to be able to act within NATO.
This debate, Mr President, is not trivial, because there may come a time, when the European Union's rapid reaction force is ready for operation, when we have to seek the backing of the United Nations so that that force can carry out a Petersburg task, and it is possible that a member of the Security Council with the right to vote may put a stop to any action of the European Union's rapid reaction force.
I wanted to point out this debate, because it seems to me appropriate at the moment, especially in light of the events of September 11, and it is clear that we have to make progress in a whole series of areas relating to the security and defence policy.
We must assess the compatibility of the European Union's rapid reaction force with the initiative of the United States to create a rapid reaction force within NATO; we must consider the extent to which we can make the use of NATO's infrastructure compatible in relation to the European Union's actions in the field of defence; we must preserve the European Union's capacity for autonomous decision-making in the field of defence and we must resolve the problem of military expenditure, or to put it another way, we must decide, on the basis of the facts, whether we want to spend more or spend better.
Mr President, these issues are very relevant in the current context.
The events of 11 September demand a response from the international community because, in the face of the threats and problems of international terrorism, we must all respond together, and within the European Union, we must offer a single response.
I believe that the best contribution the European Union could make to the system and the principles of the United Nations is to respond cohesively within the international organisations, because the strength of the European Union lies in its unity, but fragmented we are weak.
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are issues relating to the current situation in Iraq which are uncontentious, which we all share and where we have a broad consensus.
The first is that Iraq must comply with all the UN Security Council's resolutions in full and without any ifs, buts or maybes.
I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for saying that it is not only Iraq which should do so, but we are talking about Iraq here today.
Secondly, we all agree that the weapons inspectors must return to Iraq and that they must have unfettered access to be able to do their job properly.
In particular, they must search for, and then destroy, weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems.
I am most grateful to you, Commissioner, for making a further point on this consensus, and I am especially gratified that you did so by pointing out that the response to this situation, to the problem of Iraq, should be sought multilaterally and through the United Nations framework.
That is the opportunity for us genuinely to resolve this problem once and for all.
There are other issues where we do not have this consensus.
They include, for example, the question whether the weapons inspectors who now have a mandate to go to Iraq must wait until the Security Council adopts a new resolution.
I think that a definition of their mandate by the UN Secretary-General would suffice.
If it is indeed the case that a major threat emanates from Iraq, then it is logical, after all, to ensure that these inspectors go to Iraq as soon as possible.
At the same time, the UN Secretary-General must look at the issue of the embargo.
While the inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, conditions must be re-established for the embargo to be abolished entirely, and for the embargo to be ended.
I think this is axiomatic, but I would like to reiterate and underline this point here once again.
While the weapons inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, the bombing campaign by the US and the United Kingdom, which is not based on any UN resolution, cannot continue.
It should be suspended - I am phrasing this carefully - until we have the inspectors' report.
Finally, the UN should prepare a roadmap for the destruction of weapons and for the inspections, and a roadmap for the embargo and for Iraq's reintegration into the international community.
This would be an important step which could be initiated by the UN.
In the context of the UN, let me say that if we opt for the UN, we cannot have a UN Ã  la carte. In other words, we cannot comply with the resolutions which suit us and ignore the ones that do not!
We must be very clear about this, and I am in favour of our respecting and implementing all the UN resolutions accordingly.
Mr President, we know that one reason for military intervention is the search for weapons of mass destruction, but there are, of course, other reasons.
Parliament's resolution of May 2002 made a proposal which still has not been taken up.
It suggested that an international ad-hoc tribunal be set up to try Saddam Hussein and his officials, and that the Commission should set up an office of human rights to collect the evidence.
There are, of course, different reasons for intervening: humanitarian interventions, self-defence, Article 51, as was used in Afghanistan, and now a new proposal of anticipatory self-defence - the so-called pre-emptive strike - discussed by President Bush for regime change.
Even the 'bullet in the head' option has been discussed.
But this Parliament, surely, should have one thing in mind: the people of Iraq.
Here I call for a prosecution of Saddam Hussein and his officials under the 1948 Genocide Convention.
This is a crime against humanity of such a scale that it can never be forgiven and we must invoke justice and the rule of law.
The Genocide Convention to which we and all our allies are parties imposes a duty upon us to punish all acts of genocide ordered by constitutionally-responsible rulers.
It expressly envisages that an international court may be established for that purpose, preferably in the territory in which the crimes were committed and if not, elsewhere.
In this way all perpetrators may be tried by such international panel tribunals which may have jurisdiction with respect to those contracting parties which have accepted its jurisdiction.
The Nuremberg precedent reminds us that a torturer is a torturer even if you are in a uniform and you have accepted an order to torture one of your fellow men or women.
In other words, being an official does not exempt you from prosecution.
This means that we have an absolute duty to look not just at Saddam Hussein but at all of those officials.
What are Saddam Hussein's genocidal acts?
In the past, we have seen the use of chemical weapons in the north, the decimation of the gypsies, the persecution of Jews, the Assyrian Christians, over three-quarters of a million displaced people, assaults on Shia Muslims and those of Iranian descent.
Thirty years of murderous assault and still he goes after the remnants of those unfortunate people.
Genocide now concerns the marsh Arabs: over half a million people destroyed in the last few years.
They have lost their place, the people, the fish, the animals, the water, the land, their homes, their farms, villages, towns, boats and agriculture through killing, burning and draining.
We have seen the total destruction of a unique, distinctively different and ancient tribal people.
That is genocide.
A UN resolution is required but we need the evidence to be brought up front, in front of the peoples of the world, to alter the perception of why this course of action is required.
The establishment of the Office of Human Rights was accepted in principle by Commissioner Patten at our debate in May 2002.
I urge him to set up this office without delay - we have already lost too much time.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, President-in-Office of the Council, as we speak, there is reason to hope that the new war with Iraq will not take place.
It is not absurd to imagine that the resolution currently in the process of being adopted by the United Nations Security Council could finally be drawn up to encourage disarmament in Iraq rather than to legitimise a military intervention there.
That would be a great victory of wisdom over irresponsibility, but there is still a long way to go.
And can we do anything, while the decision is that of the member countries of the Security Council?
I am sure that we can, as it is clear that the requirements of our societies and the political initiatives taken by various States have greatly influenced the development of the positions of the main Heads of State, starting with George Bush himself.
His goal was to change the regime in Baghdad.
Apparently today the international community has only one possible objective, the disarmament of Iraq.
He ordered the UN to either be on the side of the US or to stay on the sidelines.
He nevertheless seems to understand that the framework of the United Nations is difficult to circumvent.
He had put forward a theory of pre-emptive war.
He now stresses that military action is not necessarily imminent or inevitable.
Nobody is fooled.
The American President has not given up any of his plans, but he is perhaps beginning to realise that international political life is not a western in which he can play the role of sheriff.
I believe it is time to promote the mission of disarmament inspectors as an alternative solution to war.
It was these inspectors who, until 1998, prevented Saddam Hussein from acquiring the atomic bomb and who destroyed stocks of chemical and biological weapons and their means of manufacture, military research installations, missiles and launch pads.
Today, they say, their experience is greater still and their equipment more sophisticated.
They are ready to start work again immediately.
One of them, however, the American Scott Ritter, opportunely suggests that, upon their return, the embargo should be lifted. This mercilessly cruel burden was imposed twelve years ago on the population.
My group, in conjunction with others, is going to take initiatives in this spirit, which you are all welcome to join.
Furthermore, my group would consider highly useful a further declaration by the Council and the Commission on the new strategic doctrine published by the Bush administration on 20 September.
I find it inconceivable that the European Union is silent on this text which magnifies what is described as the unparalleled force of the United States and emphasises their determination, to paraphrase, to act alone, if necessary as a pre-emptive measure, to extend the triumph of freedom.
We cannot remain inactive in the face of the official confirmation of a doctrine which would undoubtedly lead to war in Iraq and which would lead to nothing less than the destruction of the collective security system set up around the Charter of the United Nations following the victory of democracies over Nazism.
Lastly, we are still waiting for the beginning of the first stages of the implementation of the last parliamentary resolution on the Middle East.
While George Bush draws the world's attention to Baghdad, however, his protÃ©gÃ©, who, not long ago, he classed as a man of peace even though he is violating all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning his country, is attacking the Palestinians with indescribable cruelty, thereby exposing his own people to a new infernal cycle of vengeance and hatred.
Europe still needs to prove itself on all these points which, in fact, form a whole.
The status of world player cannot be decreed; it must be earned.
Mr President, the problem with the American threats of war against Iraq is not the desire in itself to replace an undemocratic regime.
Saddam Hussein's regime is indeed repugnant: I have been able to see this for myself in the course of a number of visits; and it has only got worse.
We should certainly support the democratic opposition and we can by all means try economic boycotts, as we did against the South Africa of apartheid, provided that this does not hit the victims more than the offenders, which is the case in Iraq.
From time to time, we can even support an armed national struggle for liberation against a dictator, as many of us did against the European colonial powers in Africa.
If anarchy is to be avoided, however, all outside interventions in the affairs of a sovereign state must be based on an egalitarian, global world order, which applies equally to all nations.
That is why the UN Security Council must make a resolution on any armed campaign.
In addition, military force must only be resorted to if all non-violent means have been exhausted.
The weapons inspectors must therefore be sent back into Iraq as soon as possible, and the American threats of a military strike without a UN Security Council resolution must be condemned.
Otherwise, we are just legitimising lawless Wild-West violence in other parts of the world, for example Israel's massacre of Palestinians or perhaps Russian interventions in Georgia.
If the EU is to be able to bear out its claims to represent a judicial culture in contrast to American lynch law, it must now with renewed vigour, and especially where Iraq is concerned, oppose the global dictatorship of the USA and insist on a global legal system within the framework of the UN.
Mr President, the debate on Iraq you provided us with last month in Strasbourg made us fear the worst, namely war.
All the speakers involved in today's debate, as a whole, have the merit of taking into consideration the developments of Iraqi positions over the past few weeks and resistance within the UN itself to US unilateralism, as well as to the excesses of the Bush administration.
As Europeans, we cannot agree to or allow others to bombard this complicated region with simple, I would even go so far as to say simplistic, ideas, which are those of the Bush dynasty, whether of the father, who admitted on television that he hates Saddam Hussein, or of the son, who justifies his obsession with Saddam Hussein with these ridiculous words: 'the guy ? tried to kill my father'.
These statements could be laughable were it not for the fact that a war in Iraq would have a cost, in terms of human lives, obviously, both in the Iraqi camp and in that of the allied armies, and at this point I would like to thank the speaker from the PSE Group for recalling or re-launching the debate on the subject of lifting the embargo for the Iraqi civilians who have already been suffering for eleven years.
This cost, moreover, would be incalculable in terms of the instability created by a military intervention in the region, and would also be irreversible for international law, and we therefore feel that, at the end of the day, it is in relation to the Iraqi crisis that UN credibility is at stake.
That is why, above and beyond the moral considerations, we cannot lose sight of these few factors.
After a year in which the United States have not made any bones about comparing Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden, we still have no proof that Iraq was involved in the September 11 attacks and the broader Al Qaida organisation.
Similarly, we still have no proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq today, notwithstanding the impassioned assertions of Tony Blair.
The only certainty so far is that, to the United States, Iraq and the Iraqi regime are a setback on the road to oil.
This much is clear.
At this point, however, we are a long way from the objectives assigned to the international coalition that Europe joined just one year ago and the countries of Europe must now ally themselves with the United States so that together we can fight the only real, immediate threat to the world, the broader Al Qaida organisation.
We could not seriously, however, tell the world today that tomorrow we will be able to capture Mullah Omar or Osama Bin Laden on Babylonian soil.
Mr President, the European Union is an observer rather than an active player in the events currently taking place, and it may be because we are speaking as observers that, in many of our speeches, we are getting the facts all wrong, congratulating ourselves on what will probably be avoided - military attacks on Iraq.
We should instead ask ourselves what we have done, what we ourselves have managed to do, as the European Union, to bring about a situation in which it will be possible to achieve that which we all hope for, to reach a point where military attacks are not necessary and the inspectors have full access to the Iraqi sites.
It is my view that we have done nothing and that, if the situation we are observing has now improved, this may be partly, principally or wholly due to pressure from the United States and the ways in which that pressure has been exerted.
Well then, it may be that what we have to do is endeavour to cast off our role of observer: we must do everything we can to avoid military action rather than just sitting here watching others make mistakes, running the risk, once again, that Europe will become not the Europe of Churchill but the Europe of Chamberlain, the risk that we will find ourselves once again in a position of impotence and inertia where we lack institutional and even maybe military resources and instruments and are thus unable to take any action.
Do we want to develop alternatives to weapons, violence and destruction?
Then let us make a start!
We must explore the possibilities provided under international law for raising awareness and providing information, for defeating a regime which is waging a constant, daily war against its own people, a war which is constantly causing deaths in Iraq and which is a danger to the international community.
We must see what we ourselves, as the European Union, can do rather than sitting here applauding or criticising the actions of those who do, at least, have the courage to shoulder responsibilities.
Mr President, I wish to address myself in particular to the Danish Presidency, the Minister for European Affairs, Mr Haarder, and the External Relations Commissioner, Mr Patten.
These are two people in whom I have the utmost confidence.
In my opinion, there are three main questions which we, as Europeans and democrats, must answer.
The first concerns how to prevent weapons of mass destruction being produced, distributed, sold to international terrorists and used in Europe, the Middle East and throughout the world.
How are we to prevent this?
The second question concerns the UN Security Council.
There are many powerful forces at work here in the European Parliament looking to restrict the veto as far as possible.
Faced with the prospect of an enlarged EU with 25 Member States, a large majority in this Parliament is saying that we shall be unable to make decisions unless the veto is abolished.
At the same time, we find ourselves in a situation in which a Communist government in Beijing in China, whose record on human rights does it little credit, actually has an unlimited right of veto when it comes to the international community's most important bodies, the UN and the UN Security Council, and the ways in which they are to act to prevent violence and preserve world peace.
This same right is enjoyed by Moscow, Paris, London and Washington.
The third question concerns how we are to be able to bring about a change in the Middle East.
The Middle East can be depicted as a pressure cooker, in which the water is bubbling and seething.
The lid is still on the pan, but the moment when all the steam could escape is imminent.
There are many people in this Parliament who consider that military action against Iraq would lead to the whole of the Middle East being plunged into horrors and into complete disaster.
Is, however, a conservative policy, in which everything is allowed to continue as before - with UN inspectors degraded and humiliated and unable to do their jobs, while Saddam Hussein, the dictator and mass murderer who had five thousand Kurds gassed in Halabja, remains in power in Baghdad - a route that will lead to democracy and human rights in Iraq and the Middle East?
Has not the time come for us in Europe to take responsibility for beginning a process of change in favour of democracy and human rights and against the spread of weapons of terror from the region in question?
What would be your answers to these questions?
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has referred to the dossier that was produced by the United Kingdom Government prior to the debate in the House of Commons.
That dossier makes for some interesting reading.
The most significant thing I found in it was a picture of the footprint of one of Saddam Hussein's palaces.
Superimposed on this was a footprint of Buckingham Palace.
Buckingham Palace was a minute corner of whole footprint of Saddam Hussein's palaces.
This is quite important because it is said that Saddam Hussein does not want anyone to go into his palaces.
Well, none of us want people coming into our houses.
We do not realise that these palaces are basically cities in their own right and that is why all aspects of the UN inspectors' mandate must be adhered to.
They must be able to go anywhere because palaces the size that he has, and he has quite a few, have the capacity to conceal major weapon sites.
We must be clear that there should be no interference with the ability of the inspectors to go in.
We know Saddam Hussein is a threat to the region and to his own people, but we know that for the interests of world peace we must act through the United Nations.
This must not be unilateral action.
UN resolutions, however, must clearly hold Iraq to account and there must be a willingness to follow through with action.
It is not enough to threaten.
We must be prepared to follow through with that threat if everything else fails.
We must keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein.
We must continue to enforce a no-fly zone, including giving the pilots the right to self-defence.
If the UN sees this through, we will change international politics.
There will be a whole new environment pushing towards multilateral action.
If the UN is not capable of seeing this through, the whole multilateral element of international politics would be discredited and the world would become a much more dangerous place.
Mr President, I have now been told several times that the EU wishes to go down the UN route, and I should therefore like to ask where that route is heading and for how long it is intended to follow it.
We are agreed that Iraq must, as Mr Patten said, comply, like everyone else, with UN resolutions.
Must not, however, the EU and the United States also comply with international law?
Can we, on the one hand, demand that a country comply with UN resolutions and, on the other hand, accept actions that are not approved under this legal system?
In short, I do not have a clear answer to that question.
Will the EU demand a UN mandate from the UN Security Council before it supports possible action against Iraq?
What, moreover, will happen if the weapons inspectors really and truly do not find anything?
There has not of course been a shred of proof anywhere that weapons of mass destruction exist.
If the inspectors really do not find anything, will the EU, then, work towards having the embargo lifted?
We know that the oil for food programme means that the Iraqi people are being kept on the verge of starvation.
A host of false rumours is being spread as to how much money is coming in, but the calculations made on the basis of the actual figures show that every penny is going into the oil for food programme and that that is not enough.
It will not do anything to take the Iraqi people off the breadline.
The programme has managed to eradicate the Iraqi middle class and is responsible for Iraq's not having been in a position to repair its water supply, resulting in a steep increase in infant mortality.
Will the EU make efforts to have the embargo lifted and will it, in that connection, remember Iraqi Kurdistan?
Will it remember that there is a people in the northern part of Iraq that will be vulnerable as soon as Saddam Hussein has the opportunity to express his anger?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many people have spoken out against a war in Iraq, the United States are continuing their threats with new demands, on the pretext of combating terrorism.
Calls for American national unity have not been able to mask the social and economic difficulties there, its crisis of political confidence and its restrictions of democratic freedom, which are condemned by many American citizens.
We are all aware, beyond the undeniable arguments concerning the reality of Saddam Hussein's power, supported thus far by Westerners, that one of the main targets of this war is oil.
Such a war would also allow other objectives to be targeted, such as strengthening the direct hold over oil and gas resources in the Middle East, in order to kick-start growth in the United States, strike a blow to OPEC, one of Washington's pet hates, and weaken the Arab world, depriving it of any possible political opposition force.
Furthermore, we cannot ignore the matter of the current context of the whole region.
This war can only destroy the United Nations' efforts to consolidate international law in favour of fair, lasting peace.
We know it will have further tragic consequences for the Palestinian people.
This is borne out by Ariel Sharon's stated support for Bush, for whom the international situation represents an opportunity to strike further blows against the Palestinian resistance.
Moreover, commencing military action in this region will set the Arab world ablaze, plunge the people into decades of poverty, and send weakened political regimes into the arms of fundamentalism.
Do not think that our continent will be spared by this war.
Europe will be the first target for terrorism and will be a breeding ground for tension, and racism and islamophobia will only increase.
It is not too late to prevent this war.
To do so, people everywhere, as widely as possible, must express their rejection of the US unilateral policy and it is time for the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities, and forcefully and vigorously restate its commitment to peace, the reason for its construction.
Mr President, two minutes, six points.
First of all, Saddam Hussein is already a hardened war criminal.
He clearly intends to continue.
The only remaining doubt concerns the means still available to him.
Secondly, no situation, however serious, justifies contravening the fundamental principle of public and private morality, in other words, we must not use means that jeopardise the achievement of the objective we are pursuing.
Our objective here is to build peace, to refuse pre-emptive war in favour of negotiations, weapons inspections and the establishment of the Rule of Law.
Thirdly, I have rarely seen situations in which so little attention is paid to the study of what could occur should force be used.
We are only discussing the legitimacy of the decision and decision-taking procedures.
We are not considering what this could lead to.
Mr President, Europe already has a Military Staff.
We are preparing a rapid-reaction force.
We should at least ask it to consider the various possible consequences.
Quite frankly, I have never seen such a lack of reflection.
Fourthly, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe needs a strong, clear, public position, and is capable of this.
Many of us have asked you to communicate the European Union's position in writing to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and make it public.
Fifthly, the main thing in this matter is to adhere to the UN rules on two counts.
The first is to convince the United Nations not to change the rules once the game has begun.
This is also part of behaving with common decency at an international level.
The second aspect proposes solving the problem in two stages: first, with regard to inspectors and their right of work, and second, lastly, taking account of what would happen should Saddam refuse, in other words the use of Chapter 7 of the Charter.
We are not pacifists.
I believe it is possible to have recourse to force. Saddam Hussein is dangerous, but it is the legality of this operation that is key, in particular with regard to the world as a whole.
Lastly, Mr President, all this is not at all anti-American.
On the contrary, it involves preserving the Rule of Law with the agreement of an overwhelming majority - as shown by surveys - of the American people today, in order to prevent a government, intoxicated by its own strength, from forgetting the law when it thinks of the power it could use.
Mr President, Commissioner, the international community considered that the Iraqi regime, which was responsible for two wars, against Iran and then Kuwait, constituted a permanent potential threat to the security of its neighbours.
That is why the Security Council drew up a strategy to cut off Iraq in order to prevent it from equipping itself with weapons of mass destruction, which, up until 1998, was effective.
The question the United States is asking today concerns abandoning this strategy in favour of the far more radical strategy of waging a pre-emptive war against Iraq, before Iraq equips itself with the decisive means for blackmail.
What must our position be should this extreme situation arise?
First and foremost, it must involve restating that waging a war against Iraq would be the sole decision of the Security Council.
The United Nations system is a guarantee of peace, and weakening this system is in nobody's interests.
We must not repeat the serious error that was made against international order in waging war against Yugoslavia without the backing of the Security Council.
Unilaterally waging a pre-emptive war against a sovereign State would set an extremely dangerous precedent that could be invoked in future by any country in order to try to solve its problems, for example India or Pakistan with regard to Kashmir.
Secondly, we must state that such a war could only be decided upon should Iraq refuse to implement the resolutions of the Security Council.
The mandate given to the inspectors must therefore leave no room for ambiguity, but we must not speculate in advance over the failure of the inspections.
That would amount to denying the remarkably efficient work carried out by inspectors from the United Nations and the IAEA between 1991 and 1998 and to renouncing any future disarmament control missions.
What is despicable is the inertia of the international community in allowing a black hole of four years to follow the expulsion of inspectors from Iraq, thus enabling Iraq to increase its capability.
Naturally, the Security Council, in order to be effective, must not automatically exclude any hypotheses.
Automatically excluding the use of force under any circumstances, as suggested, for example, by the German Government, would weaken the position of the international community.
Lastly, we must at all costs prevent inappropriate action in Iraq from making the international fight against Islamic terrorism more difficult, as this is a priority.
Waging a pre-emptive war, however, without Iraq having refused to apply the resolutions of the Security Council, could doubly compromise the essential objective of dismantling the Islamic terrorist networks.
Such action could in fact, as emphasised yesterday by Philippe de Villiers at the French National Assembly, cause a sudden resurgence of Islamic extremism and the collapse of the international coalition constituted after September 11.
Mr President, for several months now, there has been a real commotion among the Western countries with regard to Iraq.
The inspections stopped in 1998 and President Bush discovered in 2002 that Iraq was once again a threat.
This is a serious matter, as, through the Iraqi affair, the US has in fact tried to gain support for a new concept in international relations, the concept of pre-emptive war.
They have asked that UN inspectors be allowed to return unconditionally to Iraq.
The Iraqi Government agreed to this.
Now, it is the United States that will not agree to the UN inspectors going to Iraq.
They now want to adopt a resolution that would allow them automatic recourse to force.
President Bush's speech yesterday did not go back on this condition in any way.
He maintains this condition.
In reality, the United States covet Iraqi oil resources, control of which would allow them to dictate price policies to the rest of the world.
Beware!
The fight against terrorism, after the savage attacks of September 11, must not, in the hands of the American Government, become an imperial strategy to conquer the world.
A military intervention against Iraq would have terrifying consequences today in the Middle East.
It would unleash all kinds of fanaticism and discrimination against ethnic minorities.
It would encourage a surge in Islamic fundamentalism.
A war against Iraq - and we must realise this today - a war against Iraq would be considered by Arab-Muslim public opinion as a war against the entire Arab-Muslim world.
That is why, today, no Arab regime supports Washington's position.
Two countries have stated their opposition to this strategy: France and Germany.
Well, I consider that to be an honour for Europe.
If a new resolution had to be adopted, under no circumstances must it include the principle of automatic recourse to force.
We must not accept the use of the Security Council as an instrument.
I would also like to ask Mr Patten and Mr Haarder a question: why do the European Union and the Commission not suggest to the Arab League, to all the Arab countries, that they take a common initiative to reintegrate Iraq and lift the embargo?
That is the best way of fighting for the renaissance of democracy in Iraq.
Mr President, no one is in any doubt that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator.
That is not sufficient justification for launching a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.
If it were, we would be attacking many countries around the world.
We need to be clear that the motivating force for this war is primarily about trying to ensure secure access to oil.
President Bush cannot, of course, admit this.
Instead, we are told we must go to war in order to destroy Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.
Let us be clear about this, our moral authority might be a little stronger if we did not also have weapons of mass destruction.
I also want to talk about the United Nations.
Commissioner Patten said that working with the UN confers legitimacy.
I agree it is a step towards legitimacy. It is a necessary but insufficient requirement for any action because the UN process is itself highly imperfect.
In order to get agreement from the UN Security Council for the first Gulf war, the US used bribery, blackmail and threats and they will do it again.
The resolution which the US is currently trying to get through the Security Council is not designed to avert war but rather to provoke war.
Leaked drafts resemble nothing so much as a plan for unopposed invasion.
A just war to the extent that any such thing might be claimed to exist can only be pursued when all peaceful means have been exhausted.
In this case, peaceful means are not only unexhausted, they are being deliberately avoided.
Mr President, following Mr Souchet's superb speech, I would simply, in one minute, like to call for two things.
First of all, we must scrupulously follow the United Nations' procedures in demanding the disarmament of Iraq.
Saddam Hussein is a bloodthirsty dictator, a real threat to peace.
We must not allow our procedure to provide him with the slightest loophole which he would of course use to portray himself as a victim to try to side-track the debate.
Yet at the same time, we ourselves must not stray into secondary details.
We must keep the compass firmly at north.
We must stop this regime from doing harm and in particular from using weapons of mass destruction.
That is a condition of peace, at least in the region concerned.
Consequently, let us not be caught up in speeches which reverse the responsibilities, which almost try to make Saddam Hussein into a persecuted innocent party, which in fact are just speeches of refusal to take responsibility in the face of threats.
Mr President, after September 11, a broad international coalition was formed to combat terrorism.
This battle is still taking place here in Europe.
Al Qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries.
After 30 January this year, President Bush's speech on the state of the Union disconcerted many Europeans.
The countries described as 'the axis of evil' no longer had anything to do with international terrorism.
Fortunately, at the time, Commissioner Patten spoke out, clearly distancing himself from the unilateral, over-simplistic American policy.
The US is now trying to impose a concept of pre-emptive war against Iraq which falls outside the scope of international law.
In today's speech by the American Government, it was no longer possible to dissociate concerns about oil from legitimate concern over weapons of mass destruction, equally legitimate concerns over human rights and Saddam Hussein himself as a person, whom Mr Bush professes to hate.
We should not adopt this mixed bag as our own approach, since the various factors need to be addressed separately.
Europe has always backed the United Nations Security Council.
For the past few months, however, we have witnessed a veritable bid, instigated by the United States, to take control of international law - a policy of double standards. In some cases violations of human rights and United Nations Security Council resolutions are flouted and go unpunished, while in others they are not.
We are also witnessing major internal division within the European Union and preparation for a war that would constitute a real confrontation between civilisations and would undoubtedly strengthen the terrorism we are trying to fight.
In this strong-arm contest, this race against time, it is the credibility of the UN and Europe that is at stake.
One thing is certain, if there is military intervention in Iraq, the Iraqi people, who have already suffered so much, will defend themselves to the last and we will not enter Baghdad as liberators.
Mr President, it would be a grave misconception to look at the imminent attack on the Iraqi state as a new state of affairs.
We all know that the attacks on Iraq are already underway on a massive scale in the no-fly zones in the country.
I do not know under which international agreements they have been allowed to continue, but such attacks have only intensified and worsened the situation in the country.
However we view, as a Parliament, the proposed attack on Saddam Hussein, we cannot look at it in isolation.
The attack would be seen, along with the incursions against Palestine, as an attack on the Arab world itself.
It would, along with the threat to oil supplies, globalise an already-escalating conflict.
We condemn Saddam Hussein unreservedly for his regime which oppresses minorities and offends democracy in Iraq.
A more sensible and productive international approach, however, would be to defend and ensure self-determination for all minorities in Iraq, especially the five million Kurds in the north of the country comprising one quarter of the Iraqi population.
Human rights and freedom in Iraq would be better served were we to take that course of action, uniting minorities and the international community behind a common front to topple Saddam and all other world dictators.
Mr President, a variety of things have been said. For my part, I have a number of questions to put to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council, for it would appear that, once again, Europe and the European governments are very divided, and that is not good.
Moreover, despite the endeavours of the Presidency, we see the range of positions of the European governments described in the press every day.
My question is this: since France is part of the Security Council - and it is the only European country to be part of it - is there any form of coordination between the other European governments in respect of the French position?
What will a second resolution add to the agreements which have already been adopted regarding the sending of inspectors to Vienna?
Thirdly, the citizens of our countries are asking a lot of questions, ladies and gentlemen, including on the subject of the embargo.
The public is wondering, in good faith, how it is possible that, in ten years of embargo inflicted upon the civilian population, the dictator, Saddam Hussein, has been able to rebuild his military and even his nuclear arsenal.
Given that this has been possible, I believe we should open a UN investigation to find out who has broken the arms embargo that has caused the Iraqi people such great suffering.
If it has been broken by members of the Security Council, then, clearly, the Security Council will also lose its credibility.
I therefore feel that we must be quite consistent in our actions; we must find the best way to achieve the greatest success without, indeed, causing further suffering or further deterioration of international relations.
This is Europe's role in my view but, once again, this time we have failed to realise it.
Lastly, I feel that Europe must address the issue of combating terrorism and producing legal instruments for prosecuting terrorists, acting with complete honesty towards both the United States and the authoritarian regimes.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten is right when he says that the situation, while still very complex and difficult, has developed over recent days towards a more articulate context, in which the process has matured noticeably and public opinion has moved on, especially United States public opinion.
President Bush has said that the vote for a resolution in Congress does not mean that military action is imminent or inevitable, and British Foreign Minister Straw, at the Security Council negotiations, has said that 'we prefer one resolution but we have never ruled out, and nor do we rule out, there being two'.
Also important is the statement by Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei, who lead the United Nations inspection teams, pointing out that the provisions accepted by the Iraqis last week in Vienna are, in their judgment, sufficient for them to work effectively on the inspection tasks.
I believe that in this critical situation, the fundamental issues have been raised recently by an American citizen who is no ordinary American citizen: he won the recent presidential elections in terms of votes; I am referring to Mr Al Gore, who has pointed out something obvious: that the essential and urgent issue at the moment is the fight against terrorism and in particular against those who carried out the attacks of 11 September.
In this regard, Gore criticised President Bush for having squandered - to quote literally - the extraordinary response of sympathy, good will and solidarity which followed the attacks of 11 September which - he said - has been replaced by an atmosphere of fear and reticence towards the United States administration.
I believe that in this situation, which is developing in a relatively favourable manner, energetic and mature criteria must be applied in carrying out the war against terror, and this essentially requires that Europe apply two priorities: rapid convergence within the United Nations and its Security Council and, secondly, making every effort so that the future task of the inspectors may end in success.
Mr President, over the last few days the European Union has faced - indeed it is still facing - two crucial political questions which bear on its common foreign and security policy.
The question of the International Criminal Court on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity did not, I think, receive the best attentions of the Council of the European Union.
Now we have the crisis in Iraq, which really must be given the Council's best attentions.
And just what does that mean?
The UN and its decision-taking procedures have underpinned the international legal order for the last 50 or 60 years and have been used to resolve the most serious of political issues.
We must not rock this boat under any circumstances, because finding a new legal order to underpin international relations will not be an easy or straightforward matter.
This being so, when faced with varying opinions on how to deal with the problem of Iraq, the European Union must not under any circumstances go beyond the bounds set by UN Security Council resolutions.
Secondly, it must lay down limits, down to the last detail, on how far we can go in controlling Saddam Hussein's arsenal.
However, if it turns out that he has no weapons of mass destruction or the facilities to produce them, it must have a ready, unconditional answer to the question of the embargo, while monitoring developments to ensure that Saddam Hussein or anyone else in Iraq does not revert to procedures involving weapons of mass destruction.
Nonetheless, we must admit that, as the European Union, we ought to be independent when it comes to certain decisions with crucial international implications.
We cannot just fall in with whoever happens to be in power in America at the time, with the Clinton administration taking one tack and the Bush administration taking another.
And, the investigation to find out if Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction should extend to anyone who has provided materials or know-how.
They too must take their share of the blame.
Finally, let us not forget the millions who are suffering, let us not forget the children who are dying and let us not forget that we, the European Union, must not be inhumane.
Mr President, we are on the verge of war, a war which could have devastating consequences not just for the people of Iraq and for the Middle East as a whole but for the rest of the world as well.
Under these circumstances, sense and reason have to prevail over the simplistic venting of one's feelings.
Following the devastation of the Second World War, the nations of the world created the United Nations as the instrument which was to guarantee world peace, and, as Mr Patten says, there is no alternative to the UN when it comes to maintaining global security.
The nations came to an agreement under international law on the rules for military intervention in order to preserve world peace.
It is clear from these that decisions on such action must be taken by the UN Security Council.
To choose, like the USA and Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, to abide by UN resolutions only when it suits us would have devastating consequences for the whole international legal system.
It would amount to rejecting and deliberately opposing the UN.
Is this the legal system the conservatives stand for?
The justice of the powerful and international lawlessness?
Or should all countries have an equal right to take so-called preventive action?
What would happen then?
It stands to reason that Iraq must comply with UN resolutions and allow the inspectors to carry out their work without conditions.
An agreement has also been reached between Hans Blix and Iraq whereby the inspectors are to be allowed to resume the work which was in actual fact suspended when the USA and the UK started their last bombing campaign.
The inspectors should now be able to start their work immediately.
There is no excuse for dictator Saddam Hussein's breach of the UN resolutions.
Iraq, like all other countries, has to abide by the decisions taken by the UN.
Obviously, this also applies to Israel.
If the principle is that Iraq has not complied with UN resolutions and must therefore be bombed, what are we then to do about Israel, which continually breaches UN resolutions?
The EU has to make it clear to the world's largest democracy, the USA, that all countries must abide by international law and that the law of the street is not acceptable, even against dictators.
Mr President, I should like to summarise my answers in a few points which are not new but which it is important to put into words.
I should like to warn against trivialising the Iraq problem by comparing Iraq with various other countries.
Saddam Hussein is fortunately a very special case with a very distinctive history stretching back a long way.
Experience clearly shows that we shall not get anywhere with Saddam Hussein if the use of force is excluded in advance. Iraq must and shall comply with the demands made by the Security Council.
There must be unconditional access for the weapons inspectors, including access to Saddam Hussein's extensive palaces.
The EU will continue to support the efforts of the Security Council and campaign for a unified approach. That is important for the UN's and the Security Council's credibility and effectiveness, and it is important in relation both to Iraq and to future multilateral cooperation.
The EU therefore continues to support the Security Council's work along the lines of finding a peaceful solution, insofar as that is possible.
It is encouraging that the American President has recently said that war is not inevitable and that he wants to pursue the option of going down the UN route.
Turning finally to the lifting of the embargo, the oil for food programme has in fact been revised.
It is Saddam Hussein who has not so far made use of the opportunities it presents and, in that way, subjected his people to starvation.
That is because, in this matter too, he is completely indifferent to the conditions of ordinary people in Iraq.
He has other priorities.
If we are to encourage him to think about his own people and about peace in the region and in the world, we must take a united stand - in this Parliament too.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, firstly I congratulate the European Parliament for its stimulating and constructive resolution which was adopted on 25 September 2002.
It provides a useful assessment of successes and achievements as well as some of the weaknesses of the European Employment Strategy.
It is, of course, important that it identifies concrete priorities for the future.
The resolution was most valuable to the Council.
The discussions we had yesterday in Luxembourg concerned both the evaluation of the European Employment Strategy and the streamlining of processes in the context of the Lisbon agenda.
As the Minister said, there was a consensus between the Member States on the content and the procedures for the future.
I am pleased to say that there is now a large common platform of shared views between the three institutions upon which we can base the further development of the strategy and, in particular, define the next generation of employment guidelines.
I would like to concentrate on three main areas: policy messages, the process and governance of the process.
First, as far as the policy messages are concerned, we all agree that the integrated coverage of broad areas is one of the positive achievements of this strategy.
There is an agreement that there is a need to keep this wide range of issues within the strategy and not to narrow its scope.
Some progress has also been made on the identification of key priorities.
There is a long list of these, including job creation and increasing labour force participation; improving quality in work; modernising and improving the functioning of the labour market; ensuring flexibility and security; increasing labour force supply via policies promoting an inclusive labour market; promoting active and preventive labour market policies; reforming tax and benefit systems; improving lifelong learning skills and mobility and promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation.
Obviously the next step will consist of transforming this long list into a structured proposal for Employment Guidelines.
It remains to be seen whether or not the current four-pillar structure, on which we have articulated the development strategy, is still needed in order to reflect these priorities, or if other groupings could improve their visibility.
If possible, the guidelines should be reduced in number.
This brings me to the second issue which is the process.
Within the framework provided by the Treaty, the Employment Strategy should focus on the medium and long-term challenges to be met by the Lisbon 2010 deadlines.
With a view to ensuring a clearer focus on outcomes and on the medium and long-term goals of the strategy, there is a need for greater stability in the Employment Guidelines which should not be changed every year.
Member States' National Action Plans must focus more on implementation.
Overlaps and duplications with other processes should be more limited, in particular, through coordination between the employment strategy and the broad economic policy guidelines.
It is crucial that the respective roles and contributions be better defined.
The third point concerns the governance of the process.
This is an issue on which the European Parliament expressed great interest in its resolution of 25 September 2002.
The ideas for future orientations which I have just outlined should provide a better framework for more openness and participation.
Less and clearer objectives should make the strategy more visible.
A stronger focus on implementation and results should provide a better knowledge-base and more transparency.
Therefore, within this new framework, and with a stronger, more concrete focus, social partners would play a more effective role, and regional and local authorities would understand their role more easily and could participate more effectively.
Further consideration should be given as to how the European Parliament could be actively involved in the design and development of the employment strategy and on how national parliaments can be better integrated into this process.
There are major problems in some Member States, where the national parliaments have not participated in, nor have, in some cases, any idea about the employment strategy, the monetary procedures or the common goals.
This is quite a long list of shared convictions and perspectives but the new process for the strategy has only just begun.
As you know, the formal proposal for the employment guidelines 2003 will be presented in April 2003 together with the proposal for the broad economic policy guidelines.
In the meantime, there is room and time for everybody to become part of the process and to make their voices heard.
The Commission will continue to develop the idea of open participation.
In order to further stimulate and facilitate the involvement of potential stakeholders, the Commission intends to adopt another communication.
This will be presented in January and will give an outline of the revised strategy with concrete objectives and targets.
There is enough time for a rich exchange of views with the Parliament over the next few months in order to define and to agree on procedures for the new European Employment Strategy.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in closing the skills gap in the European labour market.
A gap clearly exists, however, in occupational and geographical mobility in the Union.
With regard to the first of these, European citizens do not change jobs very frequently, although most Member States have experienced an upward trend since 1995.
With regard to the movement of workers between Member States and nationally, the picture is no more encouraging: our rate of mobility is almost half of that of US citizens, with only a small elite of 225 000 European citizens moving to another Union country; in other words, 0.1% of the population of the Fifteen.
This is why, in February 2002, the Commission produced an action plan for skills and mobility that identifies 25 measures intended to respond to the shortcomings and needs indicated by the high-level task force.
I feel bound to criticise the Commission for having presented its proposals directly to the Barcelona European Council before giving Parliament the opportunity to comment on them.
Whilst the coherence of the action plan's recommendations should be highlighted, European citizens still face many obstacles.
In this report, which I had the honour of drafting, in accordance with the Hughes procedure, in cooperation with the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and incorporating the opinions of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee of the Regions, which proved to be important and valuable contributions - I would highlight various measures intended to promote occupational and geographical mobility and the elimination of obstacles to their full realisation, some of which I shall now discuss.
Firstly, local authorities should be involved in setting up a network of industry-based and educational advisory bodies to bring the world of work and education systems closer together; other, more effective actions need to be taken in order to reduce regional imbalances given that the basic reason for regional inequalities in terms of employment growth is the differences in the skill and educational levels and the mobility and adaptability of the labour force;
Secondly, Member States should provide support for one of the pillars of the European Employment Strategy - the entrepreneurial spirit - using the necessary funds, and coordinate their training-related activities more closely;
Thirdly, we must highlight the important role of the social partners in promoting access to training so that workers can achieve more and better qualifications and skills; the participation of the social partners is also crucial to monitoring the action plan at European, national and regional level;
Fourthly, Community legislation on the mutual recognition of qualifications must be more strictly applied;
Fifthly, youth exchange programmes, the awareness of cultural diversity, linguistic ability and citizenship must all be encouraged throughout training;
Sixthly, in order to combat the under-representation of women in high-technology sectors, support must be provided for the adoption of training actions and for the introduction of information and communications technologies and new systems of learning that guarantee women priority access, not forgetting the training and retraining of older workers, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups;
Seventhly, the crucial role that teleworking could play as a response to a geographical mobility that workers do not want;
Eighthly, the transferability of pensions is one of the most sensitive issues in this area, because pensions constitute a major obstacle to mobility, and workers who have acquired rights to a pension in their Member State could risk being unable to transfer these rights.
Directive 98/49/EC and Regulation 1408/71 must, therefore, be updated, simplified and extended and the coexistence of situations of double taxation with those in which this does not apply must finally be eliminated; a further major contribution to fostering geographical mobility is the creation of the European health insurance card, which is expected to be up and running in 2004;
Ninthly, we must highlight the use of the Eures system, although this must be extended and brought up to date.
I shall now address the Commission, so that it takes account of the importance of this instrument and fulfils the good intentions expressed in its communication on this particular aspect; the objective of transparency and of centralising information on employment opportunities within the Union can be achieved through the creation of a one-stop site providing information on mobility as well as campaigns aimed at individual industries.
I would also highlight the fact that the candidate countries must combat the brain drain in this area; we must help them to create their own structures for innovation and to promote the exchange of experience.
Member States, local authorities, employers, social partners and Community institutions must actively seek to ensure the success of this action plan and the measures that have now been presented must be taken into account in the revision of the European Employment Strategy
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bastos on her report and her presentation of it and to thank the rapporteur of the Committee of the Regions, Mrs Arnold, for her input.
The action plan for skills and mobility consists of 25 points designed to give the citizens of the European Union greater mobility.
Basically, the objective of the action plan is to remove obstacles to living, working and studying between one Member State and another.
The objective is not, by any stretch of the imagination, to make mobility compulsory; it is to put conditions in place which make it easier for anyone who so wishes to move within the European Union.
The Commission is delighted at how well Parliament has received the action plan and with its support for these measures which, as you know, were approved by the High-Level Task Force on Skills and Mobility as the most suitable way of improving the conditions upon which mobility and lifelong learning for our citizens depend.
Parliament's report contains a number of undertakings which are even more ambitious than those made by the Commission in the action plan, although I have to say that, given the priorities laid down in part by the Barcelona Council, the Commission has endeavoured to make the action plan as realistic and feasible as possible, taking account of the legislative procedures required in order to keep to the proposed deadlines.
The action plan contains a series of specific targets which will be used to evaluate its success over coming years and we shall, of course, need a number of indicators in order to assess its progress.
These indicators will be defined together with the Member States.
We need the Member States to be actively involved at all levels, especially as a great many measures under the action plan are largely measures for which the Member States have jurisdiction.
I should like to point out that we need coordination and we need collaboration between the Member States on education and vocational training, especially when it comes to the mobility of young people, exchanges of best practices and transparent professional qualifications.
As a result of the initiative by the Commission and the Member States, the Council will issue a resolution on 12 November on reinforcing cooperation in the field of vocational training.
The point of reinforced cooperation is to improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational training overall and to address the lack of transparency and mutual trust hampering the recognition of professional qualifications and skills from one country to another.
The implementation of the plan is under way, legislative proposals have been submitted, new procedures have been designed and the Council has been urged to take decisions on the proposals already tabled.
The Commission has made provision for close collaboration with the social partners, especially on two points: first, on the question of lifelong learning and, secondly, on the facility to transfer supplementary pension rights.
More specifically, especially on the matters addressed by Mrs Bastos, there are already plans to set up a website containing information on job mobility by the end of the year, so that European citizens can obtain information on the European job market and a number of other areas to do with mobility.
It will also provide a direct link to the learning opportunities website which will be up and running in 2003.
The Commission is to pass a decision revising the Eures system, so that it efficiently supports the mobility of European manpower, the objective being for Eures to provide services and information both to job seekers and to companies looking to recruit at European level.
Thirdly, the Commission will be tabling its proposal on the European health insurance card at the beginning of 2003, which Parliament already knows about.
I should also like to mention two horizontal issues.
First, there is room to improve the position of women across the board and the gender dimension must be taken into account in all individual measures and, secondly, we face an important challenge in the run up to enlargement: Parliament has voiced its concern about the danger of a manpower drain from east to west; this sort of mass exodus would create a huge problem for the candidate countries.
The connection between immigration and employment is to be discussed at a joint OECD/European Commission conference in January 2003.
In the meantime, the Commission is discussing a draft directive from last year on conditions of entry and residence for third country nationals looking for paid employment or freelance work, so as to ensure that the Member States take a common approach on this issue.
The action plan for skills and mobility is a very complicated and ambitious plan containing a whole host of measures which, if they are to be implemented, require very close collaboration between the European institutions and the social factors and social partners.
May I make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and interest which it has shown in this plan right from the outset.
Mr President, may I start by saying how much I welcome the Commissioner's remarks, and also those of the Danish Presidency.
The concept of putting employment in a central place in the Presidency programme is absolutely right and sets exactly the right tone and example not just for us but indeed for successive presidencies.
I would like to make some general remarks and then touch on my report.
Certainly it is fair to say that generally, Member States and this Parliament too often skate around the important issue of employment.
There is much talk but little action and such action as there is often unhelpful.
Certainly my own country sets a rather poor example in this respect.
Last year 4 600 employment regulations were introduced. That is one every 26 minutes.
That is hardly the way ahead.
But it is not enough for us to have separate programmes and projects, welcome as those may be.
It is not enough just to set targets whether for young people, women, the long-term unemployed etc., and then sit back and watch.
It is not enough to focus so firmly on job protection, trying to keep current jobs alive even when the market has moved on.
We need to focus on job creation, which means liberating enterprise.
We need to recognise that the greatest engine of employment growth in all our countries is the sector called 'small and medium-sized enterprises'.
We must help them succeed and thrive and not hold them back.
We need to realise that full employment helps create social inclusion and not the other way around.
The Lisbon Council said, and I repeated this in my report, that we need to encourage a regulatory climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in general.
Two years on, we have simply added to the burdens on business, and high unemployment in continental Europe is our own fault.
I am heartened, however, by the lead that the Danish Presidency is trying to give and I would like to thank Minister Frederiksen in particular for a most helpful letter that he sent me on 18 September.
I am sure he will not be embarrassed if I share with colleagues just one paragraph which is very pertinent to our topic of discussion today:
'My clear stand is that the European Union should only step in with legislation where there is an obvious need for such regulation and, in such cases, only to the necessary extent.
There should be room for manoeuvre at the national level and if regulation is introduced it should, in my view, to the highest possible extent, be in the form of framework directives rather than detailed rules.
There should also, wherever possible, be a freedom of choice as to the method of implementation as is, for instance, the case in connection with the open coordination method in the employment and social field.
Finally I would like to emphasise that I also attach great importance to the principle of subsidiarity.'
Those are extremely wise words and we all look forward to them being translated into action.
Similarly, the comments from Commissioner Prodi back in July saying that the intention was to simplify regulation by at least 25%, and to do that with all speed, is also to be welcomed.
Again, we wish to see some flesh put on those particular commitments as soon as possible, preferably again under your leadership and presidency.
As far as the growth and employment initiative is concerned, I was delighted that this was approved unanimously in committee and that we had made some progress in becoming lighter on our feet.
The first report on this multi-annual programme was in January 2001.
The second year's report was made only 11 months later, and this year the report is actually in October.
Next year I would like to make it earlier still, and I would look for the earliest possible feedback from the Commission to make this possible.
Specifically, however, I would like to point out how much I welcome the Commission's cooperation in providing information and updates at regular intervals.
I welcome the progress that has been made and in particular the way that the programme has been managed and has developed.
I would like to see some clear responses and some action regarding the proposals made by the Parliament both last year and indeed this time around.
Very simply, I would like to see the next Commission report show that it has not only read Parliament's report but has actually responded to it.
This means including a fuller analysis of certain aspects of the initiative and also the winding up of the Joint European Venture, the JEV Programme, in its current form.
I am reminded that at the end of the debate in December on exactly this subject, Commissioner Liikanen accosted me just after he finished speaking and asked whether the Parliament agreed with winding up the JEV Programme, because this was what the Commission very much wanted to do.
I told him that Parliament did indeed want to see the programme wound up.
He said he was very relieved to hear that and would now get on with it.
So far, I have not seen much action in winding the programme up.
The Commission needs to be much quicker and lighter on its feet on such issues, but then, so do we all.
Mr President, we received the report by the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the third report on the growth and employment initiative with a great deal of interest.
I especially appreciated the rapporteur's spirit of collaboration and his comments on our annual report and would point out that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs found the European Commission's report to be detailed and that the Commission had responded to the European Parliament's request for the report to be presented earlier.
And, of course we had excellent relations and worked closely with the rapporteur, as is clear from the position taken by Mr Bushill-Matthews.
I shall reply by dividing my comments into three entities.
First, the provision of information to Parliament and the relevant timetable, secondly geographical coverage and thirdly prospects and funding.
As far as the provision of information is concerned, although completing formal procedures is time-consuming, the European Commission has continued to apply its practice of updating the rapporteur at regular intervals before completing the official procedure.
And, it has endeavoured to provide quarterly information on the financial application of the programmes managed by the European Investment Fund on an unofficial basis.
In reply to your call in connection with so-called pre-start financing by financing intermediaries under the SME Guarantee Facility, I should point out that this pre-start financing is granted to certain small and medium-sized enterprises because they are in the start-up phase; they do not need to be officially recognised before the loan is granted and they are, of course, selected by the financing intermediaries.
As far as geographical and sectoral coverage is concerned, the European Investment Fund has managed to achieve relatively satisfactory coverage of all countries despite the recession on all the money markets.
It has managed to commit all the available funds in thirteen Member States.
The reason it is so hard to apply the European Technology Facility Start-Up Facility or ??F Start-up Facility is because the facility itself has not got off to a uniform start in every country; there are various problems with its application which are due in part to the fact that national venture capital markets are at different stages of development and, of course, in part to the 50% contribution, which is not easy to find; countries with an underdeveloped venture capital market find it hard, if not impossible to meet this second criterion.
Similarly, we need to look at the overall geographical distribution of all SME funding mechanisms, rather than at each one separately.
We also believe that we need to divide the budget between the various SME funding mechanisms within this framework with the right degree of flexibility, taking account of market demand rather than just responding to the need for geographical coverage.
I should point out that the European Investment Fund has always endeavoured to channel funding to countries where there is little demand.
As far as sectoral coverage is concerned, I should like to point out that the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises to have benefited from these funds belong to traditional sectors.
Bearing this in mind, it is true to say that the Fund's start-up facility is targeted at high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises and that over 90% of the beneficiaries of the SME start-up facility are micro enterprises with fewer than 10 employees, mainly in the services, craft, manufacturing and commercial sectors.
Thirdly, prospects for financial instruments.
The survival of programmes which benefit small and medium-sized enterprises is guaranteed under the multiannual programme on enterprise and entrepreneurship, which is now also open to candidate countries.
The European Investment Fund hopes to start negotiating contracts before the end of 2002, by signing memoranda of understanding with these countries and completing financial procedures.
As far as the European Technology Facility Start-Up Facility presented in the 2001 annual report is concerned, the revaluation of fast-growth innovative enterprises and the huge losses sustained by investors as a result have completely upset the market and there appears to be little likelihood of any change here in the future.
We also need to bear in mind that, with slow economic growth, increased competition on the European markets, the restructuring of the banking sector and the demand for shareholder value, banks are unwilling to grant or renew loans to risky small and medium-sized enterprises.
Of course, when part of the risk is underwritten by public-sector bodies, there is still a chance that banks will offer loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Consequently, the market demand for the SME start-up facility is still fairly high and we believe that the candidate countries will generate additional demand once they join.
As far as the Joint European Venture or JEV is concerned, the Commission agrees with Mr Bushill-Matthews' remarks that the programme had a limited impact as far as job creation is concerned and was not cost effective.
There was limited demand on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises and considerable delays in processing applications, due to the fact that the Commission had to apply strict procedures in order to minimise the risk of irregularity and protect the Community's economic interests.
This being so, the Commission agrees with Parliament that the Joint European Venture should be shut down.
The final evaluation of the growth and employment initiative should be completed and be ready for submission to Parliament in November 2002.
At the end of the consultation period, the Commission will submit a proposal to the Council in March or May 2003 for a Council decision amending the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship and possibly shutting down the specific initiative on the Joint European Venture.
Finally, two words about evaluation: the period covering the budget allocated to the financial instruments managed by the European Investment Fund expired on 29 May 2002, that is, four years after the Council decision was issued.
Consequently, the evaluation report was scheduled for submission after that date, so that account could be taken of the full 48-month budgetary period.
Just one comment, Mr President, on the original approach taken by Mr Bushill-Matthews.
Clearly the initiatives I referred to form part of the multiannual programme on small and medium-sized enterprises.
The conclusion drawn from all the analyses and investigations is that one of the most serious problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises is financing and that this is a real problem throughout the European Union.
All these European Commission initiatives, the guarantee funds, the Joint European Venture, technological backing for companies, are pilot programmes to find new financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises, some of which are successful and some of which are not and all of which depend on how dynamic and well-developed the markets are in the Member States.
But we believe that, in all cases, the outcome is positive because we work with the Member States, new instruments come on to the market and we always find the model to suit the country and the SME sector.
Mr President, SMEs play an important role, both from an economic and a social point of view.
They are therefore a key political priority.
The relevance of small and micro-enterprises was recognised by the Feira European Council.
This is why they should benefit from the EU financial instruments to a much greater degree than they have so far.
To achieve this, the Commission urgently needs to recognise and readdress three areas.
I am not entirely satisfied with the explanations we have had from the Commissioner.
The Commission needs to tackle the lack of information SMEs and micro-enterprises have about these programmes.
Access to information about how to get financing is an essential starting point for encouraging entrepreneurship and SMEs' activities.
Therefore, the Commission and Member States need to launch campaigns to give SMEs clear and simple information on how to benefit from EU projects and programmes.
Second, there is too much red tape and too many complicated financing procedures.
These need to be eliminated.
In Europe, SMEs have to face many more obstacles when accessing financing than is the case for SMEs in the United States.
We have heard about the Joint European Venture Programme and why it has failed.
We must look at the figures.
One of the reasons is that one in five projects was refused by the Commission or withdrawn due to the level of administrative requirements.
This needs to be investigated.
Also, the Commission failed to put in place the groundwork before they launched the JEV Programme because it was not marketed in some states, there were no intermediaries, and if you look at the UK, there was only one.
This meant that the programme was doomed to fail from the start.
I know that in my region there are many micro-enterprises and SMEs who would have welcomed the opportunity to be involved in this programme.
I hope that its successor will address some of these problems because this programme is important, especially for the candidate countries.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Bastos and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the satisfactory way in which the opinions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport were taken into consideration in the report on the mobility of skills.
The goal of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world will not be realised without a skilled labour force, for which mobility is practically possible, and even welcome.
In its opinion, however, the Committee on Culture also highlights the broader objectives of a basic education and its fundamental importance.
It likewise urges the Commission to exploit information technology in the promotion of virtual mobility and new ways of learning and working.
Although education is the responsibility of the Member States, we also need common actions and objectives.
In 2000 the number of those who received further education at the very least varied among the Member States from 78% right down to less than 20%.
It will be difficult to establish a firm basis for competitiveness unless we raise levels of education.
The problems associated with the comparability of qualifications greatly hamper labour mobility.
This year we are celebrating the millionth Erasmus student, but in reality we still have a lot of problems compensating for studies undertaken abroad.
In this regard we are expecting much from the Bologna and Bruges Processes.
The Commission's Action Plan quite rightly emphasises the fact that education systems must improve their ability to answer the needs of the labour market.
If education systems are made more flexible it will be possible, for example, to heighten interest in mathematics and the natural sciences.
Several Member States have embarked on separate projects in these areas.
Hopefully, the Commission will be able to pick up examples of good practice from these projects for others to make use of.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's action plan on skills and mobility and Mrs Bastos' report.
Whilst it is the lack of jobs rather than the lack of mobility which is the main problem for the unemployed in Europe, the issues identified by the Commission taskforce are very important.
I would like to make a few specific points that were highlighted by the Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities Committee:
First, gender mainstreaming is a requirement for all Commission documents, but an annex to this action plan explaining how it was done in this case would not only help ensure that the measures are adhered to, but would also demonstrate how mainstreaming was achieved in a practical way.
This would be a good example for other policy areas.
Second, regional initiatives are proposed to support training for women in occupations where they are not equally represented.
The revised Equal Treatment Directive allows Member States to provide such additional vocational training in areas such as the scientific sector and this should be built on in the action plan.
Third, the action plan proposes the formation of industrial, educational and other advisory bodies.
Whilst I know that membership of these bodies is not always within the Commission's jurisdiction, a clause requiring the Commission to ensure equal representation when possible sends everyone involved a very clear message that this is desirable and expected.
Geographical mobility means more, of course, than simply getting a job in a different place.
There are other issues to be taken into account, particularly for workers with children: access to housing, social services, good quality education and childcare.
The report makes several points which I welcome and which are important to women, such as qualifying periods for supplementary pension rights - as mentioned by the Commissioner - and the use of best practice to encourage more young women to take an interest in mathematics, science and technology.
I hope Parliament will support the report.
Mr President, I should like to thank both the Council and the Commission warmly for their introduction, but I should also particularly like to thank both our PPE-DE rapporteurs, Mrs Regina Bastos and Mr Philip Bushill-Matthews, for their reports.
After all, it is important not just to debate the general aspect, but also to address two very specific components of the employment issue.
First of all, the SMEs which are, of course, of key importance to the economic structure, and Mrs Bastos' report which naturally mainly concerns the labour market structure and the EU's education and training structure.
If these are not kept in step with each other, then something is wrong.
At present, the economy is, of course, not in terribly good shape.
This will undoubtedly have an impact on the labour market.
We already know this and we should be prepared for this.
This is why I wonder whether the Council is not a little too upbeat.
Is it not relying too much on figures from the recent past, when growth and the development of productivity were far better than now?
A second question that can be addressed to the Council is, of course, whether they are not being overly optimistic in combining all these processes.
We are certainly not opposed to this, but are we not in danger of creating another Johannesburg Summit of some kind, or to put it in biblical terms, a Tower of Babel, with all these processes happening simultaneously?
Will this produce any extra benefits?
This is my second question.
A question I should like to ask the Commission, one that is related to what I said on a general note, is the issue of whether the Commission takes account of its own directives.
I am very aware of the fact that as soon as a social directive is issued, very extensive discussions on employment will follow immediately.
This is currently the case with, for example, the directive on working conditions for temporary staff.
There are also other directives, though, in the field of the economy itself or in the field of annual reporting, and there are many complaints, also from SMEs, that these directives are very detrimental to employment.
I will give you an example that occurred this week, namely Commissioner Bolkestein's Take-Over Directive.
This directive will almost certainly cost tens of thousands of jobs in the Netherlands and in Germany and, in time, will undermine the present social system.
Is this taken into consideration in the Commission's decision-making process?
Does consideration of how many jobs will be lost come into it at all?
Or is the focus in respect of these inherently sound intentions on the social directives?
If this were the case, this would, in my view, be wrong.
I would therefore like to find out from the Commission whether this was the case here, and if not, whether this is likely to happen in future.
As I have already said, we are still facing a difficult situation in the area of employment.
I think that a number of things can still happen at EU level.
I would, for example, mention the issue of the arms industry, which is very badly regulated in Europe, and where we could achieve far better employment levels but also far better efficiency than at present.
I know that a lot of people would prefer not to talk about this too much but would rather leave this to the course of time.
This too is therefore a problem that I believe we need to consider.
Finally, I think we should still be very careful not to look exclusively and excessively to America, and to believe that they do everything better than we do.
We have seen a few recent cases - it is enough for me to mention Enron, but also the current strike on the west coast - in which the United States does not do so well.
I would urge the Council and the Commission mainly to try to adopt the good things that are happening in the United States and not too many of the bad things, and also not to think that we are doing so badly on all scores.
We often do much better than we think.
Mr President, I wish to thank the Council and the Commission for their statements on employment strategy, and I also wish to thank the two rapporteurs.
In my speech, I wish to concentrate on employment strategy.
It is good that there has been an evaluation after five years.
It is important to see what has worked well, what has not worked so well and where there is room for improvement.
The Council is right in saying that it is the result which counts in the end.
The overall results for the past five years are, however, fairly good.
There has been an increase in active employment measures, unemployment has fallen, and employment has risen accordingly.
If we compare the way we have tackled employment during various phases of recession, we can confirm that this recession is a great improvement on the last, even if unemployment is rising at present in some countries.
On the subject now of the proposed changes themselves and their extent, it is certainly the case that the pillar structure is not an end in itself, but it is important that a number of different aspects are included in employment strategy.
Here, I am of course talking about the targets of a rise in employment and a fall in unemployment, an increase in employment for women, high-quality employment and aspects of work organisation.
There is one more aspect that no one has mentioned, which is that sustainable development must be integrated into employment strategy as it is into the other two strategies.
I share the view that has been expressed on stability.
We should not step in and make changes every year.
Unless there are any particular developments, these processes should be allowed to continue for a number of years.
I also share the view as regards focus.
It becomes difficult if there are too many indicators and targets.
We need to focus on the most important goals, and we need to take care of implementation and results.
Regarding openness and the participation of partners, I wish to emphasise what has been said about the social partners.
They already play a central role, and there are reasons for increasing their participation in the employment strategy.
There are, however, some shortcomings, especially in the field of democratic control.
There is a lack of influence on the part of the European Parliament on overall strategy, and a lack of influence on the part of the national parliaments regarding implementation and Member States' national action plans.
These issues are important.
We cannot let such important issues be decided behind closed doors by employees' associations.
We must have proper democratic control.
When we coordinate the processes, however, no one process is more important than another.
The economic process is just as important as the social and employment-policy processes, and we must also bring in the social guidelines when we synchronise the processes.
All of this is important.
If there is anyone who should be doing the coordinating it is the General Council.
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commission, my fellow MEPs and the rapporteurs for this policy document.
It is important for us to try to attain the Lisbon goals and for this purpose, we must certainly develop the area of employment and training.
I therefore welcome this proposal. We must learn from the past, for without the past, there is no future.
In order to achieve the goals agreed in Lisbon, however, we will also need to consider better labour mobility, and I particularly have the border regions in mind.
We need more harmonisation and more cooperation in the tripartite system of government, industry and knowledge institutes, mainly in order to stimulate working across borders.
This is why I have tabled an amendment to promote this.
Fortunately, the Committee on Budgets has already adopted an amendment to this effect and I hope that the same can be done in this Chamber.
At the moment, the transnational labour and knowledge potential that is available is still very much under-utilised, and this must improve.
Furthermore, we should in future consider the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and diplomas, something that we are, in fact, already addressing to a large extent.
Eventually, however, the cross-border harmonisation of social security systems, social policy and even tax policy will also need to improve.
I assume that the Council will deal with this and will be tabling proposals in due course, particularly with a view to promoting this mobility and the exchange of knowledge across the borders, for as we know, there are very few Europeans who move from one region to another, particularly to look for employment.
Unlike Mr Pronk, I should like to point to the Americans, who have no difficulty whatsoever in looking for another job within a one thousand kilometre radius.
As for his comment on take-over bids, I should like to note that in my view, European enterprises are better able to run as a result, and if they run better within the internal market, this will eventually lead to better investments and thus to more employment.
As you see, Mr President, it is possible for us to have different views.
Mr President, allow me to say a few words about employment strategy.
First of all, I am pleased that both the Commission and the Council so clearly identify with and advocate the Lisbon strategy, with its clear aims and its talk of economic growth, full employment and social considerations in balance with each other.
It is very important to achieve a balanced employment policy, where a number of different interests stand side by side.
Secondly, it is good that the Commission speaks so clearly about the prospects for implementing employment strategy.
