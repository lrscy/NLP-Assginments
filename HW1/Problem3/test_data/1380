Please cooperate.
Mr President, on a point of order, I listened with great interest to the questions by Mrs Stauner and Mr Heaton-Harris who both asked the Commissioner to comment on the allegations made by Mrs Andreasen and on whether, in fact, she was not completely justified.
I notice the Commissioner did not reply to those questions.
Mr President, please invite the Commissioner to do so because, as two Members have asked the same question, they are entitled to a full response.
Mr President, I will gladly answer the question.
As I have explained, in the year 2000, the Commission commissioned a study that examined the accounting system.
We then decided - it was in a Prodi Commission proposal for the Financial Regulation - to propose new bookkeeping rules.
Then in June 2001 the services of the Commission prepared a first package of measures, a first action plan, of what must be done.
That was the basis on which the chief accountant was appointed in January 2002 and that was the basis of the work that should have been done.
I believe that Parliament itself would say that anyone working in the Commission is responsible for implementation.
It is not sufficient to repeat certain criticisms, but it is then that person's duty to work on implementing the reform.
This is the last point of order I shall allow, because if this requires further debate there will be another opportunity, but today we cannot stretch our time any further.
The final point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order, I appreciate your comments but this is one of the fundamental problems we have with the Commission at present.
Mrs SandbÃŠk has written to you, Commissioner, asking to see a copy of the signature of your former, former chief accountant on the 2001 accounts.
I asked who that person was.
I was told in the past that they were signed whilst that person was in post.
That person left the Commission's employment on 31 December 2001.
They were either the quickest prepared set of accounts in history or something magical happened.
I am not convinced by what you have said today and I very much doubt whether the people in the public gallery are convinced.
I would just appreciate some frank exchanges and honesty between you and those of us who are interested, because Mrs Andreasen told you what was happening.
She wrote to you and met you, and you chose to ignore here.
What happened is a disgrace to you and your institution.
Realistically, you have to bite the bullet and get on with reforming the accounting system properly, and you could do with Mrs Andreasen's help.
Mr President, Mr Heaton-Harris, once again, the chief accountant who was responsible for the budget and capital accounts in 2001 was also responsible for the 2001 financial statement.
It was sent to the Court of Auditors on time.
The Commission presents the budget and capital account to the European Court of Auditors, which also checks the books on an ongoing basis.
The European Court of Auditors again came to the conclusion for the 2001 books that the financial statement provides a correct and true picture of the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation at the end of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have no option but to move on to the next item on the agenda.
If you need to continue this debate, it must be at another time.
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0510/2002).
In accordance with paragraph 2 of Annex II of the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 40, 42, 43 and 44 will not be replied to, since they relate to an issue which already appears on the agenda for the present part-session: the Council and Commission statements on the Prestige, tomorrow Wednesday.
The authors of the questions have naturally been informed.
Part I
Question No 37 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0727/02):
Subject: Border controls in north Africa
Can the Commission explain the scope of the agreements reached with Morocco and other north African countries with a view to helping these countries curb the illegal transit of emigrants to the European Union across their borders?
Can the Commission provide information on other projects in this field?
As part of the dialogue on illegal immigration established by the Association Agreement between the EU and Morocco, and following an initiative by the Moroccan authorities, a special programme on border control management was approved by the MED Committee in December 2001 under the national indicative programme from 2002 to 2004 for Morocco.
An indicative budget of EUR 40 million in the Meda national indicative programme from 2002 to 2004, signed by the Moroccan authorities in January 2002, has been earmarked for the purpose.
This initiative forms part of a broader dialogue on migration issues between Morocco and the European Union, which also covers issues linked to legal immigration and the socio-economic dimension of migratory pressure.
The specific programme is aimed at institution building, developing the regulatory framework, modernising infrastructure and equipment, training officials and developing cooperation between the Moroccan authorities concerned and their counterparts in the Member States.
An expert visit was arranged with a view to assessing needs and subsequently drawing up a timetable of concrete measures to improve the situation.
During the mission, which took place in July 2002, experts from the Member States and the Commission had an opportunity to visit the main border posts and the frontier areas most affected by illegal immigration, particularly from sub-Saharan countries.
During those visits the Moroccan authorities expressed their political determination and firm commitment to cooperate with the Union in the fight against illegal immigration and on border controls in particular.
In a spirit of openness and fruitful cooperation, in July and September 2002, they provided the experts with information on the regulatory framework and application of the rules as well as statistics on illegal emigration.
In the light of the outcome of the on-the-spot visits and after examining the data communicated by the Moroccan authorities, the experts are to finalise their report before the end of 2002.
The content of the programme will subsequently be determined.
This programme is the first initiative on border control management with a country in the region.
Mr President, the figure the Commissioner has given is EUR 40 million, apparently for the period 2002-2004.
I would be grateful if you could clarify whether this is only for 2002 and whether it is an experimental programme because, given that, when we talk about the borders of Morocco, we are talking about thousands of kilometres of borders, I have the impression that this sum is entirely insufficient to help the Moroccan Government to carry out the control of those borders.
I would like to know whether there is any possibility of this figure of EUR 40 million, if it is considered simply to be an initial figure, being increased so that we may have a sensible programme of cooperation with Morocco which would allow that country to control its borders.
The 40 million is for the years 2002 to 2004.
This is quite clear.
It should also be added that this figure does not represent all the resources available for addressing the problem in general.
This is our additional support, including initiatives and inputs that are essential for Morocco to be able to improve its handling of this problem.
However, Morocco also implements its own measures.
I would also add that this issue concerns more than just money.
All such matters are taken up at a mid-term review.
It is not just a question of supplying some hardware here and there.
Question No 38 by Mary Elizabeth Banotti (H-0825/02):
Subject: Abuse of EU research legislation covering orphan drugs
In 1999 EU legislation was adopted with a view to encouraging research into the development of 'orphan' drugs for the treatment of rare diseases.
It would now seem that unscrupulous drug companies are using the legislation to obtain exclusive rights to common medicines which are currently used in the treatment of rare disorders, therefore pushing up the cost of such drugs.
Will the Commission undertake to inquire into the level of such abuse, and what measures will the Commission take to end such abuse and to ensure that the legislation is used for the purpose that it was intended, namely research for effective treatment of rare disorders?
Mr President, orphan medicinal products are so called because they are used in the treatment or diagnosis of conditions that occur so rarely.
The cost of developing and marketing orphan medicinal products would not be recovered by their expected sales.
For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry has been unwilling to develop such products under normal market conditions.
The regulation on orphan medicinal products which entered into force in January 2000 provides a system of incentives for sponsors to develop and market designated orphan medicinal products.
One of these incentives is market exclusivity for a period of 10 years.
This is granted if a designated orphan medicinal product obtains a marketing authorisation in all Member States.
To obtain this, the sponsor must conduct a series of tests and studies to demonstrate that the product meets the rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy required of all medicinal products marketed in the EU.
Since 2000, 123 products have been designated as orphan medicinal products and placed on the Community register.
In a very small number of cases this involves a commonly available chemical that has been supplied by the manufacturer to hospitals which have prepared the chemical for administration to patients.
The great majority of these orphan medicinal products contain new innovative ingredients.
In a few cases it has been common practice for some time to supply the raw ingredients to treat the patient.
However, this chemical has not been tested for its purity and safety and the product is not authorised.
Indeed the chemical is not of pharmaceutical quality and may contain unspecified and unquantified impurities.
In this situation, it is not surprising that an authorised medicinal product developed to meet rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy costs more than the base chemical.
The Commission has no powers with respect to either the price or reimbursement of medicines.
However, the orphan regulation contains a provision to reduce the period of market exclusivity to six years, if after five years it can be shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity.
Question No 39 by Bernd Posselt (H-0773/02):
Subject: Chechnya - Commissioner Nielson's visit
Has the Commission already decided when Commissioner Nielson will be travelling to Chechnya in order to form an impression, in person, of the humanitarian situation there and set about improving the distribution of EU aid?
Mr Posselt, the short answer to your question is no.
The longer answer is as follows. I follow very closely the developments of the humanitarian situation in Chechnya and in the neighbouring republics where part of the Chechen population is displaced.
In the most recent press statements of 27 November and 5 December of this year, I expressed my concerns about the gravity of the humanitarian and human rights situation there, in particular the growing pressures made on internally displaced persons to leave the camps in Ingushetia and return to Chechnya.
As you know, ECHO is the main donor of humanitarian aid to the region.
It has supported the victims of the second Chechnya conflict since its very beginning and will continue to do so.
The Commission, through ECHO, has so far allocated more than EUR 90 million in humanitarian aid in order to help people survive.
In 2002 alone, EUR 25 million have been allocated for this crisis and an additional EUR 3 million are now in the pipeline for more emergency food aid.
In Ingushetia, at this very critical moment, ECHO provides support to internally displaced persons in camps, spontaneous settlements and host families.
Most of the aid provided in the Aki Yurt camp had been funded by ECHO, and we will continue to be present in all other camps.
In parallel, ECHO continues to fund a very large part of the humanitarian assistance going to Chechnya proper.
This is a very difficult task, as this is one of the locations in the world where working conditions for humanitarian organisations are the worst, both in terms of security and in terms of monitoring.
We continue to argue with the Russian authorities on all these points as I have again and again informed this Parliament.
The bottom line is that we are able to deliver humanitarian aid both around and inside Chechnya although it is difficult, but we are able to do it and we will continue to do it.
Mr President, just two specific queries. Firstly, can you give some kind of guarantee - one can of course never give an absolute one - that the humanitarian aid is actually reaching the Chechen refugees, or are you relying completely on the Russian authorities for that?
My second question is this: as camps have now been set up in Ingushetia and masses of people deported, do you know where those people have gone?
One of the most important activities and one activity that we are very pleased to continue funding is the logistical work provided by the Danish Refugee Council - the only non-Russian operation that delivers food and all other items inside Chechnya.
They use local drivers, but the whole organisation is provided by that NGO.
This is also recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by the UN system in general.
It is a very important achievement because it provides access for the humanitarian community.
So the answer to the question of whether we are able to monitor the whole flow is that we are doing it as well as possible.
On a number of occasions over the years I have informed Parliament that we are working on the basis of a so-called 'remote-control' concept, which means that we have to use local implementing partners.
However, so far we have not run into problems relating to accountability.
We are trying to track every activity as carefully as possible.
I would say that, as long as we are able to keep the operation carried out by the Danish Refugee Council up and running, we have some security in terms of knowing what is going on.
The input from the UN organisations is also crucial in this respect and our cooperation with them is quite well developed.
The problem of the people who are more or less willing to go back - and we fear they are fewer in number - is that they go back into all kinds of different situations.
This is why we are criticising the pressure that they are under.
We are clearly worried.
We will proceed to the second part of this Question Time, and we will begin with questions to Vice-President de Palacio.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner de Palacio
Questions to 41 by JosÃ© Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil (H-0800/02):
Subject: Taxation of fuel supplied in Gibraltar
On 20 November, the newspaper 'El Pais' reported that most vessels passing through the Straits of Gibraltar take on fuel from tanker ships anchored in Gibraltarian waters, instead of doing so in the port of Algeciras, where there are better installations.
The reasons are, inter alia, that fuel is cheaper in Gibraltar than in Spain, and that the Spanish authorities are stricter in their application of EU regulations on maritime safety and pollution prevention than the Gibraltar authorities.
It is no secret that this particular form of taking on fuel presents considerable environmental risks in terms of spillage, which has indeed occurred fairly frequently.
Furthermore, the fact that the amount of tax paid on fuel differs between Spain and Gibraltar constitutes fullblown fiscal discrimination, seriously distorting competition, as happens with all products subject to Community customs duties.
What does the Commission intend to do, therefore, to put an end to these practices, which are both dangerous to the environment and harmful to the proper operation of the internal market?
Mr President, Gibraltar is, in fact, one of the main points for the supply of marine fuel in the Mediterranean and much of this activity is carried out by oil tankers.
Although many ports have equipment for refuelling on the quayside, this type of refuelling is still the most common in ports, not only in small ports, but also in others such as Rotterdam, Barcelona or Hamburg.
The Commission believes that this practice should be carefully supervised in order to prevent dumping and marine pollution.
Therefore, many ports have adopted specific regulations and procedures which regulate such activities and the Commission, for its part, in accordance with the Treaty, monitors compliance with the Community legislation on environmental protection and therefore, on 24 January 2001, brought a case before the Court of Justice in relation to the non-application by the United Kingdom of a whole series of environmental rules in Gibraltar, including Directive 93/12/EEC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels.
With regard to taxation, in accordance with Community tax rules, the hydrocarbons used as fuels for shipping and fishing in Community waters, with the exception of private recreational vessels, are exempt from the payment of special taxes, both at Community level and at national level.
Commissioner, behind the tide of black oil being suffered today by Galicia and which on other occasions has been suffered by other European coasts, there is always a tide of black money which should be investigated.
These black oil slicks and this black money always involve groups with structures much more like mafias than like businesses, made up of companies with ridiculous assets in order to evade responsibilities and covered by insurance which is also ridiculous.
These groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental, commercial and fiscal points of view, and Gibraltar is no exception.
The port of Gibraltar supplies much more fuel than the port of Algeciras, amongst other things because less harbour duties are paid there and because - as the Commissioner has acknowledged - maritime safety and environmental rules are applied much less rigorously and, thirdly, because less tax is paid.
I am not of course referring to special taxes, because any first-year law student knows that the fuel used in maritime transport is exempt from the value added tax on hydrocarbons.
The problem is that direct taxes are not paid either, taxes on companies, which also have an impact on prices: 35% in Algeciras and nothing in Gibraltar, as Commissioner Monti knows very well.
I would like to ask whether or not there are tax differences in Gibraltar when compared to Algeciras.
Bearing in mind that there cannot be differences in relation to special taxes, there can be differences in relation to taxation as a whole, which has an impact on costs, as you will be aware, every time you go out to lunch or dinner and pay the bill.
Mr President, my colleague, Mario Monti, has already initiated procedures on two occasions against the United Kingdom, precisely in order to ensure the correct operation of the internal market and the appropriate application of the competition rules in an equivalent manner throughout the Union.
In any event, I am sure that Mr GarcÃ­a Margallo, who has plenty of experience, is perfectly aware of these issues, and I am sure that my colleague, Mario Monti, will continue to work to ensure that there are no havens in any part of the European Union in relation to any issue, when it comes to the application of Community legislation.
Question No 45 by Nuala Ahern (H-0721/02):
Subject: EU-wide nuclear regulation
On 12 September the Energy Commissioner briefed selected press on new plans for EU-wide nuclear regulation, revealing plans that include:
a 'framework directive' which will establish nuclear safety standards in the EU; a directive on the management and disposal of radioactive waste; a directive governing the financial mechanisms for securing long term disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of nuclear facilities; a negotiation mandate to raise the levels of imported nuclear fuel into the EU.
Can the Commission state what parts of the current Euratom Treaty powers on nuclear safety regulation are inadequate and require such changes; what consultation the Commission has had with Member States in respect of plans to increase the import of nuclear fuels into the EU; and whether the Commission envisages that these increased nuclear imports are intended for reprocessing at Sellafield and The Hague?

Mr President, in the 45 years of application of the Euratom Treaty, its capacity for adaptation and flexibility in order to respond to the needs and concerns of any particular moment has been demonstrated.
In this regard, it has promoted and facilitated the development of Community research and legislation on control in the fields of both radiation protection and on the control of the use of nuclear materials.
The measures proposed are concrete evidence of the appropriate nature of the Treaty, whose provisions provide them with a solid and sufficient legal basis.
These Commission proposals strengthen, above all, the existing mechanism for guaranteeing the health protection of the population and of workers, as defined in Chapter 3 of Title II of the Euratom Treaty.
In this way, health protection within the framework of radiation protection rules will be supplemented with nuclear safety provisions able to guarantee compliance with the radiation protection rules.
With regard to the trade in nuclear materials with Russia, the Commission proposes to present a proposal for a negotiation mandate for the approval of the Council, in accordance with its right to initiative.
Commissioner, we were very surprised to discover that you, a Commissioner with special responsibility for relations with Parliament, briefed the press in September before Parliament had even heard of these proposals.
This was appalling of you.
I cannot stress too firmly that you should have come to discuss them with Parliament before briefing the press.
I am very surprised to hear that you have a sufficient legal base.
I understand that the Council is discussing this at the moment and that your nuclear proposals are based on the wrong legal framework.
You have actually got it wrong, Commissioner.
Contrary to what the Commission has suggested, Articles 30, 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not applicable, as the Commission would be interfering with the safety of nuclear installations in respect of their technical operation.
This is excluded under the Euratom Treaty.
I should also like to inform you that in the Member States, particularly in the UK, questions are being raised concerning your support for reprocessing in some of your statements.
I would like you to clarify that you are not supporting plutonium reprocessing of in these proposals.
Mr President, Mr Ahern, forgive me, but I announced the intention to present this nuclear safety package to this Parliament before anybody else and I have repeated it on various occasions, and it was therefore nothing new.
And I did not present the initiatives to the press before this Parliament. On the contrary, I came here to inform Parliament of the initiatives I had proposed in Brussels.
With regard to the legal basis, I would refer to the press release issued by the Luxembourg Court on 10 December.
The Court believes that Euratom has competences in the following areas: the establishment of a legislative and regulatory framework for organising the safety of nuclear installations; measures relating to the assessment and verification of safety; organisation in the event of emergencies; the choice of location of nuclear installations and, finally, the design, construction and operation of nuclear installations.
I therefore believe that nobody is going to argue about the legal basis in the Euratom Treaty for all the proposals I have made to the Council and Parliament, because the Court has said it loud and clear.
Finally, I do not support reprocessing in any way whatsoever.
I do not know where the honourable Member has got these ideas from, I do not get into these types of issues.
All I propose is that we must provide a framework for greatest possible degree of safety in all the countries of the Union. In all of them, in the ones that are going to join now and in the current ones, and there must be the highest possible level of safety in all of them, making obligatory, amongst other things, what are merely recommendations from the Safety Agency in Vienna.
Question No 46 by Laura GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez (H-0737/02):
Subject: Independence exercised by the Commission
In June 2002 a delegation of the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions travelled to Asturias at the invitation of the parliament of Asturias.
One of the petitions handed to the committee chairman, Mr Gemelli, at a meeting with various groups of petitioners criticised the social and environmental impact of routing the 'autovÃ­a del CantÃ¡brico' motorway through the west of the region.
That petition was declared admissible by the Committee on Petitions.
Surprisingly, however, before the petition could be discussed under the usual procedure, an MEP, accompanied by the secretary of his party in the region and three mayors, met with Commissioner Loyola de Palacio and two Commission officials.
On their return to Asturias the mayors told the media that the petition had been filed.
How can a case be closed before the committee responsible has either seen or discussed it?
How can Mrs Loyola de Palacio decide to file a petition which - as indicated in a reply sent by Mrs WallstrÃ¶m - does not fall within her department's remit?
Does the Commission not believe that its independence and the duty of confidentiality of the officials concerned have been affected?
In its view, does action of this kind not undermine the role of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament itself and, worse still, show a lack of respect for the petitioners?
Mr President, I would like to say briefly to the honourable Member that I did in fact receive a visit - and I receive many visits - from a series of representatives who not only visited me but also the Directorate-General for the Environment, which is responsible for dealing with the issue which the honourable Member refers to.
This type of visit to the Commission is normal.
Furthermore, on certain occasions I have also met with the honourable Member and other people and these meetings furthermore seem to me to be extremely important in terms of becoming aware of what social groups and people are thinking.
What we have to avoid when we are in the Commission, in Brussels, is losing contact with reality.
Having said this, I cannot get into what the people who visit me say or the content of what they freely express.
I cannot get into it, but I would like to say firstly that I am not responsible with regard to the initiation of any possible procedures or investigations relating to these issues, which fall within the competence of my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m; secondly, with regard to the Committee on Petitions, I do not have any responsibility here either, because it falls to this Parliament to deal with these issues.
Mr President, rather than supplementing the question, because I consider the Commissioner's reply to be correct, what I will do is inform her that in that case they used her name and those of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment wrongly.
As I said in the question, a number of petitioners spoke with Mr Gemelli, in Asturias - my region - and then there were a series of visits to the Commissioner.
Now, what appears in the regional press is that the Commissioner and the officials say that this case is closed.
It seems to me unfortunate to use the names of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment.
The Asturian petitioners quite rightly asked me how it could be that a case was closed when it had not even been discussed in the Committee on Petitions.
I therefore say to you that the appearance in the press of the names of these two officials and of the Commissioner greatly damages the credibility of the European institutions and of the Committee on Petitions.
It grieves me that your name and those of these two officials should be linked to a political issue which should not have appeared in the press in this way.
Mr President, I am surprised that such experienced Members of Parliament should confuse a complaint to the Commission with a petition to the European Parliament.
Such an important public communications infrastructure project as the 'autovÃ­a de Occidente' motorway deserves all the support of all the Asturian political representatives.
Therefore, certain Asturian Mayors, very concerned about some complaints made to the Commission by certain Asturian local organisations, came here to find out how the executive Commission was dealing with those complaints.
They were received by Commissioner de Palacio and by certain officials, who informed them that that complaint presented to the European Commission had just that week been filed away and that the case had been completely closed.
Of course, it is not the duty of the Commission to resolve the final outcome of the petitions to the European Parliament, but of the MEPs.
But let us not confuse complaints with petitions.
Commissioner de Palacio, I would like to ask you whether you have any news on whether in the corresponding services of the Commission there is any other complaint presented on the issue of the 'autovÃ­a de Occidente'.
Mr President, there has perhaps been a degree of confusion, as the honourable Member has said.
All I can do is repeat that I cannot comment on the content of statements by people who visit me.
Secondly, one thing is a complaint and quite another is the Committee on Petitions which, I insist, the Commission plays no part in, since it falls within the competence of this Parliament.
With regard to the issue of complaints, this falls to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
I have no knowledge but, in any event, I will be very happy to look into it and I will inform the honourable Member.
The Members are aware that this is a time for questions and supplementary questions to the Commission, not for explanations and descriptions by the honourable Members.
I very much respect your enthusiasm for debating and explaining the facts, but this is a Question Time.
As the author is not present, Question No 47, by Herman Vermeer, lapses.
Question No 48 by Carlos Bautista Ojeda (H-0781/02):
Subject: Starting date for Third Road Safety Action Plan
In reply to question E-1265/02 of 26 April 2002 by the author of the present question, the Commission stated that it would issue a communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan during the third quarter of 2002.
However, from the remarks made by Commissioner de Palacio on Thursday, 12 September 2002 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Red Cross road safety campaign it appears that the Third Plan will not be presented until 2003.
Meanwhile, it has been stated in the European research programme FANTASIE that a situation of 'sustainable growth' or 'sustainable balance' in the European transport sector would entail a considerable increase in the use of two-wheeled vehicles.
Can the Commission confirm the publication date of its communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan?
Can it provide advance information on the specific road safety measures which this plan will contain for two-wheeled vehicles?
Mr President, the White Paper on European transport policy presents a range of measures which must be taken in order to improve road safety, as well as an action plan on road safety aimed at determining measures which will allow us to achieve by 2010 the global objective of reducing by half the number of fatalities resulting from road accidents in the European Union.
This programme is being drawn up and it is scheduled to be adopted during the first quarter of 2003.
Certain measures will refer specifically to two-wheeled vehicles and, in this regard, I would like once again to highlight the excellent work done by Mr Bautista Ojeda in this area.
The general measures will also have significant positive consequences for the safety of drivers and passengers of two-wheeled vehicles.
Mr President, thanks to the improvement in communication networks, particularly within cities, in population centres, pedestrianisation and the increase in the volume of four-wheeled traffic, the number of users of two-wheeled vehicles is increasing every day, as you have said.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are intending to implement any type of specific initiative to promote the use of two-wheeled vehicles, bearing in mind, furthermore, the current situation with regard to the cost of insurance, which is leading to a significant reduction in the numbers of these vehicles sold.
Mr President, I can tell you that there will be specific initiatives.
For example, in the programme on safety for cars, in the agreements with the car manufacturing industry, there is consideration of designs for cars which are less harmful in collisions with unprotected persons, that is, both pedestrians and users of two-wheeled vehicles (motorcycles, bicycles etc.).
Furthermore, it is necessary as always within the European Union to monitor true compliance with the existing traffic rules and codes, such as wearing helmets when riding a motorcycle, because we have detected that, on many occasions, what happens is that the legislation approved is unfortunately not applied or enforced strictly enough.
Mr President, Commissioner, a lot of accidents involving two-wheeled vehicles occur mainly as a result of road works, barriers, divided carriageways, sections of road where the way is unclear.
Is it also planned to develop a kind of best practice or a benchmark system for defusing accident black spots, which after all are known from past experience, so that in future road works will serve to make traffic safer and fewer accidents happen?
Lack of visibility affects two-wheeled vehicles and all vehicles in general.
With regard to the design of barriers, I would like to say that Mr Bautista Ojeda has produced initiatives on several occasions.
We in the Commission are studying whether it is true that, in the construction of barriers, there are shapes and designs which are less harmful and safer.
We do not have any definitive conclusions about this yet but it is one of the issues we are analysing in order to increase security and prevent the terrible accidents which sometimes occur.
Commissioner, my friend and colleague Carlos Bautista Ojeda has made a brief reference to this, but I would like to expand on one of the issues which he has raised: as you know, in the Spanish State users of two-wheeled vehicles have real difficulties finding companies who want to insure mopeds, motorcycles etc. Their only answer - in some cases - is to turn to the insurance compensation consortium.
I do not know whether anything can be done in this regard, on the initiative of the Commission, because this is a great demand from the motorcycling sector: that there may really be insurance cover which is accessible and proportionate to the use, enjoyment and cost of motorcycles and two-wheeled vehicles in general.
Mr President, all the issues relating to the internal market are more directly the responsibility of Commissioner Bolkestein, but in any event I take good note of what both you and Mr Bautista Ojeda have said to me and we will try to analyse it.
This undoubtedly also relates to the problem of levels of danger and its physical and health consequences.
Therefore, it is a question of taking action to improve safety in the moped, motorcycle and bicycle sectors, in other words, two-wheeled vehicles, but of course I will also study the issue of the problem of insurance.
Question No 49 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0786/02):
Subject: Protection of Ireland's rail freight infrastructure
Is the Commission aware of recent proposals from Ireland's government-owned rail freight operator, Iarnrod Eireann, to withdraw from certain rail freight operations? This proposal would lead to an estimated additional 400 extra trucks involved in transporting freight by road each day.
Ireland already has a serious traffic congestion problem due to inadequate road infrastructure, and any further shift from rail to road would greatly exacerbate this problem.
Such a development would also run counter to the Commission's rail freight strategy.
Will the Commission urgently raise this issue with the Irish Government and ensure its current strategic rail review leads to an internal freight policy consistent with the Transport White Paper?
Will it seek a clear statement of the sums allocated to rail freight under the current and previous rounds of structural funds and of how it proposes to handle the evolution of a transport pricing policy, and a commitment that its future stewardship of the railway system will be consistent with the principles set out in the Transport White Paper?
Mr President, the transport White Paper clearly speaks of revitalising the railways throughout the European Union.
In order to achieve this objective, the Community has taken various initiatives and has recently made proposals.
The new European regulatory framework providing for the integration and interoperability of the market will allow rail companies to increase their competitiveness and orientate their business activities towards the growth of market sectors such as European goods services.
The Union's financial aid for the construction or modernisation of rail infrastructures, as well as the elimination of bottle necks, creates the physical conditions necessary for the rail system to absorb a greater percentage of the expected future growth in transport volume.
The Community has co-financed various projects for development of the trans-European rail network in Ireland.
For example, in 2000, the projects received co-funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans-European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund.
Nevertheless, for reasons of subsidiarity, the Commission is prevented from going further than its own competences when it comes to designating or selecting the priority objectives for action of a particular government, at any particular moment, in a specific State of the Union.
The Commissioner is probably aware that the Irish rail system is run by a state company in which the government is a shareholder.
This state company has recently announced its intention to review its entire network, particularly the freight network, with the possibility that it may be closed entirely.
Given that it is the objective of the Commission, and indeed of the European Union, that increases in traffic should be absorbed by the rail system, does the Commissioner not think that there is a conflict here between what we are seeking to achieve, in relation to the moving of goods in particular, and that he should at least talk to the Irish Government about establishing some coordination between the White Paper, the proposed national transport policy which the government claims it is working on, and the proposal to close the rail network in Ireland?
Mr President, Irish Rail has recently taken the decision to suspend any restructuring measures until a strategic study of the railways is published, and we expect this to be at the beginning of 2003.
The Commission hopes that this study of the Irish rail system will take account, naturally, not only of general transport policy, but also of the investments made during recent years with Community funds in the Irish railway.
Question 50 by Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye (H-0793/02):
Subject: Air transport and noise
Following the adoption of Directive 2002/30/EC
Directive 2002/30/EC lays down objectives and methods for resolving the problems of noise pollution in areas close to Community airports.
To this end, the directive describes measures which the States can apply in order to reduce noise and lays down a series of principles and rules on the methods for the evaluation of noise with a view to a reduction in levels of noise emissions.
At the moment, the Commission considers it a priority to ensure the correct incorporation of this directive into national legislations of the States of the Union, which should take place by 28 September 2003 at the latest.
This directive is one more measure in a series of measures intended to control exposure to noise around airports.
With regard to the proposal for a directive on the establishment of a Community framework for the classification of noise emissions from subsonic civilian aircraft and for the calculation of noise charges, following the first reading by the European Parliament in September, it now falls to the Council to begin examining the proposed text.
The Commission does not plan to create a single charter of rights for people living near airports.
I would like to remind the Commissioner that, about one year ago, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of people living near Heathrow airport in London whose sleep was disturbed by night flights, who received confirmation that as it happens this was indeed a violation of human rights.
This decision by the European Court of Human Rights could become case-law, to the advantage of people living near airports.
I consider, however, that the European Commission should speed up its work to take practical measures with a view to preventing these matters from being resolved through the courts.
What we need are effective European measures that would make it possible to decrease exposure to noise for people living near airports, particularly at night.
Commissioner, do you not think that Article 1 of Directive 2002/30/EC, adopted in March 2002, which provides precisely for a reduction in the amount of people exposed to noise, should be more specifically followed by practical measures to reduce the level of exposure suffered by these people?
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Question No 51, by Mr Hatzidakis, will be replied to in writing.
Questions to Mr Kinnock
Question No 52 by Gerard Collins, which has been taken over by Mr Hyland (H-0801/02):
Subject: New Berlaymont building
The main features of the contract on the purchase of the Commission's Berlaymont building were revealed on 23 October last.
The Commission's total payment will be ?553 million and its share of the renovation cost is set at ?503 million which includes ?35.6 million for enlargement purposes.
What provisions have been made for public access to the new Berlaymont building? What savings does the Commission expect to make once the need for its present 'improvised arrangements' have gone and it has returned to its original headquarters and what innovative features have been introduced to ensure that the running costs of the Berlaymont are kept to the minimum and the building will act as a symbol for a dynamic European Union?
I am very glad that interest in the Berlaymont building is spreading.
In response to the question originally tabled by Mr Collins, public access to the building was considered to be an important aspect of urban integration during the design phase of the Berlaymont renovation project.
The creation of a new public space around the building and the provision of the security glass wall are just two of the consequences of that integrative approach.
The design also ensures that, with the exception of some specialist technical installations, the Berlaymont will be fully accessible to people with mobility difficulties.
All offices, meeting rooms, interpretation booths and common spaces will be accessible either directly from the lifts or by integral ramps.
Easily visible signs and markings everywhere will also be characteristic of the building.
On the second question raised by Mr Collins, the Commission will make significant savings because the purchase of the Berlaymont building at a comparatively competitive cost puts the institution in a better negotiating position in a property market where the major participants are well aware that the Commission will vacate a number of substitute buildings when it returns to the Berlaymont in the early part of 2004.
In order to benefit fully from this situation the Commission has launched a call for an expression of interest for the provision of office space.
The final savings arising from these conditions can only be quantified precisely when the established location of all Commission offices in Brussels is clear.
It will then be possible to make accurate comparisons between the price paid by the Commission - which is stable - and market rates which are patently not going to go down in the parts of Brussels which are of particular interest to us.
In addition, unlike rental agreements that have to be renewed after a period of tenure, the cost of the Berlaymont to the Community budget is fully predictable because the annual payments of EUR 31.9 million and the annual step-up of 2% were determined when the Berlaymont contract was signed with the Belgian authorities, by me, in October.
Other cost savings which cannot easily be quantified at this stage will include the reduction of transport and communication costs between Commission offices that are now dispersed.
In addition the energy efficiency and environmentally-friendly technology of the Berlaymont, together with a design that will restrain technical maintenance costs, will bring further savings.
The financing costs issue - the third point raised by Mr Collins - is central to the project development.
The major design characteristics of the Berlaymont have already won the International 2000 Passive and Low Energy Architecture Award for the best architectural design.
A copy of an authoritative specialist article giving details of that will be sent directly to the Member concerned.
It clearly demonstrates how investment in innovative techniques in installations reduces the running and energy consumption costs significantly.
Many other aspects of the building design will keep the running costs to a minimum.
For instance, the rain water on the site will be automatically collected and recycled for flushing and for maintenance in hygiene facilities.
In Brussels, I am very glad to say, the regularity of rain water is not in doubt.
I thank the Commissioner for his usual, very comprehensive reply.
He obviously anticipated many of the supplementaries that I would be asking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Collins.
I apologise for his absence.
The Commissioner has solidly justified the expenditure in relation to the Berlaymont.
I presume he has answered many of the questions the public in general have been asking, but I am not sure if those answers will be to their satisfaction.
However, we must accept as credible the explanation given by the Commission, which I certainly do.
Could he explain why it has taken so long to complete the building?
In addition, the public in general is anxious to know how the original cost compares to the final cost?
I am grateful to the honourable Member and I will happily send to him and to Mr Collins, who I know has a longstanding interest in this matter, the full statements that were originally provided to Parliament, but I am sure the figures will be of interest.
I shall summarise at this juncture in response to the precise points that Mr Hyland raised.
One of the Commission's fundamental aims throughout the negotiations on the contract on the Berlaymont was safeguarding the interests of the European taxpayer.
The whole project has taken so long and will take some time longer - until 31 December next year - partly because of difficulties arising from the clearance of asbestos in the building which was vacated in 1991.
This clearance took about two years longer than originally planned for.
Secondly, the arrangements for managing the renovation of the Berlaymont were also delayed.
Thirdly, disputes of a variety of kinds, including litigation, have added at least several months - indeed we can probably start counting in years - to the renovation.
The problem is that delay means cost, and one of our objectives was to ensure that we only accepted a fair share of the costs.
We therefore accepted that any additions that we required, particularly in relation to the further demands of enlargement, would be met by the Commission, as is only fair.
We also wanted design adaptations to make the building fully accessible and state-of-the-art.
The net result of all that is that the actual annual price that we will pay of EUR 31.9 million per annum, at an interest rate that we negotiated in recent months, will be lower than the cost anticipated when the protocol, the memorandum of understanding, was signed between the Commission and the Belgian Government in 1997.
The overall cost of the Berlaymont meanwhile has gone up but, because of the contractual arrangements, our contribution to that cost is fixed, whereas the Belgian Government has an obligation to meet additional costs arising.
I am more than happy to provide the full figures in the communication that we gave to Parliament and the Council in October and I will see that they are with the honourable Member before tomorrow evening.
Question No 53 by Kathleen Van Brempt (H-0818/02):
Subject: Commission officials moving to private companies
The Commission encourages officials to move from the private to the public sector and vice versa.
It even has arrangements allowing officials to work for a private company for a temporary period. That is a good thing in itself.
However, the move by the head of the information policy division to Microsoft raises questions, as the official concerned was involved in the antitrust investigation into the company.
The Commission's spokesman has stated that the official was consulted by the Competition Directorate-General in connection with the investigation. He said that this did not pose a problem, as the person concerned had given assurances in a letter that he would not deal, at Microsoft, with matters being investigated by the Commission.
What guarantees does the Commission have that EU officials who go to work in the private sector will not pass on crucial information to their new employers?
Do written promises by those concerned provide sufficient guarantees?
Does the Commission agree that new rules on the secondment of EU officials are urgently needed?
If so, what precise steps does it intend to take?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for raising this question.
Leave on personal grounds from the European Union civil service is governed by Article 40 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities.
That article contains provisions that enable an established official to be granted unpaid leave on personal grounds in exceptional circumstances and at his or her own request.
As the honourable Member correctly points out, such unpaid leave may be granted when the official intends to work for a time in the private sector in order to broaden his or her knowledge and experience.
The Commission's view is that the institution benefits from such exchanges of expertise and experience and, in principle, it should therefore be encouraged.
The Commission recognises that appointment to some posts could constitute - or appear to constitute - a conflict of interest.
It is important to emphasise, therefore, that officials on personal leave continue to be subject fully to the provisions of Article 12 of the Staff Regulations, which require officials to obtain permission before engaging in any outside activity whatsoever and which also allow for refusal of permission or imposition of conditions where it is considered that the activity would otherwise be detrimental to the work of the Communities.
The Commission would interpret the creation of conflicts of interest as being detrimental to the Community and would thus refuse permission for such activities or impose conditions in order to prevent conflicts arising.
Article 17 of the Staff Regulations, meanwhile, requires officials, whether in work or on personal leave, not to disclose to any unauthorised persons information not already made public.
If an official or a former official who is working in the private sector made use of such privileged information, he or she would certainly face disciplinary proceedings.
The purpose of the letter signed by the official mentioned in the honourable Member's question was to signify his full awareness that these requirements always prevail and are unconditional.
The Staff Regulation rules governing leave on personal grounds will be clarified by the reform amendments proposed by the Commission which, as the honourable Member will know, are currently before the Council.
In addition, the Commission is examining means of providing more detailed guidance to officials and to potential employers in order to reinforce understanding of the need to ensure that the objectives of allowing exchanges between the Commission and other bodies are fulfilled, whilst also ensuring that the integrity and the security of the Commission are completely safeguarded.
As I also say in my question, I do not wish to dispute in any way that civil servants should be allowed to move on to new employment, including the private sector.
But your reply does not entirely satisfy me, Commissioner.
I want to believe in the good faith - I certainly do believe in your own good faith, let that be clear - of this civil servant.
But an impression has been created.
He was working on the anti-trust investigation into Microsoft and he leaves to join that company.
I think it should be made explicit what case is involved here.
I should certainly like to ask in future for a far clearer and more enforceable framework of agreements.
Yes, a change of jobs must be possible, but not to companies or sectors on which you yourself have worked for the Commission because this will create the appearance of partiality that damages your Commission and by extension all European institutions.
I should like once again to press the Commissioner on his future intentions.
Is it feasible to create such a framework of agreements?
Mr President, yes it is possible to have such a framework which is why I referred to the proposals now before the Council made by the Commission.
It is also why I referred to the further work that is being undertaken to clarify beyond any doubt for both potential employers and for Commission officials and former officials what the limits of activity are.
Meanwhile, the official whose case is relevant to the specific question that the honourable Member asked was granted leave and permission to work for a company after he had signed a declaration that he was aware of his obligations under the Staff Regulations and would not disclose any confidential information to his employer.
As she will understand and she was good enough to recognise both in her question and her supplementary question, in a free society, if we are trying to maintain the advantage of an interchange between the institutions and outside bodies, we must ultimately rely on the honour of civil servants as well as on the fact that they are advised and know that if they stray from the undertakings they have been required to give, they make themselves virtually automatically liable to disciplinary proceedings.
It may be of interest to the honourable Member and the House to know that, at the moment, 566 officials of the Commission are on personal leave.
Four hundred cases have so far been examined, all will be examined.
About 10% - around about 40 people - are actually engaged in professional activities.
The other 90% are on personal leave because of family or educational obligations or they are undertaking external courses.
When we have the final figures in the first week or so of next year I will certainly ensure that the honourable Member receives those in detail.
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock.
Questions to Mr Monti
As the author is not present, Question No 54, by Mr Obiols i GermÃ , lapses.
Question No 55 by Astrid Thors (H-0828/02):
Subject: Investigation of possible infringements of EU competition law by Microsoft
Will the Commission confirm that any Commission decision resulting from its present investigation of possible infringements of EU competition law by Microsoft will be taken in view of the circumstances particular to European markets and to the interests of European consumers and will include remedies sufficient to end and prevent the recurrence of any business practices of Microsoft found to have been or continuing to be in breach of EU anti-trust rules?
Is the Commission aware that, in the United States, leading consumer voices do not in fact agree that the settlement recently agreed between Microsoft and the US Department of Justice is in the best interest of consumers, despite such assertions by the parties to that settlement?
The Commission confirms that its ongoing Microsoft investigation is founded on an exhaustive analysis of the compatibility of Microsoft's business practices with the European Union anti-trust rules and hence on the effects of these practices within the EU.
The Commission intends to ensure that any final outcome is beneficial to consumers and to innovation in the markets concerned and that this outcome sets an appropriate standard by which to examine future contact.
The Commission is naturally aware of the developments in the United States' proceedings.
However, the Commission stresses that the nature of the respective cases in the EU and the US is different - both factually and legally - and hence the Commission is examining its case on the basis of the EU's anti-trust rules.
In this respect, whilst the Commission will take into account the settlement between the US Department of Justice and Microsoft, in view of the already outlined factual and legal differences between the two cases, the Commission cannot exclude seeking different remedies in certain areas.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
I noted your saying it is important, partly in the interests of innovation, to consider relevant markets.
We are now in a situation in which the software producers and a large part of the information society may be affected by this matter in the future.
At what point does the Commissioner consider that a company may be in an especially dominant position?
Will the Commission take account of those profit margins to which public reference is made, namely 85% for certain types of software?
When might the Commission be expected to reach that decision on this issue which European consumers are really waiting for?
On the question of at what point the Commission establishes that there is a dominant position, there is case-law made up of Commission decisions and judgments of the courts, on the basis of which further decisions are made.
As to your question concerning the timing, our analysis of what is a very extensive file is well advanced.
Once all the relevant information has been examined and assessed, we will be in a position to decide how best to proceed with the case.
It would be realistic to expect a final conclusion in the first part of next year.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti, for your reply.
This brings an end to this Question Time.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 56 to 102 will be replied to in writing.
Mr Oswaldo PayÃ¡, allow me to express the emotion with which we welcome you today to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.
It has been difficult to obtain your leave and re-entry visa for coming to Strasbourg.
I would like to thank all those who have worked to make it possible, including Members of the European Parliament who raised the matter with the Cuban authorities last week while there.
I asked the President of the Government of Cuba, Mr Fidel Castro, to let you come to this ceremony as a signal from the Cuban authorities of their recognition of the human rights agenda.
I am happy that this signal has been given to the European Parliament.
My dear Mr PayÃ¡, you represent for many Cubans today what Andrei Sakharov represented in the 1980s for many Soviet citizens: you represent hope.
Harassed, pursued, persecuted, prosecuted, condemned and imprisoned from your youth for your opinions, which were openly critical of the government's official policies, you nevertheless continue to work on constructing your movement, the Christian Liberation Movement for Peace.
You advocate national dialogue to enable democratic change in Cuba.
You are working tirelessly to create an alternative, non-violent democratic movement, based on a wide coalition.
Using the existing legal and political framework, you want to introduce reforms in order to initiate a process of transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Under your direction, the civil initiative 'the Varela project' was born.
This initiative calls for a referendum on open elections, freedom of speech, freedom for political prisoners and free enterprise.
To date, the project has attracted support from more than 100 organisations in Cuba and tens of thousands of individual signatures.
Together with other opposition leaders, you drafted the manifesto 'Todos Unidos' and for the first time, thanks to your action, the opposition has united together on a single initiative: the Varela project.
We recognise your endurance in the face of a barrage of obstacles.
We recognise your personal courage.
Your plan is not a theoretical construction; it does not promise heaven on earth but reminds people of basic principles for which so many have fought for so long: respect for human rights and fundamental democratic principles.
Throughout the years, the European Parliament has taken the lead in keeping human rights high on the policy agenda.
This is not, on our part, an abstract commitment; it was forged in the tragic experiences of Europe's barbaric twentieth century.
It has been used over the last 50 years to construct a vision of Europe that has learned from, but not forgotten, its past.
We are committed to the principles of democracy and respect for the universality and indivisibility of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
The Sakharov Prize celebrates that commitment annually.
The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for 2002 is awarded to Oswaldo PayÃ¡, as a tribute to his commitment to freedom of thought, democracy and reconciliation of the Cuban people.
We salute Oswaldo PayÃ¡'s decision to use the pen and not the sword, to use signatures and not bullets, to use peace and not terror, as the pathway to democracy in Cuba.
Mr PayÃ¡, to you, and through you to those who support the Varela project, we say today: 'We walk with you on your journey.
You do not walk alone.
You do not work in isolation.'
On your first ever visit anywhere outside Cuba, through you, Oswaldo PayÃ¡, the European Parliament honours all those who defend human rights, and their hard work and your hard work in building democracy from the grassroots level, step by step, person by person, day by day.
I would like to thank the President, Pat Cox, and this Parliament, which represents many of the peoples of Europe.
You have awarded the Sakharov Prize to the people of Cuba; I say this because the Cuban people richly deserve such recognition.
I say this without excluding any of my compatriots, whatever their political position, because rights do not have any particular political, racial or cultural allegiance.
Nor do dictatorships have any particular political allegiance, they are neither of the right nor of the left, they are simply dictatorships.
In my country there are thousands of men and women fighting for the rights of all Cubans in the midst of persecution.
Hundreds of them are imprisoned simply for proclaiming and defending these rights, and I am therefore accepting this award on behalf of them.
I say that this prize is for all Cubans because I believe that, by means of this prize, Europe wishes to say to them: 'You also have the right to rights'.
We were all convinced of this, but there were times when it seemed that that truth was not so evident to many people in the world.
I have not come here to ask for support for the opposition to the Cuban Government, nor to condemn those who persecute us.
It is of no help to Cuba for some people in the world to take sides with the Cuban Government or with their opponents, on the basis of ideology.
We want people to take sides with the Cuban people, with all Cubans.
And this means supporting respect for all their rights, supporting openness, supporting the demand that our people be consulted through the ballot box on the changes we are demanding.
We ask for solidarity so that our people may be given a voice through the ballot box, as the Varela Project proposes.
Many people have related this prize to the Varela Project, and they are right, because the thousands of Cubans who, in the midst of repression, have signed this referendum petition, are making a decisive contribution to the changes Cuba needs.
These changes would mean participation in economic and cultural life, they would mean political and civil rights and national reconciliation.
This would represent the true exercise of self-determination for our people.
We must put an end to the myth that we Cubans must live without rights in order to sustain the independence and sovereignty of our country.
Father FÃ©lix Varela taught us that independence and national sovereignty are inseparable from the exercise of fundamental rights.
The Cubans living in Cuba and those abroad, as one people, have the will and the ability to build a democratic, fair and free society, without hate or revenge, as JosÃ© MartÃ­ dreamt: 'With everybody and for the good of everybody'.
We have not chosen the peaceful route as a tactic, but because it is inseparable from the goal of our people.
Experience shows us that violence creates more violence and that when political changes are carried out in this way, it leads to new forms of oppression and injustice.
Our wish is that violence and force are never again used to overcome crises or unjust governments.
This time we will carry out the changes by means of this civic movement which is already opening up a new stage in the history of Cuba, in which dialogue, democratic participation and solidarity will prevail.
In that way we will build a true peace.
The heroic Cuban civic fighters, the citizens who sign the Varela Project, are not carrying arms.
We do not have a single weapon.
We are holding out both arms, offering our hands to all Cubans, as brothers, and to all the peoples of the world.
The first victory we can claim is that we do not have hate in our hearts.
We therefore say to those who persecute and try to dominate us: you are my brother, I do not hate you, but you are no longer going to dominate me through fear, I do not want to impose my truth, and I do not want you to impose yours, let us seek the truth together.
That is the liberation we are proclaiming.
There are still some people who maintain the myth of the disjunction between civil and political rights, on the one hand, and the capacity of society to build social justice and achieve development, on the other.
They are not exclusive.
The lack of political and civil rights in Cuba has had serious consequences such as inequality, poverty for the majority, privileges for a minority, the deterioration of certain services, even when they are intended to be human and positive services.
Therefore, although many Cubans have worked for years with love and good faith, today there is a serious situation in terms of civil and political rights, as well as increasing inequality and a deterioration of quality of life for the majority.
Furthermore, the hands of the citizens are tied, neutralising the Cubans' enormous potential for creativity and hard work.
That is the main cause of our poverty.
This reality cannot be justified by claiming that the Cuban people freely chose this system.
The honourable Members know that none of the peoples represented in this Parliament, nor any people in the world, would ever surrender the exercise of their fundamental rights.
It is made ever clearer that social and economic well-being and progress are the fruit of the exercise of rights.
In the same way, a democracy is not a true or complete one unless it is able to begin and sustain a process of increasing the quality of life of everyone.
Because no peoples exercise their right to vote freely in order to chose poverty and inequality, which reduce the masses to a situation of disadvantage and marginalisation.
Our Latin American peoples are calling for a real democracy, which is one within which justice can be built.
It is scandalous that, in the name of efficiency, methods are applied which are intended to overcome crisis and end poverty, but which in practice threaten to annihilate the poor.
It is not my intention to proclaim new positions or models, but our people have experienced and suffered various political and economic systems.
We know today that any method or model which, in a supposed quest for justice, development or efficiency, places itself above human beings and cancels out any of their fundamental rights leads to some form of oppression, of exclusion and brings disaster to the people.
We wish to express here our solidarity with all people suffering any kind of oppression or injustice, or who are silenced or marginalized throughout the world.
The cause of human rights is a single one, just as we have one single humanity.
While we talk today about globalisation, we declare that if we do not globalise solidarity we do not only endanger human rights, but also the right to continue as a human race.
Without human solidarity neither will we conserve a clean world in which it remains possible for human beings to live.
It is therefore my humble opinion that, rather than new models, either for societies or for relations between countries, what we need is a new spirit.
This new spirit must be expressed through solidarity, cooperation and justice in relations between countries and will not hinder development.
Because if policies and models are conditional upon the fulfilment of people, the construction of justice and democracy, if policies are humanised, then we will overcome the abyss which separates people and we will be a genuine human family.
May our message from Cuba of Peace and Solidarity reach all peoples.
All Cubans are accepting this prize with dignity and stating our hope that we can rebuild our society with the love of everybody, as brothers, as children of God.
We Cubans are simple folk and we simply wish to live in peace and to move forward with our work, but we are not able and we do not wish to live without freedom.
We place our hopes in the Lord, who was laid in a humble manger, and this is our homage to Him.
Thank you and happy Christmas.
(Standing ovation)
The next item is the report (A5-0442/2002) by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC.
[PE-CONS 3652/2002 - C5-0469/2002 - 2002/0323(COD)]
Madam President, it was nearly two years ago that the Commission adopted its proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for blood and blood components.
This was presented to the Council and Parliament in January 2001.
Considerable work has been done since then, and I welcome the constructive way in which the proposal has been addressed both in Parliament and in the Council.
Parliament has now reached a major milestone in its consideration of this proposal.
Your pending approval of this proposed directive is the culmination of considerable efforts on the part of the Council in reaching its common position, taking on many of Parliament's amendments from first reading; on the part of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in proposing amendments to that position and on the part of Parliament's delegation in reaching a constructive compromise with the Council.
May I express my sincere thanks to Mr NisticÃ² and Mr Lund in particular for their strenuous efforts in seeing this technically complex directive through to a successful conclusion in such a short time and for finding a compromise on the issue of voluntary unpaid donations.
I very much hope that the Commission's proposal for a directive on tissues and cells will be considered with the same interest and efficiency.
Madam President, I thank the Commissioner.
His contribution was short and sweet but at this stage most of the talking has been done.
I would like to thank my colleague in absentia, Mr NisticÃ², for the enormous amount of work he has done on this particular directive.
It has come back to us from conciliation quite satisfactorily.
The final issue on which the debate rested was whether a doctor would be responsible for the assessment of the eligibility of donors, whereas the Council wanted a health professional and deemed that to be sufficient.
The compromise is that both Parliament and the Council have agreed on a qualified health professional.
In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory.
Others might give it another name, but it gets us to where we want to be at this point.
I thank all those who spent a lot of time and effort in getting to this position.
The directive before us deals with the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood.
It is quite a contentious issue in many of our Member States, not least in our own.
We have had a tribunal, known as the Lindsey tribunal, which was wound up recently, having sat for some time trying to resolve the very tragic cases of patients, many of whom have since died, who received infected blood.
Other countries have had similar experiences.
One of the most important aspects of this directive is that it will restore confidence in blood transfusion services generally and in the movement of blood and blood products throughout the European Union so we can all have confidence in other Member State systems in relation to it.
This new directive, together with the existing Directive 89/381/EEC, will ensure that binding Community legislation will apply now to blood and blood products whatever the intended purpose.
Apart from blood and blood products, it will also cover the whole area of patients donating their own blood prior to surgery in hospitals and cover regulation in that area specifically as well.
There was quite a lot of contention at earlier readings on this directive as to whether all donations had to be voluntary or unremunerated.
That should be the culture; that must be the ethos we foster.
While we should never risk rare blood groups or rare blood products being unavailable to patients through our unwillingness to pay, that must be the exception.
Payment can take many forms in terms of expenses or just compensating for lost hours at work, as distinct from profit in terms of payment.
The views of the patient groups, which were very strong at first and second reading, were that we must not rule out remuneration, but it must not be the rule.
We must continue with the voluntary ethos.
I welcome the return of this report from conciliation and I hope it will not be too long before all our Member States transpose it and it becomes law.
I should like to thank Mr NisticÃ² and Commissioner Byrne for the sterling work they have done on this matter.
The outcome of the conciliation will mean our now having obtained high minimum levels of safety and quality where blood and blood components used for transfusion are concerned.
Requirements are being set in terms of staff qualifications, the operation of blood banks, the testing of donated blood and also efficient supervision and monitoring.
The most controversial issue has of course been that of whether blood should be given without the donors' actually being remunerated.
I believe it is well documented that voluntary and unremunerated donation provides the best blood quality, especially if there is a permanent body of donors.
The different rules in the Member States have meant, however, that we have not been able to decide that unremunerated donation should apply in all the Member States from day one.
I am nonetheless very pleased that the directive now refers to the European Council's proper definition of unremunerated blood donation.
I am also very pleased that the Member States are now to make arrangements for encouraging voluntary, unremunerated blood donation and that, every three years, they are to submit reports to the Commission concerning the arrangements they have made.
Finally, I think it is important that the individual Member State be entitled to maintain or introduce the requirement for voluntary and unremunerated blood donation, a requirement that also includes a ban on the import of blood and blood components not donated in accordance with these principles of non-remuneration.
I definitely think that the directive we have now arrived at will make an important contribution to the safety and the quality of blood donation in Europe.
Madam President, Commissioner Byrne, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I in turn would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², for the quality and rigour of his work. It is a great pity he is not here this evening to reap the rewards, as it were.
That said, I am glad that this joint text was adopted in the Conciliation Committee.
It was vital to ensure the same high level of safety of blood donations and transfusions throughout the Union, just as all the improvements made to the legislative text throughout the procedure were vital.
These improvements included, first of all, a great victory for blood donors and patients: the insertion of a specific chapter on blood monitoring which covers traceability and notification of incidents and serious unwanted reactions.
The Liberal Group believed this to be particularly important, quite simply, I would say, because the need for this type of monitoring requires no further proof in Europe.
Blood monitoring networks are a vital tool for making the transfusion chain as safe as possible.
On the thorny issue of benevolent donations, my interpretation differs from that of Mr Lund.
I am pleased to see that common sense has won the day, as of the second reading.
I welcome the fact that the joint text, while strongly encouraging voluntary, benevolent donations - which is the aim of Article 20 - allows the Member States room for manoeuvre to use remunerated donors in a strictly-regulated environment.
I need not remind you that the Union imports no less than 50% of plasma-derived therapeutic products, and that haemophiliacs, patients suffering from serious burns and other patients desperately need these products.
In this regard, determined implementation of a policy to provide patients with recombinant factors is more necessary than ever in Europe.
The Liberal Group also wanted the text to contain a reference to scientific and technical progress.
This concern was addressed in Article 29, which, in particular, lays down clear guidelines for establishments performing blood transfusions.
Lastly, the conciliation procedure has put the finishing touches to the excellent work carried out by the three institutions on this matter.
The only point of contention, which I shall mention briefly, is the matter of medical examination prior to donation, which has already been raised.
I am pleased, once again, that the Conciliation Committee considers it sufficient to require this examination to be carried out by a qualified health professional.
I believe it is silly, as I have said since first reading, to go against certain national practices that give excellent results.
I am thinking in particular, although not exclusively, of the awareness campaigns and donations in mobile units that could come to an end if we were to require the presence of a doctor.
The European Union is not immune to accidents, of course, or even the appearance of a new virus.
North America is currently experiencing a blood product safety alert caused by a virus from a western island.
We must therefore increase monitoring, apply the early detection principle for any use of blood, and ensure traceability from donor to recipient.
That is the price of establishing a blood chain that will renew the confidence of European citizens.
Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak this evening about this particularly important, even vital, matter, in the true meaning of the term. I am pleased on behalf of my group, the GUE/NGL Group, but also personally, as someone who has long been a staunch advocate of blood donation and a blood donor.
Blood donations, as many will know, have an incomparable human dimension, which concerns us all.
First of all, I shall state some telling figures.
They only concern France, I am afraid, but I would imagine they could generally be applied to most of the Member States of the Union.
In France, 8 000 donations are required every day to save 60 000 lives each year and carry out 800 000 transfusions.
The victim of a road accident might need the participation of ten to thirty people to ensure their survival, and yet only 5% of people give blood.
We are therefore entitled to ask why there are so few blood donors.
I know the European Commission understood - and I thank it for that - a fundamental part of the problem when defining the objective of its proposal for December 2000.
Its aim is to increase public confidence in the safety of blood and blood products and thus achieve self-sufficiency within the European Union.
I shall not speak tonight about the contaminated blood scandals, which understandably shook this confidence and which, furthermore, brought down some political leaders who sinned through lack of vigilance, not to say incompetence.
Without forgiving or forgetting anything, I would prefer to concentrate on three questions.
What must we do now to restore this confidence?
How can we encourage people to give blood more frequently and persuade more people to give?
Thirdly, does the solution not lie in the remuneration of donors, as certain European States already practise this system?
In response to this last question, I would say straight away that the answer, for me, is 'no'.
Definitely not.
Blood and blood products are not goods.
Incidentally, I would note that some people, here and there, and even in this Parliament, who vehemently defend ethical principles on matters relating to human genetics, have no problem defending the option of payment being given for blood, and therefore payment being given for the human body.
I shall say no more for now, as I do not want to get angry.
I must also, however, refer to the sickening trafficking that takes place in countries where people have no other means of survival but to sell blood or other organs.
That is why we must stand firm on this matter, in order to avoid any deviation, scandal or attack on human dignity and the ethical principles we share and hold dear.
Blood donations must therefore remain based on the principles of free consent, anonymity and benevolence.
I feel this is something that should not even be up for discussion.
Of course, we must distinguish between remuneration for blood as such and reimbursement of costs incurred in order to give blood: refreshments and snacks, reimbursement of transport costs, and time taken from work to give blood.
The proposal put forward in this area is along the right lines.
It has been strengthened and clarified to very positive effect by the European Parliament.
I shall take this opportunity to congratulate Professor NisticÃ² warmly on the quality of his work.
Lastly, it is important to emphasise certain essential points: blood quality and safety standards, more stringent specifications on the acceptability of blood and plasma donors, and testing of blood donations in the European Community.
In conclusion, I would say that, in terms of the points that were the subject of contention, I can accept the results obtained through the conciliation procedure with regard to the guarantee of traceability and the quality of the staff directly involved in collection, testing, processing and storage.
For all these reasons, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can vote in favour of this report and would call on you to do the same.
It is our responsibility to help increase public awareness of this gesture, which saves the lives of tens of thousands of people each year, a gesture that could be more common in future, so that our needs can be met in a human and ethical manner.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the other speakers who have said that this conciliation procedure went well from Parliament's point of view, considering the original position we were in.
It is essential that matters like these that are so important for human life, such as the quality of blood and its safety, are guaranteed everywhere in Europe.
For this reason, I think progress was being made in this matter when the objective was voluntary donation and non-remuneration.
It must certainly be considered regrettable that this objective has not been fully realised, although I believe we shall move in this direction in future discussions on the subject.
The wording of the conciliation decision also refers to this.
As has been said here, blood or its components cannot be commercial goods.
This is more about a gift from one person to another and that is the way it should be seen.
When in conciliation the greatest worry in the final stages was what level of health professional should carry out a health examination of donors, in my opinion the final outcome was very good indeed.
It is important that it should be a health professional: we also have to have confidence in others than those practising the profession of doctor.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Commission statement on the presence of nitrofurans and other prohibited substances in poultry and shrimps.
Commissioner, you have the floor.
Madam President, in 1966 the Community first established a comprehensive system to monitor and control the presence of residues in food of animal origin from the Member States and from third countries.
This system involves the setting up of a residue monitoring plan as well as a legal framework to allow for official controls and a practical infrastructure for laboratory testing.
This legislation requires Member States and third countries exporting to the EU to submit annually a monitoring plan for residues in products of animal origin.
Monitoring should be targeted at detecting illegal treatment of animals and at controlling compliance with the maximum residue limits for veterinary medicinal products, the maximum levels for pesticides and the maximum levels set in relevant legislation covering environmental contaminants.
The residue plans are subject to an extensive evaluation procedure.
Only those third countries that have submitted satisfactory residue monitoring plans are allowed to export to the European Union and be included in the appropriate list.
This list is kept under constant review in order to take into account the results of the evaluation of the annual updates of residue monitoring plans.
However, this approach must be complemented by measures on the ground.
First, import controls must be carried out by the Member States at the external borders of the Union.
Secondly, the Food and Veterinary Office verifies how the residue plans are implemented in the Member States and third countries.
Over the last year, we have been particularly concerned about discoveries of banned veterinary medicinal products - namely chloramphenicol and nitrofurans - in food of animal origin.
These substances are banned for use in food-producing animals in the European Union because it has not been possible to set a safe level of residues due to their toxic effects on human beings.
The Commission has not hesitated to take measures whenever this problem has arisen.
For example, imports from China of all products derived from farmed animals, including aquaculture, have been banned on the basis of the conclusions of an FVO mission, underpinned by discoveries of contaminated food.
In other cases, it has not been necessary to ban imports, as the third countries concerned have initiated extensive action plans to resolve the problems - in particular the testing of all consignments exported to the European Union and suspension of the offending establishments.
These measures taken in third countries are complemented by strict, mandatory import controls to provide sufficient guarantees.
This is the case for both Thailand and Brazil.
The Commission will ensure the maintenance of the necessary level of scrutiny on imported products to ensure a consistent approach to consumer safety.
The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is the tool to disseminate all relevant information between Member States and the Commission, as well as to third countries.
Let me say that it is not just in relation to third country imports that the Commission has identified problems of residues in food.
Indeed, residues monitoring plans carried out by Member States also enabled the identification of contamination cases in food produced in the European Union.
Some concerns have been raised - and the issue has been raised and the question sent to the Commission by Parliament - about the cancellation of FVO inspection missions to the third countries from which contaminated products have been identified.
Perhaps I should explain the background to this.
Indeed the Commission has postponed a number of planned missions in respect of residues. These include missions to Brazil and Thailand.
It is considered that such missions would be a waste of valuable resources at this moment as 100% testing is in place for poultrymeat from Brazil and Thailand and for shrimps from Thailand.
Consignments which test positive are destroyed.
These measures are necessary because there are serious failings in residue controls in the countries concerned.
It is not necessary to send a mission team to establish what is already known.
In the case of China there is already a comprehensive ban in place on exports to the European Union on a range of products and increased testing is in place for other products.
It is premature to carry out a mission now, as the Commission is not convinced that the necessary preparatory measures have been put in place.
Instead it is considered best to await concrete evidence of progress in the form of regulatory controls, such as legislation and so on.
However, in the coming months, FVO missions could be deemed necessary to assess the implementation of actions and the changes introduced by the third countries concerned in the area of residue monitoring.
The FVO programme of inspection for 2003 mentions such missions.
That is the position in regard to the issues that have been raised in the questions.
I am happy to outline that for Parliament.
Madam President, Commissioner, I think this is a very wide ranging and difficult subject.
I have listened very carefully to what you have said and I come now to a topic that I would have liked to have put before you earlier in writing.
But I believe that a joint effort may perhaps still elicit an answer from you.
Nitrofurans is a generic term.
One very important product it covers is Nifursol.
Nifursol is the last histomonostat still to be permitted in the EU for use as an additive in poultry feed to prevent blackhead disease.
I admit I am not a scientist.
According to my information, however, experts say that this product was banned for good in Regulation 2377/90.
The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) was asked by the Commission to make a risk assessment of Nifursol.
Investigations that will give a definite answer have yet to be carried out.
Because I also have the feed additives report, I have now heard the alarm bells ringing, because many who are concerned with this matter fear there will be a treatment crisis in a few months' time.
As a logical consequence of the ban on nitrofurans in Regulation 2377/90, Regulation 1756/2002 was issued on 23 September 2002, banning Nifursol from 31 March 2003.
When this ban comes into force on 31 March, there will, for example, be a crisis in the treatments used to combat blackhead disease in turkeys.
No alternative remedy is available legally in the EU, either as a feed additive or as a veterinary medicine.
The consequences of the ban will hit both fatteners and consumers.
The consequences are a treatment emergency, a painful end for large stocks of birds, jeopardy for turkey farms, the development of an uncontrollable black market, and an increase in imports of poultry from third countries, where many substances that are banned in the EU are used with few or any controls.
Only last week antibiotics of the nitrofuran group that are banned in the EU were found again in cheap imports of meat from third countries.
Logically, mixed feed manufacturers will now have to stop using Nifursol by January 2003 at the latest if there is to be no more such feed in the silos by the beginning of March.
My question to you this evening, although I do not know whether you can answer it, is: what solutions do we now have available?
Personally I find it hard to understand how the Commission can on the one hand, in the report in my possession, on the Commission's draft of which we worked very hard - approve the use of histomonostats,-- while on the other hand, in another regulation, banning the only product in existence on this market.
I therefore have a few questions. What are we to say to the fatteners?
What are they to do?
What forms of treatment are available to them?
And secondly, is the Commission aware that European production is continuing to decline, is disappearing from the market in the European Union and that we are being increasingly exposed to third country imports of turkey meat, although we still do not know what quality standards those imports come up to?
I think I can be brief but would very much like to respond to the Commissioner's reply.
I believe that it is particularly important to acknowledge the problem in the first instance.
However, I had the feeling that the Commissioner did not wish to acknowledge at all that there is a problem at this moment in the Union as regards the presence of a number of forbidden antibiotics in, for example, chickens and prawns.
We all know, Commissioner, that you are especially concerned and are making great efforts to ensure food safety and this House, across all party boundaries, supports you in that.
But it is very important - and we still have doubts about this - that the same statutory framework should be applied to products produced in the EU and for products marketed in the EU.
I believe this is precisely where the sticking point is.
I come from Belgium where we had the dioxin crisis, which is certainly not unknown to you.
On that occasion, the Commission acted in a draconian manner against Belgium.
You were right, quite right to take strict measures and one of your main accusations related to the fact that the Member State failed to give sufficient information.
I believe that we are now in a similar situation.
We have no alternative but to acknowledge the problem and therefore we regret the fact that the inspection mission did not go ahead, since we are convinced that you did not have sufficient reason.
I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable that trade relations should be revoked to ensure that certain inspections do not take place or that lower or different standards should be applied.
I should have therefore preferred a number of more concrete answers to the questions, since I do not have the impression that you dealt with them properly.
I also think that you can provide a better answer in order to reassure the consumer that what eventually finds its way onto his plate is safe.
Madam President, Commissioner, there are two areas that give us cause for concern.
The health of consumers is, of course, one of them, but there is also the position of producers here if we are not able to ensure that what may not be used here, may not be used outside the EU either.
The question is, who produces these substances and how can they get into the European Union?
You have now said there are intensive controls, but - if I understood that correctly - foreign missions are unnecessary because we find bad conditions there anyway.
So we do not need to go there.
I have heard that today's meeting of the Standing Committee was to have discussed removing Thailand again from the list of countries that must be subject to special inspections.
On what basis was that decision to be taken?
I have also heard that you have announced inspection missions to those countries for next year.
What reason do you now have to assume that those missions will be worthwhile?
I think that, if these countries do not meet our requirements, they should be put on the list, and then they cannot supply us until they can guarantee that the products they supply to the European Union meet our standards.
There is another problem that needs to be clarified. What happens to the shrimps, poultry meat and turkey that is imported into the Union and does not meet our requirements?
Is it sent back?
What is done with it?
As we have been saying about food waste for a long time, a ban is not enough.
We saw that with the shrimps from China, which somewhere found their way into animal feed and by that route got into the food chain again.
What I would therefore like is for you to put forward a clear plan that we, who have to justify ourselves as parliamentarians - including to the Commission - can stand by and say that the Commission, the European Union, is being strict enough here.
We cannot have it perceived to be true that you say the Commission enters into trade relations with some countries and is less strict with them, even though doubts have arisen about that recently.
I hope you will be able to clear this up in your reply.
Madam President, it seems like only yesterday that the Commissioner and I were talking about other issues regarding the safety of some of these foodstuffs.
Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised?
He has just told us that the FVO missions to Brazil and Thailand, and probably elsewhere, were cancelled because 100% testing is now in place within the Member States.
If the Commissioner did not say that, then I misheard him.
It is certainly true that in some of those Member States - notably Germany and the Netherlands - considerable concern has been expressed about the degree of nitrofuran residues in poultry and the extent to which even a very sophisticated Member State cannot guarantee by itself the degree of testing.
The issue is not only what happens within the Member State - as the Commissioner knows, there have been a whole series of rapid alerts during 2002.
I would like to know how many rapid alerts throughout the European Union have been proclaimed in this calendar year as a result of this continuing anxiety about carcinogens like nitrofuran when residues are discovered in imports.
I would like to know whether or not he feels that poultry imports from countries like Brazil give cause for serious concern.
I would like the Commissioner to put on record the opinion of the Commission and its own residues experts on the number of tonnes of poultry from the states in question that have passed into the European Union without proper inspection.
My information is that something like 2000 tonnes of Brazilian poultry have entered the EU in this way.
How close does the Commissioner believe we are to achieving 100% safety testing in the Member States?
Why are these missions being postponed?
Is the SANCO DG under pressure from other directorates?
Are there questions here about endangering trade talks, meaning that one should not throw suspicion on any other states?
If that is the case, it is not a sufficient answer to give to those whose primary concern is - as is the Commission's - food safety.
Finally, how soon will these proposed missions take place?
The Commissioner said earlier today in the debate on foot and mouth disease that he did not like disguised forms of protectionism - nor do I. However, I do not like disguised forms of concealment either, where there is a risk.
If the money is not available and that is why these FVO missions have been postponed - tell us so.
There are members of the Committee on Budgets here now.
Parliament is very keen to support you, but we need candour in order to do it.
Madam President, Commissioner, in the past we might have talked about pigs' ears, today it looks more like fishy goings-on.
We read today in communication COM (2002) 422, which was presented yesterday, that a firm has imported shrimps with very high nitrofuran levels - 20 mg - from Vietnam via Ostend into Germany and then on to Austria and Luxembourg as well as selling them in Germany.
How is that possible?
This communication is dated 25 November, but only today, nearly four weeks later, is there an early alert.
Why were four weeks allowed to elapse?
I would like you to give me, and Luxembourg's consumers, a clear answer.
My second question is this. On 2 October you relaxed controls for Vietnam.
That is a Commission decision.
I will read you what it says:
Mr President, firstly I would like to say how grateful I am to Members of Parliament for raising these important issues.
Let me also say that I am sure all of you may well accept this as a valuable contribution to debates in Parliament but sometimes general questions are followed up by extremely detailed questions that can best be responded to in correspondence.
However, I will do my best to answer such questions as you have raised.
I have taken notes and if I am not able to deal with technical issues of a specific nature, I will respond to the questioner in writing.
The issues that have been raised centre around the question of why the inspections were suspended and when these inspections will be resumed.
As I indicated in my earlier contribution, these inspections were suspended either because there was a ban on the importation of products from that country or because in the two countries in question there was 100% testing in respect of all products coming from those countries.
It is expected that the controls that are put in place in Member States effectively carry out the job that they are supposed to do because it is understood that these inspections have to be 100%.
Therefore it is important that they reveal any residues in any of the foods that are designated for testing.
When the tests show positive, I want to confirm, as I indicated earlier, that these products are destroyed.
A number of you raised the question whether there were doubts about standards and whether there was any pressure being put on the Commission and on DG SANCO in particular by other DGs in relation to the carrying out of tests or the changing of procedures, either by suspending FVO inspections in third countries or by not doing so.
I confirm to the House considerations of that kind never impinge on a decision in relation to food safety.
I have made that point here in this Parliament on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it now.
Inevitably you meet representatives from the developing countries that we are talking about and often others, sometimes Members of Parliament, who make the suggestion that perhaps the European Union is putting in place precautionary barriers in place of tariff barriers.
This is an important issue and has to be taken into account, but I have always responded by saying that the protection of public health, the protection of consumers and the maintenance of the standards that consumers expect in relation to the importation of food must come first.
I have to assure Members of Parliament who raised this question that the decisions that are taken in relation to these kinds of issues - testing for residues - are strictly based on the scientific analysis and judgement of the technical and scientific staff in DG SANCO, who give their advice as to the appropriate way forward in respect of these issues.
No other political or trade consideration is ever taken into account.
That simply does not happen.
On the question of when the inspections will be resumed, that will happen in the spring, but there is not much point in sending inspectors to third countries - or the ones I have been describing - to carry out tests to determine what we know already, to confirm the continuation of either a ban or 100% testing.
The only conclusion that is being suggested by those who raised this question is that, if these tests and inspections continue and if it is found that there are still residues or that 100% testing is an inefficient and inadequate response, we should there and then decide to put in place a ban on the importation of foods from those developing countries.
That is a very serious decision to take.
We have to determine whether it is a proportionate response to a risk that may exist to the consumers of the European Union, bearing in mind not just trade considerations but the kinds of consideration I am sure questioners have in mind here today.
I know that you have concerns about the welfare of and benefits to developing countries also.
This is not an inconsiderable issue.
In deciding what is an appropriate response, we have to take into account all of these considerations and make sure that we come to proportionate responses.
One of the most difficult aspects of my job in dealing with food safety is to come up with solutions that are proportionate.
Very often, when you are too hard, people will point that out. Sometimes when they believe that you are too weak, the other side will point that out.
It is not always possible to keep everybody happy on all occasions.
But I am satisfied, bearing in mind the rigour with which inspectors from the Food and Veterinary Office carry out their work and the reports they make, which are made available to the public on the Internet for all of us to read, as well as the work that is undertaken by the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that where 100% testing is required, that is done.
That appears to me to be the proportionate response to the risk that may have been identified.
All the time we keep this under review.
In the event that a problem arises, to the extent that it arose in China, it was felt that the only appropriate response in those circumstances was a ban.
As a consequence, a ban was placed on the importation of chickens, crustaceans, honey and one or two other products.
That was the appropriate response in those circumstances.
If we come to the conclusion that is the appropriate response in respect of other countries which seek to trade with the European Union and send food here, as distinct from the continuation from a 100% control programme, that will happen.
But we have not reached that view in respect of the two countries I have identified.
The more detailed and technical questions that have been raised by many of you I have taken note of.
I will ensure that each of you receives a response in writing in due course.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the report (A5-0437/2002) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 24th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (pentabromodiphenyl ether, octabromodiphenyl ether) [PE-CONS 3664/2002 - C5-0500/2002 - 2001/0018(COD)]
Madam President, Mr Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank my 12 colleagues in the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee.
I can see Mr Bowe, Mrs SchÃ¶rling, Mr Lund, and Mrs Van Brempt, all of whom have firmly and vigorously defended consumers' right to safe, effective flame retardants.
This joint text could not have been prepared without the efficient work of the Danish Presidency - who will receive the message - and the Commission either, of course.
We have come so far since 16 January 2001, when the Commission submitted this proposal for a directive which, I would remind you, was aimed at prohibiting the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether alone, a brominated flame retardant used, in particular, in the manufacture of polyurethane foam, a chemical substance that is harmful to our environment and our health.
It is found at high concentrations, in particular in breast milk, with a significant risk of contamination in infants.
Logically, therefore, at first reading Parliament pronounced itself in favour of prohibiting pentaBDE in all its forms, thus confirming the red card that the Commission had shown it.
There was therefore unanimity with regard to this first substance.
Having said this, Parliament, in its vote of September 2001, also wanted this proposal to cover the two sister substances, octabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether.
Given the strong indications of the hazardous nature of octabromodiphenyl ether, both for the environment and public health, the European Parliament, once again with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of immediate prohibition.
Parliament, however, chose to show decabromodiphenyl ether the yellow card, by proposing to defer its prohibition to 1 January 2006 at the latest and make it conditional upon the final results of a risk analysis.
This approach strictly applied the precautionary principle and was not, at this point, shared by either the Council in its common position or the Commission in its amended proposal.
In this kind of matter, where chemical substances are in the dock, debate is always tricky.
We needed to establish a fragile balance between obvious advantages in terms of fire safety and equally proven disadvantages in some cases in terms of health and the environment.
It is this balance in risk management, taking account of factors as varied as scientific risk assessment, proportionality and cost-benefit analysis, that was at the heart of the discussions within our Conciliation Committee.
Three trialogues were eventually necessary to bring together the various points of view and reach a compromise that was acceptable to all, mainly where decabromodiphenyl ether was concerned, since, I must emphasise, as regards octabromodiphenyl ether, the pressure exerted by Parliament paid off.
This pressure contributed to the swift, eventually negative conclusion of the risk assessment and convinced the Council to support us in prohibiting the use of this substance.
In the case of decabromodiphenyl ether, the insertion in the joint text of a recital inviting the Commission to immediately assess the results of the risk reduction strategy, expected by 30 June next year at the latest, seems to me to be objectively the first compromise we have been able to achieve at this stage because, in this case, contrary to the case of octabromodiphenyl ether, in the absence of a final risk reduction strategy and, in particular, in the absence of risks to human health - the conclusions of the French rapporteur are definite in this regard - this deferment accompanied by strict conditions is justified.
It should, however, be pointed out that decabromodiphenyl ether, which is mainly used in insulating products, in construction and textiles, is a particularly effective, fire-resistant flame retardant.
In the United Kingdom alone, in the year 2000, 155 lives were saved and 4 537 injuries avoided by the presence of this kind of substance in furniture upholstery.
So much effort has been put into reaching this agreement in the Conciliation Committee.
I sometimes had the impression, as rapporteur, that I was acting as a member of the European office for chemical products rather than a representative elected directly by the citizens because of the cumbersome, slow risk assessment process with little transparency.
It has taken almost ten years for brominated fire retardants, which are included in the list of priority substances, to be assessed at last.
I sincerely hope that this textbook case will enable the Commission and, in particular, the Member States, to understand the need, when preparing future legislation on chemical products, to establish a new assessment method that is swifter, more effective and more transparent, a REACH system which, as proposed by the resolution adopted by Parliament in November 2001, is based on a genuine risk management strategy at Community level.
In conclusion, and I shall go back to my footballing metaphor, whereas the Commission, in its initial proposal, only gave half a red card to pentabromodiphenyl ether, Parliament and the Council, as fair, impartial referees, give two red cards to pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether and a yellow card to decabromodiphenyl ether, as the essential aim is to reconcile citizens' immediate safety from fire hazards with the more long-term benefits in the field of public health and the environment.
The joint text to be submitted to Parliament tomorrow fulfils this dual objective.
For all these reasons, I would ask my fellow Members to support it.
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their interest in this proposal and especially Mrs Ries, the rapporteur, for her constructive work, as well as the delegation of the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee.
This is an important directive, as it would introduce a ban on substances that have been identified as dangerous brominated flame-retardants posing unacceptable risks to human health and the environment.
It is a far-reaching proposal as it bans the marketing and use of all articles containing these substances.
The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives.
Furthermore, the proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and of the environment but it would also preserve the internal market, as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.
The conciliation procedure that is about to be concluded has benefited from the fact that the risk assessment and the risk reduction strategy for ocataBDE became available in July of this year.
We were therefore able to include 'octa' in this directive.
The Commission believes that this is a positive outcome.
Considering the discussions about the extension of the ban to the third brominated flame retardant, decaBDE, this requires further examination and finalisation of the currently ongoing risk assessment.
Simultaneously, a risk reduction strategy will be developed.
This is an important step in the procedure. It will allow the right balance to be found between the protection of health and the environment, on the one hand, and the need for effective fire protection on the other.
As the risk assessment procedure and the risk reduction strategy will be completed in the next few months, the Commission will soon be able to propose justified measures.
In conclusion, I am very glad about the successful cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council and hope that this important directive can now be finalised.
Madam President, like the previous two speakers I welcome this report and I praise the rapporteur for her work.
The initial proposal to ban the use of the flame retardant pentaBDE was not considered by Parliament to be adequate, as closely related substances - octaBDE and decaBDE - were not included.
Furthermore, Parliament was dissatisfied with the speed at which the risk assessment was being carried out, as this was delaying any real concrete decisions.
No one underestimates the value and importance of these substances: they are very effective flame retardants and they save lives.
However, they appear to have dangerous effects on the environment and public health and, therefore, we felt something had to be done.
I am sure that Parliament is pleased that the original proposal is now developed and that octaBDe has also been banned.
However, Parliament cannot be totally happy about the fate of decaBDE, which remains to be decided.
Parliament would like a clear date for action on this.
The fate of this remaining substance is still hanging in the balance.
We need clear reassurance from the Council and the Commission - by way of an insertion of a paragraph in the text during conciliation - that prompt, immediate action will be taken when the results of the risk assessment become available, as promised, in June 2003.
I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight.
On this basis, the PSE Group can support this proposal, which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning.
Madam President, Mrs Ries has done an excellent job of reporting on the negotiations at conciliation and on the problems that have arisen in connection with these.
Those of us in Parliament's delegation can be very satisfied with the simple fact that we succeeded in bringing about a settlement that also included octaBDE, meaning of course that it will be possible to introduce a ban more quickly.
I nonetheless see it as a failure in terms of EU environmental and health protection that the Commission and the Council did not comply with Parliament's proposal also to include decaBDE in the ban.
At least 75% to 80% of all use of brominated flame retardants involves deca, and the risk assessment we have available to us shows that decaBDE should have been banned immediately.
A longer wait will involve further risks to public health.
These substances are long-lived and bio-accumulative.
They are stored in living organisms, and they cause changes in the behaviour of animals used in experiments.
Deca may also be converted into pentaBDE and octaBDE, which are precisely what the Council wishes to ban.
It can also be converted into brominated dioxins.
The scientific evidence is so worrying in terms of public health and the environment that the European Chemicals Bureau recommended the Member States to take a political decision or, more specifically, to employ the precautionary principle.
In June 2002, the competent authority for the Member States considered it was necessary to take measures without delay.
In conclusion, I have to say that the outcome is a failure in terms of EU environmental and health policy.
I therefore believe that Mrs Ries will understand why my group will abstain from voting in the final vote.
Mr President, I should like very much to thank Mrs Ries for the sterling work she has done on this matter.
It is of course a good example of the European Parliament's being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in Europe.
The Commission only proposed a ban on the marketing and use of one of the dangerous flame retardants, pentaBDE, and, following demands by Parliament, the directive was successfully extended so that the final result arrived at by the conciliation committee also includes two further flame retardants.
With regard to octaBDE, the risk assessment has clearly revealed that the substance entails obvious risks for the environment and public health, and it has now also, happily, been agreed to implement an immediate ban on the use of this substance.
As far as the third substance, decaBDE, is concerned, the Member States and the Commission, on the other hand, initially maintained their opposition to a ban.
A majority of the conciliation committee chose to defer to that state of affairs, so that decaBDE is only included in a recital in the directive and - if, quoting Mrs Ries, I may put it this way - has only been given a yellow card.
It is safe to say that it will be the environment and public health that, for some time still to come, will now bear the risk of the use of this substance.
I find that very unfortunate, and it illustrates of course the importance, in the chemicals area, of our being able to reverse the burden of proof so that it is the producers who have to show that the substances they use pose no risk to the environment and to human beings.
Unlike Mrs SchÃ¶rling, however, I believe that the outcome, whereby the result of the conciliation is being adopted, is, in spite of everything, a clear improvement upon the current situation.
That is why I shall vote in favour of the conciliation proposal and the outcome of the conciliation in the final vote tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0438/2002) by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint texts approved by the Conciliation Committee for European Parliament and Council Directives on:
1. waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)
[PE-CONS 3663/2002 - C5-0486/2002 - 2000/0158(COD)]
2. the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment
[PE-CONS 3662/2002 - C5-0487/2002 - 2000/0159(COD)]
Madam President, this is a difficult text.
Over the last 18 months a lot of people have asked me, 'What is all this that you are doing in Europe with electronic waste?
What is the point of it?'
The point is quite simply that a few years ago we in the European Union decided that we wanted to operate a sustainable policy in the economic, environmental and social fields.
Six million tonnes of electronic waste every year contain an enormous quantity of valuable materials that we want to reuse in future.
That is the reason for this directive.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Conciliation Committee, and also to the Commissioner and the members of the Council who, I think, have scored a minor victory with this report on electronic waste.
They enabled us to reach agreement on difficult points.
We were, for example, able to state that from 2005 consumers will be more or less enjoined by their Member States - I would have preferred it to have been compulsory - not to throw appliances in the dustbin in future, but to collect them separately.
We have set binding targets.
Unfortunately, Europe is always outstanding in its unlimited use of undefined legal terms.
The hurdles we have set in this directive today are not very high, but they are nevertheless defined and binding.
I think that can be called a success.
Unfortunately, we are still rather vague about how such materials will be treated in future, but we have used the best available technology.
I know only too well that in my country the term 'best available technology' is interpreted in 16 different ways, because Germany has 16 federal states.
There are bound to still be loopholes, but we have nevertheless made real progress in the field of recycling quotas, too.
I believe the quotas for industry are achievable and no one can say we are asking too much.
In 2005, citizens will be able to take their products to a collection point free of charge, unless the Member State goes a step further.
The Member States can decide that individually.
I think our agreement on 'individual financing' was a great success.
It is a step forward because we would like to have a guidance instrument and those who today are building computers that lend themselves to recycling - like this one, for example - should also be rewarded and those who want to continue producing boring old-fashioned ones in the future should be asked to contribute to the high costs of disposal.
There were actually countries that did not want to take this approach.
I am pleased to say that by working night and day with the help of other members in other groups we were able to persuade them to agree after all.
Following on from the packaging regulation and the end-of-life vehicles regulation, this individual liability is the first step towards a really sustainable environmental policy which, combined with economic policy, has my full support.
We may have succeeded in shutting out the free riders that there always are with such a system.
There are big firms that order 100 000 refrigerators from the Pacific region just before Christmas and fail to put a logo on them so that the small trader or the citizen has to pick up the bill later.
We have made labelling compulsory so that the costs can also be assigned and resources will be available for recycling, however the Member States do it - and we are more than willing to leave that to subsidiarity.
The important thing is the guarantee that it is done, and the text reflects that concern.
That old appliances must be managed and also paid for - in this case collectively - by the undertakings currently in existence on the market is not in question because there is no other system for doing it.
We have, however, left Member States the possibility of disclosing how it is financed so that there can be a 'visible fee', or whatever you want to call it, for old stock.
I believe this was also a good step.
I would have been pleased if, when debating end-of-life vehicles and electronic waste, we could have had a more aggressive and longer debate about how we might do more to encourage a flow of secondary raw materials in future.
Unfortunately, we are still very fond of using new primary materials but always tend to turn up our noses at secondary materials.
I might go so far as to say we should give such secondary raw materials preferential VAT treatment.
That is not necessarily my group's normal position.
I do, however, believe it would be an incentive to bring about real sustainability in this area.
That is what it is really about, ladies and gentlemen.
We want to reuse raw materials in future.
By motivating undertakings to build appliances in such a way that they can be recycled, we have found a free-market way of getting the parties concerned round the same table, and I do not need to tell anyone that for me that is an important reason.
I was also very pleased to have the NGOs fighting alongside us on this question and that the undertakings and NGOs adopted a joint resolution in support of our efforts.
Nothing like that has happened before in the time I have been in this House - and that is thirteen and a half years.
I would at this point also like to thank those colleagues who stayed on board in difficult moments.
There are always plenty who fall by the wayside when the going gets tough.
Again and again colleagues stuck with it whenever there was pressure from the Council, and in the end, that gave us this success - as did the excellent cooperation you gave us, Commissioner.
Basically, though, this directive does have two parts.
The second part is the question of how we are to deal with hazardous substances such as cadmium, lead and hexavalent chromium in future.
I think we have made a small amount of progress here.
Ultimately, this is about collecting and concentrating, for example, stray lead from light bulbs, small radios and small appliances with which we are all familiar.
Ten tonnes of lead in one place are absolutely harmless. The same amount in small pieces all over the place, however, is a problem.
The Japanese, for example, have shown us very promising approaches here, and we are now making clear to manufacturers, with appropriate incentives, that in the long term we want to create a society where these highly dangerous substances are more and more a thing of the past.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say a personal word to my personal colleagues who have been very busy here, working long hours and sometimes through the night..
May I once again thank my colleagues, you, Commissioner, and your staff, who always rendered us excellent assistance whenever we were faced with major questions.
I was proud of this European House and would be pleased if in future things could continue in the same way with the next directives.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am very pleased that these two important directives have now finally reached the last stage of the decision-making process.
The type of waste that proliferates most quickly today is waste from electrical or electronic products.
The average European produces approximately 14 kg of this type of waste every year.
Most of it ends up on tips or in waste incinerators.
These new directives are important milestones that will make it easier to get to grips with the future environmental problems to which our waste may lead. That is because we can now select this type of equipment for recycling and re-use and in that way also reduce its potentially dangerous effects.
Through the new directives, the Member States will be responsible for ensuring that waste from electrical and electronic products is collected separately from other waste.
The directives also set a binding collection target of 4 kg per inhabitant per year from private households.
In accordance with the European Parliament's proposal, individual responsibility must form the basis for this collection target.
A large quantity of dangerous substances will be phased out throughout the Community as from 1 July 2006, meaning that it will be possible to prevent many problems involving waste before they have time to arise.
I believe that these solutions are a great success for the European Parliament and for cooperation with the Council in the conciliation committee.
I should like to repay the courtesy and thank the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and all the members of the European Parliament's delegation to the conciliation committee for their contributions to the constructive agreement that will be voted upon in the course of Wednesday.
This is an important step for environmental policy.
I should also like once again to thank Mr Florenz, who is always easy to collaborate with.
Madam President, I would also like to thank the Conciliation Committee for its constructive work.
It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens.
Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union.
As the Commissioner has said, it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3% to 5% every year.
Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream.
Without proper pre-treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water, as well as polluting the air.
The directive can be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy, where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design can be promoted.
The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda, taking more account of environmental concerns, is becoming more widely accepted.
Indeed business and the environmental NGOs have been on the same wavelength during this process, which is not always the case.
It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay.
The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard.
The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers' responsibility.
The objective of the EPR is to make producers financially responsible for their products when these become waste so an upstream effect is created which leads to design for the environment, taking account of the durability, repairability or upgrading, disassembly or recycling of the product.
In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection, and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment.
The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs.
Costs of disposal, which up to now have been borne by local authorities, usually as part of waste disposal, are now to be internalised and provision made for the reuse, recycling and demanufacture of this equipment.
Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention, thus sustainability.
Madam President, I wish to join with the others in complimenting all involved, particularly on bringing this through conciliation successfully.
In particular, I congratulate my colleague, the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on the passion he has sustained on this issue, despite all the various problems he faced from industry and the different political groups in this House, not least his own group.
I thank him for his commitment and belief in both these directives.
The restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances, on the one hand, and the prevention of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the other is what we are talking about here in the two directives before us.
Colleagues have indicated the rate at which WEEE is growing.
It is interesting to know that it will grow three times faster than the average municipal waste by 2010 - quite a frightening concept.
Because of its hazardous content, electrical and electronic equipment causes environmental problems during the waste management process if it is not properly treated, sorted, separated, recycled, reused, contaminants removed etc. We can insist on improved product design, and that will facilitate recycling and the disposal of products at the end of their life.
It is against this background that the two directives must be reviewed.
I noticed that at conciliation the views concerned were unanimous - and that includes views from Ireland, Portugal, Greece and other countries whose waste network and recycling systems are much less developed than in some countries in the EU.
I hope our officials, ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically, because we should not commit ourselves to something we cannot deliver.
If it is only a matter of time before countries are dragged before the ECJ for non-compliance or non-transposition of a particular regulation, this brings into disrepute legislation passed through this House.
I am glad, but slightly concerned, that they were unanimous because they might not be taking seriously what is being required of them.
Knowing the state of 'underdevelopment' of recycling and waste management in my own country, Ireland, for example, I sincerely hope they mean what they say in agreeing to this directive and I fully support the fact that they have done so.
In relation to the WEEE directive, one of the issues that caused most angst among industry was the handling of historic waste: who would pay for it and so on. It is still a concern, as I understand from industry, even though they have accepted - perhaps somewhat reluctantly - that the only way to pay is collectively and fairly.
Each manufacturer of new products should cover its own costs, and the collection and treatment of all new products can be done collectively.
The manufacturers will have to provide a guarantee prior to placing their products on the market to ensure the financing of subsequent disposal of the products - through insurance perhaps or a blocked bank account.
In the event of the disappearance from the market of a manufacturer, such a guarantee would ensure that the costs do not have to be borne by society or by other manufacturers.
Finally, we should be realistic in terms of targets for and timetabling of the abolition of the dangerous substances, in particular lead and lead solder, and the concerns that have been expressed by industry.
Let us be sure that technologically we are able to replace with a safer product, as far as the environment is concerned, what we are about to ban.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I shall be brief for two reasons.
Firstly, I find it rather silly having the same debate here with exactly the same people for the third time in plenary.
The second reason is perhaps more important, however, and strikes a very positive note.
This can scarcely be called a debate; these are statements by people who actually agree with each other to a large extent.
That is the nice thing about the procedure we have been through since, during the first reading, that was absolutely not the case.
During the discussion we have gradually come closer together.
In that respect, we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations.
As a result, the major aspects that we put forward have actually emerged.
It is no coincidence that the rapporteur should have dwelt at length on the concept of individual producer responsibility.
I shall not expand on it yet again, but it is of crucial importance. It constitutes a precedent and it is the way in which we must proceed in the months and years ahead in our environmental policy.
And yet, I should like to set that straight. It is not a matter of collective organisation, but of collective funding.
I should like to mention a few other points that are important because none of them have been fully achieved.
I am thinking, for example, of binding targets.
It is true that we have binding targets, but we had to rein in the level of these.
We went from 6 to 4 kilograms.
I do not wish to make a particularly big issue of this, for the simple reason that I have seen how in my country, Belgium, we have managed, in one year in Flanders, to collect 4 kilos and are increasing that figure at an extremely fast rate.
I am also saying this to my British fellow MEPs.
I should like to invite them to Belgium.
We are not top of the class in the environmental field, but, as regards waste prevention and waste recycling, we are.
We are doing that to tight deadlines.
If the political will is there, you can meet tight deadlines.
That is why binding targets are good in themselves.
What I find particularly deplorable is the question of exporting.
We simply export a host of problems.
In that respect, we have not achieved our target for legal reasons.
I accept this regretfully, but I think we must ensure that this problem is solved through other means.
I conclude with a final point that I personally have always defended, namely recycling.
The principle is contained in the directive.
I hope that, next time, we shall be able to achieve concrete targets regarding recycling too.
It remains for me to thank the rapporteur and my fellow MEPs most warmly for the pleasant cooperation we have enjoyed in the course of the night.
I learned a lot and enjoyed myself greatly.
Mr President, now I know at last how European laws are really made.
They are made in the Council of Ministers building by exhausted people shouting at each other in corridors in the middle of the night - and the rapporteur and the Commissioner will know exactly to what I am referring.
If I am asked to give an example of the way in which the principles of sustainable development can be put into practice, then this directive may well be it.
If I am asked about the burden of new regulations which Parliament sometimes places upon industry in the cause of environmental improvement, I will proclaim this directive as an example of the way in which industry and Parliament can work together.
It is a splendid piece of legislation.
It is not the end, but it is a good beginning and much credit goes to both the Commission and our rapporteur.
I am particularly pleased with the principle of individual producer responsibility, which has been so firmly embraced.
Within the last week we have seen two good illustrations of the way in which industry is responding to it professionally and effectively.
Four of the major manufacturers of electrical goods, including our chief lobbyist, Electrolux, have teamed up to develop a common approach to waste management which aims to be both innovative and cost efficient.
And the mobile phone manufacturers of the world have agreed to cooperate to ensure the environmentally sound management of their end-of-life products.
My principal concern relates to - and I echo Mrs Doyle's words - the implementation of the directive.
Just a few weeks ago government representatives in that room in the Council committed themselves to this legislation at the conciliation meeting.
It is all supposed to be transposed into national law in about 18 months' time.
But judging from our experience with the end-of-life vehicles directive, that will not be the case so far as many Member States are concerned.
The UK Government has still not transposed Mr Florenz's legislation.
I hope the Commission will take advantage of the European Convention to present some proposals to change the enforcement procedures to stop Member States getting away with breaking their commitments and playing the system.
Finally, the text of Article 4 was the matter I referred to in my opening remarks.
I tabled the draft to try and deal with the problem of printer cartridges, many of which are not being recycled for anti-competitive reasons and are instead ending up in poisonous dumps in China.
I hear that, sadly, the UK Government is trying to wriggle out of the intended requirement to prevent producers from making their reuse difficult by claiming that these products are consumables.
It will probably take a British judge to make them recognise the obvious truth, that a cartridge fitted with an electronic chip is an item of electronic equipment.
I hope that other Member States will take the lead in this and in other respects in putting this directive fully into practice, and show by example just what a commendable piece of legislation this directive will prove to be.
I wish you and members of the conciliation delegation, and the Commissioner and her staff, a merry Christmas.
I should also like to congratulate rapporteur, Mr Florenz.
This is an historic breakthrough.
Ten years ago, we, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, proposed individual producer responsibility in the packaging directive.
At that time, we were laughed out of court.
We have a packaging directive that, as we say in the Netherlands, 'is not worth a light', and that is because there is shared responsibility between the government and the producer.
In the case of car wrecks we were almost successful two years ago.
In that case, the manufacturers are largely responsible, and it is interesting to see that German industry, which at the time was so opposed to the move, now takes full responsibility.
Tomorrow, we shall have achieved our goal, moreover: the manufacturers will become one hundred per cent responsible for electrical and electronic waste.
It is not the case that the industry was united on the matter.
The largest company in the field in my country, Philips, was decidedly antagonistic.
The fact that we in this House achieved a compromise between the various groups as early as the first reading and held our ground up to the night-time session with its accompanying noisy exchanges contributed, however, to our success and, for that, I should like especially to thank Mr Florenz most sincerely.
Mr President, the concerns about increasing quantities of electrical and electronic equipment entering the waste system have been well rehearsed.
There can be no dispute that this type of waste is a problem.
Furthermore, there is no dispute that the problem will continue to grow.
However, there is a world of difference between agreeing that something is a problem and agreeing with a proposed solution.
My purpose in making this address, therefore, is to enter into the record my total disagreement with this directive.
My central objection is that the directive is economically illiterate.
Its effect will be to create massive quantities of materials in a highly volatile market.
When quantities increase as a result of this directive, the value of recycled materials will drop, making the economics of recycling extremely uncertain.
On this basis, producers and eventually their customers, are being asked to sign a blank cheque.
Neither does any serious consideration seem to have been given to the problem of labour recruitment.
Salvaging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is unattractive.
Either wages will have to go up sharply to meet the demand for more staff or the scheme will be bedevilled by labour shortages.
The recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capital-intensive.
With such uncertain returns it seem unlikely that there will be any commitment to providing the necessary facilities.
Finally, I have to add to a list of objections that is by no means complete the fact that, as we have learned to expect from EU legislation, the system is highly bureaucratic, adding massive overheads and a totally unnecessary burden on industry.
It also requires Member States to create yet more criminal offences to regulate the commercial market.
Is turning our businessmen into criminals really what European unity is really all about?
