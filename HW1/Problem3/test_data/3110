In the EMPA and together with President Borrell, we are determined to move forward.
I believe that it is time to stop disappointing the people.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, there was nothing random about the events in Jericho, which have deprived us of a meeting with MahmoudÂ Abbas; they are politically significant.
The first person to be affected was certainly MahmoudÂ Abbas; hardly had he left his country than the Israeli forces launched their assault on the prison.
He is not the only one to be affected, though.
It has not been mentioned that Ahmed Saâadat was a member of the newly-elected Palestinian legislative council.
Nor has anyone pointed out that Hamas, which had made tentative steps towards recognising the State of Israel within its 1967 borders, could not proceed any further towards such recognition, after the humiliating images of half-naked, bound and blindfolded prisoners.
We Europeans have also been snubbed.
We were expecting Mahmoud Abbas but he did not come.
What is at stake is our entire policy towards Palestine.
Today, with our offices ransacked and our nationals taken hostage, there are some Members of this Chamber saying to me that we, the main donors, must not continue to finance Palestine, after the ingratitude shown.
That has been the effect of Jericho.
I should like to say to those MEPs hesitating about supporting Palestine that there is not one Palestinian today who would not swap the money we are giving to Palestine for a firm EU stance on current events.
Can we, after all, turn a blind eye to the fact that Israel has chosen a unilateral path, focused on law and order, which no longer has anything to do with the roadmap?
The Olmert plan is a unilateral one, as were the Gaza disengagement - warmly applauded as it was - the annexing of the West Bank and the capture of East Jerusalem.
The reality of Palestine is an interminable occupation and a wall which was condemned by the Hague but which is still standing.
All the money that we give to Palestine to help it survive does not enable it to escape this reality.
In other words, the peace process is dragging its feet.
To conclude, Commissioner, if there is to be a PlanÂ B to help Palestine, Europe must take a clear and courageous stance.
How otherwise can the Palestinians be expected to have hope and to believe us when we talk about the road map?
Â Â  Mr President, the Jericho events have been long debated by colleagues, this morning and later, but in the Committee on Quality of Life, Exchanges between Civil Societies and Culture the issue of the cartoons will certainly come up.
We must be unequivocal in condemning the content of the cartoons.
Respect for the religious values and identity of others, such as Muslim fellow European citizens, is a European value and only stupidity cannot understand it, but in Europe we are obliged to defend even the right of stupidity to express itself freely, and our Arab partners must understand it.
On the issue of migration, the new initiatives by the Commission and the recent decisions by the Council to manage migratory flows instead of talking only about illegal immigration are commendable.
Policies such as the well-anticipated and organised legal reception of migrants needed in the domestic markets, the establishment of brain circulation as opposed to a brain drain, facilitation of remittances, civic integration of migrants, the single asylum policy and so forth will be more appealing to our Mediterranean partners.
It is true that some of these countries have changed from countries of origin or transit to terminals.
That is why we need to work together, by sharing technical means, expertise and responsibility, to fight the trafficking of human beings and illegal immigration.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the European parliamentary delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I naturally endorse what has just been said about the recent events in Palestine and, in particular, the condemnation of the attack on the Jericho prison, which is certainly not a step forward on the road towards peace and democracy.
I should like to mention the Anna Lindh Foundation, which fosters dialogue between the civilisations and which was the subject of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) working party.
This institution is already experiencing a number of structural difficulties.
Some partner states have yet to structure their national networks, and there have been serious delays in disbursing contributions.
There is the greatest uncertainty as to whether funding will continue after 2008.
This is why these difficulties must be addressed forthwith: the continued financing of the Anna Lindh Foundation must be guaranteed; the measures undertaken by the foundation and the priorities thereof must be accorded higher visibility; European rules on the funding of projects must be relaxed; a European television station in Arabic must be set up; and the structureâs three working languages must be put on an equal footing in communications.
To conclude, the EMPA, along with the Council and the Commission, must put the necessary effort into examining this question.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent tragic events, the abundantly clear conclusions of our last meeting in November have taken on particular relevance.
Economic prosperity and social progress are not within everyoneâs reach, which means that issues of violence are very visible.
We already know that those denied healthcare and the right to acquire qualitative and quantitative knowledge tend to be our partners in the southern Mediterranean and in particular the least privileged sections of society, that is, women and the poor.
The future scenario concerns us.
This is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, which we want to see up and running by 2010, as the Commissioner pointed out.
In this case, the data shows that in terms of reducing poverty, the immediate gains are considerably lower, although other benefits may accrue from the far-reaching changes taking place in the economies of our Mediterranean partners.
In the areas of health and education, there is little chance of any short-term gains.
Accordingly, with nothing to hold back this effect, it is likely that we will see health and education being adversely affected.
As regards human rights, it is vital that we look into the near-total absence of a guiding concept in the EU and the Euro-Mediterranean institutions on the issue of economic and social rights and the part that this plays in the Barcelona process.
I feel that in the current framework in particular â albeit, in reality, across the board â this is a vitally important question, which should be given due prominence in the MEDA programme.
Our most pressing priorities in this partnership should be to step up social dialogue, the fight against child labour, cooperation in combating discrimination in the field of social security, dialogue on social reforms and promoting equal opportunities between men and women.
In the context of today's reality, this issue should be brought to the fore in the Barcelona process.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to all of you for mentioning the positive impact of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in your speeches.
It is of course possible to enumerate a large number of issues where fairly great deficiencies remain, as MrsÂ Madeira has just done.
This means that we can by no means rest on our laurels â and, indeed, we are not doing â but rather must set ourselves the task of continuing work on all the fields that MrsÂ Madeira cited â health care, social dialogue, sustainability, gender issues, opportunities for education and many other issues.
That cannot be done overnight.
We would be deceiving ourselves if we were to believe that this Partnership alone would be sufficient to enable us to make changes in a short space of time, but we must work at it, and, as the Commissioner said, the instruments to do so are available.
The human rights issue has been mentioned many times.
This is a particular concern of mine personally and also of the Councilâs as a whole.
I would add that I do not believe that the Council or the EU as a whole can be accused of not having a coherent, methodical human rights policy; I believe that we do have one.
Incidentally, I believe that the Human Rights Agency, which I hope will be established soon and will have your support, will be able to make a contribution to a methodical approach to the issue of human rights.
Mr President, I would also like to thank all those very engaged parliamentarians like yourself and your subcommittee and Mrs De Keyser and others who are working constantly and with great commitment towards better understanding between the peoples in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
We should be grateful to them and we should do our best to support you and help you, even if you do not fully agree with one or two Council measures.
Iran has also been mentioned in this connection.
I should just like to say in this regard that it is of course the Councilâs policy to use peaceful means, negotiation, to achieve results.
MrÂ CarneroÂ GonzÃ¡lez said something very important, which was that something happened at the November summit that would have been impossible a few years ago.
A close look at this declaration on terrorism, this Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism, reveals that it contains a good approach to even the difficult, delicate issues â and, of course, the fight against terrorism, with all the familiar political problems, is an extremely difficult one.
It is an approach that enables us to continue to achieve further results, and the Council shares this objective.
I should like to thank all the Members for their good ideas and suggestions, which we shall, of course, be happy to take up and look into.
Â Â  . Mr President, I entirely agree on the importance of the next Euromed Parliamentary Assembly meeting.
It is highly important and I can already confirm my personal presence.
This time it is possible and I certainly will want to come.
Your motion for a resolution is an excellent one.
All the important topics are there: freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, the outlook for a real partnership.
That is what we want.
That means that not only do we have to deliver, but our partners also have to deliver.
Together we have to find the right mix in order for them to develop more and more.
There are some specific issues that we also have to highlight, one of which is very dear to my heart and is also in our communication: education.
I have always felt that with education we can promote the next generation.
We can do our utmost to make things happen.
I also totally agree with Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez.
I believe Barcelona was a success.
However, is not right to say that it was not a complete success because only Heads of State were there.
The content was good.
Now we have to see to it that it can all be implemented in our five-year programme.
I am in favour of liberalisation, but I agree it must also take account of social cohesion and social stability, social rights, questions of energy, and of course education.
Let me quickly say that some studies that have been undertaken; the Manchester study is rather negative, but there are others that are much more positive.
As I said, what we wanted to create with the Euromed Partnership is exactly that: a partnership, which means both sides will have to do their utmost to get things moving and quite a lot of reforms are still necessary.
What we would like to achieve, with more trade, is also the creation of more jobs â that means more jobs for more young people â as also, of course, trying to provide the right prospects for the labour market, and sustainable development that takes account of social and environmental imperatives.
The Neighbourhood Policy is the policy that tries to complement this Euromed Partnership.
While also focusing very clearly on human rights, it tries to promote all the other factors that will assure these countries a better life in the future.
Finally, unfortunately all of that is being overshadowed by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and unfortunately, this is not the best moment; we are at a very critical, crucial moment.
Hopefully we can make the future, even at this critical stage, a better one.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The President of the Palestinian High Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was forced to return urgently to his country and cancel his address to Parliament, due to the extremely serious turn of events.
The EU must take a firm line on Israelâs continued attack on Palestine, of which the destruction of Jericho prison is one of the most serious and humiliating episodes.
Israel committed this crime after a recent agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the USA and the United Kingdom on prisoner security, yet nothing was done to stop it.
The Commission and the Councilâs predisposition towards the Israeli Government and the escalation of criminal violence perpetrated against Palestine must not be allowed to continue.
Measures must be taken to stop Israel from continuing to act in this appalling manner, undermining Palestine's most fundamental rights.
At the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, Parliament must show clear solidarity with Palestine and must condemn the violence perpetrated by Israel, which is jeopardising peace in the Middle East.
UN resolutions must be complied with and the free will of the people of Palestine must be upheld.
Â Â  â The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the 62nd session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR, Geneva).
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing now, at this relatively late hour, is also a great personal concern of mine, which is why it was important to me to remain here for this debate.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to join you for this debate.
As you know, a summit on the reform of the United Nations was held last year in New York and, naturally, the participants â Heads of State or Government â were asked whether or not they considered the meeting to be a success.
The President of the Republic of Austria stated that he did indeed consider the meeting a success.
Of course â as is always the case in a multilateral environment â there were some things that were pushed through and others that were not, but, in the final reckoning, last yearâs United Nations Summit in New York could be described as a success.
It was a success in that agreement was reached, in essence, on a number of things that were very important particularly to us as Member States of the EU, to the West as a whole.
We all stand up for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The decision of principle taken last September in New York to establish a Human Rights Council in place of the Commission on Human Rights was one decision that justified a positive assessment of the Summit.
Of course, last Septemberâs decision was only a decision of principle, and it took difficult negotiations to breathe life into this Human Rights Council.
I believe that special thanks are due at this juncture to the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr Jan Eliasson, for tirelessly working to enable a decision on the Human Rights Council to be reached a few hours ago in New York.
The results of the vote adopting this Human Rights Council are impressive: 170 votes in favour and 4 against, with 3 countries abstaining.
The countries that voted against were the US, Israel, Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Venezuela, Iran und Belarus abstained.
Ladies and gentlemen, 170 votes in the United Nations is a great success.
The EU put up a united front at the United Nations General Assembly with a common position.
This is something of which we can be proud, and we can congratulate ourselves and the international community on this success.
The establishment of the Human Rights Council represents an important, I would even say historic, step towards further strengthening the United Nations human rights system and the protection of human rights around the world.
Naturally, there were a number of issues on which even the EU was disappointed.
We should have liked to see a different outcome on one issue or another, but, after all, compromises are necessary in a multilateral framework, and we need to ask ourselves whether what proved possible in the end is, in essence, still consistent with what we actually wanted.
As regards the Human Rights Council in its current form, the answer was a clear âyesâ.
I am very much obliged to all those who were involved in bringing about this decision.
I am pleased that the Council succeeded in gaining the support of all the Member States for this.
I do not wish at this point to concentrate so much on the things that did not succeed, but on a number of â I believe â particularly positive aspects of the new system of the Human Rights Council.
Firstly, unlike the Commission on Human Rights, which operated under the aegis of the Ecosoc, which met once a year in Geneva for a six-week session, the Human Rights Council will meet throughout the year, and will be directly responsible to the General Assembly.
The option of the Human Rights Council possibly one day becoming one of the main bodies of the United Nations has been left open.
This would of course require changing the Charter of the United Nations, and we all know how difficult that would be, but the option is open.
At all events, however, it is now a permanent body of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The direct and individual election of members subject to the requirement of an absolute majority of all Member States of the United Nations also represents progress.
All of those who, like myself, have taken part time and again in recent years will be pleased that this will hopefully now mean, if not an end to, then at least a substantial reduction in the â often undignified â process of horse-trading over votes: who is voting for whom, when to vote on this matter, whether to vote for another in return.
Another new aspect is the possibility of suspending members of the Human Rights Council in the case of gross and systematic human rights violations subject to a two-thirds majority.
Incidentally, this was ultimately the decisive reason why the United States withheld support for the Human Rights Council.
The US attempted until the very end to push through the requirement of a two-thirds majority for membership, and also the automatic exclusion of members on whom the Security Council has imposed sanctions.
The EU offered to issue â and has indeed issued â a declaration in the General Assembly on the occasion of the establishment of the Human Rights Council making a political commitment to refrain from voting in favour of admitting to the Human Rights Council any country which has been accused by the Security Council of human rights violations and which is subject to Security Council sanctions.
Here, too, the EU has sent out an important political signal.
Thirdly, there will be a regular human rights review of all countries through the creation of a universal review mechanism, which will also help obviate accusations of double standards and selectivity in future.
Fourthly, the Human Rights Council has the competence to make direct recommendations to all the bodies of the United Nations, including the UN Security Council.
We believe that this has the potential to substantially strengthen the United Nations human rights protection system as a whole.
The fifth point is that, ultimately, the important achievements of the Commission on Human Rights remain, namely the system of special rapporteurs and the active participation of non-governmental organisations in sessions.
Although it was not possible to achieve everything, this new Human Rights Council represents a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, which was no longer effective.
The Commission on Human Rights will now meet again â presumably briefly â to conclude its business and subsequently hand it over to the Human Rights Council.
In May of this year â soon, in other words â the first members of the Human Rights Council are due to be elected, and the inaugural session of the Council is due to be held as soon as this June.
We â as the EU and the Council â shall do our utmost to ensure that the Human Rights Council is able to carry out its work successfully and effectively from the outset.
Although the United States did not endorse this proposal, I nevertheless believe that a certain amount of trust was established in recent days and weeks, particularly in transatlantic relations between the EU and the US, since the US stated, on the occasion of the establishment of the Human Rights Council, that it was not its intention to hinder the establishment and financing of this Council, and that it agreed with the objectives of this Council in principle, but that the two problems I have mentioned â the issues of the election of members and of the exclusion of members â were too serious to enable it to vote in favour.
I hope that the work of the Human Rights Council in the coming years will convince all parties that this was a good choice, that this represents progress, and that, ultimately, we have also done something positive for the protection of human rights around the world.
I believe that we, as the European Union, can be proud to have made a contribution to this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to say: Eureka!
We have a Human Rights Council!
That is extraordinary and I am very happy to be here tonight to celebrate it with the Council and the European Parliament.
As you know, the European Union and the European Commission have contributed substantially to that result.
Last week, when the EU decided to support the draft resolution introduced by President Eliasson, we made it possible for a number of countries to copy us.
We had hoped that a number of our proposals would be in the resolution.
However, I agree with the Presidency that the compromise text represents a marked improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, and that is key.
Let me say a few words about the Commission on Human Rights.
Over the last few months there has been much criticism of that Commission.
Typically, it is accused of doubled standards, of over-politicisation, or of being too tame sometimes in the face of flagrant human rights violations.
No doubt there is some truth in those allegations, and it is not by chance that the UN Summit document has proposed the establishment of its replacement.
But equally it is true that what could be done has been done.
It was that Commission, in 1948, that oversaw the drafting of the most important statement of human rights principles of all: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I wanted to mention that because now, of course, we are looking forward, but we should also have looked at the past.
I should also like to draw Parliamentâs attention to one element of the Human Rights Council: the universal periodic review.
If implemented properly, it should help to address the issues of double standards and selectivity, which have plagued the Commission on Human Rights.
After all, we see peer review working very effectively in other fields, for instance in trade, the trade process review mechanism, or even in the conflict on diamonds and the Kimberley Process.
Remarkably, throughout the complex and lengthy negotiation process on the Human Rights Council, the European Union has been able to maintain a common position.
There is no doubt that this has positively influenced the course of the negotiations.
Therefore, the Commission was very relieved that, after the recent differences between Member States on the final draft resolution, the European Union was able once again to adopt a common position and thus demonstrate its commitment to the crucial part of the UN reform process.
The Commission, like the Member States, is concerned about the US vote against the text.
However, on the other hand, we are also comforted by its declaration expressing the wish to work with the Human Rights Council.
Kofi Annan today said that his understanding was that the United States, even though they might not be able to vote for the Council as it was currently proposed, would be able to work with the Council, and I am sure that the US, which has done so much for human rights, will find a way to work with the other Member States to make the Council what it ought to be.
So I think the omens, on the whole, are not bad.
We have to pay tribute to the Human Rights Commission, but now we want to see a new development and, hopefully, together, we can get it.
Â Â  . Mr President, the creation of an effective, functioning and widely supported human rights commission is an essential part of the UN reform package outlined by Kofi Annan last year.
Unlike the political minefield that surrounds the reform of the UN Security Council, the UN has shown the capacity to agree on a new structure for dealing with human rights questions.
Most people agree that the current, large-scale, six-week, once-a-year UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is now outdated and needs to be replaced.
We need a more permanent mechanism that can respond, year round, to the multitude of human rights crises that arise.
The issues of debate in formulating the new structure for human rights have been many:
1.
The need for a permanent structure/council.
2.
The members of that council must have credibility on human rights questions.
3.
The council should not be too big.
4.
The council should be reflective of the geographical difference globally.
5.
It should not be seen as an elitist council, a small group preaching to the others.
6.
The question of how we should select or elect members to that council.
7.
The need for a continued role for NGOs.
8.
A suspension mechanism for those who consistently have a poor human rights record.
Trying to find agreement and, if necessary, compromise on all of those considerations was never going to be easy.
However, in my view, the draft resolution by the President of the General Assembly is a reasonable attempt to do just that, an effort to find common ground.
I welcome the strong endorsement by the UN this evening of that draft resolution.
It is unfortunate that the US could not support it.
I do not view the document as perfect by any means, however, and I would be critical on two points in particular.
First, I think the Council is too big: 47 members are too many.
Secondly, the election procedure whereby members are elected by an absolute majority is not ideal.
I would have agreed with the US and would rather have seen a two-thirds majority for that purpose.
I should like to finish by saying that it is a job well done by the UN today, and I think it will add credibility to its stance on human rights issues.
Â Â  â Mr President, today there has indeed been a very positive development as regards the agreement achieved in New York.
This agreement, with a huge majority of 170 countries, constitutes a dynamic and progressive compromise towards improving and strengthening the efficacy of the international system for defending human rights.
Of the very serious reforms and changes made, I should like to comment in particular on the provision for the participation in the proceedings of the new Council of international non-governmental organisations and agencies working to defend human rights.
I believe that the Commission and the Commissioner will work with non-governmental organisations to strengthen the role and the efficacy of the Council.
These clear reforms may give new momentum for human rights to the institution of the Council and reduce the lack of credibility and efficacy of the UN.
Similarly, the European Union can work with the UN and with the other countries within the framework of the Council in order to strengthen the new institution.
Unfortunately, the ostentatious search on the part of the United States for a better result undermines this positive compromise achieved today.
It is high time that fundamental humanitarian values were placed before political expediencies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is, of course, in many ways an historic day â the day on which we have set up a Human Rights Council.
The fact is that the European Parliament has pushed this issue in the past, and we know that it is in actual fact possible to change the human rights situation by working hard and in unison.
We do support the UN in this work.
The decision concerning the Human Rights Council was one of the few practical decisions taken in September, and it is therefore very gratifying that there now in actual fact exists such a Council and that we have obtained a permanent body that does away with the need for those six weeks of intensive lobbying in Geneva, characterised, just as you said, by constant horse-trading in connection with who was to support which resolution.
If we obtain a permanent body that can take the lead on these matters, we shall hopefully also do away with the situation in which some of the worst rogue states have sometimes chaired the sessions in Geneva.
I also share the analysis that the Council is rather weaker than had been hoped.
I agree with MrÂ Coveney that a two-thirdsâ majority would have been better.
The regional quota system that at present applies in appointing Council representatives will unfortunately mean that states that infringe human rights will also be represented.
Secret voting and the ability to exclude countries do, however, mean that a big step forward has nonetheless been taken.
I hope that, in the future, the EU will adopt a unanimous and consistent approach and not be afraid to point the finger if a country with a place on the Council is guilty of seriously violating human rights.
That is because, if it acts in concert, the EU will be able to play a fantastically substantial role in the UN.
We in my group should like in time to see a joint European seat on the UN Security Council.
This is a large step forward.
Now is the time of reckoning, and it is important not only to be able to act promptly when crises occur but also to remember too events that are not so sexy from the mediaâs point of view, that is to say the permanent human rights violations committed against people in somewhat forgotten, out-of-the-way places.
If the Human Rights Council can safeguard these peopleâs rights, we shall have taken a big step forward.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to commend the far-sightedness of Parliament, which arranged this debate hours after the adoption of the resolution, and which will follow suit in adopting such a resolution tomorrow.
We can together express our satisfaction and our huge relief in seeing this resolution adopted. Not everything is perfect, of course.
For example, the members of the Council will not be elected by a two-thirds majority; certain groups have seen their number of seats increase; and paragraphs have been added. I have no need to go on.
That being said, the resolution that has been adopted establishes a permanent Human Rights Council, which boasts some most welcome aspects.
For example, members are to be elected by secret ballot by the general assembly; the Council will be able to meet throughout the year, instead of less than three times a year; it will be in a position to react quickly to human rights crises; it retains the UNâs special mechanisms; it guarantees a particular role for NGOs, even though UN reform is needed in this area â something I consider extremely important â aimed at delivering better representation for independent NGOs, including those not recognised; this Council will set up a system for taking stock of the human rights situation in Council Member States.
These are all entirely positive aspects.
It will also be possible to suspend a country guilty of human rights violations, by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly.
These positive points were precisely what Parliament and the EU as a whole were looking for and enjoyed the full support of all of us.
I turn finally to the 62nd session of the Human Rights Commission.
In all likelihood, it will be a transitional committee, essentially tasked with passing on files to the Council.
I call on Member States to remain vigilant, however, and to secure the vote on important issues, such as the adoption of the draft international convention for the protection of all victims of forcible disappearance, the declaration on indigenous peoples and the renewal of mandates such as that of the special representative for human rights defenders.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs approval by the United Nations represents a hugely important step forward.
Up until now, a system of double standards has been in force.
It is unacceptable that Russia has never been condemned for the odious conduct of its special forces in Chechnya.
It is unacceptable that China has never been condemned for its tragic repression of the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people.
It is unacceptable that the United States does not have to answer for its conduct in Iraq, where an occupation that is illegal in terms of international law has led to over 100Â 000 civilian victims.
Furthermore, what can one say of Israel, which is taking illegal measures of collective punishment against the Palestinian people that are expressly forbidden by international conventions?
Reason of state cannot be a justification for the negation of the rights of millions of men, women and children all over the world.
The European Union must show greater courage on this issue: at stake are our credibility and our policy of promoting human rights.
It is not enough to protest against countries that are unprotected by often dubious international alliances.
Human rights are enshrined in codes: legal treaties apply to everyone, especially to the powerful.
The for the credibility of the now defunct Commission on Human Rights in Geneva was dealt by the presence in that institution of governments that represent dictatorships and that have used their institutional position before the UN as a means of avoiding criticism of their policies and conduct.
What right, for example, does the Sudanese Government have to participate in the Commission in Geneva, as is happening today?
I therefore welcome all the reforms that have been announced to transform the Commission in Geneva into a restricted council on human rights.
I applaud the news that has just reached us that the UN has approved the resolution of radical reforms to that institution despite opposition from the United States.
I agree with the suggestions of the resolution we will approve tomorrow, especially when it states that only countries that demonstrate respect for fundamental rights may participate in the future council.
We must also grant a more important role to international non-governmental organisations, which are truly democratic and independent, through the creation of a UN committee on NGOs, which needs to able to provide both encouragement and criticism for the UN system of human rights.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the goal of the UN reforms and particularly the changes to the Commission on Human Rights was to create institutions that are better, not the same or worse.
A compromise has finally been found and the Human Rights Council has just been formed, which in itself is a good thing.
The current solution, however, whereby at the General Assembly only a majority is needed for a state to be elected to the Council, but three-quarters of those present must vote in favour of exclusion from the Council, is a very weak compromise.
There is no certainty that, under this method, states in which there are clear violations of human rights will not gain entry to the Council.
It will be even harder to remove such states from the Council.
So there is a possibility that states which do not respect human rights may continue to operate within the Council, bringing it into disrepute.
The agreement that the Human Rights Council will now meet not for six weeks a year, but for ten weeks, is also not yet cause for optimism.
These compromises give rise to doubts as to whether Europeâs position on UN reform issues was put with sufficient force.
In the field of human rights, if we at the European Union do not guide processes then no one else will do it.
The European Commission ought therefore to mobilise the greatest possible support for further suitable reform to the UN human rights institution, as well as for the election of states to the Council which will not discredit it but which will lay a solid foundation for effective work in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, the final document of the United Nations Summit in September established the foundations, in some cases the minimal foundations, on which the institutional reforms would be built.
This was the case with the Human Rights Council: agreement was reached simply on its creation, the rest remained in the air.
It was difficult to reach an agreement in a few months to establish the body that would replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights.
President Eliasson's final proposal, which has just been voted for by a large majority in New York, is the result of a difficult negotiation.
It was not the ideal proposal â Europe would have liked more â but it creates a new body which is better than the one we have at the moment.
The members of the new Council will be elected by the Assembly by absolute majority, that is to say, a minimum of 96 votes in favour will be required.
Furthermore, during its mandate, all of the members of the Council will be subject to scrutiny and also, as has been said, it will be possible to suspend them.
Furthermore, as we have demanded, the meetings will be far more frequent and will last much longer than the meetings of the current Commission on Human Rights.
The new Council therefore represents clear progress compared to the UNHCHR.
Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the quota of countries allotted to the Western Europe group is less than that allotted to us in the Commission.
Mr President, I would have liked this proposal from MrÂ Eliasson to have been adopted by consensus, but in the end it has been put to a vote.
I very much regret that the United States has voted against.
It is a key country in the United Nations and I hoped that the initiatives to obtain their support for Mr Eliasson's proposal would succeed and that, in the end, the new Council would be established with Washington's support.
But I am pleased that, in any event, their constructive cooperation with the new Council has been ensured.
Furthermore, the work and the operation of the Council will be reviewed after five years, which will enable us to overcome the deficiencies of the new mechanism: one of the most ambitious objectives of the final document of the September Summit.
Mr President, combating poverty is treated as a priority in this document and I would like to point out that, as this Parliament has already stated, poverty should be seen as a breach of human rights, since it violates human dignity and denies people other fundamental rights.
Â Â  ( Mr President, today the UN General Assembly voted to create a Human Rights Council to replace the UN Human Rights Commission whose position has been compromised.
The new UN Council fails to meet many of the criteria for the effective monitoring of human rights and reacting to abuses of these rights throughout the world.
It does, however, represent a step towards establishing a new international structure based on respect for fundamental rights and political freedoms.
The creation of the Council has been supported by Nobel Peace Prize laureates as well as human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch or the Open Society Institute and Soros Foundation Network.
The European Union should now play a key role on the UN Human Rights Council.
The European Parliament has the opportunity to take a leading role in supporting the Councilâs efforts to create a new global system for the protection of human rights.
As part of transatlantic dialogue, the European Union should encourage the United States to collaborate more closely with the Human Rights Council and work towards further reform of the UN.
The USA was one of four countries which voted against the creation of the Council.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed the United Nations reform summit in late September of last year, one of the few things that we could really describe as a success was the planned replacement of the discredited Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council.
The only thing that was not yet settled was its composition and procedures.
It would really have been a serious defeat for the cause of human rights, but also for the United Nations, if we had failed in our attempt to replace this discredited Commission with a new Human Rights Council in a timely manner.
For this reason, todayâs outcome of the lengthy negotiations was an important success, including for President Eliasson.
We congratulate him on this, as real improvements have been made.
To elaborate: the members of this new Human Rights Council have to be elected by secret ballot, namely by at least 96 countries.
Members can be excluded from the Human Rights Council subject to a two-thirds majority if they are guilty of gross human rights violations.
The Human Rights Council has to meet at least three times a year.
More continuity has been introduced into the work, and there is to be a regular review of the human rights situation in all the UN Member States.
These are five important successes.
I was at a loss to understand, therefore, why the United States attempted to block this.
Mr President-in-Office, the US made not only positive demands, but also the demand that the five members of the Security Council retained their privileged status, that they remained on the Human Rights Council, as it were, without being elected.
That would have been a serious error if one considers the human rights situation in the Peopleâs Republic of China.
It is a good thing that todayâs vote supported the proposals in this form.
Â Â  â Mr President, the abolition of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the creation of a Council with far fewer members is intended to exclude and to be able to expel the countries which do not submit to the United States of America, the European Union or other imperialist forces.
The aim is to have a submissive Council that can be turned into an agency which will judge infringements of human rights with partiality and against the criterion of imperialist ambitions.
Thus, decisions to order will provide the pretext for various interventions, even war, in the name of the defence of human rights.
The United States of America have indeed done a great deal for human rights: they have murdered tens of millions of people from Hiroshima and Nagasaki through Vietnam to Iraq today.
That is their contribution.
To paraphrase Brecht â because time is short â who wrote, 'When imperialists talk of peace they are preparing for war', I would say that, when you talk today about protecting human rights, you are preparing to massacre them, as you do every day.
However, there is no Human Rights Council, Commission or UN that can prevent the fight of the peoples against their subjugation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, even though I would have welcomed this debate a short while ago, and today it is perhaps a little overdue, we all share a great and definite new hope, and of course we all welcome the creation of the new Council.
Above all, we congratulate the Swedish president of the General Assembly, not only for what he managed to negotiate between the UN member countries, but especially for the way in which he succeeded in bringing together the voluntary organisations of the non-governmental sector that are now giving him so much support.
We naturally welcome the longer lobbying periods in Geneva.
We hope that the improvement witnessed over recent weeks in transatlantic relations will not turn sour, and that it will prove possible to overturn the current vote.
In my view, it is important that the EU has spoken and that it has a clear and unified position, which it shares with the entire developed world.
It is the developing world, however, that has the majority.
Despite all the talk of loss of civilisation, it is clear that the new Council must fully adhere to the principle of the universality of human rights, with the same rules applying to each and every woman and each and every man.
It is always apparent whether or not human rights have been upheld or violated and in this pre-review the Council will play a very important role.
The exclusion instrument is also very important in this context, even though it requires a two-thirds majority, and in my view it creates a new opportunity for European foreign policy, a new opportunity to really address the violation of human rights, which is a problem that results from the failure of some states to function properly.
Commissioner, I hope that we and especially you will have the courage to take clear steps towards upholding universal human rights across the whole world.
Â Â  Mr President, I was present with Parliamentâs delegation in Geneva at the Human Rights Commission last year and saw with my own eyes how discredited that Commission had become and how it was being held hostage in its proceedings by countries which were themselves the worst perpetrators of human rights abuse.
So, like Members across this House tonight, I welcome the creation of the new Human Rights Council.
I believe it will be a step forward by meeting all year round, by being elected by a majority from the UN General Assembly, by having a system of suspension for those countries which are members and then violate human rights and by maintaining the tradition of access for non-governmental organisations.
I am very proud of the role that we as MEPs have played in the margins of the process.
When we met Louise Arbour, the Commissioner for Human Rights, in Geneva, and when she made her return visit to us in Brussels, we explored in detail her proposals for the universal review procedure now agreed, which will enable, it is argued, a much stronger, more objective examination of the record of all countries.
We insisted in our resolutions that membership of the Human Rights Council should be open only to countries which issue standing invitations unimpeded to special rapporteurs.
That is part of todayâs agreement.
Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Nepal and Zimbabwe will not and should not be members of this new Council.
Finally, this UN reform results from the Millennium Review Summit and comes at a historic point in the defence of the principle of multilateralism in our world.
We in the European Parliament should send a message to the US â not simply to the government but to its people â that whether it is the Human Rights Council, whether it is Kyoto, whether it is the International Criminal Court, or whether it is the principle of multilateralism itself, the United States is deeply and dangerously isolated in this world and it is no role for the worldâs last remaining superpower to play.
If the United States wants to be nominated to this new Council, it will have to allow unimpeded access to GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
I wonder whether the US will stand.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that a decision has been taken not to leave this Human Rights Council in an embryonic state.
Respect for human rights in the classical sense is one of the cornerstones of the European understanding of values, which will be reinforced by the creation of this new body.
Although the proposal adopted is not ideal, it is a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, which was still susceptible to influence from countries who had themselves committed extremely serious human rights violations.
It is an important step for human rights in the world.
A functioning body will be able to intervene more quickly in urgent cases and must oblige countries to stand up for, fight for and promote human rights.
A blockade would have meant the international community losing credibility in the fight against human rights crimes.
That is why it is a very good thing that this project did not fail; including in view of the important work of the many NGOs.
Â Â  (Mr President, the work of the current UN Human Rights Commission has been severely criticised from nearly all sides.
It has been accused of being overly politicised and excessively active as well as of being corrupt.
We should therefore welcome the ambitious attempts to reform the Commission and to transform it into the Human Rights Council, whose work will be more independent.
Although the scope of these changes seems to be well thought out, there is a danger that they will be partially restricted in the course of international talks on the proposals.
The European Parliament should clearly state its position on the issue, highlighting the need for these changes in order to promote and develop a culture based on the rule of law and democratic government throughout the world.
The most important challenge related to this reform is, as has already been mentioned, the independence of the proposed UN Human Rights Council. Demanding that it be made into one of the main UN bodies is one of the main means of achieving this goal.
What should really change is the way in which candidates are elected.
They ought to be elected by the General Assembly according to a voting majority that would make membership impossible for a country whose government behaves in a way that may lead to doubts about its human rights credentials.
It is also important for a vote to be taken on the candidature of every country, even if there are fewer candidates from the region than places allocated for that given region.
Avoiding the presence of countries such as Libya, as has happened in recent times, or of Cuba, as is the case at present, is one of the basic steps on the road back to the UN regaining its credibility in the field of human rights protection in the world.
It is also important to decrease the size of this institution so that its actions may be more efficient and its decisions more effective.
Reform of the Human Rights Commission is a great opportunity to make significant improvements to the human rights situation across the world.
We cannot, however, treat this topic as a one-off transformation. We have to see it as an opportunity to start a process of continuous improvements to the system for the protection of human rights in a way that will ensure it gains the trust of global public opinion and the status of a mechanism that draws attention to the most serious human rights abuses in the world and is not bound by political ties.
Â Â  â The news from New York brings us relief and satisfaction.
The compromise proposed by the President of the General Assembly, Mr Eliasson, will not be perfect, but it is a good one. This is for the reasons expressed by a number of speakers and, in an article, by various Nobel Peace prize winners, including ex-President Jimmy Carter.
We are disappointed that the United States has voted against, although we are not surprised, given that the US â a country that has traditionally done so much for human rights and for international law on human rights and the UN â is currently at the mercy of an administration that lacks any credibility or consistency on this matter.
It is an administration that will go down in history as that of the ignominy of the Iraq invasion, of GuantÃ¡namo, of Abu Ghraib and of the extraordinary rendition act.
Eleanor Roosevelt and other honourable defenders of human rights must be turning in their graves.
Where the Bush Administration went wrong was in attempting to hold the creation of the new Council to ransom in last minute negotiations.
We must make sure that, if it attempts to boycott the proceedings of the new Council, it does not succeed.
It is the EUâs responsibility to continue to pursue a sound and clear-sighted working relationship with Mr Eliasson, via the Austrian Presidency and future presidencies, and via Mr Solana and Mr Barroso, whose voices we should like to hear louder and clearer on this issue.
Europe needs to use all of its considerable influence to ensure that the Human Rights Council is up and running at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  (Mr President, it is unacceptable that in the face of commonplace abuses of human rights the world lacks an organisation through which to condemn these events.
The UN Human Rights Commission has, over the last few years, unfortunately become a symbol of the indolence of this organisation. It was an Old Boysâ Club, where countries notorious for human rights abuses such as China, Sudan, Zimbabwe or Russia could meet.
Their main aim, however, was to prevent any kind of discussion of their own activities.
The proposal for a Human Rights Council is an attempt to create an institution which would react more rapidly to crises throughout the world and whose activities would go beyond simply sending a symbolic UN mission to the country that is the subject of criticism.
The project is not perfect, but it seems that the Human Rights Councilâs duty of carrying out an assessment of the situation in each of its member states will at least prevent the abuses that have hitherto been perpetrated by its own members.
The creation of a Human Rights Council is without doubt the best solution available to the problem of the UN Commission whose integrity has been compromised.
The European Union should give the new institution its full support so that it can deal effectively with global challenges in the field of human rights protection.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the opinions expressed here.
They largely confirm that the position of the EU was the right one.
The expectations of the new Council are high, and a consistent position on its use is required to enable it to meet those expectations and to function properly.
Of course, we cannot abolish the laws of political reality from one day to the next, but I do believe that we have a chance.
The EU must play a key role in this.
I am obliged to the House for the support that you have expressed here.
It has been pointed out repeatedly that the election of members of the Human Rights Council is of the utmost importance.
We all regret that the original proposal for a two-thirds majority could not be pushed through.
Nevertheless, I should like to reiterate that the EUâs commitment, which I mentioned earlier, to vote only for countries who have a clean human rights record, is extremely important.
We are not talking here about just 25 or 27 votes, but rather, if we include associated countries â indeed, the community of democratic nations as a whole â we are talking about a large number, which is capable of blocking membership of countries who are in fact flagrant human rights violators.
MrÂ Coveney said that the figure of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council is too high, that the instrument is too large.
That is open to debate.
It should be borne in mind that, at all events, the membership of the Human Rights Council is a little smaller than that of the Commission on Human Rights.
Compared with 191 Member States of the United Nations, I personally consider the figure of 47 perfectly appropriate.
Incidentally, that has in fact meant rather fewer seats for the Western group, owing to the fact that members are to now be elected not at Ecosoc but directly in the General Assembly.
That, too, is regrettable, but we have to take the rough with the smooth.
If we want a powerful, relatively small instrument, we have to accept that we shall have somewhat fewer votes.
I actually agree with everything MrÂ Schmidt said.
The demand by the United States that the five permanent members of the Security Council be given automatic membership of the Human Rights Council was a relatively early proposal that was no longer supported in the latter phase.
It would certainly not have had the support of the EU, and as such was never really going to be able to command a majority.
MrsÂ Flautre pointed out that the important dossiers that are still being dealt with by the Commission on Human Rights must be completed.
The EU will of course ensure that the outstanding issues are brought to a close, namely in such a way as to benefit human rights, and such that these dossiers can be taken over immediately by the Human Rights Council.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the motion for a resolution creating the Human Rights Council was adopted by such a resounding majority âÂ 70 votes in favour, 4 against and 3Â abstentionsÂ â would certainly give the impression that this Council will have a certain credibility.
There is no doubt that 9Â May, election day for members of the Council, will be a landmark day in the emergence of the fledgling council.
On this point, I trust that candidate countries will submit their candidacies one month ahead of the vote, as the Union has requested they do.
The Council is set to meet for the first time in Geneva on 16Â June, and I trust that we shall be attending the session in good numbers.
Whilst the Human Rights Council is undeniably a happy outcome of the last UN summit, it is also true that the big winner has in fact been multilateral architecture, with the creation, also in December 2005, of the Peacebuilding Committee, which is similarly set to meet soon.
The year 2006 is set to be a good one for multilateralism.
In both cases, the EU has shown its commitment to effective multilateralism. It has also demonstrated leadership and its ability also to wield some influence in this UN reform.
I feel that we can continue down this path together.
Â Â  â To wind up the debate, I have received four motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
â the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed (COM(2005)0694 â C6-0026/2006 â 2005/0270(CNS) (A6-0033/2006), and
â the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (COM(2005)0698 â C6-0027/2006 â 2005/0275(CNS)) (A6-0034/2006).
I should like to remind speakers in this debate of what I said for the previous one, namely that this is a very long late-night sitting and that I shall therefore be ruthless when it comes to speaking time.
Please understand, therefore, if I have to take disciplinary action to keep you to the time officially allocated to you to speak.
This remark naturally does not apply to MrsÂ Kroes, to whom I now give the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, I want to start by thanking MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on both reports, the first on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin and the second on traditional specialities guaranteed.
The Commission appreciates the efficient organisation of your work, which has enabled adoption of the reports within a short period of time.
In my opening statement I address both reports, thereby focusing on the general background that has led to these Commission proposals.
Firstly, as regards the report on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, almost 14 years ago the European Community established a voluntary system of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines and spirits.
Since 1993, over 700 names have been registered.
Almost 300 requests are currently waiting for registration; this gives an idea of the success of this system.
This success may explain the interest shown by our trade partners in this regulation.
The conclusions of the recent WTO panels on cases brought by the US and Australia impose on us the obligation to open the Community scheme to direct applications and objections from individuals in third countries.
This is the fundamental reason for the proposal you have on the table: to ensure conformity with the conclusions of the panels.
On the basis of experience gained in managing the registration process, we realised that the current system would not survive an additional burden of direct applications from operators in third countries.
Thus we had to streamline the system and make it more efficient.
If we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill.
I should add that, in order to avoid any risk of a new complaint at WTO level, the procedure for third-country and EU denominations should be as similar as possible.
We have all been surprised by the extent of the changes required under the WTO ruling.
While the Community won the panel on the substantive trademark issue, we lost on the procedural questions.
We also included one clear policy change, namely promoting the use of Community logos for enhancing the credibility of the system.
Apart from that, however, there are no policy initiatives, as the primary purpose of the proposal is to conform to the WTO panel findings within the deadline.
The many demands and suggestions for policy development set out in the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are issues that deserve more time to be adequately addressed.
Let me turn now to the other proposal, which concerns traditional specialities guaranteed.
In spite of the modest number of products registered, some producers have shown their interest in this regulation.
There are only 50 names registered as traditional specialities guaranteed, but there are 19 applications pending at Community level and a number of others under examination in the Member States.
This regulation has not been amended since its adoption in 1992.
The procedures have been designed neither for 25 nor for 27 Member States, or for handling a significant number of applications.
There is a similar need to streamline and standardise the content of applications so that more efficient procedures are adopted and so that producers who make the effort to engage in quality schemes are not disappointed by approvals being delayed for several years.
I also consider it important to correct a number of inconsistencies and to reflect substantial advances in legal drafting standards since 1992.
At the same time, we propose simplifications and clarifications and other improvements identical to those proposed for geographical indications and designations of origin.
Finally, we are keen to make it clear in this regulation that WTO rules are respected and to forestall any criticism.
In conclusion, these proposals achieve WTO conformity and introduce limited but necessary housekeeping that is designed to streamline and clarify procedures.
We can thereby underpin the mechanisms and better serve producers and consumers who rely on denominations.
However, particularly in the light of the WTO deadline of 3 April 2006, we did not propose deeper policy changes.
Those will be addressed in due course within the framework of a wide reflection on agricultural quality policy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am glad that the Commissioner is here to represent the Commission at todayâs debate on this report.
Her colleague, Commissioner FischerÂ Boel, cannot be present, but that should not prevent us from making this a good discussion.
The Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process, but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO.
The beginnings of a legislative framework for quality assurance came inÂ 1992, as much as 14Â years ago, but, of course, that was not the start of high-quality production in the areas that were protected at that time.
It was rather the case that, as with organic farming, the matter of the products at issue here had been introduced onto the market long ago, over a period of decades, by producers, and proceeded to gain consumer acceptance.
There then followed harmonisation and streamlining measures, clarifications and safeguards.
With regard to quality policy, there are only two areas within agriculture that are designated âqualityâ. These are the area under discussion today, and organic farming.
Everything else is covered by the concept of food safety.
Here, however, we are talking about and focusing on quality, in particular.
As the Commissioner has already mentioned, this is no trifling matter, it is a billion-euro business.
Granting regions and businesses protection of geographical indications, designations of origin or specialities creates genuine added value.
It is understandable that others will covet this added value.
The dispute is with the United States, in particular â and when I say United States, I mean the large multinationals.
These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks.
In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, SpreewÃ€lder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), ThÃŒringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck â from both Austria and South Tyrol (SÃŒdtiroler Speck) â with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them.
That is why they, too, have joined the discussion in the WTO, and now we are presenting our response.
The good thing about the discussion is that the WTO has said from the outset, as a matter of principle, that our rules are in accordance with its own rules.
What is not in accordance with its rules, and where improvements need to be made, is the issue of third country access to these protected quality indications.
We are making good this shortcoming, and I also think that this makes sense.
I should also like to point out, however, that another kind of desire also comes to the fore here.
For example, producers of Parma ham or Tiroler Speck may think to themselves: if we were to buy the pigs on the wider market, it would be cheaper than having to produce them in the region or stipulating that the regions from which we obtain them be specifically geared towards such production â because this would naturally mean an increase in production costs.
If we do not do that, however, we run the risk, in the international discussions within the WTO â and the multinationals will keep on and on at us about it â of lapsing into arbitrariness, of undermining our own quality indications and thus ultimately losing the protection.
This being the case, it would be a highly dubious business to believe it is possible to buy raw materials at cheaper prices, and that is why we have stipulated and are stipulating that there be a special relationship between the regions in this regard.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words of a procedural nature.
As the Commissioner is also aware, the Council has already made a decision.
We are once again holding a discussion here despite the fact that everything has already been decided, and that is unacceptable.
The matter has to be debated first.
I hope that we can also make that clear in the Constitution once it has been ratified.
We considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure annoyance, because, once again, we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored.
However, we believe that this would project an outward lack of unity on our part in the WTO proceedings, and enable others to say: aha, they are not even agreed among themselves.
Since we are in favour of strengthening and securing the EU position, we shall let it pass, but we should like to make clear where the Councilâs weaknesses lie in some regards, and would ask Commissioner Kroes to communicate that in her role as Commissioner, so that she reconsiders her decisions.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of geographical indications and of traditional specialities for agricultural products and foodstuffs is an important instrument for the development and sustainability of quality products.
On the whole, I consider the work carried out by the Commission to be very positive.
Given that two phases of analysis of the question had been foreseen, one on a national and one on a Community level, it was absolutely necessary to make sure they were coordinated.
I am convinced that the greater responsibilities given by the Member States, the precise terms articulating the procedure and the new system of oppositions, address the need for faster and more efficient recognition, that is to say for a quick check that is also endowed with the crucial characteristic of completeness.
The opportunity for third countries to access the European system for the protection of agricultural products makes it necessary to protect the consumer from a false association between Community symbols and the actual origin of a product.
The indication of the origin of a product on a label, along with the diversification of the colour of Community logos and the authorisation of the use of expressions for processed products, are all innovations that address the need for greater protection of consumers.
Furthermore, I believe that these measures will encourage producers to take greater and fuller advantage of the labelling of excellent products by following the approach to food quality that the European Union promotes.
Lastly, I support Amendments 48 and 50, which are aimed at allowing the involvement of regional authorities in the national checking phase and greater protection of the protected designation of origin (PDO) and the protected geographical indication (PGI) with respect to other forms of protection like trademarks.
I hope that my fellow Members will share this point of view by approving these two amendments tomorrow.
Finally, I wish to thank the Commission, which has put this before Parliament, in which regard I also pick up what my fellow Member said earlier, for these procedures and for their recognition of the production of quality products.
They have addressed a widespread need for fast action, but also, and above all, the protection of the excellence of rural areas in Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as the rapporteur has said quite rightly, I believe that quality is European agricultureâs great asset.
In view of the global market in which we increasingly have to compete, as a result of extremely low labour costs, scant environmental and hygiene requirements â in other words, lower prices â I believe that quality must set us apart.
We therefore need guaranteed and certified quality by means of a simpler and easily recognisable system in which the consumers have confidence, both inside and outside of Europe â and that is what we are working on.
Furthermore, it is essential that these denominations are recognised outside of the Union, in the WTO, so that we can establish a market in high-quality agricultural products.
We are working on that, and I believe that the work that has been done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this position.
The first challenge facing us is to strengthen our system of consumers and producers even further.
We need a faster system, with clearly defined time periods and procedures, in which competences are properly allocated.
I believe that the way the sector itself perceives it is as important as the way the consumers perceive it, and it must be shown the economic advantages of a high-quality market: the security of a system of denomination which properly controls the products that do not comply with the conditions set, and a quick and not too burdensome procedure.
I believe that the issue that we are dealing with is very important, particularly for countries such as my own, which are pioneers of ecological agriculture.
As I have said, I believe that this issue deserves more in-depth consideration, and we must do this once the requirements of the WTO â and this must happen as soon as possible â have been complied with, simplifying access to the system for third-country products.
During the subsequent examination and reflection that we will hold in this House, I believe that it is essential to listen to the sector and to be attentive to its needs, thinking at all times of directing our products and our quality towards the global market, these being the values of a truly competitive European agri-food sector.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has once again done his duty as rapporteur with his usual enthusiasm, and on that I should like to congratulate him.
I concur with the thrust of his conclusions.
In the light of increasing liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, it is necessary for us to recognise more geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs at international level.
His conclusions are completely justified therefore.
What also comes into play for me is what precisely the definition of a geographical indication in Europe itself is.
MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf mentioned the example of Parma ham, that that should originate in that region.
I have always been puzzled by the fact that Germany, rather than the Netherlands, is the largest producer of Edam cheese, and I believe that that state of affairs should change.
If we regulate this in the WTO â and I am pleased that he sees eye to eye with me on this â and we ask the others to recognise our products, it seems only natural to me that we also recognise theirs.
I am not entirely of the same mind as MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf when he says that at present, there are only two quality categories of agricultural products in the European Union, namely those with geographical indications and those that are produced organically.
Whilst this may be true at the moment, we must go much further.
It is necessary to introduce a European quality mark for agricultural products.
If we ask our farmers to respect animal welfare standards, environmental objectives, and suchlike, then it would be very unfair to expect those farmers to compete with the rest of the world, with farmers who do not need to adhere to those same standards.
Since customers must be able to distinguish them in the shops, we must develop a quality mark for products other than geographical and organic ones.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, on the topic of a proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, I would like to draw attention to something that is said in the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, namely that intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.
It is precisely for this reason that we may express wonder and regret over the fact that we have so far had no targeted plan for developing a system specifically for the protection of intellectual property.
The new instrument should finally eliminate the persistent disputes at the WTO between the EU and some of its trading partners.
Once this matter has been resolved, we can only hope that the Commission will then return to the issue of geographical indications and designations of origin with clear conceptual aims.
I would like to add that designations of origin and geographical indications constitute an integral component of intellectual property, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
Under the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the issue of intellectual property belongs unambiguously and exclusively to the remit of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore odd both from a procedural and a practical viewpoint that the drafting of this report was entrusted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without including in it even an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Â Â  . (Mr President, the aims of both proposals for regulations seem well-founded.
It is difficult not to support an increase in the income of farmers, fair conditions for competition and protection from fake copies of original products.
There are, however, doubts as to whether the aims set are realistic.
Let us consider the result to date of existing solutions.
Within the framework of guaranteed, traditional specialities only 15 agricultural and food products have so far been registered throughout the Union.
Is it really necessary to create complex procedures and expand bureaucracy for the benefit of a dozen or a few dozen products?
Will the farmer-producer really gain anything by it?
Within the framework of the system for the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin over 700 names have been registered across the EU including 150 cheeses, 160 types of meat or meat products, 150 types of fruit and vegetables and 80 types of olive oil.
There are 300 new applications pending examination.
By creating this legislation, will we not soon find ourselves in a ridiculous position, bordering on the laughable?
In a few years we will have thousands of original product names wanting to conquer supermarkets across the whole of the EU.
As customers, we will be worn down by them and the costly bureacratic system will turn out to be inefficient when dealing with applications.
Would it not be better to give up the idea of regulating local delicacies?
If we turn delicacies into mass products, they will no longer be delicacies.
Let them remain a natural attraction of particular places or regions, but without the support of the European Union.
Â Â  . ( Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on his excellent reports.
I am delighted that we will achieve the necessary simplifications in the registration procedures for local food produce and that we will have more of these products available, or rather that they will be more familiar to us, as we are of course talking about traditional products that have been on the market for a long time.
The real future of Europe lies in supporting traditional, regional products which represent the achievements of local communities.
It is something at which we can excel, at which we can surpass others and thanks to which we can build a European market that is a common market and yet is rich thanks to the variety of regional specialities.
It is a great opportunity for regional producers.
Most of all, however, it is good news for consumers as these products are made according to traditional recipes and using methods that go back generations and are healthier and better than mass-produced goods.
It is also the best way to face the challenge presented by biotechnology companies.
They want to force us to consume their mass-produced food which is the result of genetic engineering.
We should be clear on this matter. We want to consume products that are healthy, varied and produced using traditional, regional methods, and we do not want to be forced to consume food products made using methods that cheat nature.
Â Â  Mr President, for the last few decades the common agricultural policy has encouraged farmers to produce more, regardless of quality.
As a result, they have two Mercedes in the yard and shops are full of produce which is neither palatable nor cheap.
We have to pay more for so-called âorganicâ products in order to buy what should be normal food.
It is cynical to say that consumers today regard quality as more important than quantity.
They simply want to eat food once again that they have not seen for a long time and to which they have a right.
We, meanwhile, are spending most of our budget on the common agricultural policy, mainly in the old Member States.
Let us hope that, by simplifying the current procedures, these regulations relating to the protection of geographical indications, designations of origin and traditional specialities will favour farmers who produce healthy and tasty produce.
I would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for addressing this important issue.
I hope that farmers, especially those from the new Member States who have not yet had the time or money to take up agricultural production on an industrial scale, will be rewarded for their traditional production methods.
We do not have such splendid processing methods as those for which French cuisine is renowned, but we do have healthy, tasty farm produce and food.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, there is no need for me to spell out how much we value our system of protected geographical indications (PGO) and protected designations of origin (PDO) and how keen we are to defend them and ensure compliance with them, within and outside the Union.
As things stand, following the repeated and, to my mind, all-too-frequent reforms of the common agricultural policy, producers in many of our regions only survive on account of the quality of their products and their expertise. Happily, consumers are increasingly appreciative of this and are prepared to pay reasonable prices, thereby helping to keep people in work up- and downstream and, in turn, contributing to rural development.
It has been well documented that the United States and Australia had the nerve to attack our successful regulation on the issue at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Over 700 product designations have been registered since 1993, the commercial value of which is put at over EURÂ 10Â billion.
I feel I should mention at this point the registration of , which MrÂ Ebner, who has given me his two minutes of speaking time in this debate, holds especially dear.
The WTOâs competent body has fortunately come to the conclusion that our regulation was not in breach of WTO rules.
All we have to do is adapt it by 20Â April â there is no time to waste, in other words â so as to place third country nationals on an equal footing with EU citizens as regards the application procedure and the right to object.
I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to commend him on the excellent spirit of collaboration, which is not always in evidence between factions across the political divide in Parliament.
I welcome the fact that â with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and with other luminaries of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, including the chairman, MrÂ Daul â we have succeeded in reaching agreement on amendments aimed at clarifying and simplifying matters and at making them more specific, as well as at ensuring respect, via adequate monitoring, for this intellectual property of our farmers, which is one of the last raw materials possessed by Europeans.
What we especially want to do â by means of specific deadlines:Â six months for the Commission to examine applications, four months to raise objections â is to avoid there being damaging delays for the operators involved.
We want to see Community symbols, our logos, distinguished by specific colours and to ensure that these are not used by third countries.
Lastly, we wish to ensure that if the registration of a PDO or PGI is cancelled, it cannot be registered as a trade mark for five years. This is to prevent any economic pressure being put on producers.
I know that many Members of this Chamber have had many ideas and suggestions for improving the law, but we would call on the Council, as time is ticking away, to implement initially only the changes made necessary by the WTOâs ruling.
According to ...
Â Â  (Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on two excellent reports.
I would also like to express my conviction that it is precisely these new regulations adopted by Parliament that will further the development of agricultural food production, and in particular the revitalisation of rural areas by promoting their traditions and cultural values and increasing employment outside of the farming sector.
I think that a transparent and simplified registration procedure and a clear division of competences between the Member States and the Commission will provide more effective protection for consumers and producers, citizens of the Union and, most of all, for those who manufacture these products.
They will be protected from fake copies, the misuse of original names, the copying of lists of ingredients and other fraudulent practices used by people looking to make a quick profit.
The proposed regulations do indeed contribute to guaranteeing a credible system to protect the quality of registered products which are trusted and whose popularity is growing in the Union and across the world.
These products will now not only feature the producerâs label but also the label of the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must be in a position to guarantee and protect the quality of its agricultural and food production.
In order to achieve this objective it is necessary to defend traditional specialities and geographical indications, even against attacks launched from inside the World Trade Organisation by the United States and Australia.
The rapporteur has done an excellent job to improve the two regulations.
We need to protect products in order to have a real impact on improving food safety and prevent the homogenisation of flavour, which is occurring on a global scale.
All too often, sadly, we find examples of counterfeiting: the largest market in southern Italy, Vittoria in Sicily, is every day flooded with counterfeit products that are put on the market as protected geographical indication products, for example Pachino cherry tomatoes.
For this reason, we believe that labelling is needed to reveal the indication of the place of origin and processing of a product.
We must question ourselves, however, over one matter: all too often those in favour of the PDO and PGI scheme are more concerned with commercialisation than with production.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for helping to protect regional individuality and rural self-sufficiency.
Europe has such rich and varied produce and food, and we certainly need to protect that from trade liberalisation absolutists.
The family recipe, the local flavour, the hand-made product, the quality and unique character need our protection to keep our regions as rich as they are now.
But what use will all this valuable work be if, concurrently, we allow GM to infiltrate our crops, and thus our food and produce?
Here we are trying to protect the individuality of products and the uniqueness of local ingredients.
How can we claim that our ingredients are local if they are all modified in a laboratory?
Those seeds are certainly not your family's variation; they are an identikit Monsanto seed of a particular batch number, exactly the same seed as millions of others around the globe.
How can we then claim that our products are unique, that they are our rich regional flavour, or that they are from our region at all?
Would honesty not require us to label our produce as 'Monsanto Corporation, produced in St Louis, Missouri'?
We must allow regions to choose whether they wish to be GM and we must protect those which do not.
We must not only appreciate and preserve local specialities but also the farmers' markets at which they are still sometimes locally sold.
We must ensure that, in regulating food marketing, we do not kill off the remaining traditional local farmers' markets.
Â Â  ( Mr President, it is fortunate that we are holding a joint debate on MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorfâs reports.
In one of the reports, in point 5 of the justification, the text reads that âthe aim of the proposals is to simplify the procedure and to provide an accurate definition of the remits of the different bodies during the examination process for the proposalâ.
This, along with other annotations, such as those under point 9, gives us hope that in the final Council regulations we will be able to avoid red tape and legal inconsistencies.
This is particularly important with regard to the regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
We have to remember that geographical indications are part of the heritage of certain local communities and individual nations and that they are responsible for protecting them.
The protection of geographical indications and designations of origin of foodstuffs at a Community level should only fulfil a supporting function and prevent dishonest practices.
However, âonly national bodies shall have the authorityâ to impose penalties at a national level, as stated in Article 11(3).
Regional products and foodstuffs have to support regional development and broaden the range of tourist attractions, including agro-tourism.
No one wants a Union where everyone everywhere dresses the same, eats the same food and speaks in the same manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary.
Regions have a right to exploit and protect such specialities for their own economic benefit.
I note that it is estimated that, in those Member States where this is done, around EURÂ 5Â billion a year is raised, in terms of added value, by promoting such geographical indications.
Of course, there is also a knock-on effect in terms of impact and job creation and in population retention in rural areas.
My sole regret is that, to date, my region â Northern Ireland â has not yet availed itself of this facility, though I would have to say, biased as I am, that we are rich in such commodities.
Ulster beef, which all Europeans will soon be able to savour again when the beef ban is lifted, has a taste and quality which makes it renowned and which caused the Greenfield label to be synonymous with the highest quality.
Our wheaten and soda breads are must-taste delicacies and Armagh Bramley apples have a very distinct reputation.
I would therefore call on the British Government in this debate to avail itself forthwith of the opportunities available under these regulations.
In terms of these regulations, a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic.
I would therefore make a plea that the maximum effort should be made to simplify the process so that regional products may be protected and promoted more swiftly, and I welcome what the Commissioner had to say in that regard.
In the context of the WTO, it is vital that Europe defends the rights accrued under those regulations and does not give in to the pressures coming from third countries.
I agree strongly with our rapporteur that the EU must use all its clout and diplomatic skill to defend geographical indications.
Whilst we should take encouragement from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body's rejection of recent attacks by the United States and Australia, we cannot afford any sense of complacency.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to join in thanking the rapporteur for his really excellent reports, and also the shadow rapporteurs for their very efficient cooperation on this.
I regard both of these reports as among the very important dossiers of this parliamentary term: particularly the report on protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin.
As the Commissioner mentioned, there are already over 700 products that have been registered and 300 procedures that have been commenced.
That represents a key aspect as far as European agriculture and rural areas are concerned.
I believe that intellectual property is also relevant to these products, and that these products, as it were, contribute towards the identity of a region.
If we open up our markets to products from third countries, we must be able to make this conditional on these countries applying the same standards in terms of quality and social aspects as prevail within the EU.
The fact is that we are living in a global world, but nevertheless fair competition can only be afforded if the same requirements and rules apply within the WTO and are put into practice.
Generally speaking, however, we must take care that the procedure involves careful scrutiny, and that there is no levelling down.
Quality has its price.
As Horst KÃ¶hler, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, said yesterday, the EUâs higher prices must be matched by superiority in quality.
To cite an example, in Austria, there are 180Â 000 farmers engaged in production. These demonstrably safeguard approximately 600Â 000 jobs upstream and downstream.
This also reveals how important active farming enterprises and family-run farms engaged in production are to rural areas.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur and my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, one of the strong points of which is that it emphasises a key concept, which is that Europeâs farming will only survive on the basis of quality.
Consequently, at the heart of any political measure taken by the EU, not least in international fora such as the World Trade Organisation, must be the defence of labels and other protected designations, as this is the only way of guaranteeing the sustainable competitiveness of European products in a globalised world.
I personally come from a region that has more than 30 products registered under the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) schemes.
These designations are without question an asset for the producers who benefit from them.
It is a similar idea to one we have always used in another sector, which does not fall under the scope of this text but which requires support and protection from Europe.
I refer, of course, to the winemaking sector, which accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in my region, southern France, and hundreds of thousands of jobs around Europe, and which is currently enduring a major crisis.
If nothing is done, including at European level, there is a danger that Europe will lose its soul.
Â Â  ( Mr President, today we are discussing how to protect traditional, speciality agricultural products.
The regulation mentions the time scale of a single generation of production required in order for a product to qualify as a product that is produced using traditional methods.
Concerns have been raised regarding the amendment which restricts the definition to products that were in use before World War II.
This discriminates against Eastern European Countries.
As a consequence of World War II, Poland lost half of its territory and several million people were displaced to lands that had been regained.
Therefore, the continuity of tradition was broken.
During Communist rule, production of traditional products for trading purposes was also banned.
Only for the past decade or so, after independence was regained, have communities in specific regions returned to traditional, healthy production methods for foodstuffs, for example traditional Polish sausages and hams.
This had previously been impossible.
Another extremely important question is the issue of certainty regarding whether foodstuffs will be sufficiently monitored with respect to quality and whether a situation can be avoided where the increasing supply of genetically modified plants across Europe leads to traditional products becoming tainted.
There are, after all, countries in Europe where genetically modified plants have spread beyond all control and will certainly soon threaten traditional products because of the change in the ingredients list.
The annexed register of products classed as traditional products should also be expanded to include delicatessen goods.
Â Â  Mr President, the report on designations of origin and geographical indications presented to us by the Commission states that its intention in drawing it up has been to clarify procedures and to bring Community legislation into line with a judgment of the World Trade Organisation.
The protection of geographical indications is naturally extremely important.
It is essential in order to provide consumers with accurate information concerning the quality, origin and production methods of the products they consume.
It therefore seems logical that we should avoid confusing consumers, and the use of the Community logo on third-country products should not therefore be authorised.
Furthermore, the Members of this House have an obligation to the diversity and wealth of European gastronomic heritage, which has so far enjoyed an international reputation.
We must conform to the judgment of the tribunal of the World Trade Organisation â there is no question about that; that is what it is for â and we must modify the Regulation in order to guarantee that it complies with those requirements.

Nevertheless, until the WTO includes in its debate the international system of geographical indications and thus until we have an international register of geographical indications, it does not make much sense for the modifications of our Community Regulation to go any further than is strictly necessary.
Furthermore, we must ensure that the changes to the Regulation do not lead to delays in the register or lead to discrimination between the European Union and third countries, because the procedure for Community authorisation demands compliance with very strict quality and food safety requirements.
Would the Commission be able to ensure that third-country products conform to those same standards?
In all honesty, I do not believe so.
I therefore believe that the amendment from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats should be supported and I also believe that the differing views on health systems amongst the Member States must ensure that the farmers and producers are not the only ones who have to pay for the extension of the legislation on food hygiene to designations of origin.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate our rapporteur.
The establishment of the protected designation of origin (PDO), the protected geographical indication (PGI) and the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) is a step in the right direction for the development of rural areas.
It will help both to preserve natural and cultural heritage, and to extend the range of high-quality products to a growing number of demanding and well-informed consumers.
I can bear witness to this from the experience of my country, in which more than 100 products have become subject to these arrangements, and most of them have registered reasonable commercial success.
In some cases, the success of the market represents both the rehabilitation of indigenous breeds that had been heading for extinction and of operating methods which would otherwise have been seriously at risk or would have disappeared.
The thrust of the proposals before us will help to enhance the existing regulatory framework and bring it into line with WTO rules, with which we wish to comply.
I wish to underline that clearer identification of Community symbols by means of colouring, identification of the origin and place of processing of products from third countries, and the fact that the Commissionâs decision was upheld, render the process more credible and will lead to cheaper prices and less bureaucracy.
Â Â  Mr President, before I address the subject of todayâs debate, it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally.
The announcement was made today in Ireland.
When we talk about the WTO, Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production.
Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3Â 500 farmers will be very badly affected.
Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead, as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies?
If sugar beet is sacrificed today, as it has been in Ireland, what about EU beef farming tomorrow?
With regard to this report, I thank the rapporteur for his good work.
However, I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity â as we should â but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union, which also needs protection.
I regret that in Ireland we have only three products that are registered under the PGIÂ description, but we have many hundreds of small food companies that could take the protection offered by these regulations.
I would urge them to do so.
We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO.
We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it cannot be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards.
By all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods, but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection.
Â Â  â Mr President, I must first add my tribute to the rapporteur, MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf, for his remarkable work aimed at providing better information and better protection for producers, manufacturers and consumers. His report managed, on the one hand, to steer clear of conservative protectionism, and, on the other, to show recognition and respect for our expertise.
This will not please everyone, however, and the best proof of this is the firm line taken in the United States and Australia, which want geographical indications only to be admitted under exceptional circumstances and are seeking to have them restricted to certain wines and spirits.
The EU must do all it can to defend these geographical indications and must use all its diplomatic acumen, especially in the forthcoming negotiations on the transposition of the Hong Kong decisions.
Geographical indications are an excellent way of delivering a qualitative approach to international trade.
Unfortunately, there has not been a single sign of the geographical indications being sustainably enshrined at the WTO.
The Commission must be capable of playing an important role in this respect.
We need to be aware that quality and recognition bring hope for the future of Europeâs farming.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am obliged to my fellow Members, and should like to pass on some of this great praise to my collaborators.
MrÂ Mulder, I was also pleased with your contribution.
We agree with each other in substance, but I am also pleased that you have praised my commitment.
Of course, we are both now getting on a bit and have been in this business a long time; yet we are still concerned with things, we have not tired of fighting for what we think is right.
When you complain that there are only two types of quality indication, I share your criticism.
This must be extended; we must not only afford safety in the sense that people will not die from eating something, but also respect pleasure in eating, as well as quality, origin and the endeavours of generations.
This combination of free-market economy and quality assurance is exactly what we need.
Market orientation is a good thing, of course, but it needs to be combined with an appreciation of what is being achieved here.
In reply to the question a little while ago as to whether this is a purely administrative matter, I can only say: no, it is not an administrative matter, it is a system developed over generations that is now being given legislative and administrative safeguards.
That is rather different from having something imposed on us.
If there were no benefit to be gained from this, we would not be having this discussion within the WTO.
It is natural that the multinationals are keeping a watchful eye on the added value being created here â and that is considerable.
Among us, Ireland â of which I have now twice heard mention â has unfortunately yet to set a good example, and I would urge it to encourage those of its regions manufacturing products in this way to submit a request.
There must be no omissions in this regard.
This is one aspect of the information that we, Parliament included, are able to provide.
I should also like to mention the cooperation with MrsÂ Lulling.
She may not be the eldest, but she is the longest-serving among us.
Anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task.
This is not only to do with political orientation, but also with MrsÂ Lulling as a person.
Nevertheless, we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields.
I should like to mention some of the particularly important of those here.
For some obscure reason, the Council has introduced a provision that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest can have a registration of a designation of origin or of a special quality indication cancelled.
Indeed, since we are talking about added value here, the desire to transform this into trademarks will naturally arise.
To show that we are not carrying out a commercial activity here, we have tabled a joint amendment. I would ask the Commission to really ensure that the Council incorporates this.
If a protected designation is cancelled, it cannot be transformed into a trademark for a period of five years.
This gives us some leeway, and makes it that little bit more expensive for those who wish to transform designations into trademarks and are offering the people or the regions something in return.
We must proceed very carefully in such situations.
I hope that the Commissioner will take this further.
I should like to express my sincere thanks for such a constructive discussion here today.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rapporteur has received flowers from quite a number of honourable Members and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to add a couple of flowers to the bouquet.
Thank you again for the interesting exchange of views.
Let me comment on some of the points raised during this debate.
As a general comment â Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Castiglione touched upon this point â I should like to stress again that with these proposals the Commission wants to bring our legislation into conformity with the findings of the WTO panels.
This includes numerous aspects of the procedure and elements of simplification, so the system can support the implementation of the WTO findings.
That was a point mentioned by MrÂ Allister and, in my opinion, it addresses his concerns.
In response to Mr Mulder, I reiterate the intention of the Commission to further review the various policy issues not related to the WTO findings and the wider issue of the agricultural quality policy in the EC over the next year.
I have learnt a lot this evening, including the point Mr Mulder made about Edam cheese.
I should explain to Mr Mulder that Edam is a type of cheese that can be produced anywhere.
It is a Codex standard.
However, North Holland Edam is protected, and that is a Dutch quality product.
So eat more Edam from North Holland!
Let me comment in more detail on the exchange of views and address some of the issues you have raised.
Concerning the logos, the three logos established by Commission rules are already different from one another.
I also want to make it clear that any advantage given to EC producers â and I believe the use of a Community symbol is such an advantage â will be equally open to third country producers.
That answer is for Mr Castiglione and Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a.
However, the Commission agrees that this needs to be further explored.
This will be done within the framework of the wider policy review, which the Commission intends to conduct as soon as this proposal has been implemented.
Several amendments deal with the obligations of the Member States and the Commission, which Mr PodkaÅski mentioned.
The Commission has no intention of altering the current distribution of competence between the Member States and the Commission.
Amendments 23 and 24 ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications.
I agree that the Commission should carry out its duties within a reasonable period of time.
Mrs Lulling and MrsÂ Salinas GarcÃ­a touched upon that.
I agree that we should take into account the definition of a reasonable period of time, which is not easy, given the complexity of applications.
It is certainly not realistic to have all the applications scrutinised and published in six months; twelve months would be more acceptable.
Your amendments on controls reflect the aim of the Commission proposal, which is to ensure that there is a clear understanding that all over the EC there are authorities in charge of enforcing the Community rules on geographical indications and traditional specialities.
There is also no doubt that these controls will be carried out within the framework of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law.
There are points that concern only the geographical indications report that I want to mention.
These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials.
I confirm that your proposals concerning the use of protected names in relation to ingredients for processed products meet some of the Commissionâs concerns.
However, the general rules on labelling already cover cases of misleading information.
Further restrictions on the use of registered names for processed products would mean a major policy change that deserves to be adequately and thoroughly assessed.
I took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials.
The Commission shares Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfâs objective that people should not be misled in this respect.
However, we have to be very prudent.
Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain designations.
Finally, I shall make a few points on the TSG report.
The current regulation on traditional specialities guaranteed has no definition for the term âtraditionalâ.
We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least 25 years.
We believe that this is a good compromise.
As a result, the Commission can in principle accept the following amendments in the report on geographical indications: Amendments 1, 10, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 31.
Of the last-minute amendments tabled for this part-session, the Commission can in principle accept Amendments 41, 43, 49 and 54.
In the report on traditional specialities, it can accept Amendments 6, 10, 13 and 16.
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments to these reports.
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the oral question by Mr Gargani to the Commission on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on legal professions and general interest in the functioning of legal systems (O-0003/2006 â B6-0005/2006).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually here to represent my colleague MrÂ Gargani, who, as Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, is the real draftsman of this question.
Nevertheless, it is an honour for me to do so.
Before I give detailed reasons for this question, I should like to say a few words about the background.
The history of this issue, namely that of liberal professions, in particular legal professions â to whom this question relates â goes back several years.
Parliament dealt with this issue in the previous parliamentary term on the basis of two questions for oral answer in the corresponding resolutions, particularly in the light of the activities of the Internal Market and Services Directorate General under Mario Monti, the former Commissioner for competition, and also in view of the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies that sparked off this whole debate.
I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs actually always held a broad conviction â even across the political spectrum â that this Vienna study took a very biased approach, one biased towards economic aspects, and did not take sufficient account of the specific role of the liberal professions, particularly the legal professions, in administering justice.
The Committee also feared â and this was borne out to some extent by the documents â that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and, furthermore, was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues.
After all, liberal professions, with their particular importance, quite simply cannot be compared with the supermarket round the corner in terms of competition policy and competition law.
Their origins are different, their importance to the functioning of society is different.
Presenting another question for oral answer today, following the latest Commission interim report presented by CommissionerÂ Kroes â an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week â practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term.
I should like to make it crystal clear at this juncture that we, too, are of course well aware that antiquated customs should be dispensed with.
We are no longer living in the Middle Ages, and the guild system is a thing of the past.
Nonetheless, particular account must of course be taken of the distinguishing features of the liberal professions: in particular the legal professions, which are what interests the Committee on Legal Affairs.
These features form part of the judicial system, and have to function.
If the system does not function, the public suffers, being afforded insufficient legal protection, and this means that an intrinsic part of democracy, namely the rule of law, is also called into question.
That is why the rules for the liberal professions have to be scrutinised very carefully and in great detail, and why we have to consider carefully what is needed in order to afford legal protection and access to justice for all citizens that is as effective and safe as possible, including in practice.
Naturally, this should be done with particular regard to the case law of the European Court of Justice.
I should now like to turn to a specific problem which has, of course, also been addressed in conjunction with this question, and which was one of the reasons that the Committee on Legal Affairs wanted a further debate on this issue today in plenary.
That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions, since, in many EU Member States, these have a special nature and importance, especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses, and also in situations in which companies providing legal-expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients.
Such things are virtually impossible without tariffs, and are also deeply rooted in the legal traditions of many Member States.
As such, they should not be called into question without good cause, because they also represent a fundamental aspect of consumer protection.
This should be made quite clear at this juncture.
The case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past.
Just recently â a few weeks ago â we saw a specific instance in which the Advocate General, too, attempted to show due care in such issues.
It is very important to us that the Commission cease dealing with this fundamental issue â which is extremely important to the functioning of the legal professions in many Member States â in this way, as the Commissionâs documents would suggest.
The Commission cannot treat the liberal professions in the same way as it does supermarkets.
These professions have a special importance and role.
Some EU Member States have now abolished tariffs and, interestingly, this has meant an increase in prices for lawyers and consumers, for example â in some cases they are considerably higher, on average, than those in Member States who still have such a system.
Particularly with regard to the price trend, this system has ensured that legal protection for consumers continues to be accessible and financially sustainable.
We would now welcome a reply to our oral question from CommissionerÂ Kroes, who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee, on behalf of the Commission.
We shall then have the opportunity to respond to it, both in the context of the debate and, in the coming week, in the context of the resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission thanks the Committee on Legal Affairs for its question and Mr Lehne for doing a great job here this evening.
He presented his views quite clearly.
The Commission recognises the special role of the legal sector in the good administration of justice and in promoting access to justice â by the way, in response to the example cited by MrÂ Lehne, the Commission also recognises that supermarkets are very important and very honourable members of our community â we are certainly not challenging this.
But we are saying that we need to look afresh at the current regulation of the sector to see what can be modernised to promote new types of services and new ways of doing things.
That is in the interests of the users of these key services.
So we are proposing that Member States use a proportionality test to see how far current regulations are all really serving the public interest.
This approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle.
It allows for national circumstances, and the special characteristics of the legal sector, to be taken fully into account.
The Commission certainly agrees with the need for some regulation.
I repeat: our initiative is about better regulation, not deregulation.
We also recognise that it is the Member Statesâ right to determine the balance between state rules and self-regulation by professional bodies.
On the question of the right of Member States to fix tariffs, I would underline the position of the Commission in its report of February 2004.
In our view the judgment suggests that state measures delegating regulatory powers to professional bodies in order to fix tariffs can be challenged under the competition rules â for example, Articles 3(1)(g), 10(2) and 81 EC â if the state does not have the final word and exercise effective control of the implementation of these tariffs.
We are expecting further clarification on this when the Court delivers its preliminary ruling in the case (case C-202/04).
Finally, there are the internal market rules.
These are at issue in another case pending before the European Court of Justice, the case (case C-04/04), again concerning the Member Statesâ responsibility for price fixing.
The Commission considers that minimum prices for lawyersâ services are a restriction on the freedom to provide services because they neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States.
Moreover, we see no justification for minimum prices under the proportionality test, since they do not per se guarantee quality, access to justice, or good ethical conduct.
Â Â  . Mr President, the question from the Committee on Legal Affairs is appropriate since relations between lawyers and notaries, and the legal professions in general â as MrÂ Lehne has said â and their clients must be given special consideration.
The European Commission must not deal with these cases as if they were a question of a mere business relationship between client and service provider.
The relationship between a solicitor or notary and their client affects the administration of justice, a sensitive issue in terms of democracy, as Mr Lehne has also pointed out.
The work of the professional associations of legal professions in the different countries is very beneficial to relations, not just corporate relations, but also those in defence of the public interest.
The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which MrsÂ Kroes is so keen to see, has so far recognised that systems such as the Spanish system conform to European legislation, whose fee rates are merely guidelines, rather than minimums, which help the judicial administration to set costs, which is ultimately always controlled judicially.
Neither should the opposition of many lawyers from many countries to the pact be questioned.
This pact violates the dignity of work and shows a lack of consideration and respect for the profession.
The prohibition of the pact has also been accepted by the national courts, MrsÂ Kroes.
I would call upon the European Commission to respect the work of institutions which, like the colleges of lawyers and notaries, have generally speaking been working well for more than two centuries, despite the ups and downs and interruptions of history.
Do not forget that constitutions, such as the Spanish Constitution, recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do.
The European Commission should be loyal to the European tradition, and not to the newer United States tradition.
We must support small legal practices.
Do not make any mistakes.
Â Â  . Mr President, as will be clear, most of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs are very passionate about the legal profession.
For many of us, myself included, it was our profession before we came here and, in that sense, we have an interest.
Yet however passionate I might have been about my former profession and its independence, I am more passionate about access to justice and legal services in general and how we make those services available to serve the public interest.
The public interest in access to justice must, I believe, be our overriding goal and not the protection or convenience of lawyers who may find it more comfortable to continue to provide services in the way they have always done.
The profession needs to be independent, but its protectionism should only serve the public interest.
It seems to me that, in Europe, we have a wonderful opportunity to look around and see what exactly best serves the public interest.
For example, I have always thought that the fee scales in Germany at the lower end work well to ensure that claimants with low value problems can pursue justice.
In my own country, this is often a problem because the costs are so high and, where we have some form of fixed fee, the fees are so low that lawyers decline the work.
These are delicate balances, but Europe gives us the chance to look at many answers that may be available to these problems and to pick the best for the society we try to serve, and we should not be frightened or protective about looking for the best.
I believe that so long as the Commission shares that aim, we should be able to work together.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am totally in agreement with Mrs Wallisâs conclusion.
Let us look for the best and do it together.
That is the only way we can face all the clients and potential clients of those professionals that we are talking about.
I should like to re-emphasise some key messages about our aspirations in this area.
Our initiative is about better regulation.
What does that mean?
It means a regulation that is balanced and no more restrictive than is strictly necessary.
We want to promote, not hinder, access to justice.
That is what really makes sense.
Opening the way to greater competition in that sector will do just that; it will result in the emergence of new and innovative types of services.
That is surely a great advantage. It will benefit all by releasing the potential of the sector in terms of growth, in terms of jobs, as well as providing better-quality services and more choice for consumers.
I should like to make a more detailed comment on the crucial question of price fixing, which has been put on the table as the main issue this evening.
Generally, I do not see how wide-scale price fixing, even for in-court work, can be objectively justified for all consumers and business users.
There may be certain limited circumstances in which price regulation is justified: for example, where there is a need to provide special protection for certain disadvantaged groups, including the lower paid.
That may require very limited and carefully targeted price regulation.
More generally though, consumers and business users are likely to be better off with a number of offers from different service providers to compare and to choose from.
In systems where legal costs are borne by the defeated party, I can, however, see some merit in having a guide for judges when they need to decide on costs.
I am not saying that removing price regulation or that lower levels of regulation will automatically lead to lower prices, more choice for consumers or the creation of new jobs.
As to the removal of price regulation in the UK leading to high legal costs, I am not aware of any evidence to show that price deregulation in the UK has meant problems for UK citizens in accessing legal advice and representation, or that UK legal fees have escalated disproportionately as a result.
In fact the Law Society in the UK noted in 1999 that introducing greater competition into the area of conveyancing of property transfer led to price falls of up to 24% in the 1990s and opened the way for consumers to shop around to get the best deal.
In the country I know best, research in 2002 found that the introduction of competition in conveyancing resulted in fees falling.
Finally, a word on quality.
We all want European consumers to have access to quality legal services.
That is essential if access to justice for all is to be a reality.
But I do not think fixed prices are always essential for this.
I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that removing fixed tariffs has led to a deterioration in the quality of legal services in Member States where this has happened, though quality has a price.
A fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality.
The motto I will take over from Mrs Wallis is: âlet us look for the best and do it togetherâ.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in Brussels on Thursday, 23Â March.
Â Â  â The next item is the statement by the Commission on preparations for the COP-MOP meeting on biological diversity and security (Curitiba, Brazil).
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission is committed to implementing and further strengthening international obligations related to biodiversity.
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has underlined the need to take drastic steps if we want to avoid irreparable loss of the ecosystem services on which human wellbeing depends.
If we do not pay attention to the links between economic development and biodiversity, we will also put at risk the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment concludes that âan unprecedented effort is needed to achieve the 2010 target of a significant reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss at all levelsâ.
That global 2010 biodiversity target was adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity and endorsed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development.
High-level political commitment is therefore needed to strengthen and implement the Convention on Biological Diversity and achieve the 2010 target.
The eighth conference of the parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will take place during the next two weeks in Curitiba, Brazil.
The COP-8 is preceded by the third meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
Those are major international environmental events and Commissioner Dimas will attend the ministerial segment of the eighth conference of the parties from 26 to 30 March.
The Environment Council of last Wednesday adopted conclusions setting out the EU priorities for the eighth conference of the parties.
The conclusions are: first, strengthening the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and monitoring progress towards achieving the 2010 biodiversity target; secondly, making progress in implementing the programme of work on protected areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and in particular on its objective to establish a global network of comprehensive, ecologically representative and effectively managed national and regional protected area systems.
That should be done by 2010 for terrestrial areas and by 2012 for marine areas.
That will also require progress regarding marine areas that lie beyond national jurisdiction.
The Convention on Biological Diversity should establish scientific criteria for the identification of marine areas and species in the high seas requiring most urgent protection.
The third conclusion concerns making progress with the negotiations of an international regime on access and benefit-sharing.
As regards the ongoing third meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, our priorities are to finalise the adoption of documentation requirements for cross-border movements of GMOs, to develop further guidance on risk assessment and to discuss additional measures on compliance.
Capacity-building issues will also be centre-stage at the third meeting of the parties.
The Commission is strongly committed to the inclusion of Members of the European Parliament as observers in Community delegations negotiating multilateral agreements and has already done so on a number of occasions.
The Commission therefore welcomes the participation of Members of the European Parliament at COP-8 and believes that they can make an important contribution.
Within the limits imposed by the available staff resources at the COP, the Commission will keep Members of Parliament regularly informed of developments in the negotiations, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is now 13 years since the UN Convention on Biological Diversity was signed, and yet biological diversity on earth is becoming poorer and poorer.
When the eighth conference of the parties to the agreement begins next week, the world situation will be one where some 16Â 000 animal species and 60Â 000 plant species are under threat of extinction.
We are exploiting our ecosystems in an unsustainable way.
Globally, the major factor causing the impoverishment of diversity is land use which changes the natural environment to make it more profitable.
Every year, some 2% of the earthâs original natural environments become agricultural and forestry land or part of the built environment.
Because the problems of habitats, their species and the impoverishment of hereditary diversity are generally only seen after some time has passed, the nature of the biodiversity ceiling as part of global change has not received sufficient attention.
As a result of the deterioration in ecosystems, their function and the free services they provide for humans, such as the production of clean water and the maintenance of the hydrological cycle, carbon binding, the pollination of edible plants and the recycling of nutrients, could be very adversely affected.
Ecologists and economists have calculated that the value of the free services provided by nature amounts to the incredible sum of approximately EUR 23Â billion a year, which is more than the combined national product of the entire world.
The services provided by an ecosystem can to some extent be returned, for example, by afforestation of logging areas prone to erosion, but forest plantations will not compensate for the diversity of natural forests.
We therefore share the same clear desire: we want to halt the impoverishment of nature.
Where, however, will the wisdom be found to embark on effective ways of doing so?
The resolution contains many worthy recommendations, but when you look at nature itself, you cannot help but marvel at its wisdom.
Nature itself is infinitely productive, creative and even extravagant, but at the same time efficient and practical.
Nature provides a model for what a natural economic system of production is actually like, and what to aim for with an ecological product design.
Nature is not concerned about integrated product policy from start to finish: for nature, everything is always the start of something new.
We need the same sort of wisdom â but also an unbiased approach â to be able to overcome the difficulties that lie ahead.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is broad consensus on the need to strengthen international environmental management.
Climate change is the biggest of the global environmental problems, but unfortunately not the only one.
The decline in the number of species in the world is already threatening the viability of our society.
For this reason, we need real results from the forthcoming UN Conference of Parties regarding biological diversity in the EU.
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the most widely adopted existing international agreement on the conservation of biological diversity.
It has 188 signatories, including all 25 Member States of the European Union.
In order to ensure that the Convention has the widest possible impact, it is essential that it should be implemented effectively in the various policy areas, and that it is compatible with other international agreements on the environment and that they can all be coordinated together.
The biggest problem for effective implementation, however, is the insufficient number of indicators describing biological diversity.
We do not know what is happening in our environment or how we might best respond to this challenge.
The Commission needs to work hard to produce these indicators.
The European Union must be the one to point the way in strengthening the global dimension of sustainable development.
We should be prepared to agree on targets which are binding on all of us, in order that we might be able to stop the impoverishment of nature and safeguard its riches; not just for us, but for our children as well.
Â Â  . â Why do we need to preserve biological diversity?
The answer is simple â because it is directly linked to us â people.
Man is a part of biological diversity; man affects living organisms which surround him and is affected by them himself.
However, every day, namely man destroys an unknown number of life form species, as his actions induce climate change, increase pollution of the environment and destroy the natural habitats of plants and animals.
Human activities, for which there is no analogy in nature, are usually disastrous from the point of view of biological diversity.
An assessment of available data held by various European states on the condition of bird and mammal populations and changes in their abundance shows that the long-term conservation of many of these species cannot be guaranteed without an urgent and determined change in biological protection strategy and policy.
The so-called simplified environmental protection strategy, which has previously been used, only tries to take into account the needs of those species most at risk of extinction.
Such strategy is no longer suitable.
I take a very positive view of the European Union's ambitious goal of halting the decline in biological diversity by 2010.
To realise this goal it is necessary to create a biological indicator system, which would help to assess the progress in the implementation of obligations undertaken under the Convention on Biological Diversity.
We must draw up national action plans and coordinate the collection, analysis and publication of data on an international scale.
Clearly this also requires financial investment.
Today is World Consumer Rights Day.
It is symbolic that today of all days we are discussing the conservation of biological diversity.
The ever growing promotion of consumerism, which as it has been affirmed, increases economic growth and the welfare of every person, increasingly harms the environment on a daily basis.
Â Â  . Mr President, this resolution provides a vital opportunity for Parliament to send a strong resolution to the parties meeting in Brazil about the value that Europeâs citizens place on the worldâs natural resources and biodiversity.
I want to focus on just two such resources.
The worldâs last ancient forests are being lost at a rate of more than 13Â million hectares a year with devastating impact.
A global network of protected forest areas must be established and funded, and countries must set measurable time-ban targets to ensure that the use, consumption and trade of biodiversity resources come only from sustainable sources.
We must also urgently speak out on the issue of crops engineered using terminator technologies.
These crops produce sterile seeds so farmers will be unable to save seeds from one yearâs crops to sow the next, forcing them into buying seeds each year from biotech corporations whose control over seeds is already enormous: just ten corporations control more than 50% of global seed sales.
The consequences for food security, especially in developing countries and for the livelihoods of poor farmers, would be huge.
Any proposals to undermine the moratorium on field testing and marketing of these suicide seeds must be firmly rejected, and that is what our group has tabled an amendment on tomorrow to strengthen that point.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the last two centuries, population growth, the exploitation of natural resources, and environmental pollution have resulted in a rapidly increasing loss of growth.
As has been said many times today, man is dependent on biodiversity.
Forests, for example, not only supply us with the raw material wood and increase the oxygen content of air, but also clean our water and prevent erosion and flooding: a function of which awareness is growing in all corners of the world as the impact of climate change is increasingly felt.
As the Commissioner said, a decision was taken at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss.
At that time, the European Parliament delegation strongly criticised this insufficiently ambitious demand.
Within the EU, we went beyond that demand and said that, by 2010, the trend towards biodiversity loss was to be reversed.
I believe that the Commission and the Member States should continue to play a leading role and ensure that, at the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreement is reached on measurable objectives and a specific time frame for the achievement of such objectives.
The EU and the Member States should also pay particular attention to marine biodiversity, and the EU must look at its own performance on this.
I should like to make just a fleeting mention of the European fisheries policy, a subject that is currently being discussed with our ACP colleagues on account of the alarming fall in stocks of various fish species.
Â Â  â To wind up the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The Independence and Democracy Group has informed me that as of yesterday, 15 March 2006, it is made up of the following 22 Members.
Gerard Batten, Bastiaan Belder, Johannes Blokland, Godfrey Bloom, Jens-Peter Bonde, Graham Booth, Derek Roland Clark, Paul Marie CoÃ»teaux, Nigel Farage, HÃ©lÃšne Goudin, Georgios Karatzaferis, Roger Knapman, Patrick Louis, Nils Lundgren, Michael Henry Nattrass, Kathy Sinnott, Jeffrey Titford, Philippe de Villiers, John Whittaker, Thomas Wise, Lars Wohlin and VladimÃ­r ÅœeleznÃœ.
For this reason, as of the aforesaid date, the following Members are non-attached.
Umberto Bossi, Matteo Salvini, Mario Borghezio, Francesco Enrico Speroni, Dariusz Maciej Grabowski, Urszula Krupa, Bogdan PÄk, MirosÅaw Mariusz Piotrowski, BogusÅaw Rogalski, Witold Tomczak and Andrzej Tomasz ZapaÅowski.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply ask that it be recorded in the Minutes that MrÂ Bossi, MrÂ Borghezio, MrÂ Speroni and MrÂ Salvini object to the entirely irregular procedure that has been followed with regard to the subject of the communication presented just now by the President.
We have not been informed of any meeting.
This decision by the Independence and Democracy Group is entirely unjustified and irregular, and therefore the communication presented this morning by the President must also be regarded as being based on an irregular and unjustified decision.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
Â Â  (Mr President, I am interrupting to request a change to the Minutes.
I had omitted to sign the list of people present yesterday.
I was there, of course, as is clear from the minutes of the voting session, and, indeed, I contributed to the debate on the Cottigny report.
Thank you for noting that, Mr President.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to speak in relation to Rule 172, with regard to the Minutes of the previous sitting.
On Tuesday I presented a question to the Council on an issue which is extremely urgent for my region, the Canary Islands, relating to the humanitarian disasters involving immigrants, who are arriving in my region in their hundreds.
I did not receive a reply â the Council replied to very few questions â but I expected at least to receive a written reply.
Today, Thursday, I have received the verbatim report: the reply does not appear there either and I have no way of knowing what that reply is, because Parliamentâs services are not giving it to me.
I wished to protest at the delay in the operation of the services, because I believe that for urgent subjects, which is the purpose of these questions, the time between a question not being answered and the reply being received is too long, given that the written reply already exists.
I wished to register my protest and I hope to receive a written reply as soon as possible.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments will be noted.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the communication on my exclusion and that of other members of the Independence and Democracy Group, you replied that you were taking note of this matter and that it would be recorded in the Minutes.
I consider that to be an unsatisfactory reply, however.
Through the head of our delegation, MrÂ Borghezio, we pointed out some irregularities in the procedure of excluding Members from the group, and so I call on the presidency to verify whether they are in order.
If the presidency determines that everything is in order, then I shall consider myself no longer attached.
However, I should like the presidency to verify whether the correct procedures have been followed.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
We will consider this matter in a separate procedure.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0030/2006) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Programme of Community Action in the field of Health and Consumer Protection 2007-2013 â Health aspects [COM(2005)0115 â C6-0097/2005 â 2005/0042A(COD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, for his excellent work in preparing this report.
However, I should also like to thank the members of the two committees for their excellent work in studying and examining this programme.
I am truly delighted at the large number of both speakers and proposals submitted on this programme.
Similarly, I want to say as of now that I could not in fact, under different circumstances, disagree with the substance of the proposals made.
We may, as regards the split into two programmes, have different approaches, but the recommendations add to the actions under the programme, extend its scope and make it more effective, so that it covers more sectors.
In addition â and this is equally important â not only is provision made for the resources sought by the Commission in order to support the programme, but also its budget has been further increased.
Unfortunately, however, under present circumstances â and I refer here in particular to economic circumstances â we must be careful and â to use a word which I do not particularly like â 'realistic'.
The most serious issue which is pending at the moment is the closure of discussions on the financial perspective and Parliament has an important role to play here.
At this point, I would highlight the support and positive positions of Parliament and the Commission on the financial strengthening of the programme.
It is a fact that, if the compromise achieved in the European Council in December is maintained, this will mean considerable cutbacks to the programme.
PresidentÂ Barroso has already sent the relevant letter to President Borrell, in which he points out that, if the arrangement stays as it was in December, the health and consumer protection sector not only will not have sufficient resources, but also this sector will have fewer financial resources in 2007 than it had in 2006.
In other words, there will be less money for the Europe of the 25 and 27 Member States than there was for the Europe of the 15.
I believe, as President Barroso also points out in his letter, that this approach cannot be justified, especially at a time when we want to bring Europe close to its citizens.
That is why President Borrell is asked for Parliament to make one more effort to cooperate in this sector.
The Commission proposal for the programme is also reflected in the relevant budget.
If, however, the considerable reduction to which I referred earlier ultimately comes about, this will mean that numerous actions and numerous sectors of the proposal will have to be abandoned, because there is no point in allocating small amounts to numerous sectors in such a way that, in essence, no sector is supported effectively.
That is why the whole programme needs to be reassessed, priorities need to be set and the actions, initiatives and sectors covered need to be reduced considerably, so that we can cover effectively even just the few sectors selected.
Of course, I would like to hope that, in the debates which follow, this situation will be remedied and it will be understood that this was perhaps a mistake and that, given the huge political significance both of the issue of health and of the issue of consumer protection, even just some small amounts will at least be added to the programme.
As far as the question of splitting the programme is concerned, I understand the positions expressed.
I know that both committees would prefer there to be separate programmes, I understand the arguments and I understand the concerns.
We, however, continue in essence to consider that there are benefits if a joint programme is maintained.
Better use can be made of resources.
However, in all events, until the matter of the financial perspective has been cleared up, the Commission is not in a position to take a final decision on the extent to which it does or does not accept the split.
That is why, at the present stage, the Commission will reject the amendments which promote the split into two programmes and, once we have the final outcome of the debate on the financial perspective, then we shall re-examine the matter.
Parliament has made its position clear and we have noted that.
I will not go into other details due to lack of time.
I had the pleasure of discussing the programme with the competent committee.
I merely wish to emphasise, because there is no time and there are a great many amendments, that the Commission's position on each of the amendments will be circulated in writing and I would be obliged if it could be included in the Minutes of this debate(1).
However, I would insist on the fact that the amendments which are being rejected are not being rejected due to disagreement in substance with their tenet.
I would remind you, of course, that many of them are being accepted, but those which are being rejected are mainly not being accepted because of the need for there to be, on the one hand, some priorities within the framework of the financial situation and, on the other hand, because of issues of subsidiarity, in other words so that we do not intervene in the competences of the Member States and, of course, so that we do not overlap and do not repeat actions which are covered by other Community policies and actions.
To close, I should like to thank you once again and I shall follow the debate by the Members with a great deal of interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, the problem of bird 'flu was â I am sure you will agree â an opportunity for the Union and the Member States to act in a coordinated and effective manner, by strengthening citizens' confidence and feeling of security.
However, it also provided further proof of the value which Community action has in the field of public health.
That is why I consider the timing of this debate to be the right time to support the present report, including the increased financing which is the necessary basis for achieving the objectives, objectives which, like the basic lines of action, safeguard the continuation and, at the same time, the development of the previous programme. This is achieved by a combination of objectives and actions, such as the protection of citizens from health threats from physical, chemical or biological sources, infectious diseases and so forth.
We need a common defence system and a coordinated response at European level for possible pandemics, as the topical issue of bird 'flu proves.
The promotion of policies which result in a healthier lifestyle â health determinants.
We owe it to our children, to future generations, to work for the adoption of lifestyle standards, taking serious account of health determinants: proper eating habits, stopping smoking, social and economic conditions that do not result in excessive stress.
Disease prevention cannot but be based primarily on addressing health determinants which demonstrably affect physical and mental health.
Helping to reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality for major diseases and injuries is a further line of action which also requires coordinated and joint action.
