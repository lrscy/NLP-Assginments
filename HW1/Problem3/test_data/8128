They focus on effective enforcement by Member States, self-regulatory efforts by industry, technical solutions such as filtering and security, and consumer awareness.
On enforcement in particular, Member States must not only put in place adequate complaint mechanisms, remedies and penalties, but also prosecute 'spammers' effectively and monitor 'spam'.
Cooperation between industry and public authorities is important in this regard.
The Commission is also taking steps to improve cross-border cooperation inside the Union by meeting relevant authorities.
Since a large volume of 'spam' originates outside the European Union, international cooperation will also be essential.
Several actions are under way in this regard.
Let me mention some of them.
Firstly the declaration and action plan agreed at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society call for appropriate action on 'spam' to be taken at national and international level.
Secondly the Commission will be hosting an OECD seminar on 'spam' on 2 and 3 February 2004 in Brussels.
Thirdly, bilateral contacts are ongoing with third countries, including the competent authorities in the United States, since a large volume of 'spam' seems to come from US-based companies.
These actions are the subject of a communication on 'spam' which the Commission will adopt in the next few days.
Finally, the Safer Internet Action Plan and, to a greater extent, its likely successor, Safe Internet Plus, will also fund activities relating to 'spam', including 'spam' sent to children.
To conclude, however, let me stress one element: no one party acting in isolation will be able to solve the problem; success will depend on the firm commitment of all interested parties.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and, in my opinion, very good and positive reply.
I wish, however, to ask a further question.
Recently, those responsible for creating and spreading a virus have used other peopleâs computers to send out spam.
This is known as the Trojan Horse principle.
Although, let us say, 60% of computers might be protected, there are always some which have inadequate protection, and the hackers and crackers can use them as bases and platforms for spreading spam.
Has the Commission considered how one might respond to this very international problem of a virus and innocent peopleâs computers being used to turn spam into a problem on a large scale?
Â Â  . â This âTrojan Horseâ case, which MrÂ Paasilinna mentions, is one of the nastiest ways of abusing the Internet to cause trouble for people and restrict their ability to work.
This is one issue we intend to deal with in our communication, which is to be published very soon, and also at a seminar to be held by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Brussels in February.
I hope that MrÂ Paasilinna will be able to attend.
At the same time, obviously, as we are now establishing a Network Security Agency, a report on which MrÂ Paasilinna has already presented here in Parliament, this problem will also feature as part of that whole process.
We are prepared to give special attention to this Trojan Horse problem and the way it creates spam.
Innocent people unknowingly become perpetrators of an illegal activity that also contravenes this directive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I share your view that the issue addressed by MrÂ Paasilinna is an important one.
I hope that the European Network and Information Security Agency will also be able to make an assessment of spam and that we shall be able to obtain different assessments of the spam programs.
When the Commissioner sent an e-mail to a number of Finnish MEPs last week, Parliamentâs spam program labelled it as âsuspected spamâ, not however with the label âsuspected highâ, but âsuspected lowâ.
We need an assessment of the way in which the spam programs operate if the protection is to be effective.
I also hope that we shall together be able to develop tools for revealing the false identities.
There are not only Trojan horses, but also many false identities on the Internet.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall no doubt have to talk with Parliamentâs departments which do not know who the Commissioners are. If a Commissioner sends an e-mail to fifteen Members of the European Parliament, this should be assessed as genuine, factual information.
Â Â  . Firstly, I thank Mrs Doyle for the question.
The Drinking Water Directive of 1998 sets quality standards for a range of chemical parameters, including fluoride.
The parametric value for fluoride in the directive is based on available scientific evidence and is in line with the values recommended by the World Health Organization.
Secondly, there is general agreement in the scientific community that fluoride in drinking water may have positive or negative effects depending on the concentration.
The maximum permitted value of 1.5 mg/litre maintains a good balance between positive and negative effects, according to the World Health Organization.
The Commission feels supported in this assessment by the most recent documents of the World Health Organization from 2003, that is, in a new draft edition of the World Health Organization's 'Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality'.
These documents maintain the same value for fluoride.
At the same time, the issue of artificial fluoridisation of drinking water is the responsibility of Member States and, indeed, the approaches vary from country to country.
In some countries it is banned and in others it is left to the local authorities to decide.
However, in any case the maximum permitted value has to be respected.
Thirdly, in order to assemble most recent knowledge and experience, the Commission organised a seminar on drinking water in October 2003.
It brought together experts from across the European Union, including those from new Member States and from the World Health Organization, and addressed the issue of fluorides and fluoridisation.
For fluoride values it has been recognised that the current value of 1.5 mg/litre reflects current scientific knowledge.
Finally, following a request from the Commission, the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment evaluated a study concerning the quality of drinking water in selected European cities.
In its evaluation of 2003 it referred, in line with the scientific position adopted by the World Health Organization, to both the protective and detrimental effects of fluoride, but did not suggest making a change to the value for fluoride in the directive.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for answering my question here today.
I am still not satisfied, however.
In answer to a parliamentary question â PQ 1434/00 â put in May 2000, you said, Commissioner, that you would examine whether there was any significant new evidence on artificial fluoridation.
This would, you said, include 'obtaining an appropriate update by consulting the Commission's Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment'.
Apparently, you did not consult that committee, you went immediately to the WHO and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels.
The evidence is extremely shaky in this area.
Yes, the scientific jury is out, but 13 out of 23 developing countries working under the WHO guidelines have serious problems with fluoride poisoning, or fluorosis, in the dental care of their people.
In my own country fluorosis is becoming an increasing dental problem, particularly in teenagers.
I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants, who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted, fluoridated tap water.
Given that it constitutes a huge proportion of their diet, fluoridated tap water that is not inspected, in which the levels of fluoride are not regularly checked, is a serious health risk to our neonates and infants in Ireland and in parts of the UK where they still fluoridate tap water.
As well as the ethical question of mass-medicating members of the public, who do not want fluoridation in their tap water, could you comment on the ethical and infant-related issues?
Â Â  . We get the scientific advice on this from the World Health Organization.
We also ask the committee you mentioned.
It gave us its opinion on fluoride as recently as 2003. It said that the concentrations of fluoride normally present in fluoridated drinking water do not present a health risk according to a large number of animal studies and human epidemiology.
The World Health Organization drinking water guideline is the same as in the EU Directive â 1.5 mg per litre.
Dental fluorosis occurs at concentrations above 1.5 mg and 2 mg per litre.
Skeleton fluorosis occurs at higher concentrations â between 3 mg and 6 mg.
In Dublin, for example, the water is fluoridated but the parametric value of 1.5 mg per litre was not exceeded and, according to this report, the highest concentration recorded was 0.9 mg.
We ask every Member State to comply with the existing legislation, which was drawn up in the light of the scientific advice.
There has been no reason to re-evaluate that advice.
We have brought together a group from both new and old Member States â all the experts we could call on â and they concluded that they saw no reason to change the directive in this regard.
It is also a matter for Member States.
So, in your case Mrs Doyle, it is a matter of trying to change Ireland's policy on this if you think it is wrong and if you think your country is not following the values laid down in the directive.
We have no reason, from the advice we have sought, to change the parameters that are established in the directive on fluoride in drinking water.
Â Â  I very much agree with what my colleague Mrs Doyle said, and I do not actually feel that the Commissioner answered her questions adequately.
In relation to mass-medication, it is completely unacceptable in terms of freedom of choice that 9 million UK citizens and 2.7 million Irish citizens are being forcibly mass-medicated.
In Ireland, 91% of submissions were actually against the fluoridation of water.
Clearly there is a lack of public consent here.
The EU is not adhering to the precautionary principle, as it is supposed to.
I would like to see the Commission push for fluoridation of drinking water throughout the EU to be discontinued until there is a proper, adequate assessment of the situation.
For example, the fact there is a big difference in water consumption between hot countries and cold countries is not taken into account when discussing how much water people drink.
In hotter countries a lot of people drink a lot more water and therefore they are consuming a lot more, and in some of the new Member States there is fluoride in hot water as well.
Mrs Doyle's point on infants is a really serious question because infant formula is being mixed with water that has been fluoridated, and I believe that there are serious consequences for children here.
My opinion is that we should not be using formula anyway.
Â Â  . The scientific advice both from the World Health Organization and from our own committee takes that into account.
Fluoride can occur naturally.
The water in the well in our own backyard, for example, had a very high concentration of fluoride.
It can occur naturally to such an extent that you are recommended not to use it for your children because it could affect their teeth.
However, it is up to each Member State to set the rules, as long as they follow the recommendations and the limit values set in the directive.
We have asked for scientific advice, which we follow very closely.
We ensure that we are kept up to date with the latest scientific advice.
As I said, as a result of the findings and the work done in the various working groups, and after calling together all the experts, we have no reason to change â at least for the time being â the recommendations on the limit values in the directive.
If we receive new scientific evidence or see any reason to change, we will do so.
Otherwise, however, you will have to try to influence Ireland on its policy on this issue because such policy is decided in each and every Member State.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We shall proceed to the second part of questions to the three Commissioners here today.
Â Â  . The honourable Member's question asks the Commission to comment on progress achieved on the implementation of the Tampere objectives concerning the development of a common immigration and asylum policy.
The question is very timely since we are coming to the end of the first phase of the development of these policies, as detailed in the Tampere agenda.
Moreover, the five-year deadline set out in the Amsterdam Treaty for the realisation of certain objectives, notably with respect to asylum policy, will be reached on 1 May 2004.
The annual parliamentary debate on the development of an area of freedom, security and justice, which will take place during the February part-session, will be the first opportunity to discuss with Parliament the assessment of our policies in these fields.
In June 2004, the Commission intends to present to the European Parliament and to the Council a communication which will evaluate the progress made in implementing the Tampere objectives.
This communication will include an evaluation of all aspects concerning immigration, asylum, the integration of immigrants in our societies and the development of relations with third countries.
I hope that this communication will also be able to include some guidelines for what could, in the near future, become a 'Tampere II' agenda.
Â Â  Thank you Commissioner for that comprehensive answer.
I do not want to pre-empt the Commission's June 2004 communication, but would like to ask the Commissioner's personal view on whether he is hopeful that, within that communication, some progress on the links between Member States and the European Union and sending countries will be established.
He may know that the issue of managed migration is now coming to the fore of the agenda in the European Union, partly due to his work and that of many others.
I would like to ask his personal opinion on whether he thinks, when the communication is finally published, that he or anyone else will have some positive news to give us on the issue of managed migration and the specific partnerships between our countries and others.
He may know of examples concerning the United Kingdom and the Philippines, which has sent health workers, and issues of that nature.
Does he have anything to say about that?
Â Â  . I thank you for that supplementary question because it allows me to say that I hope that Parliament and the Council will, in the interim, have concluded an agreement on the adoption of a regulation concerning the multiannual programme to finance partnerships with third countries in the shared management of migratory fluxes.
Over the next 5 years EUR 250 million will be allocated for this programme, and we intend to give priority in the assessment of this financial instrument to those countries engaged in negotiating readmission agreements with the European Union.
The second strand will be a report â which the Commission will present to the Council in April â concerning links between legal and illegal migration, which will above all set out the conclusions of the study currently being undertaken by the Commission into the possibility of establishing some kind of system for coordinating legal migration in the Member States.
Such a system could be helpful to third countries in their partnerships aiming to combat trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.
The third strand will be the report that the Commission will present to the Council by June 2005, in which it will consider new ways of enhancing international protection and, above all, the possibility of establishing Europe-wide resettlement schemes and providing improved protection in the region for refugees.
I hope I will have some progress to report to you in all those areas when I come back in June for the global assessment of the Tampere agenda.
Â Â  As ever, I have listened with admiration to the presentation and comments by the Commissioner.
He spoke about managing migration and legal migration.
Could he take the opportunity, in the light of the hysteria in some areas of the British press about what will happen in terms of migration when enlargement takes place, to outline some of the initiatives I know he has put in place that will ensure that migration from the new Eastern European members of the European Union will be sensible, and controlled in such a way that it will be mutually beneficial to the citizens of those countries and to the existing Member States of the European Union?
Â Â  . I will answer the honourable Member by giving my own example.
I come from Portugal, which before entering the Union was supposed to be preparing to invade it.
There were many fears surrounding the Portuguese and the Spanish too, Mr President, if I recall correctly â the Portuguese and Spaniards were about to invade Europe.
In real terms, our assessment is that joining the Union presents such a huge opportunity for economic development in those countries that join the Union that migratory fluxes are limited.
There are special rules written into the accession treaties concerning the free movement of workers during transitional periods.
We therefore have the necessary legal framework to guarantee that everything will be handled carefully, swiftly and in a very reasonable way.
I hope that message gets through to the British public.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, on 23Â June 2003 two agreements were signed between the European Union and the United States, regarding extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters respectively.
These agreements were negotiated by the Council Presidency, assisted at all times by the Commission, pursuant to Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty.
The extradition agreement does not contain any specific provision that gives the US the right to request the extradition by a Member State of a person having committed a crime in that Member State that is statute-barred by its legislation.
Member States may, however, invoke grounds for refusal based on matters not covered by the agreement that may be applicable pursuant to bilateral treaties in force between a Member State and the US.
This is provided for in ArticleÂ 17 of the extradition agreement between the EU and the US.
The same criterion applies to your second question; that is, when extradition by a Member State is requested of a person for a crime of which he has already been convicted by that Member State.
Neither of the two agreements between the EU and the US has yet come into force, with some Member States having stated that they are obliged to abide by national constitutional procedure for such agreements to come into force and that written bilateral instruments are required between each Member State and the US for agreements to apply between the EU and the US.
These complementary bilateral instruments are currently at the negotiation stage.
Once all of the bilateral instruments have been agreed they will have to be ratified by the US Congress.
Â Â  . I thank Mrs McKenna for her question.
The Commission is very concerned about the welfare of animals and gives it very high priority.
Community rules exist in respect of animals, including dogs, for their protection during transport.
Under the protocol on the protection and welfare of animals annexed to the EC Treaty, the Community and Member States must pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in formulating and implementing the Communityâs agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating, in particular, to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage.
As a consequence of this, the conditions under which dogs such as greyhounds are kept and raced or used for hunting within the Member States are not regulated by Community law.
These are matters coming solely within the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned.
As it is the duty of the individual Member States to find a solution to this problem, the Commission can only call upon responsible authorities to eliminate the ill-treatment to which the honourable Member refers.
In this context it is significant that last year the largest Spanish animal welfare organisation recognised that progress towards improving the welfare of these animals is being achieved, including through the updating of legislation by the autonomous regions.
In addition, police action has curtailed the cruel methods of killing these dogs at the end of the hunting season.
While general cruelty to dogs or the use of these animals for racing or hunting comes within the sole competence of the Member States, commercial transport of these animals over distances of more than 50 kilometres falls within the scope of Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC.
Complaints have been formally brought to the attention of the Irish, Spanish and UK authorities.
The Irish authorities provided a comprehensive reply on 5 March 2002 outlining the various actions taken to protect greyhounds transported to other Member States and also providing other information on the aspects of greyhound rearing and racing which are outside the scope of Community legislation.
No basis for infringement proceedings was apparent from the reply from Ireland.
As far as matters falling within Community competence are concerned, namely the commercial transport of animals, the Spanish authorities indicated that they were not able to trace particular shipments of greyhounds transported from Ireland.
The Commission continues to make further enquiries.
The Commission confirms that no Community aid is now available for investment in greyhound rearing or racing.
While previous operational programmes allowed for aid for investment in greyhound housing and rearing facilities, no Community aid has been paid since 1993.
Â Â  As regards non-regulation by Community law, my understanding is that before 2002 a certain amount of EU funding was devoted to greyhound breeding in Ireland once funding for sheep breeding had stopped because there was an over-capacity of sheep.
If that is the case, the Commission should be concerned about animals whose breeding was partially funded by the EU.
In Spain the situation has not changed.
I was talking to someone a few days ago who had been to one of these illegal race tracks in Spain, where they found nine greyhounds from Ireland racing on a course in appalling conditions.
As regards animals not being traced, I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on greyhound breeding and the export of greyhounds.
As regards correct identification, a microchip would be very useful in tracing the animal's place of origin.
The Commission could take an initiative here in passing some sort of law on this, and also making greyhound owners responsible for the animal, not just for the two-and-a-half years in Ireland where the dogs are economically of benefit to the owners, but for the whole of their lives.
It is unacceptable that these animals are raced to death in places such as Spain and kept in appalling conditions.
We have to take responsibility for that.
That is why the Commission must take some sort of initiative to bring in legislation to ensure that this issue is wiped out.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is perfectly correct: there was funding for this and for the rearing of greyhounds before 1992.
That ceased, as I said earlier, in 1993 for a number of reasons, partly due to concerns at EU level and in the Commission relating to animal welfare considerations.
I repeat that this is a competence issue.
It is not within the competence of the Commission or the European Union to engage in inquiries in Member States relating to issues that are strictly outside the competence of the European Union.
To seek to try and make a competence for the EU for such an endeavour merely because there was funding prior to 1992 â which has now ceased â is impossible to achieve.
That means that there is very little that can be done.
Nonetheless, as I have indicated, in response to enquiries from the Commission, the authorities in both Ireland and Spain, and the major animal welfare organisation in Spain, have indicated that the situation has considerably improved, not least, in Spain, as a result of the introduction of legislation in the areas of the autonomous regions and also because of the greater vigilance of the police authorities in prosecuting infringements.
Â Â  . I thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his question on this issue.
The Commission is not aware of specific breaches of the EU Plant Health Directive by the Netherlands.
Indeed, Council Directive 2000/29/EC, which is the basis of the Community plant health regime, has been fully transposed by the Netherlands.
I assume that the honourable Memberâs question is motivated by the finding of potato ring rot in seed potatoes in Wales, as his question was not directed to any specific issue.
These potatoes are grown from seeds imported from the Netherlands, as occurred in 2002.
I can confirm that Directive 93/85/EC on the control of ring rot has also been transposed by the Dutch authorities.
When notified by the UK authorities of this outbreak, the Commission immediately examined the information supplied by UK with great attention.
The Commission gave the UK the opportunity to inform other Member States in the latest meetings of the Standing Committee on Plant Health in November and December 2003.
The origin of the outbreak is, however, still being investigated and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions.
I would like to underline that the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission has carried out a series of audit missions in the Member States in recent years in order to clearly assess the situation of potato production in the Community.
I can assure the honourable Member that the Commission will continue to follow the situation very closely.
The Commission is at this stage satisfied with the preventive actions taken by the United Kingdom, as a follow-up of the outbreak, as well as with the current investigations launched by both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in order to identify the possible origins and pathways of the disease.
Turning to the question on compensation, under existing Community legislation there is a possibility for a financial contribution referred to as 'solidarity' to be granted to Member States.
It is intended to cover expenditure for the necessary measures to combat organisms harmful to plants introduced from other areas in the Community.
The Commission has informed the Welsh representation in Brussels of the existence of this contribution and of the practical procedures to follow should it wish to make an application for such compensation.
Upon receipt of any file, the Commission will verify if Community requirements to grant such a contribution have been met.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that very clear answer.
I would like to extend the question â and my apologies for not making it clear to him earlier â that this is not just about potato ring rot but also about a disease called ramorum dieback or sudden oak death, which was first seen in the EU in the Netherlands in 1997, but has now reached the UK.
It is found in rhododendrons, camellias and native tree species and, last month, it was found in wild woodland in the UK.
It is clearly a major problem for our country.
The biggest exporters of such products are the Dutch plant auctions.
It has also been alleged that some operators there have been spraying such plants with fungicide in order to mask traces of that particular disease, meaning that the disease shows itself at a later stage.
I would be grateful if the Commission could look into these allegations, in particular to see whether this breaches the plant health directive, because, clearly, the disease has now crossed the border.
We wish it to be eradicated where it is and certainly wish too that no other country should suffer as some of our plants and woods are already suffering.
Â Â  . I would like to assure the honourable Member that I will have my services investigate, and prepare a proper response to, his supplementary question relating to ramorum dieback.
I will then write to him in due course.
Â Â  . Let me first say that surveillance of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and cancer are important health issues for the Community as a whole, and remain important priorities for me.
However, the responsibility for such surveillance â for cancer screening tests â rests with the Member States.
The Communityâs role is to provide the appropriate framework for coordination of these activities, to facilitate the sharing and spread of good practice and to promote the development of common methodologies and procedures.
To this end, the Commission provides funding for the setting-up of networks that deliver standardised methods of collection and processing of information on diseases such as AIDS, TB and cancer at Community level.
Once networks have been developed in this way, their participating structures should be in a position to continue routine network activities.
The Community should concentrate on the development of networking and the Commission will continue to do so, within the present budgetary possibilities, until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established.
The Member States must provide the resources to ensure that surveillance activities are properly pursued in their territory.
The Commission will continue to promote cooperation and coordination between the Member States through the Communicable Diseases Network.
The funding decisions referred to by the honourable Member will not therefore lead to a gap in surveillance.
This is not to say that the Community is not contributing to actions on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
We are already funding 15 projects on AIDS, amounting to a total contribution of over EUR 4.2 million.
We also plan to support a project under the 2003 budget to strengthen coordination of surveillance of infections in the northern region, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.
This will include Russia, Ukraine and Belarus â all areas with worrying infection rates for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and areas where improved surveillance must be a high priority, especially in the context of enlargement.
On cancer, we plan to fund three projects from the 2003 budget, two on smoking prevention and one on cancer information, to a total of about EUR 4.4 million.
This is on top of the massive investment that has been made over the last 15 years in cancer prevention, which has already helped to make cancer epidemiology one of the most developed areas of health statistics.
There were many valuable proposals made for the public health programme in 2003, which the budget available did not allow us to fund.
I understand the problems faced by those that have been involved in the surveillance networks, the development of which the Commission has financed since 1996.
The Commission has taken several steps to improve the situation.
First, we have mobilised experts to provide advice on funding priorities for disease surveillance under the work plan for 2004 and for future funding rounds under the public health programme.
Secondly, we have disseminated guidance on projects concerning disease-specific surveillance networks to enhance quality and their potential for funding.
Thirdly, we are giving urgent consideration to the possibilities this year under other funding mechanisms, including under the research programme, for data compilation and processing on HIV/AIDS and TB, as well as on cancer screening.
We should also remember that the 2003 budget is not the end of the story.
Future work plans under the public health programme, starting with that of 2004, will have the scope and potential to finance projects on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
The importance of ensuring continuity of support for key networks in the field of communicable diseases until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established will be particularly stressed.
My services are working to ensure that this will be reflected in future funding rounds.
I hope that this provision, together with the many projects I have described and the coordination of surveillance activities we continue to provide will respond to the question put by the honourable Member.
Â Â  Like the Commissioner I think surveillance of these diseases is fundamentally important and that is why I am concerned that there should not be a gap.
As rapporteur for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I know we are not going to have this up and running before 2005 at the most optimistic estimate, so it is the gap between now and then that I am concerned about.
Of course, the centre will not deal with cancer as it is not a communicable disease.
It will deal with the other two mentioned.
I know the Commissioner has been looking for solutions to cancer, because he has discussed that with our committee in the past.
Nevertheless, I ask him to look very carefully at the organisations who have been doing the surveillance â particularly on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS â and see how they can be supported over the coming two years.
We are faced with a double problem in this area: one, as the Commissioner mentioned, is the exponential rise in cases in Eastern Europe, and the second is the fearsome rise we are now seeing, here and across the Atlantic, in a number of newly-diagnosed cases which are multi-drug resistant.
Potentially, there is thus a dual crisis attacking us from both sides.
Â Â  . As I indicated earlier to Mr Bowis, I am aware of these concerns and can only stress that responsibility for this entire issue rests with Member States.
We keep a close watch on this, using monitoring and surveillance mechanisms.
It will be the sort of issue to which I will be turning my mind during the upcoming discussions on this year's budget over the coming weeks, or perhaps months.
Â Â  . The Commission fully shares the concern of the honourable Member as regards the threat to the Community citrus crop caused by the harmful organisms intercepted by Spain.
Following the notification by Spain of the preventive measures it has taken against citrus fruits originating in Argentina and Brazil, and in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in the Community plant health regime, the Commission initiated discussions on the issue in the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 11 and 12 December 2003.
In the meantime, the Commission has also urgently requested from Argentina and Brazil additional technical information in respect of the situation faced by Spain, and about which the Commission fully shares its concern.
The Commission and the Member States agreed to review the position at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on 22 January 2004.
The Commission will then consider any action ensuring that organisms harmful to citrus fruits â like citrus canker, from which the Community is free â are not introduced into and spread within the Community.
The Commission expects to achieve a satisfactory solution before the next import campaign.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply.
The question I asked was very clear; the Commissionâs reply as well.
The facts are absolutely clear and I am in agreement with the Commission in relation to them.
The diagnosis is not under discussion; what we are discussing now is the therapy required.
I am pleased that measures should be taken on 22Â January, and I would like to know what type of measures the Commission has planned, because at the moment it is not a question of discussing, but rather it is a question â as in Leninâs famous tract â of what to do.
What to do and to do it as soon as possible, because the introduction of a disease of this sort could have harmful consequences which are very difficult to put right if they are not tackled in time.
Commissioner, I would like to know what the Commission is going to propose at the meeting which is going to take place on 22 and 23Â January: the specific measures it is going to propose.
I would like to know the specific analysis of the specific reality.
Â Â  . As you know, a number of measures are available under European law to deal with such situations.
I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the discussions that will take place on 22 January, but there are a number of measures, including temporary emergency measures, applicable to the next import campaign.
I am sure you are aware of the kinds of measures that are available.
They are quite powerful, it is within the competence of Community law to impose them, and these are the kinds of issues that will be considered in the event that the discussion discloses a need to put these measures in place.
That is as far as I can go at this stage; I would rather not pre-empt those discussions.
Â Â  . We are aware of the threat to the environment and to consumer health that obsolete pesticides constitute in Ukraine and aware, too, of the magnitude of the challenge that their elimination poses to that country.
Ukraine has taken a positive step concerning the elimination of some of the obsolete pesticides, in particular those that are persistent organic pollutants, by signing the Stockholm Convention regarding the elimination and reduction of those pollutants.
The ratification of the Convention is still pending.
The Commission urges Ukraine to ratify the Convention and to cooperate with the international community to work on this difficult problem.
Responsibility for dealing with obsolete pesticides is primarily for the country itself.
While the Commission is prepared to assist Ukraine to the extent possible â and I should just note that our assistance to Ukraine amounts to EURÂ 126 million a year â current EU assistance programmes do not provide funding for the elimination of obsolete pesticides in Ukraine.
In fact, environmental issues have not been selected by the Government of Ukraine as a key cooperation area with the European Union.
However, Tacis small project programmes could accommodate project proposals linked to the elimination of obsolete pesticides.
Taking into account the amount of pesticides to be eliminated, an EU contribution could only partially alleviate the vast problem.
As a signatory to the Stockholm Convention, Ukraine is eligible for funding from the interim Global Environmental Facility, which is the financing mechanism of the Convention.
Â Â  We have been and continue to be very active in dealing with the consequences of Chernobyl and other environmental disasters, but I should like to ask the Commissioner what more we can do in order to prevent another environmental disaster occurring when something goes wrong with pesticides.
Could he approach the Ukraine authorities on these issues, since we shall be raising them in Parliament at the next meeting of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee that is to take place next month?
What more can he do in terms of contacting the Ukraine Government and looking again at how the Tacis Programme can contribute to that?
After the Chernobyl experience we have to prompt Ukraine to do something.
The Commissioner knows as well as I do how that country functions.
This will not be its top priority.
We must tell Ukraine that dealing with these kinds of methods is a top priority for the EU.
Â Â  .
I totally agree with the honourable Member that obsolete pesticides are a real and serious problem, not just in Ukraine; they are a common problem in all too many post-Soviet regions, as well as in some acceding and candidate countries.
The estimate is that in Ukraine there are perhaps up to 20 000 tonnes of these pesticides in 5000 locations and, as the honourable Member knows, they can affect human health because of the contamination of groundwaters, soil, food and even air.
The honourable Member mentioned Chernobyl: I was there recently.
We have dedicated a lot of time and a great deal of money to that extraordinarily difficult and dangerous environmental issue.
There we are working with the government of Ukraine, which wishes to take that as a priority.
It has not been easy even in those circumstances.
What is more difficult for us, is to insist on our priorities through a programme such as Tacis, in which the partner country is supposed to take ownership of the programme we are helping to support.
I can assure the honourable Member that we will continue to raise this issue and other environmental issues in the relevant subcommittee of the partnership and cooperation agreement.
We will raise this issue during those meetings and if the government in Ukraine says it would like us to focus some of our spending on this issue, we would be delighted to look at that.
But the figures involved are very substantial.
It is reckoned that it would cost at least EUR 100 million for the elimination of the problem I described earlier, and that is why, in our judgment, it is probably more helpful to turn to the global environmental facility in order to secure an objective which the honourable Member is quite right to highlight.
Â Â  â I should like to thank the Commissioner for his clarification.
I too know that it is a problem at the level of the Ukrainian Government, but there are also political forces in the Ukraine that are very clearly facing up to this problem at the moment; they are on the side of the European Parliament, which has stated that this problem must be solved.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is prepared to give encouragement to those forces in the Ukraine that are currently not in government but may be in future, and help them to look for a solution to this extremely difficult and extremely dangerous problem in the Ukraine.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is entirely right to say that the issue we are discussing is of considerable concern to many groups in Ukraine, and many of the environmental NGOs which have begun to be active.
The issue in which he has taken a particular interest â water contamination â has been of considerable concern to many people.
I can only repeat that we will raise this issue with the Ukrainian authorities.
We will be willing, if they wish, to consider ways in which we could assist through the Tacis programme.
However, the need for funds for the overall elimination of pesticides in Ukraine is beyond the present budgetary resources of the European Union, though we can encourage Ukraine to turn to other possible financing sources in order to deal with what is a horrendously difficult problem.
Â Â  . The debate about development issues and security does not result in a single choice about doing either one thing or the other.
One of the key challenges faced by the European Union is to make better use of all the resources at our disposal in the external relations field.
This was recognised as one of the major tasks of the European Convention.
The goal of ensuring greater coherence implies a seamless and coordinated use of the common foreign and security policy and of all other external relations instruments, including the annual Community budget for external actions of approximately EUR 10 billion, of which EUR 6 billion is official development assistance.
We recognised long ago that development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict.
That is a fact that has been reflected in the recently adopted European Union security strategy.
The logic is simple, the logic is straightforward: one of the underlying causes of the disastrous conditions in which people in Afghanistan and southern Sudan live, for example, is conflict.
If we are serious about tackling poverty then we must tackle conflict.
There is no development without peace.
That is why, at the request of our African partners, my colleague Mr Nielson and I have recently presented an ambitious proposal for an African peace facility to the tune of about EUR 250 million to support the African Union in its efforts to contribute to peace keeping.
Â Â  You might expect a bit of an old hand in development like me â as you are yourself â to be somewhat sceptical about the possibilities that we can deal with, in particular the coherence issues related to development, foreign policy and other policy areas such as agriculture and trade in the European Union.
So there are still outstanding issues.

You mentioned the peace facility, which, as an initiative from the European Union, we of course welcome very much indeed, but it is my understanding that certain Member States of the Union are suggesting that funding should go through regional and subregional organisations such as ECOWAS, and I wondered whether you would agree with me that our view should be shared with the African heads of states, who say that finance, organisation, management and decision-making should come through the African Union itself and not be devolved to various other regional organisations?
Finally, how would you assess the implications of the failure of the IGC on the proposal â of which you have been very much in favour â related to the creation of a European Foreign Minister to manage some of these issues?
Â Â  . Firstly, on the specific point of the peace facility, at a time when we are trying to support and sustain institutionalised African solidarity, it would be quite curious for us not to try to give the maximum support to the institutions of the African Union.
Therefore I agree with honourable Member on that.
Secondly, on the question of overall coherence, conceivably, things have changed since I was a British development minister many years ago.
But I must say that I find that there is more coherence in the Community's programmes than there was when I was a British minister.
That does not mean that we are perfect: we still have a long way to go, not least in relation to the overall field of external actions.
I am not just talking about CFSP and official development assistance.
I hope in the next Commission that there will be two former development ministers doing the job that Mr Nielson and I are currently doing â it would be a help.
As far as the question of a foreign minister is concerned and the temporary abeyance of the moves towards creating one following the Convention, I still believe that if this person â woman or man â is to emerge in the next few years from the IGC, it is absolutely imperative that we draw on the strengths provided by both the Council and the Commission.
It does not make very much sense to have a foreign minister who is somehow cauterised from the Commission on the ridiculous argument that her/his activities may be polluted by too much contact with the Commission.
It is perfectly possible to retain the integrity of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the relationship with the Council and Member States while, at the same time, drawing on all the competences for which the Commission is responsible and which, taken together, should give us a real possibility to shape an external actions strategy which meets the demand of the 21st century.
Foreign and security policy is no longer â if it ever was â the sort of agenda which is simply decided in the chancelleries of European capitals.
Foreign and security policy, development policy, trade policy, agriculture policy and external policy in the justice and home affairs fields, are all relevant to Europe's impact on the rest of the world and the real positive contribution we can make there.
Â Â  â Mr President, how does the Commissioner rate the talks that began yesterday between the United States and Latin America?
Will they strengthen or weaken the Community objectives referred to in Mrs Kinnockâs question, and what is the EUâs response to the US initiative?
Â Â  . I will be in a better position to answer that question after the meetings to be held in April as part of the ASEM process.
In April, following the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting at Tullamore in Ireland, we have meetings with our Asian partners in ASEM.
We also have meetings with the Indonesians and other partner countries.
I hope they will underline the importance of our partnership.
Europe is the biggest provider of development assistance and the biggest trading partner in many Asian countries, and it is certainly the biggest provider of external financial investment in most Asian countries.
I am not convinced that our political impact in those countries is as great as our economic impact and I hope we can change that.
We have done a great deal to enhance our relationship with China.
I am keen that we should do the same with India, and I hope that later this year we will be able to produce a strategy document on our relationship with that country.
We have already produced a strategy document on our relationship with south-east Asia.
We are starting to move things forward and we have been helped in that by the Parliament, which has supported our opening of five new Commission delegations around Asian countries.
Â Â  . The agreement which we have been discussing with our Syrian colleagues but which has not yet been initialled would, in my judgment, provide a solid platform for economic and political reform in Syria.
The dismantlement of tariffs and the opening of markets will be an important incentive for Syria to undertake legal and institutional reforms.
The agreement would also help Syria to integrate into the world economy and could be a stepping stone towards other initiatives, such as Syrian membership of the World Trade Organization.
The provisions on the respect for human rights, on non-proliferation and on cooperation against terrorism would, I trust, strengthen our ability to engage with Syria on these issues.
As regards the facilitation of regional integration, the agreement would complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements with our Mediterranean partners.
It constitutes the final step for the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration.
We should now continue working together to ensure trade liberalisation between the Mediterranean partner countries themselves.
The agreement would be the most important element in our policy of constructive engagement with Syria.
It is our belief that the agreement should strengthen the incentives for reform in Syria, both by creating a more open economy and society and by establishing a political dialogue on issues such as respect for democratic principles and human rights.
I believe that the United States shares our fundamental objective of integrating Syria into the international community as a country that abides by international law and cooperates, we hope, on non-proliferation and against terrorism.
The association agreement should be seen as a framework for a long-term engagement with Syria in this respect.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you very much for referring to the objectives and the procedure for achieving the cooperation agreement with Syria.
However, I wanted to ask you to clarify the last part of my question: do you share the opinions expressed by the United States on relations with Syria and its role in the region and in achieving peace.
The methodology followed by the European Union is different from that followed by the United States.
It may be that the objective is the same within the more general framework, but that the methodology differs.
Do you share the fears which the United States have specifically expressed?
Do these fears have any bearing on the policy of the European Union?
Â Â  . I noted that when the American Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, whom I much respect and admire, was undertaking his hearings in Congress before he was confirmed as Secretary of State, he made a powerful case â I may not be using exactly the same words he used, but similar ones â against knee-jerk sanctions and against always trying to secure one's political objectives by cutting people off through sanctions.
He has always been a powerful exponent of constructive and hard-headed engagement.
I am not saying that he would necessarily agree with us on Syria, but I think that is what we have been trying to do on Syria just as we have been trying to do it on Iran.
It does not mean that we are simple-witted; it does not mean that there is not a spine to what we are trying to do, but, provided people will engage with us on issues like human rights, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and trade liberalisation, then we should be prepared to hold out a hand and try to encourage them.
We have had a series of extremely useful negotiations with Syria over the past few months.
The Commission has put a great deal of energy and effort into this process, as have the Syrians.
The Syrians, on issues like tariff dismantling, have moved further and faster in the last few months than most of us thought possible.
I negotiated, or virtually negotiated, the clause on human rights when I was in Damascus a few months ago, and my excellent officials have been carrying through the negotiations on other things, including weapons of mass destruction.
Now the proposals that we discussed with the Syrians the Council are being discussed by the Council. The Council will have to decide whether we should go back to the Syrians and try to secure more from them than we have done so far.
I have no doubt that if we can come off with a strong and sensible agreement with Syria â the last piece in the jigsaw puzzle of our Euro-Mediterranean partnership â then everybody will benefit from that: everybody who wants to see a more prosperous future in the region, everybody who wants to avoid a clash of civilisations between the European, North American and Islamic worlds and everybody who wants to see terrorism and insecurity tackled in the most effective and sustainable way.
Â Â  Commissioner, the word 'hope' appeared several times in your initial response.
There seemed to be a certain amount of 'hope' rather than 'expectation'.
Could you give your estimation as to what you think we can get from Syria as regards its relationship with Lebanon as well as its occupation of that country and its support for Hizbollah?
Â Â  . It is fair to say that as part of the negotiations we have had with Syria, we have had an increasingly frank and comprehensive dialogue on regional political issues.
That includes the situations in southern Lebanon, Palestine and Israel, and the situation on the Golan Heights.
I expressed hope because â and I hope I am not entirely fatuous in my geo-strategic observations â we want to see more movement from Syria on a number of issues.
I much prefer talking and trying to secure agreement, to reading what the Syrians' positions are in the newspapers.
So when I say 'hope', it is a small and fragile word.
Perhaps it carries too much baggage, but before I leave the European Commission I would very much like to see the signing of an agreement with the Syrians.
Â Â  As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 27 to 47 will be replied to in writing.(2)
That concludes Question Time to the Commission
Â Â  The next item is a statement by the Commission on services in the internal market.
Following the Commissionerâs speech, we shall apply the catch-the-eye procedure.
Â Â  . Madam President, I assume that you want me to say something â I used to speak your language, but I have not done so for about 40 years!
I have come to the House this evening to make two declarations: the first is on the Services Directive, which the Commission decided upon this afternoon; the other is a short announcement on behalf of the Commission, and in particular of my colleague Mr Solbes, on the strategy for economic policy coordination and surveillance.
I shall start with the Services Directive.
It is with great pleasure that I can announce to you today that the Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive to create a real internal market in services.
It is an ambitious but balanced and gradual proposal, which aims to set service businesses free of legal and administrative barriers to the development of cross-border activities.
It is potentially the biggest boost to the internal market since its launch in 1993.
It will improve the competitiveness not only of the services sector but also of the whole European economy, including the manufacturing sector.
The proposal is a major element in getting the Lisbon Agenda back on track.
It is the result of a long process launched by the Commission's Services Strategy in December 2000.
It addresses the internal market barriers identified in the Commissionâs Report on the State of the Internal Market in Services in July 2002.
The European Parliament was involved throughout the process and adopted supportive opinions on both these documents.
I am therefore delighted that I can come to you first and present our proposed solution today.
The proposal responds to the European Parliament's call for a comprehensive proposal to ensure free movement of services by means of applying the country of origin principle, administrative cooperation and, where strictly necessary, harmonisation.
The proposed directive is comprehensive in that it covers all the services that are at present unable to benefit from the internal market because of legal or administrative barriers.
It covers both the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
It will benefit a wide variety of services, including professional services, business services, security services, environmental services, distribution services, travel agencies, hotels, restaurants and entertainment, as well as health services.
Only those services that are already covered by wide-ranging specific EU law, such as financial services, telecommunications and transport, are excluded.
In order to make it easier to establish a service business in another Member State, the proposal will cut red tape through a large-scale administrative simplification process.
A number of restrictions on establishment, such as nationality requirements or 'economic needs tests', will be abolished.
In addition, Member States will be obliged to set up electronic procedures and make available to service providers single points of contact dealing with authorisations and other formalities.
Unnecessary authorisation procedures will be screened and removed; remaining authorisation schemes will be made more transparent and predictable, being based exclusively on objective criteria known in advance.
Other restrictions, such as requirements that limit the number of outlets per head of population, or fixed tariffs, will also undergo a transparent process of screening and mutual evaluation.
In order to make it easier to provide services across borders, the proposed directive aims to implement in practice the country of origin principle, whereby once a service provider is operating legally in one Member State, it can provide its services in others without having to comply with further rules in those 'host' Member States.
In order to underpin this principle, the proposal provides for enhanced administrative cooperation between Member States and for some basic, harmonised, EU-wide quality requirements.
It will, for instance, require appropriate professional indemnity insurance for services giving rise to particular risks.
The proposed directive recognises the specific nature of the regulated professions and the particular role of self-regulation and calls on professional associations to establish European codes of conduct on professional ethics. It is complementary to and fully compatible with the proposed directive on the recognition of professional qualifications.
In order to make it possible to use services offered in other Member States, the proposal also clarifies and strengthens the rights of users of services.
It therefore makes it clear that those rights prevent Member States from imposing restrictions such as requiring authorisation to use services (for example of architects or builders from other Member States), or discriminatory tax rules making services from other EU countries more costly.
The proposed directive clarifies the rights of patients by setting out, based on the case-law of the European Court of Justice, the conditions under which national social security systems must reimburse the costs of medical care received in other Member States.
The proposed directive seeks to create more cross-border service activity, which will give businesses new opportunities in new markets, so that they can grow and create more jobs.
Increased competition will also be likely to reduce prices and help to disseminate best practice and encourage innovation.
In particular, SMEs will greatly benefit from the improved legal certainty and increased opportunities for cross-border supply.
The effect on the economy as a whole will be higher competitiveness and more and better jobs.
Therefore, the proposal needs to be adopted, written into national law and implemented as quickly as possible.
This means that it must get the highest political support from all the institutions involved.
The Commission is aware that, unfortunately, this proposal arrives too late to achieve first reading in this Parliament.
However, given that it meets the European Parliament's request for a comprehensive approach to create a true internal market in services, I trust that Members will give it due consideration and start to discuss it in order to provide a sound basis for the new Parliament's work and show the way to the Council of Ministers.
That is what I would like to say on the directive on services.
Now, very briefly, on the other subject, I should like to say that the Commission has decided today to challenge the Council conclusions in the European Court of Justice.
This challenge will, however, concentrate exclusively on procedural elements and will not touch on the country-specific economic surveillance aspects of the Council conclusions.
More details are available in a document literally just made public, with the reference number IP/04/35.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
We should be particularly grateful if you would inform us immediately of the outcome.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to welcome the Commission's proposal warmly, on behalf of my Group and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
We have been following the development of this very closely.
As the Commissioner was kind enough to say, the Commission has taken notice of a number of reports we have made.
I was the rapporteur for the last round, and we are currently working on a new single market report.
So we will have a chance to go into detail, and I agree with the Commissioner that it would be highly desirable to start the debate in this Parliament.
I hope that my committee will be able to do that so we can start consulting a wide range of interests in this extremely comprehensive proposal.
It is also absolutely essential to start the progress of this through the Council.
The political points I want to make to the Commissioner tonight, and on which I would like his comments, concern the Council more than anything else.
I am pleased to see that we have one representative on the Council benches.
It is disappointing that there are not more.
As the Commissioner said in his statement, the crucial factor in getting this to work will be the willingness of the Council to accept the basic principles of the internal market: a 'country of origin' principle for supplying cross-border services, the mutual recognition of conditions of establishment and sensible behaviour as regards grasping some of these issues.
I do not need to remind the Commissioner â although he may wish to refer to it â that the Council's record to date in dealing with these issues has, frankly, been deplorable.
The sales promotion mutual recognition directive â which is an integral part of this â has been with the Council for 15 months.
Under the Commissioner's proposal we face the position where we will be able freely to establish marketing agencies in other countries, but they will not have a common set of principles.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's views about how he is going to work with us to get the Council to accept a serious timetable for dealing with these issues and how it is going to perform its part of the packages on the table.
Colleagues, if we do not have the support of the Council we will get nowhere.
This is the crunch time for the internal market.
Unless the Council comes to terms with this proposal, then it is not serious about Lisbon and not serious about the internal market.
Frankly, the Council's acceptance of this directive is the biggest challenge that the whole Lisbon proposal faces.
The Council must get on with it.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome your second declaration â that the Commission is asking the ECJ to clarify the procedural aspects of budget monitoring â very warmly.
The euro â let us admit it for once â has achieved far greater stability in the five years that we can look back on than the Deutschmark did.
On the other hand, the euro is a difficult currency, for it runs alongside not one but fifteen national finance and economic policies, has an âopen-doorâ policy, and is still a young currency.
It is therefore especially important to enforce Article 104 of the Treaty and the associated Stability Pact rigorously, and the eight countries and their citizens who have done their homework have a right to expect this.
That is why the Commission is acting properly by clarifying these rights and enforcing budget discipline.
That in itself serves to boost confidence in this new currency.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us.
Thank you for this decision.
Â Â  Madam President, my question is also about the short declaration or short announcement about taking legal proceedings against the Council.
I should like to ask the Commissioner: what is the best that the Commission expects; that is to say, does it expect to win the case?
What would the consequences be?
Would it be able in some way to intervene in the decisions taken by the Council?
What does the Commission mean when it says that it is exclusively procedural elements that the challenge will concentrate on?
Â Â  Madam President, I want to comment on both of the Commissioner's statements.
I welcome the proposal on services.
It is a great pity that it does not cover financial services.
Unless there has been a last-minute change, these have been left out of the general proposal, which is unfortunate because the general principles of country of origin and mutual recognition, which are found in the service proposal, are applicable in financial services, and it would have been good to have that reinforced by their inclusion in this proposal.
The main thing I want to comment on is the Commission's decision today to take the Ecofin Council to court over its suspension of the Stability Pact.
This is a serious row, and it has just got a lot bigger today. It is a graphic illustration of the problems you inevitably get when you try to run a single currency across 12 different countries.
Those tensions will continue and only get worse, because it really is impossible to run a single economic policy which suits every single one of those 12 economies.
Those tensions will get more â not less â significant with the expansion of the eurozone and with the enlargement of the European Union.
I hope there is a satisfactory resolution to this problem, but at the moment it is another serious blow to the euro's credibility that the rules are not being enforced by the ECOFIN finance ministers.
We were told that these rules were fundamental to making the euro work, the Commission is being forced into this drastic action and the wrangle is set to go on for a great deal longer.
In the light of the circumstances we have seen today, it is no wonder that people in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden are all saying a big 'no' to the euro.
Â Â  . Madam President, I thank the Members that have put questions to the Commission.
First, I should like to deal with the subject of the services directive. I will then move on to the other subject.
I thank Mr Harbour and Mrs Villiers for their support for the directive, or at least for what I said about that directive in general terms.
Mr Harbour said quite frankly that approval by Parliament is all very well, but what about the other half of the legislative body in the Union â the Council?
He is quite right in saying that the Council â not only on the issue that he mentioned, but others as well â has been laggardly.
That is very bad.
Sales promotion, the example quoted by Mr Harbour, is only one example: there are others.
Mr Harbour asked for the Council to accept a serious timetable.
I wish I could achieve this.
As Mr Harbour knows, the Commission is very powerful, but it is not powerful enough to force the Council to stick to a timetable.
We are in the hands of the presidency.
Mr Harbour can count on the Commission to impress upon the Irish presidency that it should do some serious work on this.
However, when all is said and done, the presidency presides and the Commission plays the role of the Greek tragedy chorus: it looks on, but there is not much it can do but say 'Woe!'.
Nevertheless, we will chivvy the Irish presidency along, and tell it to get on with the job.
Mrs Villiers complained that financial services are not included.
The reason for that is that we have a very elaborate framework for financial services, as Mrs Villiers knows better than almost anyone else.
The financial services action plan, with its 42 measures, is now well on its way to completion.
We did not want to muddy the water or go over the same ground again, and that is why, as with some other fields that are regulated by other legal instruments, we thought it better to exclude financial services.
With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, and the fact that the Commission has decided to challenge the decision of the Council in the Court of Justice, Mr Mombaur said that the Commission must insist on budgetary discipline.
The Commission certainly does that: that is why we are going to court.
I am pleased that on the whole â if not across the board â Parliament supports the Commission in that endeavour.
The Commission believes that we live in a community of law.
The Stability Pact is an agreement between parties and an agreement between parties is the law between parties, and that law must be upheld.
I said earlier that the proceeding the Commission would like to start in the Court of Justice will concern procedural aspects.
We do not think it is the proper role of the European Court of Justice to tell the Union how to formulate economic policy.
Therefore, the Court will focus on procedural aspects â the areas where it believes that the Ecofin Council has gone astray.
Having said that, I should like to point out that procedure and substance form a whole.
It is for the Court of Justice to decide where the Member States â or the Council â have gone astray.
I hope that will happen soon.
We do not want this procedure to drag on for years.
We hope that a fast-track procedure can be followed so that we will receive the opinion of the Court in the autumn.
Mrs Villiers repeated her well-known song in pointing out that she is against the euro or, at any rate, that Britain should not join EMU.
I will not enter into a debate on that now.
I know that fools rush in where angels fear to tread, so I will not get mixed up in the UK debate on the euro.
She also said that 'inevitably' â that is the word she used â these problems arise when there are 12 countries without one over-arching economic policy that is followed by all 12.
I beg to differ.
Twelve countries have signed up to the Stability and Growth Pact.
If, and as long as, they do what they signed up to, there is no problem about 12 countries following different economic policies.
As long as their budget deficits are below the famous barrier of 3%, I do not see what more we need.
No doubt the Commission will come up with more proposals along those lines.
That is my answer to Mrs Villiers on the point of the link between sovereignty in economic affairs and deficits in fiscal policy.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is a recommendation at second reading (A5-0455/2003) by MrÂ Nobilia, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on detergents (1095/3/2003 â C5-0521/2003 â 2002/0216(COD))
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner Liikanen, two years ago when Parliament began looking at the regulation in question, it seemed truly unthinkable that the legislative process could be settled with almost unanimous agreement.
Yet, with the vote tomorrow and the conclusion of the second reading, we can say that the process is essentially concluded with the agreement of all those concerned.
It must be said that the initial Commission text radically reformed the provisions in question, yet the amendments made to the original text were not at all minor.
The definition of âsurfactantâ, additional tests, the derogation from authorisation, labelling, more and better information for consumers, are all aspects that genuinely broaden environmental protection and human health protection and that take into consideration the well-being of animals within the context of research for the development of products.
It must also be stressed that the text in question considers the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the procedures have been simplified, without disregarding the necessary protection.
I will not expand any further my explanation of the text that I hope Parliament will tomorrow be able to adopt with a large majority.
Instead, I would like to thank all the groups and their shadow rapporteurs who, during this long phase, drew up the text in question after very effective dialogue.
I feel that everyone can find reason to be satisfied with aspects or sections of the text in terms of what was constructively contributed and that they will, therefore, find they can agree with the overall text in terms of the afore-mentioned assessments.
Furthermore, I would like to thank the Commission for being willing to reconsider its proposals and for the commitment there was to harmonise a text, which is certainly not easy, to make it satisfactory in view of all the respective points of view.
I must add that, even when faced with a continuous exchange of proposals and with understanding everyoneâs demands, we also prepared a legislative product with the Commission that met with broad satisfaction.
It is true that an important contribution was also made to this text by the Council, which, faced with the immense commitment of the Italian Presidency that has just come to an end, effectively followed the textâs progress and intervened at once, just when it seemed that the common position, which was aimed precisely at opening a second reading, would be delayed; nor do I want to forget the commitment and interest shown by the Irish Government delegation long before it assumed the current Presidency, thus showing a real desire to best define the text in question.
Having said that, as a signal of the long road together, I refuse to believe that the only point on which there seem to be differences can really be a reason to start the conciliation procedure.
I am referring to the provision for revision where the Commission commits to providing Parliament and the Council with a report on the anaerobic biodegradation of surfactants and on the biodegradation of other components within five years, and to put forward proposals on phosphates within three years.
The problem, however, does not seem to be so much this, but the possibility of this happening in the next parliamentary term, and this because the standard phrase on the entry into force of the current regulation would, in fact, prevent the afore-mentioned commitment being made good within the next parliamentary term.
As we know, compromise texts have been presented on which there is, as has been said, general agreement.
The solution to the problem that I have just explained is contained in the afore-mentioned texts.
I am sure that all of the groups will be happy with this solution and, appealing to the Commission, I would like to hope that the matter could be happily resolved so as to conclude a somewhat problematic procedure in a generally satisfactory manner.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Parliament on the excellent progress that it has made towards bringing this technically rather complex proposal to a successful conclusion.
The second reading has proceeded very rapidly despite the number of issues that remained to be resolved.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Nobilia, for the special effort he has made, personally, in this respect.
The Commission is pleased that this proposal is now entering its final stages.
The proposal was made with two broad aims in mind: to improve the protection provided to the environment and to consumers while, at the same time, maintaining and improving the single market in detergents.
The proposal modernises the legislation on detergents in three major respects.
Firstly, it introduces more stringent tests for the biodegradability of surfactants.
Secondly, it extends the scope of the legislation to include all types of surfactants.
Thirdly, it introduces labelling requirements for the benefit of consumer health.
It should also be recalled that this proposal simplifies EU legislation by replacing five directives and one Commission recommendation by a single regulation.
It is therefore genuine simplification; there is a lot of talk in this field, but not much action.
The Commission does, however, regret that Parliament has chosen to emphasise national measures on detergents in a proposal for Community legislation one of the aims of which was to expand the harmonised area and promote the single market.
The proposed regulation nevertheless represents a significant step forward in terms of stricter testing and extending the legislative scope regarding surfactants, as well as better information for the consumer.
These aspects are what we should concentrate on at this stage.
It is in the Commission's and Parliament's joint interest that the text should be definitively adopted before the end of the current parliamentary term.
The prospects of doing so are good if we can agree to put aside minor issues and concentrate on securing the main benefits.
The Commission therefore supports the compromise package that the rapporteur has proposed; this means Amendments 30 to 37.
Consequently, the Commission cannot accept any of the other amendments.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Nobilia, I am most grateful for the very pleasant and productive cooperation over recent years.
I am pleased that in this final phase, we have been able to reach agreement on seven important compromise amendments, and I can tell you that after critical appraisal, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support all seven amendments.
Personally, I am very pleased that we are able to maintain national measures on detergents.
In your country, for example, there are already substantial bans in place on the use of phosphates, as there are in mine.
I think this is the right approach, because it means that countries wishing to take this further will not now be prevented from doing so; nor will they actually have to turn the clock back.
Instead, they can retain their current successful standards.
I think this sends out a positive signal for environmental policy, and an especially positive signal for the enlargement of the European Union.
The amendment with the five-year period â the experts know what this is â will remain, but on the whole, my group will support the three years in the compromise.
I also think it is important that this regulation genuinely strikes the right balance as regards derogations, and I am pleased that there are virtually no derogations on the implementing obligations.
I am also pleased that in other areas where, knowing that derogations are necessary, we have been courageous enough to provide them, namely for smaller manufacturers of specialised detergents for industrial use, which after all have had to seek out a niche market where general detergents are not used, such as hospitals and industrial kitchens.
I think that we have been successful here in weighing up all the various aspects of sustainability â environmental, economic and social.
About ten years ago, the mountains of foam on our rivers were the trigger for amending the legislation on phosphates in water.
We have genuinely moved a step forward.
I am very pleased that we are no longer adopting an âend of pipeâ approach by focussing on water purification processes but are establishing innovative rules in Europe on the initial discharge of substances.
What is more, we are doing so not only with the heavy hand of the law, Alexander, but by adopting innovative approaches in order to encourage our companies to continue their work here.
I think this approach has been successful.
One point that applies to us all remains unresolved.
The legislator can impose conditions only on quantities and products; he cannot regulate the use of washing powders and detergents.
If the same amount of washing powder is used for one kilo of laundry as for five kilos, this is where the real environmental pollution arises.
There is still a great deal of work to be done here to raise awareness among Europeâs consumers, and I include myself in that.
Â Â  Madam President, the procedure in question is clearly important and we all agree on this point.
The Council common position offers the basis for an acceptable compromise and yet sufficient account was not taken of some of the areas that were debated and adopted by Parliament at first reading.
Therefore, I too believe that this balance should be improved upon, in light of the fundamental objectives of this regulation: health, consumer safety and environmental protection.
The amendments that were re-tabled by my group, with the agreement of the rapporteur, seek to guarantee that these objectives are achieved, in the interests of the key principles of the environmental strategy: the precautionary principle, the âpolluter paysâ principle and the substitution principle.
Limiting the scope of the regulation to just the biodegradation of surfactants contained in detergents does not run counter to these principles.
In fact, I believe that anaerobic biodegradation, biodegradation of main non-surfactant organic ingredients and the use of phosphatesÂ âÂ this in particularÂ âÂ should be subject to special control as a substance that is subsidiary to the detergents regulation.
The committee is almost unanimous in its call for a new legislative proposal to be presented that seeks to gradually ban these substances or to limit specific use to three years from the publication of the current regulation.
This is what has been agreed in advance by the representatives of Parliament and the Council in view of the attempt to conclude the legislative process at second reading, a package that I consider to be reasonable, above all for swift adoption of the regulation.
I therefore believe that adopting any other amendment that moves away from this compromise offers a rather narrow margin for improvement, if it does not jeopardise the entire regulation.
I therefore agree that Parliament must not deviate from this balance, and it would be ironic if it were to do so when reviewing the environmental significance of the provision.
All that remains for me to do, finally, is to congratulate the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for their willingness and their commitment.
Â Â  Madam President, our group has chosen to support the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
We should have liked to have gone further in quite a few areas and had tougher legislation, but we think it is very important for us to take a decision and for this to enter into force as quickly as possible.
Proposals to enable individual Member States to retain and introduce stricter rules in this area, as quite a few Member States have already done, are particularly important to us.
One of the main issues is that of the need to cease using phosphates.
There are sound arguments for stopping using them immediately.
We know that phosphates lead to serious eutrophication.
In the marine environment, for example, they give rise to major environmental problems.
We know that there are perfectly satisfactory substitutes and that countries have in practice phased out the use of phosphates.
In politics, there is sometimes a conflict between what is politically possible and what is desirable.
We have therefore chosen to support a compromise that is politically feasible, that is to say to phase out phosphates over three years.
Ideally, they should be phased out straight away.
We shall try to choose both routes.
We shall vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to phase phosphates out immediately, but we believe that it will be the political compromise that will be adopted in the end.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Nobilia for the excellent cooperation.
As I only have one minute, I shall have to be brief.
There is, in fact, only one major problem left, namely that of phosphates.
Phosphate-free detergents are compulsory in a number of countries; this may be on the basis of a voluntary agreement with the producers, or, sometimes on the basis of legislation.
However, in some countries of the old Fifteen, such as Spain, there are still detergents available that contain phosphates.
In a whole host of new countries that are soon to join, sometimes two-thirds of the detergents still contain them.
It would be very simple to replace these, and this is, in actual fact, what the Commission should have suggested a long time ago.
I also understand that the Commission has prepared a proposal to that effect.
What, then, is stopping the Commission from producing this proposal now rather than waiting for three years?
I also have a question for the Commission.
Is it true that one country, namely France, has blocked the compromise?
Had it not done so, this entire sitting would have been unnecessary and we would have reached a compromise a long time ago.
I should like to have an answer to this question.
Is it only France that has blocked the compromise?
Â Â  â Madam President, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I should like to congratulate Mr Nobilia, the rapporteur, on the compromise reached with the Council.
With regard to the assessment of detergents, this legislation takes the environmental and health effects sufficiently into consideration.
Agreement has been reached on exemptions, phosphates and labelling, and I have shown my support by co-signing the compromise amendments.
Particularly with regard to phosphates, it is to be welcomed that Member States can ban these, as a few have already done.
A ban on phosphates also has the positive effect that it limits the spreading of harmful cadmium into the environment, since cadmium is released when phosphates are extracted.
The recent conclusion reached by the scientific committee on toxicology, ecotoxicology and the environment, however, has sparked a reconsideration of an EU-wide ban on phosphates.
The scientific committee has demonstrated the harmful environmental effects of phosphates and rubberstamped the alternatives.
I should like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this.
Finally, I am pleased that agreement has been reached on labelling.
It should be enough to display simple texts on products approved following thorough evaluation.
If consumers are curious to know more, they should consult the manufacturers via their websites and telephone.
Â Â  Madam President, the key aim of the EU's detergent policy has been to safeguard the single market in these products and, above all, to ensure a high level of environmental and human protection.
The proposal is a consolidation and modernisation of five existing directives, as the Commissioner has told us, to form one regulation concerning the biodegradability of surfactants, which are essential substances used in detergents as catalysts to break down the surface tension of the liquid in which they are dissolved, for example oil or grease floating on top of a washing-up bowl.
The focus is on solving the problem of foam caused by surfactants in our water systems.
A major error in the installation of dishwashers and washing machines over the years â certainly in my country and, I suspect, elsewhere â has contributed greatly to this problem of foam in water systems.
These appliances are often wrongly connected by householders to surface-water drains leading directly to rivers rather than to so-called foul drains, which channel the run-off to water treatment plants, thereby causing unnecessary pollution in water courses.
Harmonisation of detergents legislation across the Community in this regulation will ensure a level playing field and is in line with the Lisbon proposals.
It will also take into account the principles of sustainable or environmentally friendly development set out in the Gothenburg strategy.
The costs of a cleaner environment and water supply are difficult to quantify, however.
This integrated two-pronged approach, which marries environmental and economic concerns, is a positive departure.
I welcome this proposal both because it provides greater information for consumers â particularly those who suffer from allergies â and because it lays down a high level of product safety through increased transparency and producer responsibility enforced by a system of national sanctions for non-compliance.
All concerned â manufacturers, national authorities, consumers â hold a stake in the process and stand to benefit from the regulation.
In addition, as well as the rightful emphasis on biodegradability of surfactants, I welcome the change in the review clause in the compromise package to give priority to exploring possible needs for phosphates legislation within three years rather than five.
There is a need for phosphate-free detergents.
Studies in my country have established a statistically robust cause-effect link between eutrophication, or algal bloom, which has an enormous detrimental effect on water quality and aquatic ecosystems, and phosphorous concentration.
A recent survey in Ireland showed that, while Irish freshwaters are still markedly less polluted than the European average, up to 30% of river length has been contaminated by phosphates.
Our government regulations were introduced in 1999 to counter this trend, which has been cited repeatedly since the 1980s as the main problem in Irish freshwaters.
However, this problem must be examined at European level in line with the directive on dangerous substances in water and under the EU water framework directive launched in October 2000.
In conclusion, I would like to echo the support expressed by the Irish presidency for the compromise package agreed by the Italian presidency, the Commission and the rapporteur.
Â Â  Madam President, like everyone else, I too can endorse the package that has been assembled as a compromise.
I thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this.
The process for reaching a compromise has been very useful and speedy.
However, like so many others, I endorse it with some reservations.
Over the last few years we have seen, at least in Western Europe, the levels of phosphate in drinking water fall by between 50% and 80%.
It has dropped steadily since the 1980s.
One of the biggest reasons for that has been the control of detergents.
Now we are opting for even tougher laws, I hope.
We are going to see them applied over a wider area, from Limerick â which Mrs Doyle knows very well â to new places such as Latvia, Nicosia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.
We can expect that all the rivers that drain into the Baltic and the North Sea will become cleaner.
There will be far fewer bubbles in the rivers of Europe than Europeans have in their baths.
These new measures, in terms of labelling of detergents and ensuring that they break down into safe components when they are discharged in the water, are not quite enough.
This issue could quite simply be resolved and in many ways improved by the removal of phosphates from our laundry wash.
This is something that we have not managed to do in this proposal.
I believe that it is something that Parliament would like to see happen and something which we feel the Commission still has to address.
Something not mentioned by other colleagues is the continued use of animal tests to assess detergents.
The practice cannot be accepted for much longer.
The Commission must set out a clear timescale for the development of replacement tests.
It is long overdue.
The Commission appears to have missed its chance yet again.
Nevertheless I, like everyone else, will support the compromise tomorrow.
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and all the parties involved in the proposal tabled.
I think that a surprisingly sound piece of work has been done.
It is an important report for the environment, but it also addresses a major and important consumer issue because detergents are important items of daily use.
Consumers need to be given full and adequate information so that they can direct developments in the market by choosing environmentally friendly products.
When it comes to phosphates, it is argued in Sweden, where we still have a number of detergents containing phosphates, that, firstly, we have sewage treatment works to deal with the phosphates and, secondly, that the alternatives are not entirely free from problems.
I have accepted these arguments.
In Amendments NosÂ 40-46, now being tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we take as our starting point the Scientific Committeeâs statement that phosphates cause major problems and that the existing alternatives do not cause these problems.
That being said, I believe it is time genuinely to ban phosphates if they are so dangerous and if they pollute the Mediterranean etc. Let us not wait for that to happen.
I should therefore like us to vote in favour of these amendments so that the Commission can put forward a proposal concerning the matter.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I stated during the debate on first reading, I believe that the regulation before us represents progress, especially for producers, consumers and in terms of environmental protection.
We are indeed moving towards the welcome modernisation of the legal framework concerning monitoring the biodegradability of detergents, which dates back to the early 1970s.
Please allow me, however, to register my disappointment as regards two points that I consider to be especially relevant and sensitive.
My first point is about the need to harmonise legislation on additional labelling, especially the banning of images likely to increase the risk of detergents being ingested, such as images of fruit or other food products.
These images are particularly dangerous for children, because their eye-catching nature increases the risk of children ingesting them.
The system currently in force only bans dangerous substances and preparations, which is clearly inadequate.
I therefore suggest that we go further to protect consumers, especially the most vulnerable.
Furthermore, I should like to express my incomprehension at the imposition in the regulation of national, non-harmonised testing methods, without any timetable for their publication being built into the regulation.
I feel that in all of these aspects the solutions we have found are far from ideal.
Â Â  . Madam President, I thank Members of Parliament for this very constructive debate.
I want to come back to the issue of phosphates, which was raised by a number of Members.
We must remember that fertilisers are a very important source of phosphates: about 50% come from fertilisers.
Years ago, in the country which I know well, I proposed taxation on fertilisers high in phosphates.
That solved the problem to a certain extent.
In many countries the authorities have acted.
The use of phosphates in detergents is effectively banned by means of national legislation or voluntary agreements in Member States that have deemed such measures necessary.
National measures currently exist in the majority of Member States and, in some cases, they have been in place for many years.
That is why the Commission will now concentrate on ensuring that any proposal in this area has a secure scientific basis and that it has an added value at Community level.
The Scientific Committee found that the consultants' report on phosphates was seriously lacking in some respects â for example concerning the impact of alternatives â and it is has identified a number of other areas for which data is still lacking.
I want to assure you that the Commission is fully committed to filling these data gaps as rapidly as possible and to proposing whatever measures may be justified on that basis.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0474/2003) by MrsÂ SandbÃŠk, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the update of the EC Programme for Action: accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction; outstanding policy issues and future challenges (COM(2003) 93 â C5-0384/2003 â 2003/2146(INI)).
Â Â  Madam President, it was in February 2001 that the Commission adopted the action programme âAccelerated action against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reductionâ.
The Commission has now presented an evaluation of its implementation and given an account of outstanding issues and future challenges.
There is a need for a stronger and more coherent strategy.
Unfortunately, enough challenges still remain.
Almost 20Â 000 deaths â not per year, not per month but daily, and it is the poorest countriesâ populations that are absolutely the hardest hit.
The crisis causes enormous human suffering and brings the possibilities of development in these countries into serious danger.
There is therefore a need for greater concerted effort in a number of related areas.
There is a need to develop new medicines.
Medicines of proper quality must be produced in sufficient quantities.
The prices must be within the financial reach of governments and populations, and the medicines must be available to all.
In this context, I should particularly like to emphasise the need for increased and continued support for the global fund for combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Africa is the primary focus for the fundâs work.
This continent receives 60% of the resources.
This fund provides the best opportunity we have partly for slowing down the spread of these three diseases and, at the same time, for reducing the consequences for those who are already suffering from the symptoms.
For example, a contribution from the fund to Haiti in 2002 has put the country in a position to reopen a public health clinic and operating theatre, provide five public clinics with important medicine and provide basic laboratory services to four clinics.
More than 600 individuals have received anti-retroviral treatment, and more than 300 cases of tuberculosis have been discovered.
In that case, the fundâs resources are not only helping Haitiâs efforts to prevent and treat HIV and tuberculosis but also mean an overall improvement in health in an area of 250Â 000 inhabitants.
President Prodi earlier gave an undertaking that the EU and the Member States would contribute a billion euros to the fund.
I would urgently call upon both the Commission and the Member States to contribute no less than that amount, and I support the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which make this undertaking clearer and more precise.
Prevention is still of crucial importance, but this was unfortunately sabotaged by President Bush's Mexico City Policy, which literally killed millions of men and now, in particular, women, for it means that vital reproductive health articles are withheld.
That is downright unethical, and the EU absolutely must respond to this catastrophic situation.
It is also crucial to ensure that research and development efforts are directed at the developing countriesâ special needs.
The Commissionâs reflections on specific legislative instruments to promote research and development into neglected and poverty-related diseases could point to one of the solutions.
Once the medicine is developed, it must be delivered to all patients who need it.
In order to achieve this, we must support the implementation of the Doha Declaration on the link between the TRIPS Agreement and public health.
There is also a need for continued discussion of the TRIPS Agreementâs significance for the accessibility of generic medicine at realistic prices.
There have been major discussions as to whether efforts should be concentrated mostly upon prevention or health.
We must quite clearly make efforts in both areas.
If there is no possibility of treatment, there will be no incentive to be tested.
There is, however, the possibility of treatment.
Generic production and competition have brought about remarkable falls in the prices of antiretroviral drugs, and, now, a number of the worldâs poorest countries have the opportunity to offer treatment for less than a dollar a day.
The importance of supporting treatment programmes by producing quality antiretroviral drugs at low prices cannot, therefore, be overestimated.
In sub-Saharan Africa, treatment is offered to only one per cent of the four million people who need it.
A report recently issued by the WHO and the World Bank shows that no progress has been made in terms of achieving the UNâs millennium development objectives regarding health.
The slow progress in the health sphere is particularly worrying because many of the technologies needed to improve health are in actual fact available at reasonable prices.
The problem is one of making them available to the people and creating strong health systems in all the countries.
In partnership with the ACP countries, it is very relevant to focus upon the unused resources from the European Development Fund in order to try to help vulnerable countries combat these diseases which have very negative effects on the countriesâ economic opportunities and destroy their social cohesion.
I should also like to emphasise the huge significance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for children.
There are now more than 13 million children who have lost at least one of their parents because of AIDS.
There is a need for a clear EU policy and for this area to be given higher priority.
I am therefore pleased about the Irish Presidencyâs assurances that African issues are high on the EUâs agenda and that the EU wishes to cooperate with African partners in a coherent, serious and consistent way and to support initiatives to meet the enormous challenges faced by Africa.
To that extent, it would be a clear and welcome symbol of the EUâs obligation if, as the report calls upon it to do, it were to appoint an EU ambassador to coordinate and lead the EUâs work in this area.
Â Â  . The Commission welcomes Parliamentâs interest in its report on the Programme for Action.
We share the overall assessment that substantial progress has been made, but further action is needed â by developing countries, by EU Member States and other donors, by the business sector, by NGOs and by European institutions â to confront and fight HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.
We recognise that these diseases affect different people in different ways and that women, children and the poorest sections of the population are often most vulnerable and most severely hit.
This should be documented, wherever practically possible, by developing countries, with support from the international donor community.
At the same time, we should avoid portraying women only as victims and make an effort to recognise the tremendous contribution they make in terms of caring for people living with HIV/AIDS or for children left behind.
Women comprise that group of the population which is most affected, in a negative sense, by poverty and disease but strangely, at the same time, that group shows the biggest potential for change and hope.
I note with satisfaction the importance attached in the report to our cooperation with the World Health Organization.
This is now recognised more visibly through the strategic partnership which is being developed between our two institutions and which, for example, has led to the signature of an agreement to provide EUR 25 million of Community funding to support the WHO in developing its pharmaceutical policies.
I also understand the emphasis placed by the rapporteur on access to basic health services and on the wish to see increased funding for this sector.
The Commission is open to increasing â however we can â support for health and other social services.
However, this is a demand-driven process in which our partner countries are in the lead.
As to the Global Fund, our contribution has been steadily increasing, with the vital support of Parliament.
We have now secured funding for the next four years, both from the Community budget and from the European Development Fund.
Despite this, resources for the Global Fund are still far from adequate.
We are committed to working together with the Member States to find a sustainable solution.
The EU as a whole â the Member States and the Commission â have so far contributed more than 50% of the money in the Global Fund.
That is a figure worth keeping in mind in view of the complaints made now and then by other donor countries.
Access to affordable medicines is an important element in our Programme for Action.
Through tiered pricing and the untying of aid we have managed to contribute to a process whereby prices on medicines have been reduced by up to 90%.
Supply of medicines at tiered prices is essential and the European Union has adopted a regulation to prevent the re-importation into Europe of medicines sold at tiered prices in developing countries.
That is very important.
The report rightly points to the important role that research and development of new medicines and vaccines could play in fighting these three 'killer diseases'.
More needs to be done in public and private research to develop new products which target these diseases.
It is clear that pharmaceutical companies could play a constructive role in addressing these needs.
The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership aims to facilitate such a contribution from industry.
The Commission is already contributing to this initiative, but we also expect Member States and industry to allocate resources.
I should like to respond to Mrs SandbÃŠk's remarks concerning the negative impact of the Mexico City Policy carried out by the Bush Administration in Washington.
I agree with the choice of wording put forward by Mrs SandbÃŠk.
We have reacted to this policy, which was announced when President Bush took office, by saying clearly that Europe is ready and willing to fill the decency gap, and that is what we are doing.
Â Â  . â Madam President, some of the developing countries are experiencing an unprecedented health crisis, and it is in the interests of the entire world to take the steps that are needed to alleviate this crisis, and, above all, to fight it.
Although the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is aware of its limited contribution to the solution of this problem, it does stress that its contribution is essential.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to raise three points.
First of all, the industrial dimension.
Too many diseases are still being neglected, with no research being done into them, because no industry can see that there is anything in it for them.
Not only does European industry stand disgraced by this, but it has also missed an opportunity.
The European pharmaceutical industry is too lacking in innovation, and focusing on neglected diseases could provide it with a new impetus.
The EU must now show political leadership in order to persuade industry to invest in diseases that have so far not been profitable.
A directive or framework for neglected diseases is much needed, and we should not shrink back from unorthodox measures, subsidies, protocol assistance, tariff exemption and even the transfer of patent rights.
The EU must create a framework on the basis of which it can start the dialogue and negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry about investments in research into such diseases as malaria, TB, African sleeping sickness, among others.
A second point is research.
The EU must now attend to its research programmes itself.
The platform for clinical trials was a step in the right direction, but what is being done in practice?
The EU should draft a research agenda and identify all the gaps.
Subsequently, research institutes and companies should be invited to put their names down.
Incidentally, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy appreciates all Commissioner Busquin's efforts on this score.
Thirdly, there is the issue of trade.
In this respect, the decision of 30 August 2003 on the eve of the Conference in CancÃºn is obviously of major importance.
Our committee would like to see this decision actually implemented in legislation in the pharmaceutical field.
We call for the prompt implementation of this legislation.
Doha should not remain an empty promise.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, I should like on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, of which I am chairman, to present our opinion on Mrs Sandbaek's exceptional report, which I am presenting in Mrs Valenciano's absence.
Unfortunately, Commissioner, after half a century of promises, analyses and development aid plans, most less developed countries are not only not on the road to development, but are also sinking increasingly into poverty and the fatal diseases of our times.
The victims of this situation are, of course, women, the social group which still does not have access to rudimentary medical and pharmaceutical care and sexual and reproductive health services.
Of course, Commissioner, as you said, women make a very great contribution, even in countries in which their fundamental freedoms and human rights are not recognised.
However, Commissioner, if women governed, I believe that the world would be a much more humane place.
I think it is a disgrace on our civilisation that 30 000 people in developing countries die every day of diseases which are curable in the civilised world.
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, ranking even above death in childbirth.
The number of women infected with the AIDS virus is high and is rising constantly.
This impacts not only on the women themselves, but also, in the case of pregnancy, on their children.
As Mrs Sandbaek said, 13 million children have been orphaned and this number, to the glory of our civilisation, is expected to reach 25 million by 2010.
As the Committee on Women's Rights, we are calling both on the governments of the developing countries and the European Union and other international organisations working in this sector to ensure that the gender dimension is fully incorporated into all health policies, taking account of the leading role played by women.
I should also like to welcome the agreement by the members of the WTO in August 2003, despite the differences and time-consuming procedures and delays which intervened, the efforts of the UN to provide high quality drugs to patients with the AIDS virus and the decision by the Council of the European Union on increased incentives for the pharmaceutical industry, with the aim of selling drugs more cheaply.
I think that we should step up our efforts to address this dreadful scourge, Commissioner.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Programme for Action against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis dates back to 2001 and has now been in force for two years.
The situation has not become any less harrowing.
The three diseases combined are responsible for more than 20Â 000 deaths daily.
Over the past year alone, according to the WHO, approximately 40Â 000 people were infected with HIV/AIDS every day, and based on the latest information, 16 million children under the age of 15 have now lost one or both of their parents to the disease.
Tuberculosis is one of the world's major infectious diseases.
One third of the world population is infected, and it is expected that 5 to 10% of them will actually become ill.
Malaria is pushing ahead fast; in Africa alone, some one million people die of it every year, most of them pregnant women and young children.
The seriousness of the situation cannot be pressed home enough.
The death rate as a result of this disease is still increasing and this is set to be the case for some time.
Let it be clear that the least developed countries are hit hardest, and that is why these diseases are termed diseases of poverty.
They hamper social and economic development, completely disrupting the societies of many developing countries.
Fatalities hit large sections of the working population, and companies and organisations have to do without workers.
In many countries, the loss of teachers means that the educational system can no longer function, and as already stated, the number of orphans is growing dramatically.
What kind of a future do they have?
A whole generation is at risk of being lost.
The diseases are making demands on health care systems over and above the ability of these to handle them.
The Programme for Action can be considered a sound programme but can be improved on a number of scores.
After all, the evaluation of the European development policy shows that the current programmes have too little impact.
The European Union has set itself millennium objectives.
One of the points is to stop the steady increase in the spreading of AIDS in 2015, but we are still not doing enough to achieve these goals.
I would therefore urge you to set aside more money for this programme and to intensify the research into the causes and reduction of diseases.
As is known, the biggest problem with malaria is that due to increasing resistance, new medicines have to be developed all the time.
I think that the report gives a clear indication of Parliament's commitment where, as has already been mentioned, the importance of the availability and accessibility of basic health care, of medicines, of prevention, of the possible role of civil society of research and monitoring is concerned.
I should like to highlight one point that deserves specific attention, namely the special position of women.
These diseases hit women first, and hit them hardest.
In the 15-24 age group, there are nearly twice as many women victims compared to men.
Worse access to education and health care, a biologically greater risk of infection and a difficult social position all contribute to this.
This population group therefore deserves specific attention and policies, especially as health care projects, among others, appear to be more successful if women are involved.
Investing in girls appears to lead to lower mortality rates among women and children, offers higher food safety and benefits the fight against poverty.
This was once more evident from the research published by Unicef on 11 December last.
In fact, the report states that without, for example, campaigns to get more girls into schools, it will be impossible to achieve the millennium objectives.
Moreover, it transpires that when more girls attend school, this does not only benefit the girls, but also the boys and the countries.
Finally, I should like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, who is an expert in this field and has once again produced an excellent report.
There is still a great deal to be done by the European Union and the individual Member States.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, today, like any other day, more than 8Â 000 people have died of AIDS for lack of treatment.
In Africa, more than 4Â million AIDS sufferers are in desperate need of treatment and only 50Â 000 people have access to it.
Moreover, AIDS is not the only scourge overwhelming the countries of the South: tuberculosis is on the increase and kills 2Â million people every year; malaria is responsible for between 1 and 2 million deaths every year and affects between 300 and 500Â million people.
In fact, we have the means to cure these diseases or to significantly reduce the death rate.
But the treatment is expensive, too expensive for countries that can only afford to spend derisory sums on their health services, with the result that medicines are for the North and coffins for the South.
Fortunately, things are starting to change.
Much progress was made in 2003, giving cause for a glimmer of hope: the WHO initiative to provide treatment for 3Â million sufferers by 2005; the agreement reached on 30Â August 2003 in Geneva by the members of the WHO; the decision of the South African Government to launch a national treatment programme; the efforts to bring down the price of antiretroviral drugs on the world market and the programme of clinical trials in a partnership between Europe and the developing countries, with a budget of EURÂ 600 million.
These initiatives are very encouraging, but they are still far from being enough.
The Union itself is being slow to deliver on its financial promises and the SandbÃŠk report is a timely reminder to the European Union to firm up its commitments, setting it a target that is appropriate to what is at stake.
It reminds us that the absolute priority has to be access to medicines for all sufferers, in accordance with the Doha Declaration.
The existence of patents should not therefore constitute a barrier to the manufacture or purchase of vital medicines.
Furthermore, the report forcibly underlines the fact that the prevention and treatment of transmissible diseases are the concern of everyone, because they constitute a global public good.
It sets an ambitious target for the financial contribution of the European Union and its Member States, a target of a billion euros a year.
In adopting this report, Europe will reaffirm that it intends to play an important role in the fight against these dreadful diseases.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to voice my support for the report and, at the same time, my gratitude to Mrs Sandbaek.
This report sends out alarming signals and challenges us, in particular, to combat poverty and devastating diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis far more resolutely than before.
My group does not underestimate the Commissionâs efforts.
However, the facts presented in the report tell their own story.
The impacts are probably most severe in Africa.
As people die, whole villages die as well.
As a result of poverty and disease, vast territories are virtually depopulated, even without war.
Of course, the issue today is the adoption of practical measures and programmes to control these diseases.
Nonetheless, the general social context cannot be ignored.
People who live in poverty have no energy to fight these deadly diseases and nor do they have the money to pay for drugs.
The armies of refugees, camping in open fields or in tents, are easy prey to these pandemics.
When the market is dominated by the profit motive, it is difficult to supply high-quality drugs at low prices in the developing countries.
However, this is exactly where politics must accept its responsibility and do more to meet it.
Regrettably, WTO conferences are aimed more at reinforcing the privileges enjoyed by major monopolies than at supplying the comprehensive and reliable services of general interest that are so urgently required.
If we ignore the signals sent out by the World Social Forum now, we will hear them far beyond Mumbai.
In light of this emergency, whose roots go back to the colonial era, it comes as no surprise â although it is only right and proper â that the former colonies should now demand compensation from the former colonial powers.
This, as the report says, is where the EU, the Commission and this Parliament have to redouble their efforts.
Â Â  Madam President, the battle against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis has for a long time been one of the principal concerns of the Greens.
Moreover we welcome the consensus that now prevails regarding this report, which would not have been possible four years ago.
It is disquieting to learn that deaths are still being counted in millions, particularly if one takes into account the fact that these diseases affect many children or pregnant women.
It is sad and devastating to learn that these diseases are still killing even though treatments exist.
The accessibility of medicines must be guaranteed.
It is necessary to facilitate not only a mere reduction in prices, but also the assignment of patents, because that is necessary in order to enable developing countries to produce these products for their people, or import them at low prices.
The efforts on which we agree must be targeted first and foremost at children and pregnant women.
Real assistance must be provided for women, who carry within them the future of the continent.
This assistance includes, in addition to treatments, information about these infections, and in that respect it is necessary to strengthen the health structures in these countries.
The adoption of this report will confirm the European Unionâs involvement in the struggle for the health of Africa.
Â Â  Madam President, there is a moral obligation for the European Union and the individual Member States to make every effort to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
Twenty thousand deaths per day or more than seven million deaths per year are horrific figures.
We are reminded of the Black Death that raged here in Europe during the Middle Ages.
The Black Death is back. Forty-one per cent of the worldâs population is in danger of being infected with malaria.
In the light of, for example, the UNâs millennium objectives and the G8 Summit in Evian on sustainable development, I want to say to MrÂ Nielson that no effort should be spared in helping people hit by malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and in preventing these diseases.
We are in actual fact concerned here with rearming the whole of civilisation on this earth.
Women must no longer be exploited, sexually degraded and exposed to a form of slavery that is completely unworthy of a society that is both modern and civilised.
Throughout the world, men need to begin recognising the dignity of women.
What is needed is a society marked by a new and more potent dispensation in which men show respect for women and for human dignity.
I want to call upon Commissioner Nielson to get involved in lifestyle issues, especially when it comes to the male lifestyle that, especially where the spread of HIV/AIDS is concerned, degrades women and contributes to the completely immoral spread of this disease.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and for continuing to show her interest in and commitment to these issues.
Like her I welcome the Commission's continuing focus on action against and treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.
The programme which was launched in 2001 has produced some very important and impressive results.
We need in this report and in this Parliament to reiterate the importance of continuing this emphasis on tackling these particular diseases in the context of our poverty eradication efforts.
It is absolutely crucial to recognise the importance of this concentration of effort on these diseases, which, as others have said very graphically this evening, claim so many lives and cause so much suffering.
I trust the Commission will continue its efforts to build the necessary political will, based since 2001 on an increasing knowledge of what actually works in the field at this time.
There remains a greater need for donor resources and for national resources, and the Commission must continue to argue for more commitments to fight AIDS, to the programme and to the Global Health Fund from bilateral programmes.
I welcome the acknowledgement, as the rapporteur and others have already agreed in the report, of what is arguably the most neglected crisis spawned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic â the plight of millions of profoundly vulnerable children who have been orphaned by the disease.
The numbers, as some of us have already seen in the field, are overwhelming the capacity of families and communities to cope.
We are clearly facing a development catastrophe at the hands of the AIDS pandemic.
There is no better gauge of its scale and cruelty than the orphan crisis.
I urge the Commission to compile data on the impact of all these diseases on children and women.
All of these efforts will not be assisted by the dangerous misinformation pedalled by the Roman Catholic Church with its pseudo-scientific pronouncements about the spermatozoa passing through the net formed by a condom.
This nonsense, alongside US views on the need for abstention before marriage, is incorrect and quite simply dangerous.
US policies are not saving lives: they are only pandering to the fundamentalist conservative voters at home.
Kofi Annan has described the AIDS crisis as being an issue of weapons of mass destruction.
There is a great deal to do, and it will require substantial funding from our programmes in developing countries.
AIDS has to be a core theme of our development assistance.
Â Â  Madam President, we shall be voting in favour of this report because it describes the disaster being caused by diseases linked to poverty.
For anyone reading this report with the least humanity and reason, the findings alone are a true indictment of our economic and social system, which allows millions of human beings to die of diseases that can be healed, particularly TB and malaria.
The rest of the text is merely an admission of impotence.
That is not the fault of the rapporteur, but of the whole system.
Parliament is invited to vote, but it does not have the power to affect the root of this evil.
It will only be possible to combat diseases linked to poverty effectively if we combat poverty itself and, consequently, combat the flagrant inequalities of a social organisation in which certain individuals can obtain and accumulate more wealth than entire countries possess.
For instance, what is meant by the proposal â and I quote â to involve the European pharmaceutical industry in the fight against poverty-linked diseases?
Everyone knows that the pharmaceutical trusts are looking to make a profit, even at the expense of the poorest people, and for them there is no question of distributing medicines, even if the cost of developing them has been written off a hundred times, to sick people who do not have the money to buy them.
Moreover, when those trusts have no hope of making a profit because the disease in question affects only poor countries, they stop their research, as the report itself concludes, giving sleeping sickness as an example.
The pharmaceutical industry should operate under the control of society, without bringing in private profits, and it should produce the necessary medicines so that they can be distributed to all those who need them.
That would not put an end to poverty, but it could help to ensure a certain amount of equality when it comes to medical treatment.
Â Â  Madam President, I think that the Commissionâs update report was very constructive.
I also think that MrsÂ Sandbaek has produced a very sound report.
She has produced a whole lot of proposals that strengthen the areas in which the Commission has stated that such strengthening is needed in order to achieve the objectives of combating poverty and these diseases.
I want to take paragraph 26 of MrsÂ Sandbaekâs report, which is very central, as my starting point.
This recalls that debt repayment and servicing account each year for almost 40% of the least developed countriesâ GDP.
That is incredible.
I believe that the EU should take the initiative regarding the writing off of debts.
Written off debts could also be earmarked so that they are, in the first place, used for efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and perhaps also for education.
In that way, the fight against poverty could really be strengthened and given impetus.
Â Â  Madam President, when I wrote my report on HIV/AIDS two years ago, I was not sure what the outcome would be.
However, I am delighted that the EU, the Commission and this Parliament have done quite a lot, as many speakers, including the Commissioner, have said.
However, I want you to focus on an African woman who is suffering and dying from HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria.
If she were to watch CNN what does she see and hear?
She sees the conflicts in Iraq, Congo, Afghanistan, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and so on. She sees loss of life, billions of euro wasted, including the EUR 75 billion that President Bush has pledged for Iraq's reconstruction.
This is essential, but it is a lot of money in relation to the US commitment of EUR 15 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS, of which 10 000 people are dying every day.
So, this lady sees terrorism in Istanbul, New York and Saudi Arabia.
She sees a natural disaster in Iran â 20 000 people dead, a town flattened â and she says to herself 'I have TB, and yet I do not have ten dollars or ten euro to cure it.
I am dying'.
How does she feel when she sees all these billions of euro that we spend to renovate buildings that have been destroyed and which are then destroyed again?
The pledges â which are very worthy indeed â for the reconstruction of Iraq made by countries like the United States amount to EUR 75 billion.
What is their contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria?
That is where the European Union has been tremendous, very generous and is showing the way for the rest of the world.
I also look to the oil-rich countries.
What are they doing?
How much are they contributing?
If not, why not?
What about Japan and others?
If we are to address this issue we have to be serious and put it into context, because the people who are suffering are poor, sick, oppressed, not free to work and live in harsh conditions.
They have no water or electricity, they have no tools to till their land, and nor are they near the sea.
What chance do they have?
That is why it is important to EU aid and to go back to the basics of life such as water and access to energy, because these people are already spending their whole day looking for water and firewood to cook their next meal.
I know the Commissioner is committed.
He is brilliant.
I know this Parliament is behind him.
Let us go for it and make sure that this year and beyond we can achieve what we set out to do.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine myself to making a number of comments about HIV/AIDS.
Although a great deal has already been done, it is certainly not enough, and in the long term, the costs will be higher if we fail to act than if we provide massive assistance now and spend what sounds like a lot of money.
However, HIV/AIDS is not just a health problem.
HIV/AIDS is a threat to society as a whole.
The death toll from AIDS reverses the modest successes achieved in the past.
In a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, life expectancy is falling dramatically.
Men and women of working age are dying in increasing numbers, and this leads to educational deficits, for there are regions where the number of teachers dying of AIDS is higher than the number of new teachers who can be trained to replace them.
The result is a drop in the standard of education.
This is exacerbated by the fact that young girls are no longer able to attend school because they have to care for their parents who are sick with AIDS.
In Swaziland, for example, school attendance among girls has fallen by 36%.
HIV/AIDS also causes malnutrition and starvation, for a rural population which is sick cannot cultivate its fields, or can only do so to a limited extent.
In Burkina Faso, agricultural production has therefore fallen by almost a fifth.
Millions of children are orphaned, facing an uncertain future.
These examples could be continued .
They show that HIV/AIDS worsens the plight of the poor immeasurably.
To put it another way, every euro spent on prevention, treatment and healthcare infrastructure is worthwhile, not only to benefit the individuals but also to boost economic and social capacities.
To this end, the EUR 1 billion being demanded is money well spent.
Â Â  Madam President, I agree with most of what has been said tonight.
I should like to focus on the EU contribution to the Global Health Fund.
Two amendments have been tabled to make it clear that we are talking about the EUR 1 billion from both the EU and the Member States.
I am pleased that Mrs SandbÃŠk will accept that amendment.
President Prodi has supported this target.
It sounds like a lot of money, especially at a time when public finances are tight, but it is not unrealistic.
In fact, it is about one third of the increase announced this year for the farm budget in the EU, so it is not unthinkable that we can achieve this amount.
We can afford it and so can the other developed countries.
Mr Khanbhai asked what the woman who had these illnesses would think.
What would she have thought, turning on her television last week, to see President Bush announcing a multi-billion-dollar space programme of truly astronomical amounts?
It is about time that we resolved the problems in this world before flying off in search of others.
Â Â  â Madam President, we are hardened to the fact that people are still dying of hunger and disease in this developed, globalised community of ours.
They could be saved with modern medicines and food that is thrown away.
Cheap aid programmes would mean the lives of six million children under the age of five could be saved each year.
We accept the fact that people amass huge sums in profits worldwide.
It is common to steal billions.
It is not true that if individuals amass wealth on a colossal scale it will benefit the community at large.
There is a limit to hunger, but not to greed.
The best remedy is taxation.
The rich oppose it.
It means sharing.
Charity is not solidarity; sharing is.
Capitalism thrives on greed, and so does poverty.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us resolve the problem of deprivation in the same way as with the wars in Europe: through cooperation.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mrs SandbÃŠk referred to the unspent EDF money that could be used for this.
The amount of commitments not yet spent on the budget part of our development cooperation is EUR 11 billion.
For the EDF it is EUR 8 billion.
We are now at a point where it takes the Commission and the Member States pretty much the same number of years to implement things.
Today we are not slower, but we have a mountain of old decisions to implement.
This is true for both budget and EDF areas.
At the end of 2003 we found that we had reached a level of EDF spending of around EUR 2.5 billion: the highest ever, around 60% higher than the level when this Commission took office.
It was announced to Member States that they had better be prepared to pay up for the last quarter of that year so that we could deliver on this better performance.
Unfortunately, however, some Member States did not pay their contributions, so we had to ask them to make up their minds as to whether they were serious about their wish for the Commission to perform better.
The Commission is serious about that.
The TRIPS Agreement is being addressed by the Commission.
We were pleased that it was possible, before CancÃºn, to have concluded this agreement, after waiting for the US since December of the year before.
We are now in the process of working out how to implement this in terms of legislation.
We look forward to doing this.
We will give this a very high priority.
The money being committed by the Union, Member States and the Commission for the Global Fund is EUR 2.6 billion.
All in all, the total amount pledged to the fund is EUR 4.8 billion.
I agree with those who said that this is still not enough money, but it should be considered that our budget support for the health sector and even our general budget support makes it possible for our developing partner countries to increase the effort in basic health services.
The annual spending per capita on public health services in sub-Saharan Africa is somewhere between two and six dollars.
So even with antiretrovirals becoming very inexpensive, the system to administer them and to make sure they are correctly handled is not there.
I do not mean that we should give up on treatment, but I insist that prevention, to put it quite clearly, is the only cure in terms of HIV/AIDS.
I would tend to agree with Mr SacrÃ©deus regarding lifestyle change, especially for men.
This is why the whole agenda on reproductive and sexual health and rights is the key to getting it right on HIV/AIDS.
More people in Africa â especially children â die from malaria than HIV/AIDS.
These are poverty- and ignorance-related diseases, so the whole link with fighting poverty and the challenge of meeting the millennium development goals makes a lot of sense.
I wholeheartedly thank Parliament for its cooperation and the backing that we have received.
Let us continue to make this a team effort.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0329/2003) by MrÂ BÃ©bÃ©ar, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) [2003/2106(INI)].
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the New Partnership for Africaâs Development, or NEPAD, is a political initiative which was adopted in October 2001 by five African Heads of State, President Mbeki of South Africa, President Bouteflika of Algeria, President Mubarak of Egypt, President Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Wade of Senegal.
Those five countries now form the Steering Committee of NEPAD.
NEPAD is actually part of an ambitious project known as the âAfrican Renaissanceâ.
