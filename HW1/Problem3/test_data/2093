Â Â  . As you know, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on 15 March 2001 to combat offences that damage the environment.
In particular, this proposal specifies that Member States shall ensure that certain activities are criminal offences, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence, as far as they breach the rules of Community law.
It particularly refers to the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste referred to by the honourable Member in his question.
On 27Â January, however, the Council adopted, instead of this proposal for a directive, a framework decision based on TitleÂ VI of the Treaty on European Union.
This text criminalises a number of actions that damage the environment, committed either intentionally or by serious negligence, and makes them liable to criminal penalties.
This list of offences includes the unlawful disposal, treatment, storage, transport, export or import of waste, including hazardous waste, which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person.
The Member States had to adopt the measures necessary to comply with this framework decision before 27Â JanuaryÂ 2005.
The Commission is currently studying the national transposition measures notified to it by the Member States in order to provide the Council, as specified by the framework decision, with a report enabling it to check, no later than by 27Â JanuaryÂ 2006, the extent to which Member States have taken the measures necessary to comply with the framework decision.
That said, the Commission, which, with the support of the European Parliament, went to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to challenge the legal basis adopted by the Council, is waiting for the judgment to be delivered shortly, on 13Â September I believe.
As MrÂ Staes mentioned, on 26Â MayÂ 2005 the Advocate-General delivered conclusions that are very favourable to the Commissionâs position, as MrÂ Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer suggests that the Court annul the relevant provisions of the framework decision of 27Â JanuaryÂ 2003.
If the Court follows its advocate-general, a new legal instrument, this time a Community one, will have to be adopted to protect the environment through criminal law, including to prevent the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I am indebted to the Commissioner for his exhaustive and correct chronology of the facts, and I think that this question is very timely.
Indeed, if the Court of Justice pronounces its judgment on 13Â September, the Commission will need to take prompt action to deal with something that is â in my view âa serious crime.
You, Commissioner, are responsible for justice and police matters.
This is a serious crime and represents a risk to the environment, very often also a risk to food safety and public health, and those engaged in it are also often criminals linked with the mafia â a term I use in its traditional sense.
I would therefore ask you, as Commissioner, to act as soon as judgment has been passed and that you ensure that we can create a sound legal framework for this.
Â Â  . Yes, of course, I fully share your point of view.
If, on 13Â September, the Court supports the Commissionâs opinion, which is shared by the European Parliament, the Commission will very quickly launch an initiative in this vein.
Â Â  . The Commission wishes to underline that there is no current requirement on air carriers to provide to the United States API data on passengers for overflights.
As you probably know, the United States authorities are considering a so-called emergency amendment, which would require airlines to check all passengers against a United States no-fly list for all flights overflying the United States.
The Commission would seek opportunities to discuss any such proposal which could have implications more generally for international air travel.
The European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security, but that does not include a no-fly list.
The inclusion of persons in a no-fly list, however, does not mean that they are guilty of, or suspected of, involvement in criminal activity or other wrongdoing.
Rather, the United States authorities, on the basis of wide range of information, have determined that the individuals in question should not be allowed to fly to or over the territory of the United States, either because their presence in the United States is deemed unwelcome or, because by travelling on an aircraft they might pose a security risk.
Such decisions and the criteria on the basis of which they are made are exclusively the domain of the United States Government, which alone is responsible for them.
Although the occasions on which flights are diverted are relatively few, we recognise the concern and inconvenience they may cause.
The Commission will, therefore, pursue clarification of the United Nations no-fly list in talks with the United States, as I promised earlier in the summer.
For example, early and effective communication to airlines of an up-to-date no-fly list is an essential aspect. The Commission is in the process of seeking to elucidate further with the American authorities on that criterion, in order to prevent in the future cases of false positives.
I will be discussing this and other issues during my next meeting with Secretary Chertoff in Washington in early October.
Â Â  . Commissioner, basically you are saying that you do not yet have the answer to this question.
You are saying that we do not know how you get on to such a no-fly list, so we do not know how you get off it.
I should also like to ask if you know who has access to these lists.
Is it the American authorities?
The airline companies?
European authorities?
If a citizen is on a list for all the wrong reasons, then what can they do to be taken off it?
I do not think that your reply is satisfactory.
We asked what the criteria were for being placed on such a list.
I believe that is still a valid question.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my reply must be extremely short and I would like to repeat that it is a fact that these decisions are the exclusive responsibility of the US Government.
Europe, the European Union, I say again, and this is a matter of fact, does not have any competence to obtain authority or to require a reply on the criteria that govern inclusion in this no-fly list.
We believe that it is not necessary to supply the no-fly list for Europe, but we are in contact with the United States to obtain those clarifications that we have not yet obtained.
As I have said, I will go to Washington in person to obtain, among other things, a reply to this question.
Â Â  Madam President, the delegation for relations with the United States visited America a few weeks ago.
The question now arises of whether it might be possible to draw up a common catalogue of persons who present a risk to security.
I believe it to be important that there should be a transparent catalogue of criteria on both sides of the Atlantic.
Does the Commission already have any ideas about this?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view this is an idea that can be taken further.
As I said, it would be possible first of all to provide for the communication to the airlines of persons included on the no-fly list, to be provided suitably in advance of the aircraftâs departure, precisely to avoid cases such as those that have occurred of errors being discovered when the aeroplane is already in flight, with route diversions as a result.
Then there is the possibility of achieving a substantive dialogue on the criteria for inclusion on the no-fly list, to which there would obviously be restrictions connected with the national sovereignty of the United States, which to date has not agreed to make these factors known precisely.
We are talking exclusively about overflying the territory of the United States, not about flights from and to the United States.
Â Â  â You had a meeting with the US minister responsible in June 2005 on these issues and, in a written reply by the European Commission to my question on the subject, you say that the minister, Mr Chertov, asked you for more controls on passengers and cargo, improved used of technology for such controls and the removal of obstacles to the operability of mechanisms for imposing controls.
I ask you specifically, and I would be obliged if you would not reply with generalities, what are the specific US proposals to the Commission and which of these proposals does the Commission accept?
Which does it say âyesâ to and which does it say ânoâ to?
That was months ago.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, no specific proposals have been made â it has merely been repeated that there is a need to avoid, through upstream control, the possibility of persons suspected of serious offences, and in particular terrorism, being on an aeroplane flying over the United States.
Our request to the United States was obviously not intended to interfere in the issue of US national security, but to obtain a guarantee regarding compliance with privacy in the handling of personal data.
In response, a decision has been taken to set up an office and an authority responsible for the protection of personal data within the United States Internal Security Department.
Pursuant to the legislation of the United States, such an authority is and will be responsible for all cases of contravention of the rules on proper handling of personal data.
This is â and I repeat â a result obtained at the request of the European Union.
With regard to other possible specific proposals â and I would like to say this once again â I believe that the only effective method is a direct personal meeting with Secretary Chertoff, and that is what I intend to do in the second week of October.
Â Â  . Indeed, as the honourable Member proposed in his 1998 report, it was precisely Parliamentâs resolution on the effects of the enlargement of the European Union on cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs that resulted in the creation of a European police academy and of a Community service with regard to external border controls.
I think that we can now be very proud that these two proposals have already become a reality.
With regard to the first proposal, as you know, the European Police College (CEPOL) was established by the Council Decision of 22Â DecemberÂ 2000, and I think we can say that it is now in a position to fulfil its role.
Two Council decisions inÂ 2004 gave it legal personality and named Bramshill in the United Kingdom as its permanent headquarters.
A proposal presented by the Commission in OctoberÂ 2004 with the aim of improving the legal framework of the CEPOL is waiting for formal approval from the Council.
I think we can tell you that a political agreement has already been reached within the Council itself, in JuneÂ 2005.
As Parliamentâs reservations have all been resolved, I think that the decision will be formally approved in the course of SeptemberÂ 2005.
The proposal relating to the setting up of a specialist European service for external border controls, too, has led to the establishment, by the Council Regulation of 26Â OctoberÂ 2004, of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States.
This agency, based in Warsaw, has started work and already has a budget of more than EUR 6 million for 2005.
Â Â  Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for that outstanding and welcome answer.
Can I just ask a supplementary question?
I would like to know the present state of thinking about the idea that the Police College should be made even more of an institution, particularly by being made subject to Community control and being funded from the Community budget.
What is the position on this issue?
As regards the external borders, I would like to ask whether thought is already being given to the possibility of joint units on them, or whether this is not yet being done at present.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the proposals to improve CEPOL â the police academy â will move in the direction of more rigorous control by the EU institutions and certainly in the direction of more substantial funding.
In my view, one of the most important tasks is training the officers in the police forces of the 25 Member States.
With regard to the European Agency for External Borders, however, the actions have obviously not yet been defined in the sense that you wish.
Personally, I have always said that I was in favour of joint training for all the Member Statesâ border officials, so that if in the future the conditions warrant it, we will be able to prepare a European border officials force and a border police force.
Opinions still differ on the matter, but to me it seems necessary for the Agency to be able to start to help the Member States immediately in operational checking activities at the borders.
On this point, I can say that the first task I have entrusted to the Agency concerns the Mediterranean, and in particular support for certain major measures relating to the control of the Mediterraneanâs maritime border, partly with a view to strengthening relations with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean â in other words, a task that is extremely important for Europe.
Â Â  . As you probably know, in its annual work programmes, the Agency for External Borders will, on the basis of the results of its risk analysis, identify a number of operational activities to be carried out each year by Member States together with the agency.
In addition, Member States can also put forward proposals for joint operations and pilot projects which the agency may then decide to co-finance.
The agency shall evaluate the results of all operational activities carried out under its aegis.
If Member States carry out operations at external borders outside the framework of the agency, they shall report on such activities to the agency.
As regards the joint return operations, it follows from Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 that the agency shall provide Member States with all necessary support in organising joint return operations.
The agency will at this stage not carry out return operations itself, but only provide technical assistance to Member States.
In this context, it should also be noted that the agency shall identify best practices on the acquisition of travel documents and the removal of illegally present third country nationals.
A credible European migration policy necessitates the use of return operations in order to uphold the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum and immigration systems of the Member States.
However, such return operations must always be carried out in full respect of the human rights and safety of returnees.
The Commission expects the agency to play a major role in developing and promoting at European level the highest possible standards in this regard.
The Hague programme asked for the establishment of common standards for persons to be returned in a humane manner and with full respect for their human rights and dignity.
It called for the submission of a Commission proposal.
On 1Â September 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive providing for clear, transparent and fair common rules concerning returns, removal, temporary custody and re-entry which take into full account, I repeat, respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the person or persons concerned.
Finally, as regards the internal organisation of the agency, the Commission can inform you that the management board of the agency decided on 30Â June 2005 to launch an evaluation of the need for establishing specialised branches on the basis of the results of this evaluation.
The management board will decide if and where the agency shall establish specialised branches.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
As you know, the Commission and the European Parliament take a different approach to this specific issue of addressing immigration flows and there is a great deal of concern within the European Parliament about not touching on basic human rights.
I ask you directly: will you take account of the opinion of the European Parliament?
There have been occasions in the past when you have proceeded in the opposite direction.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the term ârespectâ for Parliament signifies sincere and transparent confrontation.
This morning I confirmed my readiness to present to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs as early as next week the whole package of proposals that the Commission approved only last week.
It seems to me that I have been rather swift in being ready, as the competent committee in Parliament will be the appropriate forum for the expression of all the opinions formulated on this subject.
Â Â  . Of course, as you know, several of the provisions in the Protocol to the Europol Convention of NovemberÂ 2003, which has so far been ratified by 16Â Member States, aim to improve Parliamentâs involvement in the work of Europol: forwarding the reports on the activities of Europol and of the joint supervisory body and the five-year financing plan, consultation on any initiative by a Member State or by the Commission regarding Europol, and the possible appearance before Parliament of the Presidency of the Council, possibly accompanied by the director of Europol.
That is why the Commission urges the Member States to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible.
Europolâs participation in a supporting role in joint investigation teams is expressly provided for by the Protocol to the Europol Convention of 28Â NovemberÂ 2002, which has not entered into force.
At the moment, it still needs to be ratified by five Member States.
Indeed, that Protocol cannot result in Europol being given operational powers until the Member States themselves have implemented the framework decision of 13Â JuneÂ 2002 on joint investigation teams.
On this point, the Commission shares Parliamentâs opinion regarding the disappointing outcome of the instruments transposing the framework decision.
As it is a field that falls outside Community competence, unfortunately Â may I sayÂ  the Commission does not have the right to institute infringement proceedings against the Member States that have not implemented this framework decision.
Nevertheless, Europol has participated in a number of cross-border investigations that do not fall within the precise framework of the joint investigation team and, at times, has coordinated some of them, such as Operation IceâBreaker on 13Â JuneÂ 2005 targeting Internet child pornography, during which 153Â searches were carried out simultaneously in 13 different countries.
Involvement in this investigation enabled it to strengthen its position.
Finally, in its 2002 communication on democratic control over Europol, the Commission supported the idea of a joint committee of national parliaments and the European Parliament responsible for discussing matters related to Europol.
It would be worth relaunching this idea.
In this regard, the Commission is quite willing to participate in this type of parliamentary meeting.
As you may know, two half-day meetings have been scheduled in Brussels in October, between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, specifically regarding parliamentary control of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
Four sub-topics are on the agenda: the European arrest warrant, Eurojust, Europol and the exchange of sensitive information.
Â Â  Mr Frattini, although you do not have the formal powers to take infringement proceedings, as you quite rightly stated, can you use your influence to determine a greater transparency between Europol and the institutions?
In a recent report on Europol, all sides in this House felt that transparency was totally lacking.
However, we felt that the work of Europol was hugely valuable and that it is an effective organisation with a new director trying to invigorate the organisation.
Given the importance of the topics that it deals with, can you use your influence to increase the transparency arrangements, which will only make the organisation more effective?
Â Â  . Yes, I fully agree with you on that point.
I will do all I can to put political pressure on Member States to strengthen transparency and to try to make relations between Europol and the European Parliament and other European institutions more transparent.
Â Â  In terms of accountability, has the Commission sought a report from Europol on its apparent failure in detecting and impeding the progress of three international terrorists who fled as fugitives from justice in Colombia, before publicly appearing last month within the European Union, in Dublin?
If the Commissioner is not in a position to provide me with the information today, will he undertake to write to me on that subject?
Â Â  . We do not have that information yet, but I can reassure you that I will give you all the necessary information when it is available.
Â Â  As the author of the question is not present, Question No 51 lapses.
Â Â  Madam President, on a point of order, Mr Frattini has been answering questions for well over 20 minutes.
Should we not move on to the third part of Question Time?
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has dealt with this matter and gone into it thoroughly following a written question by MrÂ Wuermeling, who recently received a written reply.
The issue, as many of you will probably know, concerns the conformity of two reference circulars, one adopted in 2000 and the other in 2004, regarding the issue of visas and the circulars on specific subjects implementing the two reference circulars.
The first circular, adopted on 3Â March 2000 and known as the VÃ¶llmer circular, has been deemed by the Commission not to be in line with the principles of the Common Consular Instructions currently in force.
We then examined the subsequent circular, adopted in October 2004, which replaced the previous circular from 2000.
The conclusion that we came to, after our first stage of thorough examination, is that the 2004 circular remedies the general issue of conformity with the Common Consular Instructions in force.
We also said, however, to the German authorities in our reply, and also of course to Mr Wuermeling, that, even though overall the 2004 circular seems to be in line with the Common Consular Instructions, clarifications, specifications and improvements in drafting are necessary in the text of the circular in force, adopted in 2004.
We have also asked the authorities of the German Federal Government to provide some replies on the specifications required, and I can assure you that contact with the relevant authorities is continuing.
Obviously, I intend to provide further replies as soon as the answers have been given to the Commission.
Â Â  I am much obliged to the Commissioner for the detailed written reply to the question which has now been provided.
As the Commissioner has just said, the German visa decree of 26Â OctoberÂ 2004 warrants further clarification, especially on the subjects of false statements by visa applicants and false documents.
Since the Commissioner has also stated very clearly that there is no scope for national provisions in the Common Consular Instructions on Visas, I should like to know whether the 2006 revised version will put an end to this once and for all.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Klamt for this broad question.
Let us remember that the lesson to be drawn from this incident is that we should harmonise the system for the issue of visas by the European Union Member States to an even greater degree.
Let us also remember that on a subject such as the issue of visas, if the documentation is incomplete there cannot and should not be room for any doubt or uncertainty, not even in terms of interpretation.
This is why the proposal for a revision of the Common Consular Instructions, which we will submit in early 2006, will be even clearer as regards incomplete information provided by an applicant, and as regards cases where elements are found to be untrue; the rule will be absolutely binding: a visa cannot and must not be issued.
Â Â  â I am very much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements on the âVolmer decreeâ, which simply was not in conformity with the law.
I should like to emphasise once more that this is not a matter for Germany alone, because many people entered the EU on a German visa and then moved on to other Member States.
Therefore, I wish to ask the minister to reiterate his assessment of the magnitude of this âincidentâ and the extent of its adverse effect on Europe.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while I do not for the moment have exact data at my disposal, I can say that the impact of application across the board of rules contained in the Common Consular Instructions on visas has an extremely significant impact on the European Union, in so far as it affects thousands of people who request entry and who apply for a visa.
In addition, as you said, this is not a German issue in a narrow sense, but concerns the need to ensure that all consulates in all the European Union Member States prevent the entry on a properly issued visa of anyone who cannot demonstrate that they fulfil the legal requirements laid down by the Common Instructions.
If flexible interpretations of the rules occur, even if they are not breaches of the instructions in the strict sense of the word, the impact can nonetheless be extremely significant.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question NoÂ 53 lapses.
Resettlement of refugees is an important instrument in finding sustainable solutions to serious and protracted situations involving refugees.
However, at the present time, only a few countries in the world accept refugees through resettlement.
The EU could play an important role by introducing a common refugee quota.
More Member States should take part than at present to enable the EU, in close cooperation with UNHCR, to work more strategically and to coordinate resettlement with other long-term efforts, such as targeted aid for assistance with return and reintegration.
In the Hague Programme, the Council has called on the Commission to develop regional protection programmes in partnership with third countries and in cooperation with UNHCR, including a joint resettlement programme for those Member States wishing to take part.
Has the Commission been able to launch a joint resettlement programme yet?
What view does the Commission take of a permanent resettlement programme within the framework of EU cooperation?
What are the Commission's views on the willingness of the Member States to take part in a joint resettlement programme?
Â Â  . The regional protection programmes, which were adopted last week by the Commission, aim to help, in a spirit of co-ownership and co-responsibility, third countries which have large refugee communities or are faced with large numbers of asylum applicants beyond their protection capacity.
Voluntary resettlement will be an important element in every regional protection programme in terms of providing a lasting solution for refugees and demonstrating the partnership element to the third countries involved.
Resettlement can help alleviate the burden of the regions of origin and consequently enhance their protection capacity.
With regard to the development of an EU-wide resettlement scheme, the Commission believes that it is more appropriate to follow a step-by-step approach, as resettlement is a policy that is new to most Member States.
At present, the objective pursued by the Commission is to maximise the protection benefit and overall impact of the resettlement activities to be undertaken under the regional protection programmes.
The objective is therefore to encourage and facilitate to the greatest possible extent Member States' participation in the EU resettlement effort.
In order to achieve that objective, the Commission services are working on an amendment to the Council decision of 2004 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2005-2010, which would envisage that resettlement activities could be substantially financed by the Community as of 2007.
This proposal is due to be presented for adoption by the Commission in October â very soon.
As one of the stumbling blocks to any new policy initiative lies in budgetary support for its implementation, the financial underpinning of such a new policy is vital, as you understand very well.
The Commission believes that the possibility of contributing to the actual resolution of protracted refugee situations through the strategic use of resettlement in the framework of regional protection programmes, combined with a strong financial underpinning of resettlement activities to be implemented in this context will provide â I am convinced â Member States with the incentive to participate in EU resettlement initiatives.
The Commission has noted that several Member States are currently considering setting up their own national resettlement programmes.
Moreover, there is no broad consensus among Member States on the need for a coordinated and systematic approach to addressing protection issues in regions of origin and an increasing acknowledgement of the fact that the targeted use of resettlement has the potential to deliver comprehensive and effective solutions to protracted refugee situations.
Finally, on the basis of the evaluation of the pilot regional protection programmes and taking into account the operational and logistical needs of managing resettlement on an EU scale, the Commission will examine the appropriateness of bringing forward a proposal for a more structured approach to resettlement at EU level, which might lead in the long term to the development of a permanent EU resettlement scheme, something I firmly hope to see.
Â Â  I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for this gratifying decision.
As you know, I come from Sweden which is one of those countries that have been very committed to this issue.
In the general debate about refugees we have had so far, we have not talked about this as an important solution.
I am therefore looking forward to reading the forthcoming proposals and would thank you again for your answer.
Â Â  . We will work in this direction.
Â Â  Since the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions NosÂ 55 to 94 will be answered in writing(2).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0244/2005) by MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of minors and human dignity and the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry (COM(2004)0341 â C6-0029/2004 â 2004/0117(COD)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to thank MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez for her report and for the work she has done.
It is certainly not easy, when it comes to problems directly related to our society, that represent the very essence of our society, to unite the whole of Parliament, with the various visions, ideologies and cultures represented in it, around a single text.
It is marvellous that MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez has managed to achieve consensus in Parliament first of all, not to mention between the institutions, on the objectives presented by the Commission.
As you will appreciate when I explain the Commission's position on this report, the majority of the amendments are acceptable to us fully or in principle.
Before I discuss the details, however, I should like to hear Members' views on this report.
Basically, I can say the following: the spirit of better regulation is fundamental to what we have to do.
That is why we must strive to be as succinct as possible in legal texts and let the stakeholders, as well as the Member States, deal with the details of their implementation.
As a Commissioner, I have tried to ensure that every level of our society takes its responsibilities seriously. That also includes, for instance, our media industries.
A number of Parliament's amendments are not acceptable to the Commission in their current form, because they are too detailed or too prescriptive, or because of their substance.
However, this debate might change my mind, so I am looking forward to hearing Members' input into this very important social issue.
Our work is essential.
We are not politicians for the sake of it; we make policies in order for our societies to be better off.
When I speak about our societies, I mean the diverse cultures of the 25 Member States, which have to be brought together in one high-level European policy.
I know Parliament is capable of that.
That is why I shall listen to how Parliament wants the Commission to present its basic proposal to the Council.
I have great confidence in what Parliament, in its wisdom, is going to say.
Afterwards I shall try to draw the appropriate conclusions from the proposals that have been made.
I shall listen with great interest when Mrs De Sarnez sets out Parliament's position.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the main purpose of this recommendation is to protect minors on the Internet.
The Internet is a powerful tool, without borders, open to all, and it gives everyone access to a pool of knowledge and documents and an ability to exchange information that have never been equalled in the history of humanity.
In just a few years, the Internet has changed the face of the world.
It is the legislatureâs duty, however, to prevent this powerful communication tool from becoming a harmful, or even dangerous, tool, particularly for minors, who are using it more and more frequently.
Indeed, young children now spend more time in front of the computer than in front of the television.
They do not know it, but they are not always safe on the Net.
They are faced with new dangers that could cause them deep and irreversible trauma.
I would like to give you a few statistics regarding this situation, which is becoming increasingly worrying.
More than one in three children have accidentally stumbled on violent, pornographic or paedophilic images on the Internet.
There are currently about 260Â million pages on the web with pornographic content, and 470 paedophilia sites.
More than 1.5Â million images have been identified on the Net of children, very young children, being sexually exploited or abused.
Between 2003 and 2004, Internet child pornography grew by 70%.
On average, it takes just 30 seconds for a young person connected to a chat room to be approached sexually by a predator, in other words by an adult pretending to be a teenager for the sole purpose of getting the photo and address of a young surfer and a meeting with him or her.
The paedophilia business generates 20Â billion dollars a year worldwide.
In France alone, it represents a turnover of EURÂ 50Â million a year.
Faced with such a situation, we must not and we cannot remain inactive.
It is time to protect children and the most vulnerable from all harmful content, whether legal or illegal.
It is time to ensure that all those involved take responsibility for what is happening on the Internet.
This is all the more necessary now that new technologies are omnipresent and frequently freely available in schools, homes, cybercafÃ©s and, soon, on mobile telephones.
These are all new ways for young people to avoid any kind of supervision.
Today, self-regulation is no longer enough.
We must go further by calling on all those involved, politicians, the industry and educators, to take responsibility.
First of all, politicians have a responsibility.
It is up to governments and ministers for education to implement specific Internet education programmes aimed at all children, teachers and parents.
It is also up to them to organise information campaigns to alert public opinion to the dangers posed by the Internet.
They should also increase the availability of hotlines for reporting harmful content and encourage the establishment of a European toll-free number accessible to all.
Finally, we propose that the Commission should consider creating a domain name âkidâ reserved solely for content for children.
Next, the industry has a responsibility.
The existence of charters, codes of conduct and quality initiatives is no longer enough.
It is high time that hosts provided easy-to-use parental software and offered subscriptions to access services intended specifically for children, with automatic filtering at source.
It is high time, too, that creators and producers were compelled to provide a description of their sites so that they could be classified.
Finally, educators, in other words parents and teachers, have a responsibility.
Children of younger and younger ages are faced with the information and images carried by the Internet.
Only the inclusion of an educational approach as part of schoolsâ curricula will enable improved use of the Internet.
Needless to say, this would require training and information for teachers, and also for parents.
Those, in essence, are our proposals.
However, this recommendation also seeks to make a right of reply available in all online media.
This right of reply already operates satisfactorily for the written press and audiovisual services, but not for the online media.
In most Member States, no provisions are currently laid down.
We therefore need to establish minimum principles at European level for exercising the right of reply for all new electronic communications media.
Thus, this recommendation will make it possible, thanks to the support of Parliament, which I would like to thank for the quality of its work, to improve Internet usage and will, I hope, be able to restore confidence.
Europe is currently experiencing a major crisis, a crisis in its institutions, its operation, its budget, its identity and its values.
However, I hope that, at least, when it comes to the future of our children, we will rediscover our ability to take action and to bring about the necessary changes to protect them.
It is the least we can do for them.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a recommendation undoubtedly represents an advance for the protection of minors and human dignity, particularly in terms of safer Internet browsing for children and also guaranteeing a right of reply in relation to inaccurate information disseminated through any type of medium.
It is a pity, though, that the legal basis chosen for this recommendation should be Article 157 of the Treaty, which is intended to ensure the competitiveness of European industry, instead of the more appropriate Article 153 on the protection of consumer interests.
It is also a pity that the legal form chosen should have been a recommendation that, as is well known, has no legally binding force.
In spite of this, it is very important that this report focuses on strengthening the protection of minors, through education programmes on information media designed to also enable adults, parents, teachers and trainers to teach minors to make proper use of the information media, especially the Internet.
Also extremely important is the commitment to fight the danger of child pornography, especially on the Internet, which is to be combated through informative and preventative advertising campaigns.
As the rapporteur also stated, the Internet is a formidable tool for communication with the entire world, but it should be safe and trustworthy.
For this reason it is important for the Commission to agree to set up a European toll-free number to supply information on existing filtering systems that can also simplify the submission of complaints to the relevant authorities and the reporting of dangerous sites.
In addition, it could be a good idea to promote the adoption of a seal of quality for providers, so that users can identify whether or not a particular provider is regulated by a code of conduct.
Finally, another important point is the possibility of creating filters that will prevent at source the computer transmission of child pornography and other material that constitutes an assault on human dignity.
To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the Members who have worked together to draft this text.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs de Sarnezâs outstanding report has brought Parliament face to face with a problem which is a long way from being resolved and which will take a long time to be resolved to a satisfactory degree, although the adoption of the proposed recommendation could prove a highly significant step in the right direction in this area.
The protection of minors and human dignity is an issue that raises fresh problems on a daily basis and increasingly requires both firm action and appropriate teaching in conjunction with a broad spectrum of the people directly involved in the issue.
Specific responsibilities must be taken on, good practice must be exchanged and close cooperation must be established between all of the stakeholders involved.
Yet we must ask ourselves if this enough.
Can we expect, for example, that the mechanisms of self-regulation and co-regulation will prove a genuinely satisfactory solution to the problem?
What is needed is a sea change of mentality in terms of competitiveness and the production of content, with a view to rejecting the illegal and harmful products that are increasingly invading all audiovisual areas and what are referred to as online services.
This issue covers areas as diverse as the protection of human rights, the development of personality, family and school education, and the construction of citizenship; in other words, it goes to the heart of democracy and freedom.
Consequently, the substance of the recommendation before us should, at various levels and from a variety of perspectives, involve the European and national authorities, the audiovisual industry, and Internet providers and users, along with, on a broader level, authority figures who deal most directly with minors, such as parents, educators and teachers.
It is also essential, however, that technology develops and improves so that the measures included in the recommendation can be made genuinely effective: from signalling systems to filtering, from classification to clear guidance on whether a particular practice is legal or otherwise.
Direct contact with the minors themselves; they must be in a position to activate protection mechanisms; child protection agencies and similar associations must become involved; and academic training and learning that takes account of these considerations must be provided.
Tricky and complex self-regulation procedures should also be promoted, whereby institutions and businesses foster self-evaluation and civic awareness.
This, for me, is the most difficult aspect, because it will entail a radical change of mindset and behaviour in an era of fierce competitiveness and thirst for profit.
Changes must also be made to national laws whereby all of these factors can be brought together and can run smoothly, in such a way that we can achieve at least some of the objectives.
Let us hope that this becomes a reality in the not too distant future.
I therefore feel, Mr President, that we should congratulate Mrs de Sarnez and vote in favour of the report before us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Lisbon Strategy resulted in the introduction of the European Unionâs -Europe Action Plan, the aim of which is to speed up the achievement of the new-economy objectives, particularly those involving the Internet, by 2010.
The Action Plan also includes measures to be taken by Member States with a view to achieving Internet security.
Internet security means not only the use of smart cards and virus protection, but also protection from harmful and illegal content.
I would therefore ask the Commission to strengthen this aspect in future -Europe action plans, and at all events to include specific measures.
In Austria, for example, 80% of young people use the Internet and, of these, 50% go on-line nearly every day.
It has been established that there are currently around 260Â million pages with pornographic content circulating on the Internet.
The trade in sex, particularly child pornography, on the Internet is booming, and so Parliamentâs call for the protection of minors cannot be repeated too often.
We must also take care that we do not, in our pursuit of increased competitiveness, overstep the bounds of human dignity.
Measures must be demanded and implemented at political, entrepreneurial and educational level.
Parents should also be involved.
The objective must be to achieve a uniform level of protection of minors and human dignity with a view to improving the competitiveness of audiovisual, information and on-line services in the long term.
Filter systems must become more widespread.
It should not be possible in future for minors to gain access to websites with content involving, for example, child pornography or racist or violent material.
Information and awareness-raising campaigns, continuing education of teachers and instructors, and also the introduction of a quality label for providers subscribing to a certain code of conduct, are urgently required.
Although voluntary self-regulation is a good thing, it does not offer adequate protection of children in the face of the proliferation of harmful content.
Equally important is the requirement for the right of reply, which should also apply to all new electronic communications media â audiovisual media and on-line services, in other words â but must of course also take into account freedom of expression and the specific nature of the service concerned.
It is regrettable that this is only a recommendation and that we have to content ourselves with making demands of the Member States.
I should like, instead, to see regular monitoring that would enable us to exert public pressure and thereby separate the good from the even better.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate my colleague Ms De Sarnez for the effective and innovative approach she has taken to a subject with extremely delicate ramifications.
The huge growth in the reach of the Internet has recently drawn the institutionsâ attention to the need to safeguard the rights of minors, which should be protected especially carefully in so far as they are among the main possible users of the web.
I am well aware of how difficult it is to find the right balance between two requirements: firstly, that of ensuring that minors can benefit from the wealth of information that the web can provide, and secondly, the duty to prevent the danger that the Internet might become a tool for deviancy and miseducation for minors.
For this reason, the combating of the circulation of content that is harmful to human dignity and the civil and cultural development of minors is of fundamental importance.
On the other hand, it is also vital not to slow down but in fact to speed up the process of development of the sector, by promoting new audiovisual media and information services, but in an environment of calm and trust.
In fact, if effective tools to protect the public interest are not rapidly identified and used, these new media and services may not be able to achieve their full potential from the social, cultural and economic viewpoints.
I agree with the rapporteur when she states that, in order to ensure the protection of minors in the utilisation of new information technologies, various actions must be taken simultaneously at three levels of responsibility: politicians, the industry itself and the educational system and parents.
I therefore support the proposals she has made, particularly those aimed at implementing information campaigns for citizens to alert public opinion to the dangers posed by an inappropriate use of the Internet, the promotion of training for the trainers, through initiatives specifically aimed at teachers and educators on the risks of the Internet for minors, and the distribution of information packs to pupils and parents.
Finally, I urge the European Commission to promote the setting up of a single toll-free telephone number for the whole of the EU, to receive information and complaints about harmful sites.
This would make it easy to compile a list of such web domains, partly with the aim of possible legal action against the authors.
It would also make it possible to give very useful data and news to the Member States that currently do not have such a reporting service, which fits in well within the strategy of protecting minors.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, like almost everything else in life, the Internet has its good and bad sides, not only for minors, but also for adults.
I speak from experience, for there is much to be found there that bothers me, too, even though I am not a minor.
The problem facing us consists in striking a balance between freedom of information, which we all agree is a good thing, and the protection of minors.
We must not, however, go too far in doing this.
In the United States, there were plans to apply certain filters, but these blocked all the information on breast cancer, for example, because the word âbreastâ was banned as pornographic and all the information on it was filtered out.
We should make these risks known: this kind of scenario is unacceptable.
Our vision is one of both children and adults being able to handle the media in an independent and self-confident manner.
In order to achieve this, we need websites suitable for children â because, of course, minors require particular protection â on which children can practise constructive behaviour from an early age, that is to say the ability to recognise positive and exclude negative Internet content.
Of course, we also need effective filter systems of the kind that do not overshoot the mark.
We need systems to filter out pornography, and also racist and violent content; I should like to see these particular filters for adults, too.
We need continuing education for teachers and instructors in schools and educational establishments so that they, too, are able to pass on to children the information they require.
In addition, we need to introduce a quality label so that we can advertise a good example and thereby subsequently outlaw bad examples.
We intend to table an amendment to ensure that there are not too many strict filters, but that these are nevertheless effective and capable of protecting our children.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the boundaries between television, the Internet and telephone services are becoming increasingly blurred, and this presents us with new challenges.
The legislation currently in force at EU level is inadequate in the face of such challenges, for example when it comes to safeguarding the mental and moral development of the youngest media consumers.
The most problematic aspect of the Directive is the way in which Member States are absolved of responsibility for the content of programmes broadcast beyond their borders.
The notion of state borders, or that of an EU made up of nation states, is an anachronism in todayâs media world, and it would be irresponsible to ignore programmes merely because they are broadcast outside national borders.
The mandatory technical safeguards for programmes that pose a threat to childrenâs moral development are both outdated and ineffective nowadays, and the sole purpose they serve is to boost the egos of those who incorporated them into the Directive.
We are also overlooking the fact that provision is made in ArticleÂ 22 for a type of programme that should not be broadcast at all, in addition to programmes to which as a rule children should not have access.
According to the Directive, programmes should not contain obscenities or pornography, and they may not be broadcast if they pose a threat to childrenâs mental development.
In spite of this, we are incapable of dealing with the problem of harmful programmes being supplied as part of packages to families that have no desire for them.
It is plain to see this is where we come up against the fundamental principle of freedom of speech, and that this is a battle that we will lose to the porn industry.
It is a sad fact that we are incapable of resolving this simple conflict of standards in favour of common sense and the public good.
The great many loopholes and exemptions in the Directive will encourage Member States, and the European Union itself, to avoid dealing with issues covered by the Directive, in particular those falling under ArticleÂ 22.
A good example of this is the European Commissionâs failure to take action over complaints that have been lodged regarding the French Supreme Audiovisual Councilâs registration of a porn channel.
This registration not only constitutes a violation of the Directive within France, but also now provides a basis upon which applications can be made for the automatic approval of the channel, for example in Poland.
We are making poor use of the opportunity to afford greater protection to viewers by means of national legislation.
The De Sarnez report responds to the majority of these challenges and problems, which is why it deserves our support.
It should not go unmentioned, however, that the frequent references to the dead and buried draft Constitutional Treaty detract significantly from the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the fulsomeness of her work and my honourable friends for their speeches on the proposal for a recommendation by the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of minors and human dignity and the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry being proposed through the De Sarnez report.
There are a great many findings, but the main fundamental conclusion which led to this report is still the European Union's inability to monitor urgently and effectively the application of its individual directives.
We conclude from the amendments which we had the opportunity of tabling and voting for that, achieving the objectives in the area of the media, led by television without frontiers and the new technologies in the information sectors, such as the Internet, depends on cooperation between politicians, the audiovisual industry and parents, responsibilities which touch on the quality of the product offered, of training programmes for young people, of the protection of dignity and of the right of reply when morals are offended and citizens' personal data are divulged.
To close, I recommend the direct and uniform application in the Member States of terrestrial digital television broadcasting, which will allow parents to control programmes, especially the programmes to which millions of European citizens, including minors, have access as a result of rapid technological progress and, finally, the production of information broadcasts with a strategy against acts of violence against minors and support for victims in the form of psychological, moral and material assistance.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the development of new technologies in the information sector and the spread of the use of the Internet have brought very important benefits in the dissemination of knowledge and information and have facilitated communication between people to a very great extent.
However, technology often also has negative results when it is used for the wrong purposes, especially when there is no proper legislative framework to regulate its use.
Thus today there are millions of pages of pornography on the Internet and, as our rapporteur Mrs De Sarnez noted earlier, young people spend more time on the Internet than in front of the television.
Consequently, it is the duty of legislators to ensure that this tool of the freedom of expression does not become a dangerous medium for minors.
This recommendation has precisely that objective.
It proposes innovative and specific measures to control Internet sites with illegal and harmful content.
I believe that these measures respond to a considerable degree to citizens' concerns.
We need to congratulate â and I for my part congratulate â Mrs De Sarnez, with whom we had the opportunity to hold numerous discussions via our committee and, of course, the work carried out by all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and all the contributions on this issue are now here before the House ready to be voted on.
This is a text which is a decided improvement on the Commission's initial text.
Finally, as far as the right of reply is concerned, there need to be common principles in all the Member States so that the protection of people's dignity, honour and reputation can be safeguarded effectively.
If we continue to have different conditions for exercising the right of reply in the various Member States, there is a danger that people facing inaccurate accusations with ulterior motives will be unable to make appropriate use of this right.
Â Â  I welcome the reportand I am in favour of the protection of young people who are exposed to dangers in the media and in particular on the Internet which their parents and teachers may not be fully aware of.
There is, therefore, an urgent need to inform and educate parents, teachers and all of society, and to alert them to these modern-day dangers.
However, the kind of adult supervision that can prevent all dangers does not exist.
Violence in society and violence among young people is growing and various sections of the media and electronic games must also bear some responsibility for this as it is via these very means that young people learn the skills of violent behaviour, identify with negative role models in such games and thus become immune to the suffering of others, or they may even enjoy such suffering, regarding it as something normal.
At a time when we are fighting terrorism in every corner of the world, such images of violence are helping to support and strengthen it here.
Since the most important thing in the world of business is generally profit alone, countries must make use of regulations and laws to impose restrictions and also make sure that such restrictions are respected and that appropriate measures are taken when infringements occur.
On the other hand, all those who make their living from the media or from young people must take responsibility for their actions.
Industries must provide a description of the contents of what they propose to sell, which will facilitate the classification of web pages and make it possible to formulate abbreviations and advisory messages and to provide appropriate filtering.
I wonder whether it is only violent contents that actually bring profits when there are so many important things in life that could be communicated to young people in an interesting and informative way, and which at the same time could contribute to a better society and to better relations between people.
Â Â  I welcome the speaker with such a carefully prepared document, and I believe the document will be instrumental in helping us protect our children from harmful content disseminated through the mass media, including the Internet.
I would like to point out that the Internet, and the Internet cafes in particular, are the least controlled of all information media.
According to a Gallup survey, as many as 63% of Lithuanian children browse the Internet, of whom as many as 33% are 7â10 years old, and only half of the parents show any interest in how their children do that.
As many as 90% of those interviewed believe that the most harmful content on the Internet is pornography, whereas 54% of the respondents pointed to violence-related information.
36% of the respondents ascribe such content to paedophilia and 13% to religious sects.
I fully support the proposals and amendments presented in the document.
The Lithuanian authorities have been quite successful in managing locally produced Internet sites, and we do not have any problems in this respect.
However, we face serious problems with content from abroad, since it is virtually outside of any control.
Therefore, I believe that following the adoption of this recommendation the Commission should prepare an appropriate directive.
Childrenâs psyches should be protected from damage by any sort of content, and that is a task and responsibility for all of us, including the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Please believe me, Mrs De Sarnez, when I say that your report is really very good.
We should guard against complacency, however, and always aim high, so I would venture to point out three issues in relation to which I believe we could have gone a little further.
The content of the report deals with subjects that differ so much from each other that it is difficult to find a common denominator.
It refers to the protection of minors on the Internet but also to the right of reply and discrimination.
I believe, and I am addressing this to you, Mrs Reding, that we should make it possible for each of these issues to be the subject of a specific recommendation.
Secondly, an express reference is required to the necessary respect for freedom of expression, because the protection of minors that we have laid out in this recommendation could lead to situations in which the restrictions extend to adults, and that would be a violation of ArticleÂ 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In this regard I agree with what Mr Sifunakis has said.
The United States Supreme Court rejected the Communications Decency Act for a similar reason and because no right is without limits.
I do not believe that we should make the same mistake and we should be cautious.
Thirdly and finally, I would like to point out that I believe the scope of this recommendation has been unnecessarily restricted, because we have talked a lot about minors as viewers of unwanted audiovisual content, but we have not focussed on minors as passive subjects.
When we refer to paedophilia, we forget that it is children, minors, who are the object of this type of illicit information and I believe this report should make some reference to that point.
Â Â  â Today we are considering a truly important issue that concerns every family and every one of us: the protection of minors, our children and grandchildren, from harmful pornographic, violent and drug-related Internet material.
This is undoubtedly a most important task, requiring immediate measures.
This is also an international problem going far beyond the boundaries of the European Union, thus calling for the efforts of the entire international community.
The most recent statistics suggests that children spend more time browsing the Internet than watching TV.
In this respect it is necessary to point out that there are about 260 million pornographic sites, in addition to many others teaching how to commit crimes or produce drugs.
In Lithuania we have noticed that websites promoting the use of drugs and registered on European servers are immediately transferred to America as soon as any threat arises, and this makes our task even more difficult.
Our experience has shown that in an attempt to protect under-age persons from harmful Internet content the self-regulation of Internet service providers is no longer an adequate measure.
In so far as the technical means are available, it is necessary to legally bind Internet service providers to install filters that screen harmful sites and to oblige them to block such sites on the server.
I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary to harmonise the laws of the European Union Member States on the protection of under-aged persons from the harmful impact of the Internet.
I welcome the proposal to arrange courses in schools for children and parents on the possible dangers created by the Internet and the means of protection against such dangers, as well as the proposal to open free telephone lines for people to call and report on Internet sites harmful for children.
Another justifiable proposal is the idea to create a domain specifically designed for children and to have the content of the sites registered therein regularly scrutinised by an independent authority.
In conclusion, I would like to express my strong confidence that in order to avoid even more serious problems in the future we should declare, in the entire European Union, zero tolerance of any harmful Internet material promoting pornography, violence or drug addiction, especially material targeting children and under-aged persons.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Parliament has made a number of proposals that I support unreservedly, because we share the same aim: to protect our children.
God knows that new technologies, in enabling us to communicate freely on a global scale, present us, educators and politicians, with greater difficulties than was the case with the technologies and media we are used to.
When something negative is published in the written press, it is possible to prevent it being republished.
When a negative programme is broadcast on television, we can stop it.
In contrast, on the worldwide web of the Internet, these options are limited.
We must be aware that, with the growth of these new media, we have entered a technological reality that presents us with far greater regulation difficulties than for traditional media.
That being the case, we have a responsibility as politicians, but also as parents, because I think that most of us here are parents too: what can we do to protect our children in the face of technological realities that can no longer be controlled as they could in the past?
I would like to assure the honourable Members that, faced with this problem, we have not remained inactive.
We have been working for a number of years with the Safer Internet programme, and we have observed that hotlines, for example, work extremely well.
We have been able to see the results of these hotlines, where they relate to law enforcement bodies.
I will just mention the INHOPE network, which has really made it possible to move things on.
Indeed, you must not think that the Internet is completely unregulated.
The Internet is regulated in a different way.
In the past, for the traditional media, regulation came from outside.
For the Internet, it comes from the inside, from the users themselves.
It is Internet users that, using our hotlines, using our portals, bring our attention to the existence of negative content.
Most of our information on this subject therefore comes from teachers, from parents, from ordinary Internet users and that is one of the new assets for our politicians: we have communities of Internet users who operate by trying to control negative content.
As legislators, we therefore have to think differently and make these communities more aware of their responsibilities.
Nevertheless, MrÂ President, we must not forget the responsibilities of politicians, of the educational sector and, above all, of parents.
In this respect, I agree completely with the honourable Members: we must give parents, if they want it, the means to protect their children.
Filters are extremely important in this regard, and the Safer Internet programmeprovides funds for testing the effectiveness of these filters, because we must accept that they are not all very effective.
One of you had a story to tell about this, and I am sure we could all tell more.
We therefore really need to put in the investment to increase the effectiveness of filters.
Some Members, and I can well understand this, are wondering why we have not gone for more restrictive legislation, why we prefer âlightâ to âheavyâ legislation.
There are a number of answers to that.
First of all, the recommendation of 1998 is still valid.
Today, we are discussing an addition, an improvement, further action to what has already been decided.
Secondly, we must not forget that this is very much a matter for subsidiarity.
Thus, according to the âTelevision Without Frontiersâ Directive, the definition of harmful content and the actions to be taken in response to it come under national authority.
This is already a partial response to another question that was asked: why do we not confine ourselves to revising the âTelevision Without Frontiersâ Directive in the future?
Well, it is precisely because, in transforming the âTelevision Without Frontiersâ Directive into an âAudiovisual Content Without Frontiersâ directive, we would not include all media.
It is extremely important, in the field concerning us, for all media to be involved, in other words not just audiovisual media and the Internet, but also the written press.
Another issue that was brought up is the right of reply.
In relation to this right, our Member States â because this subject, too, comes under the subsidiarity principle â have had good experiences with coregulation.
I consequently believe that we should continue to use coregulation.
That said, MrÂ President, I must stress that the main aim of all the actions that will be taken thanks to Safer Internet, thanks to âTelevision Without Frontiersâ which will become âAudiovisual Content Without Frontiersâ, thanks to all the regulations, both light and not so light, that we are going to apply, is and remains the protection of our young people.
I would therefore like to say to the honourable Members today that I was very pleased to hear from all sides that, in addition to paedophilia, which is a crime, in addition to pornography, which is still banned in our various countries, by various cultural methods, it is also, and above all, violence that causes a problem.
In the five years that I have now been responsible for media matters, I have said this time and again: it is not only pornography, but also violence that is very damaging to our children.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for recognising this fact and for helping to go down this route, because, at present, violence is not recognised in national or international legislation as being as damaging as pornography.
We have therefore taken a huge step forward in this regard.
However, I think, MrÂ President, that what Parliament really wants to hear is what the Commission intends to do with Parliamentâs amendments on which various speakers have commented this evening.
There is a whole series of amendments that the Commission will accept as such or with only minor alterations.
It is late, so I will not go over all of them.
I wanted to start on a positive note: the Commission accepts almost all the amendments, albeit with a few alterations to which we can return later.
I agree with Parliament with regard to hotlines and filtering.
I would add that I have promised and acted to ensure that part of our research budget is invested in improving filters, because, quite frankly, what we have at the moment is not great.
In that vein, MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez, AmendmentÂ 33 on hotlines and filters is one of the amendments that the Commission accepts.
We will support it in our policies.
On the other hand, we have some problems with AmendmentsÂ 3Â andÂ 5, particularly because they refer to the Constitutional Treaty, which, unfortunately, we do not have.
We cannot make commitments based on a text that we may wish for with all our might, but that is not yet available to us.
With regard to AmendmentÂ 13, you will be aware that the Commission has proposed dates for the transition from analogue to digital, but this aspect has no place in the recommendation as such.
In addition, the dates are some way off, as the transition is scheduled for 2010 and the analogue switch-off for 2012.
I do not want to get involved in fortune telling.
As regards AmendmentÂ 27, which aims to reduce food advertising specifically targeted at children, although I agree with the principle, it comes under the subsidiarity principle and I must say that self-regulation of the industry is working quite well at the moment.
What is needed, from the point of view of Parliament, from the point of view of the Commission and from the point of view of the Member States, is to apply pressure for this self-regulation to be truly effective in all aspects.
With regard to AmendmentÂ 28, we think that it does not add anything and that it risks causing confusion because there is industry and there is industry, so why not all industries?
With regard to AmendmentÂ 29, you should be aware that, in the assessment systems, local, regional and national cultural differences also come into play.
These cultural differences, for which, as you know, I have fought continually, do not suit me in this particular instance, but they do exist and they must be taken into account.
As for AmendmentÂ 32, concerning discrimination created by false and stereotyped images, we must, as some of you have already said, strike a balance between the protection of children and freedom of expression.
On the subject of AmendmentÂ 34, we think that the original proposal will be more effective.
With regard to AmendmentsÂ 23,Â 37Â andÂ 38 on the right of reply, which was the subject of almost all of your speeches, I have got the message.
I know how close this right of reply is to your hearts.
However, moving from indicative guidelines to minimum principles, covering all audiovisual and online information services, replacing âassertion of factsâ with âinaccurate factsâ: all of this raises some major legal problems.
I am therefore inclined to listen to the Commissionâs legal service, which has warned me of the possibility that these concepts could be falsely interpreted.
That is why I prefer to err more on the side of legal certainty.
In relation to AmendmentÂ 39, too, I prefer the basis of the Commissionâs text.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we agree on 95% of the elements presented and we agree 100% on the values that we share and that will be the values of our society in the future, based on respect and on the way in which we protect the young people of today.
That is what is essential here.
The fact that we are implementing the best methods for achieving these results seems to me to be an element of that that the Commissioners, and also the MEPs, know so well because they are in contact with the national and regional officials who will have to put into practice a large proportion of what we have decided today.
Therefore, yes to the values and yes to almost all of the Commissionâs proposals.
Thank you to the rapporteurs and thank you for your very committed speeches this evening, which I welcome on behalf of our European society.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0228/2005) by MrÂ Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs,
1. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying value added tax obligations (COM(2004)0728 â C6-0024/2005 â 2004/0261(CNS));
2. on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1798/2003 as regards the introduction of administrative cooperation arrangements in the context of the one-stop scheme and the refund procedure for value added tax (COM(2004)0728 â C6-0025/2005 â 2004/0262(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, first let me express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his objective analysis of the Commission's proposal.
I am pleased to note that his report corresponds fully with the views of the Commission.
Let me say a few words about the Commission's proposal.
In the communication on the VAT strategy presented in 2003, the simplification of tax obligations was identified as one of the key areas for future work.
In particular, a proposal for a directive on this issue was scheduled for 2004.
The objective of simplifying business obligations in the field of VAT is in line with the request made by the European Council of 25 and 26Â March 2004 to identify areas for simplification.
As Mr Becsey rightly says in his report, cross-border businesses need to comply with the tax rules of every Member State in which they undertake their activities.
That implies that such businesses are faced with enormous administrative burdens, which discourage companies â especially small and medium-sized enterprises â from cross-border business.
Those burdens obstruct the smooth functioning of the European single market.
One of the ways of attaining the Lisbon agenda objectives, in particular that of promoting economic growth, is to reduce cross-border administrative burdens and compliance costs in order to facilitate Community-wide activities by businesses.
The Commission's proposal fully meets the objective of reducing such administrative burdens.
The Commission proposes the establishment of an optional one-stop system, whereby taxable persons can fulfil their VAT obligations in the Member State of establishment.
It will harmonise the scope of the goods and services to which Member States may apply restrictions on the right to deduct.
It will extend the use of obligatory reverse-charge mechanisms for certain business-to-business transactions carried out by non-established taxable persons.
Furthermore, it reviews and updates the scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises and simplifies the distance-selling arrangements.
Finally, it will provide for the exchange of information between Member States, which will be facilitated by the electronic system for the exchange of information.
For your information, the proposal has received a positive reaction from the European Economic and Social Committee.
The Committee has acknowledged that, in the current environment, the unanimity rule for decision-making applies; the Commission should opt for a pragmatic approach.
The United Kingdom Presidency has indicated that it will give these proposals a high priority, and discussion on this proposal commenced in the Council during July.
Two more meetings will be devoted to the subject in September.
So far, the Council has concentrated its discussions on a general overview of the Commission's proposal.
I appreciate that the Council's approach has been globally positive.
Â Â  . I am in a fortunate position at the time of the proposal for a one-stop shop scheme for value-added tax returns.
This package of proposals could certainly be a major step towards building a unified internal market.
With the introduction of this scheme â which I hope will be possible in early 2007 â small traders for whom it has not been worthwhile employing or contracting a tax advisor to deal with their value-added tax affairs in other Member States, will be able to file their VAT returns without a tax advisor.
This will allow them to obtain refunds that they have not been able to claim up to now. The lack of such refunds has been damaging their competitiveness and they have suffered a disadvantage compared to larger enterprises.
We know that more than half of the outstanding VAT owed to businesses is not being refunded at present (according to a survey by the Commission).
A positive aspect of the proposal is that everyone will be able to deal with these matters in their own language and with the help of their home authorities, and will be able to receive the VAT owed to them or make VAT payments directly.
As the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs seeks to translate into practice its proposed amendments, electronic administration will speed up registration and the recording of any modification to the data.
Another advantage for businesses is that the deadline for refunding value-added tax can been shortened.
The scheme does not change current practice whereby value-added tax is payable in the country of consumption; in other words it is neutral with regard to different tax rates.
I agree with the Commissionâs approach with regard to launching the introduction of the simplified scheme.
In other words, it does not want to open up debate as regards the fundamental issue of whether VAT should be paid according to the place of origin of the supplier or goods, or according to the place of consumption, as is current practice.
I hope that in the Council the Member States too will be principled enough to forgo tying this positive initiative to such a fundamental philosophical debate.
The other advantage of the proposal is that it opens up a path for progress on a number of issues on the basis of common principles, and this progress will evolve precisely as a result of the one-stop system.
A case in point is the first common list of exclusions from VAT deduction.
This would make any items that are excluded in all Member States â primarily luxury consumption items â subject to common regulations.
It thereby avoids tying the hands of businesses, but does not seek to link the right to deduct VAT in future to the place of establishment â rather than to the place of consumption â thereby also facilitating information-gathering and planning for small businesses and eliminating unnecessary competitive situations.
Another case I would also include here, however, is the possibility it creates to enable easier inspection of an enterpriseâs turnover in the case of distance selling, in other words simplifying distance selling arrangements up to a reasonable threshold set for the whole of the European Union rather than for each Member State.
Up to a threshold of EUR 150 000, businesses would be able to choose whether to pay VAT on the revenue from distance selling in the country of consumption or the country of establishment.
The electronic system â use of which will incidentally be optional for the Member State and the business concerned â will also help us to set a uniform maximum VAT-exemption threshold for small businesses.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also adopted my suggestion to set a minimum VAT-exemption threshold to be applied for the first three years of activity of a newly established business.
By doing so we are providing a sound incentive for new businesses and a stimulus for family employment in line with the Lisbon strategy.
Progress has been made on a number of other issues, too.
First of all, I accept the caution evinced by the Commission in its decision not to review experience with the regime for trade conducted electronically until after 2006; at the same time, it may also review whether this system could be extended to the current one-stop scheme.
It will consider in particular whether to allow businesses also to file VAT returns and make refund applications electronically via the relevant tax office based on the place of establishment.
Another important advance is the proposal to examine how to build a uniform electronic system permitting cooperation among national tax administrations, eliminating abuses and speeding up inspections.
In the interests of legal certainty, the time permitted for the tax administration to ask further questions or request additional information prior to making a refund should be made even shorter, since this would help to enhance businessesâ liquidity.
In order to make the system more business-friendly, I have proposed that the whole of the one-stop scheme and the modifications now being implemented in connection with it should be subject to a thorough review by the Commission four years after its adoption, to analyse experience so far with the scheme and propose any modifications deemed necessary.
I think this would also be a reasonable occasion for the Member States to review the application of a value-added tax payment scheme based on place of origin.
Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues and the experts from the European Commission for their good work and constructive approach.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner KovÃ¡cs, ladies and gentlemen, VAT is the most important indirect tax in the different Member States and also a fundamental element of the European tax system, making a significant contribution to the Unionâs budgets.
The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy requires an improvement of taxation rules to promote growth and employment.
A reduction in administrative burdens can promote the internal market and stimulate business activity, in particular by encouraging the involvement of small and medium-sized businesses and by benefiting consumers.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of simplification, modernisation, uniform application and intensification of the fight against tax fraud.
In order to make progress with these objectives, we believe we should learn from experience and take advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies.
We therefore warmly welcome the Commissionâs proposals on the simplification of crossâborder returns and obligations, the harmonisation of the categories of deductible charges and administrative cooperation within the context of the oneâstop system.
The final outcome of the report by Mr Becsey represents a step in that direction, and is worthy of praise, even though it has been spoilt by the inclusion of an amendment, Amendment 9, which alters the Commissionâs intention to recognise the power of the Member States to grant exemptions for small and mediumâsized businesses whose turnover does not exceed EUR 100Â 000.
We believe that its alternative wording has led to conflict over whether or not it is appropriate or correct, and that has diminished the consensus within the various Groups.
I hope that we can recover our unity on this point as soon as possible, so that we can make sound progress towards the European Unionâs objectives in the very sensitive area dealt with in the Commissionâs proposal.
Â Â  . I would like to express my support of the seemingly very technical document presented and take note of Mr Beckseyâs outstanding work, since it is extremely important to simplify the VAT administration system, not only with a view to promoting business development, but also because this will facilitate the coordination of the public fiscal policy of the Member States, which in turn will enhance mutual understanding and strengthen the role of Europe as a united entity in the international market.
I deeply regret that all these important issues, the previous presentation and others, including one on paediatrics, are being considered so late at night, because the issues addressed here concern everyone.
People are often not aware of these issues, and then we are surprised when they ask what Parliament is doing.
Tax administration will have a positive impact on small and medium-sized businesses, since it will facilitate the expansion of activity beyond national borders.
This is also very important to enterprises in my country, in particular transport companies, that still fail to reach agreements with other countries concerning the timely refund of the VAT.
However, while positively reflecting on the proposals submitted, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to certain other proposals and amendments suggested by Parliament and our group, the Liberal Democrats.
First of all, companies should be allowed to prepare their documents in the language of their home country, since it is difficult to imagine that a small company could prepare documents in 21 languages as we do in Parliament.
Second, it is necessary to help small and medium-sized enterprises to avoid losses in connection with currency fluctuations, since not all States have all currencies, and moreover, the exchange rate may fluctuate during the period while the VAT is being refunded, thus causing significant losses to small and medium-sized enterprises.
In conclusion, I would like to point out that it is very important to ensure that this version of the directive is implemented more efficiently than its previous version, and I ask the Commission to ensure the close monitoring of the implementation of the directive.
Â Â  . Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to thank Mr Becsey for his report and all the speakers for their interventions.
My thanks also go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their contribution to our joint work.
I am delighted that, on the whole, Parliament supports the Commissionâs proposal.
Unfortunately, I am unable to support the amendments that have been tabled.
This is not due to any fundamental reasons of principle, and certainly not because I question the good intentions underlying the proposed amendments.
I am unable to support them simply because in fact they are unjustified and superfluous, since on the one hand they repeat solutions already contained in the proposal, and on the other, they are concerned with pointless details.
In the case of some of the proposed amendments, I am unable to accept them because they refer to periods of time or deadlines that are too long in view of the capabilities of the electronic tax declaration system.
I would particularly like to draw attention to Amendment 9, proposing a minimum VAT exemption threshold of EUR 50Â 000 for small and medium enterprises.
This would be an excessive increase, and would distort competition.
As regards the assumption underlying Amendment 10, that the directive could have adverse budgetary implications for Member States and businesses, it is the Commissionâs opinion that this danger does not exist, since the proposal does not change the regulations on taxation, it merely simplifies them.
I would like to emphasise particularly the importance of ensuring the rapid entry into force of this proposal: as Mr Becsey stated in his report and other speakers, too, have pointed out, this directive would greatly simplify the activities of cross-border businesses, enhance competitiveness, and help to boost growth and create jobs.
In other words, it will help to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
I sincerely hope that the plenary sitting of the European Parliament this week will adopt the Commissionâs proposal.
I am also hopeful that the decision of the European Parliament will have a favourable influence on the Councilâs position.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The best tax systems are those in which the rules are well understood, simple and unchanging.
Taxes that stay the same help businesses to plan for the future with confidence.
Yet we have had a continuous stream of directives and regulations on VAT.
While the current proposals purport to simplify, particularly for small businesses, the main drive has always been rather to harmonise - to prevent so-called 'harmful tax competition', to achieve a uniform minimum rate for VAT, ending derogations such as the zero-rated items we have in the UK.
Ten new member states give harmonisation additional impetus.
Why do we need harmonised VAT rates?
To help the single market?
But we shall never achieve a single VAT rate and since there seems to be little effort to harmonise the much greater differences in rates of excise duty, one has to look for other motives.
I suspect that the ultimate objective sought by the Commission is to have VAT centrally administered and collected, guaranteeing a continuing source of funds for the EU budget not subject to bickering between EU member states.
We should be aware of this possibility and not allow it to occur.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by MrsÂ GrossetÃªte on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 1768/92, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) NoÂ 726/2004 (COM(2004)0599 â C6-0159/2004 â 2004/0217(COD)) (A6-0247/2005).
Â Â  .â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be able to present to you this evening the Commissionâs proposal for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use.
This is a very important proposal, which will improve child health in Europe and spare many families the suffering which the premature death of a child brings.
Over 50% of the medicinal products used on children in the European Union today are neither tested on children nor authorised for paediatric use.
This means that we cannot always be sure that these medicines are effective or safe.
As I understand it, none of us is prepared to take that risk any more.
The Commissionâs proposal tackles this aspect of public health head-on.
It will provide an incentive for high-quality research and bring about the development and authorisation of paediatric medicinal products that will be ofhigh quality, extremely safe and extremely effective.
The proposal not only addresses this important aspect of public health, but also aims to stimulate innovation and competition and contribute towards growth and employment in the European Union.
I should like to extend my thanks and congratulations to MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for her work and the effort she put in to complete this report.
She has made a truly outstanding job of it.
I also wish to thank MrsÂ Toia for drafting the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and all the members of both committees for their support for the proposal.
I should like to proceed directly to the specific point that I know has been the subject of extremely intensive debate in Parliament.
I am talking about the Commissionâs proposal for a fixed six-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate for the products concerned here.
This is one of the most fundamental provisions of our proposal, without which it is of little value.
Let me start by explaining why we have given preference to a fixed over a variable extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.
A fixed extension is simple to use and can be foreseen exactly.
It creates only a small administrative burden, and is compatible with existing patent law.
In contrast, a variable extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate would contravene the principles of patent law and, moreover, would not be conducive to innovation.
A provision to this effect would be highly impracticable, as it would require a precise economic analysis for each medicinal product.
I also doubt whether a variable solution, being based on sales figures, would be fair.
One thing that should be borne in mind in this regard is that sales success is not an indication of the innovativeness of a medicinal product; nor of the outlay on research.
I should like to make it clear that the Commission is very determined about this, and I do not believe that the Commission sees any prospect of compromise in this regard.
Secondly, I should like to explain the Commissionâs reasons for proposing a six-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.
Based on our impact assessment, which was very thorough, we believe that this period strikes a balance between the aims of the proposal on the one hand, and the costs and benefits to public health, industry and public health service finances on the other.
The Commission can support in principle the amendment advocating a review of the regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use, in order to enable a proper assessment of its impact, particularly the financial impact of bonuses and incentives.
We must ensure that any review carried out also takes into account the desired benefits to public health of this regulation.
Finally, the financial impact of the regulation should not be assessed until such time as sufficient data are available.
Understandably, I have not been able to discuss every single amendment, but the Commissionâs position on all of the amendments has been communicated to Parliamentâs services(1).
The proposal for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use is important from the points of view of child health, innovation and competitiveness.
I have no doubt that todayâs debate will show that we are on the right track here.
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise most strongly that the issue here is the health and welfare of children for whom no help was previously available.
This is far more important than the interests of any pharmaceutical-industry lobby group.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been waiting for this moment for a long time, because our Parliament has been calling for this specific European regulation on paediatric medicinal products for many years.
Commissioner, you explained it very well: it seems inconceivable that, today, our children cannot get treatment adapted to their needs.
It is, however, a reality.
In 2005, a large number of the medicinal products administered to children were not specifically developed for paediatric use.
In many cases, the products used for the very young are the same as those prescribed to adults, the only difference being that the doses are smaller.
However, children do not have the same metabolism as adults.
Children therefore need specifically adapted pharmaceutical forms, not only so that they are better tolerated, but also so that they are safer and more effective.
That is the aim of this regulation and I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have participated in the work.
My report presents some considerable advances, which have the approval of a large number of Members.
They aim in particular to improve the readability of the actions of the Paediatric Committee, which will be set up within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, to avoid additional clinical trials being performed on children when they are not necessary, to promote the transparency of the instruments, to reduce administrative delays, to strengthen pharmacovigilance, to introduce an obligation to perform paediatric research for any new medicinal product intended for adults, without this system delaying the placing on the market of innovative medicinal products, to call on the Paediatric Committee to draw up an inventory of therapeutic needs of children, and finally, to create a European research fund intended to finance research on medicines which are not patent-protected but which could be of great benefit to children.
However, the main point in this text is still that connected with the incentive.
I have put a great deal of work into this issue.
I have listened carefully and, having debated it with you all, I think that the proposal for a fixed incentive, namely a six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate, is the best possible solution.
This period is the fairest and most pragmatic that we could come up with.
I definitely say six months, not five months.
The US has set up a recognised system with a period of six months.
Why should Europe not do the same?
I must admit that I do not really understand the amendment proposed by MrÂ Maaten.
MrÂ Maaten, we are always asking the European Parliament to look for better solutions by means of benchmarking.
Indeed, the United States have a good system in this regard; since they have had this regulation, around 100 paediatric medicinal products have become available to American children.
Why should we be unable to provide the same support for pharmaceutical research in Europe?
I have the impression that we are forever haggling, and I find it regrettable, because what is at stake here is public health for children.
I think it is a shame, MrÂ Maaten, that we could not agree on this period of six months.
Research is, by definition, risky and if the European Union wants, as you all hope, to develop this strategic sector, we cannot create a watered-down system or institute vague measures.
Some of my fellow Members have drawn up a proposal based on proportional rewards.
However, this system imposes too many restrictions.
I have asked my fellow Members some important questions, questions relating to public health.
I am still waiting for the responses of those who advocate this proportionality.
Moreover, while waiting for information that never comes from the authors of these amendments, I have been wondering about the reasons for this long silence.
It is a question of saving childrenâs lives and not of balancing the books.
Proportionality, however, balances the âlives savedâ column against the âsales volumeâ column.
Under the proportional system, three months plus three months, or four plus four, the second part would be granted depending on whether or not a particular sales volume or turnover had been achieved.
In my view, the danger of this system is this: we would be moving from a health-based system to a market-based system.
Why?
There is no Europe-wide price for medicinal products.
Each Member State sets its own price and, as we know, they vary considerably.
With the turnover-based system, laboratories will get out their calculators and choose a country depending on the prices set and not depending on health needs.
Moreover, who will be able to verify the sales figures?
Some Members have suggested using an independent audit, but without specifying what procedures should apply.
They have not assessed the costs, or the additional delays that this bureaucratic procedure would bring, or the possible remedies in case of dispute.
The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products itself has told us that this system is unrealistic, because it does not have the resources.
What, then, is the benefit of this proposal?
Ladies and gentlemen, the proportional system is not good, and it is not applicable.
The system I am proposing is also not based on the medicine itself but on studies conducted under the authority of the Paediatric Committee.
I would ask you to take a close look at this condition.
With regard to the impact of this measure on the public health budgets of our countries, a study presented to the Council concludes that, with a fixed six-month period, the increase in health spending would be infinitesimal, between 0.7 and 1%.
Finally, I wanted to include in the amendments a review clause for the incentive.
In six yearsâ time, the Commission will have to assess the situation, indicating the precise conditions under which the six-month extension has been granted, with what costs and what benefits.
With this text, we have the opportunity to move from words to actions.
We must stop always being philosophical and be more pragmatic instead.
Let us make no mistake.
If we do not set up a stable framework to promote research in Europe, it will favour the industry in the US and Asia.
This would therefore be a real absurdity in terms of politics, science and health.
What is Europe good for?
This regulation can show our fellow citizens just how useful it is.
This matter, which affects everyone, can only be regulated at Community level.
No Member State on its own can support the research policy with regard to the pharmaceutical industry.
Your vote will be decisive.
If we say âyesâ to a fixed incentive of six months, our children will soon benefit, thanks to the European Union, from appropriate, safe medicinal products.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the infants and children of Europe need and are entitled to benefit from special medicines, that is, medicines that are expressly designed and made for this type of patient.
From this point of view, we are all aware that the current situation in Europe is testimony to a very inferior level of development.
This positive and important regulation thus needs to be adopted urgently.
It is based on certain vital points, which I will go over briefly.
The creation of the Paediatric Committee is of great importance, as is its composition: it must be made up of high-level, authoritative and independent figures, in view of the extremely delicate tasks for which they will be responsible.
They will have to assess the paediatric investigation plans, approve them and evaluate their results.
The Paediatric Committee will have to create a databank, a network of skills, to be able to avoid â and this is absolutely necessary â duplications of these experiments, and to achieve a position where consideration can be given to the ethical and human aspects necessitated by experiments on such a fragile group of people as sick children and their families.
Another vital point is the incentives/responsibility, incentives/prescriptions mechanism.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for which I am the draftsman, has as you know approved a proposal for a proportional system.
I would therefore like to call on Mrs GrossetÃªte and the other Members who are in favour of different solutions not to demonise our proposal but to try to understand that each of us, representing only ourselves and our own ideas, has put forward what we each believe to be the most appropriate solution for paediatric medicines, and thus child health.
A proportional solution, which could be extended past the six months, might also help those medicines that are very expensive because of the research involved and that have a small market to have a longer extension.
In any case, regardless of the position that this Parliament adopts, I ask the Commissioner to agree with this proposal, by giving a positive opinion to enable an assessment mechanism to be created which, after a certain period, will enable us to understand what the best proposal is in the light of the facts.
This is the most important point, because our children, the children of Europe, have the right to see their needs and their requirements met.
Â Â  . Mr President, 20% of our citizens are under 19 years of age; in other words, 100 million of our fellow European citizens are children.
That is who we are talking about today.
We are talking about half the medicines we provide to help them through their young lives not being properly researched, tested or authorised.
We have what I call 'the half-an-aspirin syndrome': you give a child half the dose you would give an adult, because you think it ought to have less than the full dose.
That may do no harm, it may do no good or it may even harm the child, because it may not be correct for it to have the dose at all, or it should have more or less than that.
Therefore I very much welcome both the Commission's proposal and the rapporteur's report.
The key is how we provide incentives to research.
That is what we want and what our children need.
We have to maintain a balance between the need for more research and the need to keep costs under control.
The rapporteur has mentioned the example of the United States.
Since the system was introduced there in the 1990s, over one hundred new children-specific medicines have come on stream.
We want to catch up with that.
The debate we have had, and perhaps are still having, centres on the patent extension.
Some wanted a variable number of months; some wanted a longer period, others a shorter period.
The Commission proposed six months; the Council â or 22 Member States in the Council â proposed six months; the rapporteur proposed six months; the committee agreed six months.
It must be said that six months is right: it is simple and is a single extension.
I am also concerned that we avoid double extensions and double claims.
Therefore, the aim of my amendment to Article 36 was to make clear that we should not have double rewards for the same paediatric formulation.
We need to ensure that it is correctly worded.
That is something that the Council and the Commission will now be able to look at.
However, when I hear, on the one side, companies saying that it is going too far and, on the other side, generics saying that it is not going far enough, perhaps we have got it right.
We welcome the MICE.
We do not often welcome MICE into this Chamber, but the MICE â the fund for paediatric medicine research â is very much to be welcomed.
The report as a whole and the Commission's proposal are good and will help the two million children who have health problems now and could be helped through this measure in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, although the success of this legislation has been mentioned, it is something that should be emphasised again and again.
I shall tell you in a minute why I find the pedantry, and sometimes even the simplicity, of this debate distasteful.
We have tabled amendments in committee â I have even tabled them myself â stating the need for this legislation to enter into force more quickly, the reason being that we have waited so long for it, on behalf of the children in the European Union.
In addition â and this I say for Mrs Toiaâs benefit â the role of the Paediatric Committee, which is to be set up in accordance with the legislation, must be enhanced.
We have an interest in a strong Paediatric Committee, and what is more one which takes the lead.
I agree with MrÂ Bowis, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and all the others who have said that we need the MICE research programme, another EU initiative.
This must be given a proper basis in law, and the proper place for it is in the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
I would ask CommissionerÂ Verheugen to urge the Commission that scope and funding be made available for this within the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
I have said that this is a great success, and so I regret that this success is not being given due emphasis in this debate.
I find it cheap, pitiful and even shameful that this debate has focused almost exclusively on the extension of patent protection.
It is interesting that there has been no discussion of the ten-year extension of data protection for medicinal products whose patent protection has expired: âPUMAâ, as it is known.
We should ask ourselves why this is not being discussed: because it creates a level playing field, as it were, between generic medicinal products and pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research.
Not a single word has been spoken about it: despite going much further â ten-year data protection â it evidently enjoys widespread approval.
Yet a dispute of which I have seldom seen the like in this House has developed about a six-month period to be given to those pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research who still have a patent, or are applying for one.
I would ask all of those who have a fixed opinion on this whether they have spoken to patientsâ representatives; I have.
I have also spoken to parents with sick children.
They could not understand it.
They could not understand this discussion, some of which they followed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
They were just saying, âWe want these medicines for our childrenâ.
If what CommissionerÂ Verheugen said does happen, and there is an incentive to procure more medicinal products more quickly, it will be marvellous; it will be exactly what we want.
We do not care whether someone earns half a million more or less in the process.
There should be considerable benefits to research, and children should also stand to gain.
That is what patientsâ and parentsâ representatives are saying.
I am a relatively long-standing Member of this House, and do not want to see it split into two, with the countries and representatives of countries which have no research-oriented pharmaceutical industry but only a generics industry objecting that six months is too long, and others saying the opposite.
Our sole concern should be doing what is best for patients, which is what the Commission is proposing.
The majority of my group will be supporting that, and so shall I.
Â Â  . Mr President, that this regulation is of paramount importance to the consumer goes without saying.
It is also a good example of what Europe can mean to the citizen, exactly at a time when many citizens appear to be in doubt about this, and deserves all our support for that reason.
The regulation is so important because at present, children are all too often prescribed medicines that have not been developed for children or tested on them, and so the positive or negative effects that the use of these medicines may have on a child are often not known, with all the consequences that this entails.
It is therefore vital that more should be invested in the development of medicines that are specifically tailored to children.
The proposal is right to try to promote the development of sound and safe childrenâs medicines by requiring producers of medicines, whenever they apply for a license to market one, to examine its suitability for children.
Another good example that has been mentioned before is the creation of a childrenâs medicine committee that will be responsible for the assessment and approval of plans for paediatric research.
Similarly, the rapporteurâs proposal in connection with the investigation programme for paediatric research, MICE, for funding research into the paediatric use of medicines that are not protected by a patent or additional protection certificate, will considerably stimulate the production of childrenâs medicines.
I also believe in general that investments are needed, particularly in innovation, more so than in patent protection, the subject we are debating today.
Research involving children should, of course, be done with due care.
Double trials must be avoided and all kinds of measures must be taken to prevent them being carried out.
I am also delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has already approved a number of amendments to that effect.
I agree with anyone who says that it is regrettable that in this discussion, we have apparently lost sight of the importance of the child amid the discussions that focus on who in the industry should reap most benefits.
In fact, I think that both sides are guilty of this and it is extremely frustrating indeed.
In principle, I think that such a patent extension should be as short as possible, for in the final analysis, it is the user, or the citizen, who picks up the tab.
It is their money we are carving up.
A patent is a temporary monopoly that is granted to promote innovation, but in this proposal, research is a requirement and the patent a way of recovering costs, and that is what sets us apart from the United States.
I would therefore be tempted to move the spotlight away from patent protection.
We have decided in favour of five months while the rapporteur made a passionate plea for six.
I myself have changed my mind, first from a flexible period to four months, and I have now proposed five months.
Your plea has therefore not been an entire waste.
I do fear, though, that we have not really moved any closer to each other, although I value the rapporteurâs work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we welcome this regulation.
The fact that over 50% of the medicinal products used in Europe to treat children are neither tested on children nor authorised for paediatric use is preposterous and no longer acceptable.
Why has the pharmaceutical industry, which is, after all, always preaching personal responsibility, not seen fit in the past to conduct these very studies itself?
This is an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry: it is out to make a killing, a huge profit.
That is why I think it appropriate that we should be honest about, and make no bones about, the fact that this debate in this House is about how this regulation must not be allowed to become the means whereby the few help themselves to the profits they are interested in.
We must also, then, seek to lay down very clear conditions.
We are not just talking of a couple of million euros here, but of sums into the millions and billions.
I agree with those Members who say that patents need to be protected for a shorter period of time.
We have re-tabled an amendment to extend patent protection to just four months, and I should once more like to ask all my fellow Members to support this amendment.
We need, however, to make the conditions even clearer.
These medicinal products must have a therapeutic benefit.
After all, it is senseless to knowingly allow children to be made guinea pigs in tests in the absence of any therapeutic benefit: this is unacceptable.
The clear aim must be for rewards to be reserved exclusively for those whose clinical trials have been successful.
Only if we really act together on this can we truly speak of a success.
We should not, however, allow this to give rise to an industry wish list; the focus must be on the interests of the children.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs GrossetÃªte for her work.
We needed to establish the tasks of the Paediatric Committee more clearly, clarify the system and ensure monitoring of paediatric investigation plans, while at the same time giving the committee the important job of identifying special needs in the paediatric sector.
At the same time, however, the various administrative deadlines and timetables needed to be reduced and clarified.
It is important in my opinion â and I happen to be a doctor â that the six-month extension to which producers of medicinal products for paediatric use are entitled should be reduced, given that their products are already protected by pharmaceutical patents.
Any such reward is out of proportion if we take account of the huge profits which companies make from this exclusivity, given that no one else can manufacture the medicinal product.
Most importantly, consumers and, by extension, the state are forced to pay heavily for the brand until others are allowed to sell the medicinal product.
Mrs Behrendt said earlier, what if we were to ask the patients, the babies, what if we were to ask the parents?
I want to ask Mrs Behrendt if she has asked a mother or father who have children and who do not have the money to buy the medicinal product.
That too is something we need to bear in mind.
We shall support the reduction in the time to three plus three months; I should also like to add that there must be no abuse â and I agree with John Bowis â of the new system of rewards by repeating previous rewards.
The legislation must clearly state that the new additional protection, which compensates for paediatric trials, will not be granted again through any other system for protecting the market from competition.
Amendment 75 aims to clarify this and I call on you to vote for it.
The objective of the report by the European Parliament must be to establish real dialogue between the interested parties.
To close, I should like to protest about the time at which this very important subject was tabled for debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report.
I can also support the majority of the amendments that have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Even so, I voted against the amended report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, because I was disappointed that the duration of the patent extension had not been amended.
It will be plain to everyone that for many medicines, a six-month extension is not necessary.
The extra costs involved in research that is necessary to obtain approval for paediatric use are relatively low, but that is not the case for all medicines.
For some drugs with a low turnover, the six-month extension may prove necessary after all in order to recoup the costs.
That is also the thrust of the amendments tabled by our group.
We would like to see a three-month extension put in place by way of standard, and provide for an additional three-month extension for those medicines where this proves too short.
That is fair on everyone and cost-saving for national health systems.
It would be irresponsible on our part to apply the six-month extension to all products.
After all, health insurance is expensive enough as it is.
I would therefore call on everyoneâs support for Amendment 89 tabled by Mrs Breyer, Mrs McAvan and Mrs Corbey or Amendments 91 to 93 tabled by my group.
Â Â  Like my forespeakers, IÂ would like to thank rapporteur Mrs GrossetÃªte for her work on this important document.
Its aim is to improve the current state of affairs, which is untenable from the medical point of view and, from the ethical point of view, it is unfair to children, to say the least.
IÂ believe that it does not require medical education to understand that a child is not just aÂ miniature adult.
Children are individuals whose metabolism is very different from that of adults.
It is not possible to simply reduce the dose of medication needed to treat aÂ child proportionately to its weight.
For, we know that medications often have side effects that are well tolerated by adults, while they may lead to serious health complications in aÂ child.
I realise that it has not been easy to acknowledge the medical viewpoint, requirements and recommendations of the physicians while at the same time respecting the often legitimate claims and demands of the pharmaceuticals industry.
But, what bothers me more, is that the discussion about this directive in Parliament concentrated on whether patent protection should last six months, three plus three or four plus two.
From the aspect of priorities, this fact is not important or decisive.
What is important and urgent is that children get the final product â aÂ medication developed with due account of and respect for the distinctive status, that of a child.
Our ultimate aim is aÂ healthy child.
If, as aÂ by-product, we have aÂ happy pharmaceutical company, then we have achieved what we have intended and had to do.
Â Â  Today we have the opportunity and the responsibility to decide about the health of our children.
In this discussion we should be focusing on the medical considerations, and not allow ourselves to be influenced solely by financial considerations: who will profit or who will lose.
As aÂ doctor IÂ am in favour of and strongly support the view that research into paediatric medicines must always be compulsory, safe, highly professional and subject to constant checks, if for nothing else, because there is still a shortage of medicines for children, and because the development of new substances must go ahead.
We should also realise that the development of medicines for children should not be based on the premise â already mentioned several times before â that aÂ child is just aÂ reduced version of an adult.
Children have their own specific characteristics, completely different metabolism, and different susceptibility to medicines, as Dr BelohorskÃ¡ said just before me.
The European Union must set out binding regulations for all Member States that will not harm the health of children, but that will ensure the availability of high-quality childrenâs medicines within optimum timescales.
Also for this reason the debate in our committee took account of the widest variety of viewpoints of major stakeholders and their professional arguments, and I therefore propose, with full support of my political group, that the incentives for manufacturers take into consideration the costs borne by the manufacturer in developing the drugs, and that at least aÂ minimum period of time be set during which the newly developed medicine may not be manufactured by generic companies.
Responsibility teaches us to check, after six years, the effectiveness of the measures taken and, if necessary, to adapt the established parameters accordingly.
In finishing, Mr President, IÂ would like to voice my support for rapporteur FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªteâs idea to set up the MICE (Medicines Investigation for the Children of Europe) agency.
In this way we will be able to ensure that all children in the European Union will have the same access to first-class medicines, and I call upon you to take that responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been wanting and waiting for this text on which we are going to vote for a long time, and we are all very happy to know that it will soon enable our children to be better cared for.
Nevertheless, we must be demanding.
Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to improve this proposal for a regulation so that it best serves the interests of children and public health, and we will improve it by adopting those amendments focussing on research into and the placing on the market of medicinal products with the greatest added value, providing a real therapeutic benefit; indeed, how can we achieve the objective of limiting clinical trials on children without limiting the number of medicinal products placed on the market?
If the criterion of the medicinal productâs added value were taken into consideration, this would avoid many unnecessary studies in children.
We will also be able to improve the text tomorrow by adopting the amendments that propose greater transparency for pharmacovigilance data and their accessibility to the public.
The financial issue is also important for the stability of our social security systems and the guarantee of access to healthcare for all.
It is increasingly important when it comes to finding the right financial incentive so that the pharmaceutical industries take a greater interest in paediatric medicinal products.
It is important for all European citizens, because it is public money that indirectly finances these financial incentives in the form of the extension of market exclusivity.
That is why, in view of the results of the impact assessments, in view of the enormous gaps ranging from EURÂ 1 to 4Â million, it seems to me that we should at least be able to suggest to the industry a two-stage system: a fixed three-month incentive and a three-month extension depending on the level of benefit provided by the medicinal product sold.
All of us here want the best for our children, as soon as possible, but we must not be hypocritical.
Those who are talking about urgency were not willing to support the proposal to reduce the gap between marketing authorisation and placing on the market, which is currently two years.
That is why we will have other meetings and we will really see what we can do for the health of European children.
Â Â  I believe we need to establish a system of appropriate rewards for the holders of patents on medicines who have to carry out compulsory clinical trials for the use of such medicines in paediatrics.
However we must take steps to prevent the accumulation of rewards under this regulation and other areas of European legislation.
A large part of the debate has revolved around questions that have already been superseded by the establishment of a sensitive balance between the producers of original and generic medicines in the recent revision of European pharmaceutical legislation, questions such as âWho will get more?â and the like.
When we also take national health budgets into account the picture changes.
The entry of producers of generic medicines into the market increases competition, reduces the cost of drugs and reduces the strain on health budgets.
If such a goal is to be reached and the producers of original medical products are to be reimbursed for the true additional costs they incur as a result of clinical trials, it makes sense for European legislation to be based on verified information regarding these costs.
The unjustified short-term extension of the market monopoly on drugs produces large profits and places unjustifiable new burdens on health resources.
Â Â  MrÂ President, children must have safe medicines, adapted to their needs.
That is an obvious requirement of legislation.
With a patent extension as long as six months, we are, however, paying an unnecessarily high price for having the pharmaceutical companies fulfil obvious requirements.
The pharmaceutical companies already have multiannual protection and EURÂ 100Â billion in their coffers for purchases.
They can tolerate a 1% increase in costs much better than already depleted public budgets.
We must not transfer even more money to these companies.
In doing so, we should finally end up with safe medicines for both children and adults, but with no one able to afford them.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have put forward a compromise amendment involving a maximum of four months, with the further limitations described by MrsÂ Breyer.
If this is unacceptable, Parliament will show that it is more attentive to the pharmaceutical companiesâ lobbyists than to the needs of children.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by previous speakers, who said that the draft regulation that has been submitted to the House is not only of great significance, but also urgently needed, and that it should provide the greatest possible benefits to the youngest citizens of the European Union.
As a doctor, I believe that the draftâs most important feature is its attempt to afford greater protection to child patients, in view of the fact that they constitute a particularly vulnerable group of patients.
Further welcome developments include backing for information on medicines being as widely available as possible, as well as provisions guaranteeing greater protection for child patients in clinical research.
Similarly, I am delighted that the MICE programme has been set up for independent research into certain medicines.
Turning to the paragraph in Article 36 that has provoked such debate, it is my opinion that a three-month extension of patent protection is adequate for the time being.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this dossier, which has been far from easy.
It is my firm belief that there will be a positive outcome to the vote on this draft regulation, which will bring benefits in social, health and also ethical terms.
Â Â  Mr President, we are about to vote on a report on regulations on paediatric medicines.
The provisions of this report are based on the obvious truth that children are not mini-adults and they must have medicines tailored and tested specifically for their use.
There is another, less obvious, truth that underlies this report that I feel I must state in this debate.
This truth is that an alarming number of children are sick and the number suffering from chronic, acute and fatal diseases is on the increase.
As the scourge of contagious diseases among children in the West has been largely contained, all other types of illness are increasing, some to epidemic levels.
In my country, it seems that every other child is ill.
How many children have inhalers, or have to avoid certain foods or pets because of allergies?
Education budgets are straining with the increase in learning, behaviour and communication disorders.
Eczema, disabling autism, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy and arthritis are all increasing, as well as life-threatening leukaemia and tumours â the list goes on and on.
Why have children become such a profitable market place for medicines that powerful lobbies should find it worth their while to fight for a few months here and there over extended patents?
In the West, we should have the healthiest children in the history of the world.
We have the affluence, we have good sanitation, the wherewithal for proper â even superior â nutrition.
Our children should be thriving; they are not.
What are we doing to children?
We need to do some serious soul-searching and serious research, not just into drugs and that kind of profitable research, but into children's growth and immune system development, and identify the new factors in our environment, in our food, our birthing and child-rearing practices, in our medical practices and in our lifestyles, and find the culprits that are sickening and even killing our children.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, this draft paediatric regulation is a welcome development for all of us.
It is an expression of our concern about the health of children in Europe, and also, in the long term, of children in non-European countries.
Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the negative financial impact of the regulation will be greater for some countries than for others.
As former Commissioner for Enlargement, MrÂ Verheugen is probably better acquainted than anyone with the major financial problems facing the health service sector in Poland.
Unduly long periods of protection for patents and registration data would have particularly harsh consequences for less wealthy countries whose market economies, which act as a guarantee of normal economic conditions, have only been in place for a short time.
We should take joint action to ensure that the pharmaceutical sector does not earn excessive amounts at the expense of the public in the Member States, since this sector has in any case no cause for complaint about profits.
I am opposed to the pharmaceutical sector receiving anything other than minimal rewards, and I am in favour of opportunities being made available as rapidly as possible for the production of generic medicines.
As MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt concluded, however, the quality of childrenâs health care is more important than the amount of money saved.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs GrossetÃªte, for her enthusiasm and perseverance with which she has fought for the health of all children in the European Union is certainly in order.
At long last, research and development of childrenâs medicines are given the attention they deserve.
Enterprises can, and should, be rewarded for investing in research of this kind, only incentives of this kind will ensure that they continue to invest in new medicines for children.
Moreover, we should not overlook the fact that they employ thousands of people in the process.
A fixed six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is preferable for all kinds of reasons, but transparency and sound agreements are key words in this respect.
We must consider the potential implications of a patent extension for all children in the world.
In Belgium, for example, it was Dr Janssens who made Sporanox, his antifungal, available to the developing countries, but now that Janssens Farmaceutica has been taken over, it will be interesting to see whether the new owners will adopt the same line.
In addition to attention to research, it goes without saying that the government must also continue to guarantee accessibility to medicines.
Let me give you an example: in Belgium, the manufacturer of Rilatin independently increased the price of a box of tablets from EUR 2.60 to EUR 6.52, the level of the European guide price.
The increase for parents of children with ADHD is prohibitive, certainly if you consider that there are children who need a few boxes a day.
The pharmaceutical industry can, and must, therefore be stimulated in the area of research, but should, at the same time, consider the people who have to pay for those medicines.
I have just one more question for the Commissioner.
Apparently, products not covered by a supplementary protection certificate, including certain AIDS medicines, do not qualify for an extension if research is carried out during the period of patent protection.
Can the Commissioner confirm this, and if so, is it possible for this clause to be changed at this stage?
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the regulation on paediatric medicines is necessary for everyone, and in particular for children, or in other words the youngest citizens of the European Union.
Its aim is to ensure better medicines at reasonable prices that every mother can afford.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this regulation, which will allow us to send a positive message to our voters.
It will demonstrate that Parliament supports the development of paediatric medicines, and that we attach a great deal of importance to the treatment our children receive and to their health.
Although we made a number of mistakes when drawing up this draft regulation, fortunately we still have a chance to rectify these mistakes during tomorrowâs vote.
Firstly I wish to express my opposition to what are termed double rewards, that is to say, the granting of financial assistance twice to the same investigations or investments.
Secondly, I believe that it is a mistake to waive the requirement for a paediatric medicine to be registered in all Member States before additional patent protection may be obtained.
Paediatric medicines should be registered and available in all Member States, and not merely in a few.
I cannot consent to certain EU citizens being deprived of the chance to receive treatment using new and improved medicines, and I find it intolerable that companies producing such medicines should be rewarded regardless.
This is unfair in social terms, unjustified in legal terms and contrary to the principle of equality.
It should not be tolerated by Parliament.
Thirdly, I have serious doubts regarding the proposal to extend patent protection for paediatric medicines, as every new medicine is in any case protected by a patent, regardless of whether it is used to treat children, women or elderly people.
There can be no doubt that extending patent protection would limit access to the market for generic medicines.
We should not consent to this.
Every mother would pay any price to protect the health of her child, but the question I would ask is why mothers should pay more, given that Parliament could adopt amendments that make it possible for them to pay only as much as is necessary.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been a shameful stigma on our 21st century civilisation that, to this day, many of the medicines we use to treat our children are untested for paediatric use and that a large number of medicines that could be of lifesaving benefit to children are not used because they never underwent paediatric testing.
In a world in which it seems, perhaps, inevitable that economic profit is, to a great extent, the cornerstone of our existence, the Commission has finally brought before us a remedial proposal based mainly on financial terms and mores.
The pharmaceutical companies will now have to measure a child's ill-health on financial balance sheets and proceed with paediatric drug development only if it is profitable.
I do not necessarily blame them: they produce medicines to make money and if they do not make money they will not be able to produce medicines.
This is unfortunately the harsh reality and those of us with more romantic aspirational fantasies will just have to accept it.
This piece of legislation, despite its ideological shortcomings, will help develop more and safer drugs for children.
It is therefore an important step forward and deserves our full support, although its application will have to be monitored closely, especially with regard to the proper ethical scrutiny of paediatric clinical trials.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this regulation represents an important advance: today the majority of European minors take medicines whose effectiveness and safety has not been documented in children and adolescents, who are therefore exposed to greater risks than adults are.
However, the implementation of the regulation will depend on the activities and responsibilities of the scientific committee which, while working within the EMEA, must retain its independence from the pharmaceutical industry in the interests of children.
The proposed control activities of this committee should be made public, to enable all citizens to be aware and informed of what it is doing to improve their health.
The implementation of the register of clinical and pharmacological experiments involving children and the creation of a European paediatric form, to be regularly updated, will also be important.
In addition, in order to set up the MICE programme, envisaged by the regulation, it will be necessary to clarify the financing methods and how they interact with the EUâs framework programmes.
The prolongation of a patent by six months is yet another gift to the pharmaceutical multinationals, in total disregard of the health of children and running counter to the objectives of this very regulation.
The pharmaceutical industry is the industrial sector that in recent years has distributed the highest dividends to its shareholders, and it certainly has no need of even greater profits!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the need for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use.
I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, for her deeply committed speech, and also for her fair discussion of the matter.
Of course, by the end of the debate it is difficult to introduce new points of view, so I should just like to make my point symbolically.
120Â secondsâ speaking time in this House is very little in view of the significance of this milestone in European pharmaceutical legislation; but a great deal â as I know from many yearsâ personal experience as a chief emergency physician â when it comes to saving childrenâs lives.
We can also see this 120Â seconds as a symbol that it is time for Europe to at last roll out an appropriate regulation for paediatric medicinal products.
I should very much like to see a consensus at first reading, so that our European community can be restored to a respectable competitive position on the important international market in pharmaceutical research and manufacture.
I support the proposal for a uniform extension of patent protection.
MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, and now CommissionerÂ Verheugen as well, have convinced me that this is the right, simple, and practicable way to go.
We have included a revision clause entitling us to make improvements for the eventuality that the profits are as exorbitant as we suspect they will be.
We have to take great care when discussing this issue, as it concerns children â the most precious things we have â and human lives, on the one hand, and economic interests on the other.
These two things cannot be weighed against each other.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is an uncontested fact that public health is one of the most valuable social commodities.
After congratulating my honourable friend, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, I should like to draw the House's attention not only to the basic outlines, but also to the details relating to public health, access to quality services and the creation of reliable control mechanisms.
Special attention needs to be given to the question of the production, testing and marketing of medicinal products, mainly due to the obvious need for greater transparency, given that direct and indirect financial interests attach to the production and marketing of these products and a whole set of medical practices and actions depend, either at research level or at application level, on their use.
We need with this report to safeguard the important right of child patients to protection both from the needless administration of medicinal products and from their subjection to treatment or research protocols of unknown value and efficacy.
Medical and paediatric research programmes, licensing requirements for medicines and post-marketing studies must become beneficial means, both for patients and for medical and pharmaceutical research centres, so that we can safeguard maximum possible medical efficiency.
Creating a strong system of risk management, creating a list which will be given to all health agencies, companies and workers involved and providing the facility for informing patients about the treatment protocol to which they are to submit and its anticipated therapeutic value constitute, in conjunction with the foregoing, a strong system of protection and improvement.
There are no scales for weighing the health of children against financial interests.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like, in my turn, to thank MrsÂ GrossetÃªte for having adopted the same philosophy as was applied to rare diseases: mobilisation against the injustice suffered by some patients, in this case children.
Recently, the Belgian paediatric association rang the alarm bell: 50% of medicinal products prescribed to children and almost 90% of those used in intensive care are not approved for paediatric use.
Clearly, this regulation is urgently needed: research and development are expensive and we must support the efforts that will be required of the pharmaceutical firms, and thus also support the fixed period of six months during which they will not be subject to competition from the sector.
At the same time, we must promote lower-cost paediatric research, the clause regarding review in six years, the MICE programme for paediatric research and, as is vital when children are involved, measures aimed at avoiding the unnecessary duplication of studies that meet this requirement.
It is this delicate balance that we need to maintain in our vote tomorrow, a balance that meets the expectations of paediatricians, families and the millions of young patients in Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, for her excellent work.
I do think, though, that the Commission deserves criticism for being so tardy in presenting this proposal on medicinal products for paediatric use; after all, 100Â million children in the EU are affected.
That being the case, coordinated European action is not only important but indispensable.
Why is that?
Three problem areas can be identified.
The first is that the national markets for paediatric medicinal products are much too small to be of interest to pharmaceutical companies; only the Community market is large enough to be significant.
Secondly, clinical trials on children should and must be avoided as far as possible.
Where they are absolutely necessary, they must comply with the strict conditions of the Clinical Trials Directive.
This makes it all the more necessary to make all test results centrally accessible, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of trials.
Thirdly, the compulsory investigation of the potential effects of medicinal products on children which is provided for under the proposal must not impede the development of new medicinal products for adults.
It follows that the Paediatric Committee, which is envisaged as forming part of the EMEA in London, has to assume the important role of resolving these issues quickly for the whole of the EU.
The committee should, of course, also be better placed to judge the need for medicines and studies when assessing draft paediatric investigation plans, exemptions and deferrals; and provide healthcare professionals and patients with a reliable source of information.
This is the only way of better managing the organisation of the ethical and financial problems which paediatric medicinal products present.
We need to create a harmonised, functional European market in this field, so that we are finally able to give our children the medicines that they deserve, namely the best.
Â Â  Mr President, it is really important that children should be prescribed the right medicines in the correct dosage and in the right form.
The Commissionâs proposal is of major significance to children, parents and industry alike.
Pharmaceutical companies must be given reasonable compensation for the research they carry out into paediatric medicines.
As far as I am concerned, this compensation could even be generous, but a six-month extension of the patent protection is in many cases extremely big-hearted.
According to a well-known British innovative company, research into paediatric indications generally costs some EUR 8 million.
The returns of a six-month patent extension are a multiple of this, some EUR 200 to 300 million, and sums in excess of this have been mentioned for blockbusters.
I would therefore call for proportionality: three months, but with the possibility of adding another three months if the turnover is below EURÂ 100 million.
Three plus three also adds up to six, but only for companies that really need it.
Along with Mrs McAvan, I tabled these amendments that have been signed by 44 Members from Belgium, Estonia, France, Portugal, Greece Poland, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
In our view, the reward should be proportionate to the costs incurred.
That is a very simple and fundamental principle.
It would be unseemly to rake in enormous profits on the back of sick children.
It is always good to remind ourselves of who ends up paying for this: the people taking the medicines and the insured.
The cost of health insurance is rising; medicines account for some 10% of total public health outgoings.
The price of medicines need not become unnecessarily expensive.
The money would be better spent on care than on nice little extras for the industry.
Of course the pharmaceutical industry will lobby very energetically in favour of six months.
Anything else, they say, would be bureaucratic and complex, but there is nothing bureaucratic about providing turnover figures that are already known anyway.
Looking at the pharmaceutical industry, I can see major problems ahead.
There is too little in the way of innovation in Europe.
That innovation does not come about by handing out extras to the pharmaceutical companies.
Quite the reverse: real innovation is possible if we insist on added therapeutic value, and that is why I back the amendments tabled by Mrs Ferreira and the Group of the Greens.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the regulation on the safety of medicinal products for paediatric use is a necessary and sensible alternative that puts an end to a long period of uncertainty surrounding medicinal products in the paediatric sector.
The Commissionâs proposal was well-balanced and was based on impact assessments.
A six-month extension of patent protection as an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers is reasonable.
This period is based on the results of the impact study and is a clear, fair basis for calculation for all manufacturers.
I am pleased that a majority in Parliament supports this fixed period.
Variable patent protection is impracticable and entails a considerable administrative burden.
In addition, the duration of a patent must never be dependent on a productâs sales figures.
The international competitive situation of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry demands that we take a look at Europeâs attractiveness as a research destination.
This is another reason why I see no material arguments in favour of the reduction in the fixed six-month period that is still under discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not a paediatrician nor am I a pharmaceutical industry expert but I have some expertise in that we have two small children: Oliver, who is three and a half years old, and Emilie, who is eighteen months.
To MrsÂ Grabowska I would like to mention, by the way, that fathers do actually go and buy medicines for their children: I did last time on Saturday at the Genvall pharmacy.
I support the proposed regulation and I also support MrsÂ GrossetÃªteâs excellent report, and I wish to raise three brief points with regard to it.
The first, which is something we all know, is that research into medicinal products for paediatric use is not good business.
It is not profitable and for that reason not enough is done.
In my opinion, this proposal for a regulation is an incentive for further research, and should be supported.
My second remark is that the six month supplementary protection proposed by the Commission and FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªte is a good thing, as at present we rely too much on the use of medicines intended for adults as medication directly adapted for children.
That is not a good thing.
My last point is that I think it is ultimately a question of whether we conduct clinical research or learn through our mistakes when children have received the wrong drugs.
I would support the first option.
By the same token, the Commission and FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªteâs report deserve our full support.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a whole debate on this issue.
I am sure that on many issues both sides have the right arguments, as both the innovative and generic industries have an important role in the medicine sector.
Whilst I understand the importance of innovation, as a Socialist and Hungarian MEP I think that the social aspect should take priority.
For retired people and families with children in Hungary, medicine represents a large part of their living expenses.
In the transition to capitalism, the cost of medicine became extremely high in Hungary compared to people's incomes.
Further increases would be unacceptable for me.
The rapporteur has to understand that the extra price of the extension period would be paid by the most vulnerable strata of society, the poor and their children.
That is why I support the 'three plus three months' extension period.
Hungarian Socialists support all the amendments by Mrs Corbey and Mrs McAvan, which many of us have signed.
Â Â  Mr President, it is beyond dispute that this proposal for a directive contains valid points, but, as other Members have said, I think that the price we are paying is too high.
I have listened to everyone, but I think that, more than anything, this House should be able to strike a balance between the interests of patients, governments and the pharmaceutical industry.
I have to tell Mrs GrossetÃªte that the difference between us and the United States is that we boast a sound social security system that should also balance its books.
Those of you in this House who argue in favour of six months protection are also those who very often caution in their own countries that the social security budget must be kept under control, and that cuts must be made.
In order to keep this budget in balance, everyone must contribute, including the pharmaceutical industry.
In our view, the six-month extension will lead to an unnecessary additional cost.
That is why I will continue to support the amendments tabled by Mrs Corbey.
Â Â  Mr President, a child is not a small adult.
A pill for a child is not half of that for an adult, and a childâs coat is not a shrunken version of an adultâs.
In many areas of society children receive the attention they are due, but I am seriously amazed that there are not yet enough medicines available tested and intended specifically for children.
Many diseases and illnesses have their own paediatric form, which have also to be treated employing a paediatric approach.
However, fewer than 30% of the medications registered in Finland, for example, include dosage instructions for children of all ages.
I will be happy to pay the price of complying with a six-month term, so that my grandchildren can receive better medications and treatment for their illnesses than they do now.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank all the speakers for their overall support.
There does seem to be a broad consensus in the House that something needs to be done in the field of medicinal products for paediatric use.
I have listened very closely and should like to start by dealing with the question posed by many Members; that is, whether the Commission can guarantee that the funding required to ensure the necessary scientific and research-policy safeguards for this legislative proposal will be made available within the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
