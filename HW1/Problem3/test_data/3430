I accept Amendment No 44, although we must comply with Community provisions governing data protection.
I also accept Amendment No 78.
However, I must reject Amendments Nos 7, 26, 34 and 39 to 43, because they add nothing new of substance and create a whole host of practical problems.
Now for your proposed amendments to the chapter on controls.
I am delighted that many here are in favour of stepping up controls and the implementation of a common fisheries policy and gladly accept Amendments Nos 51, 57 and 61.
However, I should like to accept Amendments Nos 51 and 57 in a slightly different form.
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 52 to 56 or 62.
Nor can I accept Amendment No 12, because we need effective tools if those who break the rules are to be held liable for the damage they cause.
And that includes quota reductions.
Now to decision-making procedures and consultations.
I must reject Amendments Nos 21, 37, 65, 66, 80, 84 and 86 to 89 for the sake of institutional equilibrium, although I gladly accept your Amendment No 64 and part of Amendment No 85 to do with regional consultative committees and the demand that they should also be set up in third countries.
Finally, I am unfortunately unable to accept your Amendment No 69, because the basic principles will be included in our new framework regulation in the future.
Now to the proposed amendments in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's two reports. First, I have made the Commission's standpoint on this quite clear.
I must say, to my great disappointment, that many of the proposed amendments are designed merely to maintain the status quo.
I find that unacceptable and must therefore reject the proposed amendments which refer to it.
I am convinced that it makes no sense to hand out money for scrapping with one hand and to finance new ships with the other, because all that does is to put more pressure on endangered stocks and subsidise this absurd state of affairs out of taxpayers' money.
Nor do I agree with you on exports or joint ventures.
These mechanisms do nothing to reduce excess capacity in our waters because most of the vessels which receive public aid for joint ventures or export were already fishing in third countries.
However, I can accept Amendment No 3 on the possibility of adapting programme planning during the current Structural Fund period.
I can only accept the part of Amendments Nos 19 and 37 designed to promote the diversification of vessels out of fisheries.
Finally, I think that Amendment No 27 is superfluous.
Now to the final proposal on scrapping.
Unfortunately, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9, because if we ask the taxpayer to fund the scrapping of vessels out of additional public money, then it is only logical that we re-programme public aid for fleet renewal at the same time.
As far as Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8 are concerned, here too I must beg to differ.
Scientists have been telling us for years that our fleet is far too big and that stocks are depleting under the tremendous pressure from fisheries.
Our scientists have repeatedly concluded that TACs and quotas and technical measures alone are not enough.
As far as additional funds for scrapping are concerned, we have drawn up calculations based on empirical values.
Of course they are only estimates, but the majority of Member States see them as an upper limit, which is why I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8.
Nor can I accept Amendment No 7, because the Commission has indeed honoured its obligations by instituting infringement proceedings against Member States who fail to achieve their fleet targets.
As for Amendment No 10, the point here is that Member States must meet all the conditions of MAP 4, that is, overall fleet targets and individual targets, if they want to claim additional scrapping premiums.
Anything else would put Member States who have achieved their overall fleet target at a disadvantage.
Mr President, the Commissioner said that he could not address the principle of relative stability because it is part of the CFP.
CFP reform, which we should embark on today and in the next few days, is based precisely on the principle of relative stability, which is not unchangeable.
On the other hand, the Commissioner said that another amendment was to maintain the status quo.
The status quo in Community waters is maintained by the Commission and Mr Fischler, Mr President.
I have received the motion for a resolution corresponding to this oral question on the cod crisis.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0389/2002) by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2006 [COM(2002) 497 - C5-0493/2002 - 2002/0238(CNS)]
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank you, Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, for your report on our proposal on the conclusion of a new fisheries protocol with Senegal.
I am delighted that you support this proposal.
It will enable our fishermen to continue fishing in Senegal until 30 June 2006.
I think this protocol is of huge interest to both parties.
Senegal will receive a financial contribution of EUR 16 million and we shall be helping Senegal to build up sustainable fisheries.
In addition, more Senegalese fishermen and observers will be deployed on board our vessels, although fishing opportunities for our vessels have been cut back, in line with data from Senegalese scientists.
The fishing zones for Community ships have been reduced and coastal zones have been reserved for the local artisanal fleet.
Finally, we have increased compulsory landings for the Senegalese fishing industry in the new protocol.
The agreement offers our fleet stability, because the new protocol will run for four years, and flexibility, thanks to the new system for calculating fishing opportunities.
In turn, this will foster higher utilisation rates and hence a better cost-benefit ratio.
The Senegalese authorities have confirmed that our fisheries will not endanger stocks because, even during the period from 1997 to 2001, Community catches only accounted for between 1.7% to 3.3% of total catches in Senegal.
By comparison, our vessels accounted for 25% of landings for the local industry in 1997.
Now to the proposed amendments.
I agree with the content of Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 but in form they are, I think, superfluous.
The Commission already passes on the information called for.
We are required to do so under the interinstitutional agreements, especially the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
I cannot accept Amendment No 5, because this is a protocol to a fisheries agreement.
As an addendum to a framework agreement, no new mandate is required in order to renew a protocol.
I must also reject Amendment No 2 for this fisheries protocol.
However, I promise to propose this sort of clause during negotiations on future fisheries agreements with third countries.
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the earlier debate simply to ask the Commissioner to promote all these possible measures to help Galicia as much as you can, and try to speed them up, because those suffering from the damage in Galicia have identity cards and human faces; they are the fishermen, their neighbours, small businessmen, etc. It is true that whoever causes damage should pay for it, and here those responsible are hiding behind a legal web, under the umbrella of an anonymous public limited company, and here I mean 'anonymous' in the literal sense of the word.
Perhaps, Commissioner, it would be a good idea to promote measures for transparency, clarity and flexibility as well within the scope of maritime trading legislation.
I shall now move on to the EU/Senegal Fisheries Agreement, to say that we should set out fisheries possibilities in Senegalese waters and the financial contribution.
I believe that the conclusion of a new protocol on fisheries relations between Senegal and the European Union - which is of particular importance following the failed agreement with Morocco - should be welcomed.
As you said, the impact of the protocol on fish populations in Senegalese waters is minimal, given that the fisheries activities of the European Union only represent between 1.7% and 3% of total catches in the area.
Furthermore, fishing possibilities for EU vessels have been decreased on sensitive stocks and technical measures including a two-month biological rest period have been agreed to give more protection to fish stocks and to minimise the risk of competition with the artisanal fleet.
I do not want to say too much because a great deal of data already appears in the report.
Allow me, however, to say that with regard to demersal species, the opportunities for pelagic fishing have vanished and the opportunities for tuna fishing have remained at the same level.
Allow me to say also that financial compensation from the EU will increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 16 million annually and of these EUR 16 million, EUR 3 million will be allocated to specific measures: developing local industry and the informal commitment - what a pity this is not included in the agreement - by the Senegalese authorities to pass on 50% of total compensation to the sector, which is important because the Senegalese economy is heavily dependent on fishing and one in six Senegalese nationals of working age works in this sector.
I would also highlight that the biological rest period is obligatory unlike the simple provisions of the previous agreement, and states that the aim of prohibiting deep-sea fishing is to foster the conservation of vulnerable species and promote the small fishing sector and defend the sustainability of fishing in Senegal.
All of which, like the setting of lower by-catch rates and larger mesh sizes, demonstrates the importance of this.
It is equally important to ensure an increased number of Senegalese seamen on board EU vessels.
I would like, Commissioner, to emphasise a reference to Amendment No 3, which has a clear social content - I am a member of the Committee on Social Affairs - and, overall, sets out similar working conditions, rights and freedoms for all seamen on board EU vessels, whether or not they are EU seamen.
The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights therefore does not draw any distinctions and its first article states that human dignity is inviolable.
In conclusion, this seems to be a good agreement: an achievable agreement is always the best one.
The agreement is clearly a meeting of wills, and often - almost always - both parties must make concessions in order to reach the agreement.
The Members of this Parliament are not in the habit of offering congratulations, but I believe this is a good agreement and we should congratulate the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0390/2002) by Mr Lage, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out, for the period from 3 August 2002 to 2 August 2004, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Angola on fishing off Angola [COM(2002) 495 - C5-0492/2002 - 2002/0237(CNS)].
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
First of all, my thanks to you, Mr Lage, for your report.
I am delighted that you support this proposal granting Community vessels access to Angolan waters until 2 August 2004.
The new protocol is in the mutual interest of the Community and Angola and contains a few new clauses, which I should like to comment on.
Stocks in Angolan waters will be checked annually by local scientists in the interest of sustainable fisheries.
As a basis for this scientific knowledge, or should I say as a result of this scientific knowledge, fishing opportunities will be revised in line with it.
36% of the financial contribution will be used to set up a partnership between the EU and Angola, in order to develop research, artisanal fisheries, training and aquaculture.
This is a net improvement over the 28% earmarked for targeted action in the last protocol.
Not just tuna vessels but all fishing vessels will have to carry six Angolan fishermen, compared with five previously.
This will create an additional 160 to 180 jobs locally.
I should like to comment briefly on the proposed amendments.
Basically, the same applies as I said earlier about the protocol with Senegal.
On the question of including the Member States' obligation under Regulation 500/2001, with ships declaring their catches in third countries, this is not possible.
But I am more than willing to include this obligation in any new agreement, because this is something that needs to be negotiated.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has already addressed the basic issue: the report adopts the results of the negotiations between the Commission and Angola, and even welcomes the way in which the negotiations were concluded and the protocol offers interesting fishing opportunities for the Member State fleets and is today the second largest, I believe, after the agreement signed with Mauritania.
The new protocol is the ninth since the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Angola entered into force in 1997; this new protocol applies to the period between August 2002 and August 2004, provides access for 33 tuna vessels and 22 shrimp-fishing vessels.
The tuna fishing quotas are shared out between France, Spain and Portugal - it should be noted that the previous protocol provided access for 43 European Tuna vessels, slightly more than the current number.
With regard to demersal fishing, Spain has received the lion's share, with Portugal, Italy and Greece sharing the rest.
The annual financial compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15.5 million, which is to be applauded.
This is a contribution by the European Union to the development of fishing in Angola. EUR 5.5 billion are going to specific measures for research, control and monitoring, as the Commissioner has already rightly pointed out.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not want to end my brief intervention without mentioning the fact that Angola is a terrible and shocking paradox: Angola is a vast territory, with a population of around 13 million inhabitants, has truly amazing underground resources such as oil and diamonds - suffice it to say that its oil, the production of which will increase in the next two years, represents around 15% of US consumption - but most of this money does not go to those in Angola who are suffering an appalling tragedy of hunger and misery.
One report by the International Monetary Fund even states that EUR four billion have been poured into the State's coffers but have moved along impenetrable and tortuous routes.
Does this mean that the European Union should not support Angola?
No it does not!
What it means is that Angola has entered a new phase in its history, which has been plagued by civil wars, death and destruction.
Angola's fishing industry is extremely interesting.
I remember, although it is always risky to depend on one's memory, that in 1973, when Portugal was still the colonial administrator, around 490 000 tonnes of fish were brought into Angolan ports. This is something I read in a book on the history and economy of Angola.
In 1999, around 190 000 tonnes were brought in.
This means, then, that Angolan fishing has suffered a major fall and is now recovering, partly because it is no longer a State-run industry and is essentially in private hands.
It also means, however, if the scientific data are not misleading, that Angola has considerable opportunities for fishing and that Angolan waters contain a wealth of fish.
The texts also state that fishing in Angola represents 3% of the gross national product and so any effort to support the Angolan fishing industry is to be welcomed.
I therefore wish to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on the result they have achieved.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Carlos Lage, on this report which is extremely well structured and clear in terms of its proposals.
As Mr Lage himself stated, this is a further renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Angola that began in 1987 and is now being renewed once again.
As has also been said, European Union vessels fish in those waters for tuna, shrimp, demersal species and, on an experimental basis, some pelagic species.
This new protocol clearly shows that there has been a slight increase in demersal fishing and a noticeable decline in tuna fishing, which is all the more worrying because we know that for some years, this area, with all the tuna migration, has been experiencing a major decrease in numbers, which is largely due to what we call IUU, or illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.
We are seeing a great deal of illegal tuna fishing, especially in tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Guinea, in which the tuna are killed before they even have time to reproduce.
Perhaps this situation of illegal tuna fishing in all tropical waters will not be too different to this reduction in the tuna fishing quota in the Agreement with Angola.
It should also be emphasised that when calculating the EU's financial compensation, which is also increasing, we must also take account of the rates paid by shipowners.
As the report also clearly states, EU compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15.5 million and in fact it is important to note that 35% of these appropriations are specifically earmarked for the development of the fishing sector.
It should also be stated that this agreement with Angola represents gradual progress in the field of fisheries agreements with third countries.
This considerable allocation of appropriations to the fishing sector is important and shows that it is possible to conclude commercial fishing agreements that contain a development component.
I believe that we must not show any prejudice - in other words, fishing agreements must be made an integral part of the common fisheries policy: they can be of benefit to third countries, aiding their development and to the European Union, by improving the supply of its markets.
Lastly, I feel it would also be reasonable, linking this with the reform of the CFP, for vessels scrapped in the European Union to be able to join the joint enterprises that fish in these waters.
I should also like to mention, on behalf of my group, the PPE-DE, that we will be supporting this report, which we believe to be well-grounded.
Madam President, the complete, total and disgraceful failure of the common fisheries policy and the consequent collapse of fish stocks means that the EU must now cast its net wider and wider to satisfy voracious Spanish demands.
Not content with destroying the North Sea, Africa is now the prize.
There are now 16 third country agreements in place.
Today we are discussing Angola and, according to the World Wildlife Fund, this deal will strip a vulnerable African coastal community of a precious asset.
When each deal is debated, my colleague, Mr Nigel Farage, has urged you to open your eyes to the environmental destruction and, more seriously, to the deaths of many hundreds of black African fishermen which European Union boats are causing every year.
Exhaustive documentary evidence from Mauritania and Senegal confirms the scale of this tragedy.
The contempt with which our pleadings have met leads me to think that most of the rest of you must inhabit a different planet.
There is a better way.
Ten years ago, Namibia threw out the Spanish boats and took control over her 200-mile territorial waters.
14 000 people now work in an industry worth USD 350 million a year.
Namibia should be our model if we really want to help the third world.
Let us stop exploiting these poor countries and encourage them to modernise their industries.
Let us recognise that the only fishery management schemes that work around the world are the ones with national control.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF VOTE (ARTICLE 120)
We have the whole of 'blue Europe' stretching out before us waiting to be reorganised.
The reality of the situation is that fisheries resources are being depleted, whilst the discussion focuses on the reliability of instruments used to measure the extent of the rarity of fish shoals.
Our instruments for managing catches, the market, fleets and relations with third countries are criticised by professionals.
The Commission wants to act as a substitute for the Council of Ministers in decision-making processes.
It persists in its Malthusianism tactics by scrapping boats and even by refusing to fund modernisation.
This is how, in addition to jeopardising the safety of fishermen, the problem of unfair competition arises.
Whilst we undermine our own industry's fishing possibilities, other fishermen from third countries are coming in their place.
The margin for manoeuvre is, nevertheless, very small.
Even aquaculture is not a genuine solution as, in order to 'manufacture' one kilo of farmed fish, you need to use between 4 and 7 kg of fish meal.
This is the absolute limit of industrial fishing.
The potential solutions are acknowledged: regionalisation of management for greater flexibility, more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disputes, greater involvement of the profession ?
(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
The next item is the report (A5-0400/2002) by Mr Karas on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication on streamlining the annual economic and employment policy co-ordination cycles [2002/2215(INI)]
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say about today's report is this.
One: the goal of the Lisbon strategy is to transform the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, an economy capable of bringing about permanent economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Two: in order to do this, we need an economic, employment, education, research policy and social policy strategy developed jointly by the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Three: Europe is moving from a market economy towards a social market economy and is in the process of taking the next step and making the eco-social market economy the order of the day for the twenty-first century.
As someone so nicely put it, the twenty-first century will be the century of Europe but only, I would add, if we want it to be.
Four: assuming we really mean it, the Lisbon strategy and an eco-social market economy will allow us, at long last, to get past the received wisdom of capital versus labour, social policy versus economic policy, public versus private sector, Europe versus the Member States.
Five: it would all be quite simple if we could agree on a few basic principles: that the economy creates labour, that everything labour creates is social and that social cohesion and environmental protection are mutually supportive for the purpose of sustainability.
This all depends primarily on human rather than state resources, not on equality for all, but on competitive ideas that strengthen the continent of Europe as a whole.
Six: we should therefore emphasise that economic policy has not been communitised and lies primarily within the sphere of competence of the Member States and that, under Article 99, economic policy must be regarded, and coordinated by the Member States, as a matter of common interest.
Seven: we therefore welcome, by way of conclusion, the overall approach of the Commission communication on streamlining the annual economic and employment policy coordination cycles.
We need this coordination in order to achieve common objectives despite differing jurisdictions.
But this coordination depends on the Member States' doing their bit, on their passing fast, clear information to the Commission, on defining individual responsibilities within the overall concept - because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link - and on the euro zone becoming more aware of its responsibility within Europe.
We make a huge point of this in paragraph 18 of the report by calling for the role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, in other words the European social partnership, to be strengthened.
We therefore call for a tripartite social summit to be set up, with the participation of the European Parliament.
We have no time for legal wrangling between institutions; we need to foster this social dialogue jointly and involve organisations of social partners.
Which is precisely why we are demanding more rights in fora and in this process, by which we mean more involvement and more right of involvement on the part of the European Parliament.
We stress in point 8 of the report that anyone who wants to see this democratic involvement must be concerned that the new timetable for the guidelines package gives the European Parliament even less time than before to agree on its position.
We welcome the fact that this process has been streamlined.
We welcome the fact that the focus is on implementation.
We welcome specific timing arrangements and we welcome the fact that a strategic, medium-term policy concept is being strengthened.
If we ensure that life is breathed into this communication, then we shall be one step closer to the Lisbon strategy.
Madam President, economic prospects are not at their best at the moment and the European Union has realised that it needs to coordinate economic policy and employment policy more efficiently.
The Commission proposal on streamlining coordination cycles has attracted the interest of all the institutions and numerous discussions have been held at various levels, illustrating that this proposal is not merely a technical proposal, as it might appear at first sight; it is, of course, guided by important political objectives, such as efficiency and transparency in the application of the Lisbon agenda and the role of the European Employment Strategy which, after five years in practice, is now firmly established.
May I make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Karas, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Bullmann, on a job extremely well done.
I shall confine my comments to a few basic issues.
First, the report supports the focus on the medium term.
This means that we need to be much more sparing when changing and revising the guidelines.
The Commission will approve a package of guidelines in keeping with the new programme for the first time in April 2003, covering the three years up to 2006.
We need to avoid any major changes in the guidelines before this mid-term review in 2006.
We have proven that it is far better to keep to the guidelines and ensure they are applied than to constantly add new elements.
Secondly, this medium-term focus will require greater discipline on the part of everyone involved: the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and all other interested parties.
Of course, the Commission will review the employment recommendations for each individual country every year in order to ensure that they still reflect political developments in each Member State.
May I remind you that the Treaty requires us to produce this annual report, which will take the form of application monitoring.
That brings me to the second aspect, which is consistency and complementarity.
It is vital that the two procedures complement each other if we are to achieve the maximum possible coordination between economic policy and employment policy.
We had a fair degree of overlap in the past; on occasions, however, we also had contradictory approaches to the two strategies.
Thirdly, there is a need to focus on application.
Now that the employment strategy has been up and running for a number of years, we have identified the basic practical problems and the gap which often arises between submitting national action plans on employment and implementing them.
I should like to stress in particular that this streamlining procedure should result in closer collaboration, not just between the various Councils - the Ecofin Council and the Council on Employment will need to find a clearer and more efficient way of working together - but also between the institutions of the European Union.
I think that Parliament - and the entire procedure, of course - will benefit from this proposed streamlining of procedures, especially from more transparent information, with the main elements of the application of financial policies and employment policies being provided in a coordinated manner.
May I remind you that, in the past, information on these two procedures often came in at different times, giving rise to a great deal of confusion.
Fourthly, streamlining means a better governance model for these procedures, which in turn means more efficient consultation with the European Parliament and greater involvement on the part of the social partners and civil society.
The big issue as far as evaluating employment policies is concerned is that neither the social partners nor the national parliaments have been properly involved.
Finally, I must say that this proposal respects the need for autonomous procedures, as required under the Treaty.
In short, the economic guidelines provide an overall framework for economic policy but the employment strategy has the necessary degree of autonomy.
I am delighted that Parliament supports this approach.
So what next?
This entire procedure coincides with the review of the employment strategy.
We shall be presenting an initial communication in January 2003 and both these documents, the communication on the revision of the employment strategy and the draft joint report, which we submitted a month ago, will be the two basic political papers and will need to be debated so that we can get to the spring Council and then start applying the new procedure with the guidelines.
We have a long history of collaboration with the European Parliament on the employment strategy.
I think that we now have an opportunity for even more efficient and substantial collaboration.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Parliament has worked on this Commission proposal in a very focused manner, in a very focused and very concerted manner.
We were quick and we agreed across the committee and party political divide, under Mr Karas's guidance, on what I think is a good position.
And because we have worked in such a quick and concerted manner, we can formulate clear demands on exactly what sort of coordination is required.
First, at no time, not for a minute, not for a second, does anyone have any authority whatsoever to subordinate the social goals of Lisbon, the employment policy ambitions of the Lisbon agenda, to a one-dimensional interpretation of the internal market.
This must be crystal clear and must be expressed in the procedures we choose.
On the contrary, only if you take specific measures to promote social integration, only if you develop the full potential of people in Europe and get them into work, will you have any chance of putting Lisbon's demanding agenda into practice.
I say that quite advisedly in the present debate on job market reforms and the reform of social security systems.
Of course we need systems to be flexible and adaptable, but we also need them to be modern.
And a modern system is a system that offers security, security for job seekers, job security, security in the event of illness, old age or disability.
That is why economic reform is a means to an end when it comes to maintaining and renewing the European social model, not the other way round.
If this is what we want, we have to put the objectives of competitiveness, social security and full employment on a par with each other.
We have to find ways of linking these goals and making them mutually supportive.
And if that is what we want, we must also make sure that the relevant Councils and Commission departments are involved on an equal footing and that no new hierarchies are created or old hierarchies reaffirmed.
We shall be measuring you in your spring report, in your guideline package, on the basis of whether you meet these targets and do justice to what the streamlining concept promises.
Secondly, if we want to do justice to Lisbon and Gothenburg, we must stop beating about the environmental bush.
We must use the full potential of environmental policy in order to make it work for qualifications and employment.
Thirdly, as Mr Karas quite rightly points out in his report, economic policy is a matter of common interest which deserves to be coordinated.
If we want to coordinate it, then we also need to pluck up the courage to talk about investments and about an offensive in this area in the face of around 8% unemployment and a growth rate of under 1%.
Parliament will be involved in this discussion and we must secure our rightful place in it.
Madam President, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the proposals of Mr Karas and the Commission.
When it comes to economic and employment policy in the European Union, the hour of truth is drawing ever nearer.
The demands and the objectives from Lisbon and Gothenburg must now become reality.
Simplification is more important than streamlining.
Increased participation, increased openness and increased transparency are important.
For us Christian Democrats, it is also important to assert that we are in favour of a social, ecological and ethically based market economy in Europe.
It must be people-friendly. It must be family-friendly.
It must provide room for personal, responsible creativity and also for security and initiative.
Open coordination does not stand for standardisation but instead allows Member States, within the framework of close co-operation, still to find the solutions which are best for each individual country.
It is important that the environmental objective from Gothenburg be combined with the economic growth requirement and social cohesion to achieve the three dimensions.
We regret that the Commission has not included this in its communication.
As Christian Democrats let us also emphasise that trust as well as ethical and moral values are fundamental to social and economic development.
If the economy lacks trust and an ethical and moral base, it cannot be developed.
The European Parliament must achieve greater participation without necessarily demanding the right to make decisions.
It is about giving the European Parliament not only the right to be present but also time.
To conclude, I would like to say that it is important that the candidate countries take part in this work soon and that the regional and local authorities also be given an active role to play.
Madam President, the Commission communication actually takes up a proposal which Parliament has debated time and again in this Chamber since the second stage of monetary union, namely the need to try and coordinate and interlink the various political areas much more closely.
We have always taken the view that this will only work once all the political areas have been put on an equal footing and all the Councils are considered equal under a guiding General Council.
Unfortunately it took the Lisbon process, some six years later, to grab this opportunity and I am delighted that we have now moved from theory into practice.
Commissioner, we have great expectations of the Commission; we expect an agreement to be reached.
Europe is sorely in need of one.
And that applies not just to economic and employment policy; it also applies to social and environmental policy.
Europe is sorely in need of one because we cannot afford the luxury of uncoordinated policies.
The Delors Commission concluded at one point that uncoordinated policies were costing us growth, which automatically means they are costing us jobs in the European Union.
We are counting on an end to this situation and from that point of view this new paper really is most welcome.
But it is only most welcome if it can rely on a more secure data situation than is presently the case and we can explain to our citizens that the coordination process is not just yet another euro-word or instrument which will not stand up in practice.
What do I mean by that?
We need to be able to show that certain economic or employment or environmental policy decisions in one Member State also harm or benefit the national economy or the job market or the environment in another Member State and can halt, freeze or foster growth, and we need statistics that can provide us with the relevant data.
Unfortunately, to the disappointment of European economic researchers, this is still not the case.
What we need is a coordination profile and this profile may become clear in the question of how we bundle investments, investments in research and development for example, where Europe unfortunately still has a great deal of catching up to do.
The main thing is that Parliament should be involved under an interinstitutional agreement, at the very latest by the time the Convention completes its reforms and the Treaty is amended.
Madam President, no coordination, no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will.
This must be our starting point.
Some good objectives were set out in Lisbon and Gothenburg, but there is a huge gap between what is said and what is done.
The European Union is facing serious economic problems, its growth potential is slowing down, public and private investment is very weak and it is lacking skills.
Neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the monetary policy is dealing with these challenges.
They are assigning everything to the Member States, and coordination cycles, which are designed to be the Member States' area of discipline, cannot work if the Union also fails to adopt and implement common policies.
There is no genuine European economic policy due to differences between the Member States.
Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries.
And we do not yet have a global approach to the European economy and the eurozone, considered in the context of globalisation.
We do not yet have a policy on demand, networks or human capacities.
The Union is still an area of regulatory and fiscal competition, where the very notion of social market economy is not accepted and will not be incorporated, in my view, in the future constitution, especially since there is still genuine aversion towards economic affairs.
I shall now turn to institutional procedures.
What the Commission is proposing to us is purely technocratic.
I am in favour of merging different areas and setting up a cycle.
I agree with the principle of streamlining.
However, this will not remove the aforementioned political obstacles, hence my suggestions.
First of all, the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy.
Our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the Convention.
Secondly, no reliable comparative statistical and analytical tool exists, particularly for social cohesion and sustainable development.
As a priority, we must therefore provide the Union with investigative and analytical resources which are equal to its statements.
Thirdly, the proposed procedures do not yet have any democratic value.
We urgently need a broad public deliberation on the situations and options prior to the Commission's package, as well as a subsequent evaluation, by civil society and the elected representatives, and not only by the Commission.
Fourthly, I do not believe that the European Parliament is today still capable of properly debating and of choosing a coherent economic policy.
Too many positions held are marked by national interests alone and ideological mindsets.
Having said that, Parliament is better placed than the Council and the Commission to deliberate and assess the economic policy.
An annual interactive discussion is therefore necessary between national communities and the Community institutions at Parliament's initiative.
Only then will the Commission draft its proposals, only then will the decision be referred back to the Council, but Parliament could then have a power of ratification.
To sum up, without shared political will and a common democratic procedure, the coordination of national policies will fail.
Madam President, the report we are now discussing is an important step on the way towards implementing the Lisbon objectives.
Just like Mr Karas and Mr Bullman, I am quite disappointed that the Commission once again has managed to forget the decisions made at the Gothenburg Summit in which the environment was also to form an aspect of the Lisbon process.
Although I think that it is good that the rapporteur is encouraging the Commission and the Council to add sustainable development to the rationalisation of political coordination, it can be done considerably earlier than the Commission is doing.
The fact is that, besides failing to reinforce the Lisbon objectives with an environmental objective, there are also still many issues which remain to be resolved.
We have discussed fisheries policy practically all night, but this also concerns an overhaul of agricultural policy, an area where we have to tackle the subsidies which we know to be damaging.
We must also make sure that the environmentally harmful subsidies are abolished.
This is included in the concept of 'sustainable development', but the Commission does not really seem to have accepted this or thought it through yet.
The goal for the spring summit next year must be to create balance in the measures between all three parts of the Lisbon agenda, above all by developing the environmental dimension and continuing to strengthen and make concrete the concept of sustainable development within all three dimensions of the agenda.
The Commission must do this in a much more focused way.
Above all, it must be ensured that the environmental indicators are taken seriously, which will in fact not be discussed until a few days before the Council is to reach a decision on this.
All the work on sustainable development in this agenda has completely the wrong focus and is going far too slowly on the part of the Commission.
Madam President, like many other speakers, I think that the Commission communication is very narrow.
What is being discussed is coordination of the economic guidelines and employment guidelines.
We are agreed, however, that the concept must be expanded.
We need an environmental process and, especially, we also need a social process as an important part of the total process which was developed from the Lisbon Summit.
These four parts, which are each of independent importance, must be coordinated.
Otherwise, we will see an imbalance, changing the character of employment policy, for it will then no longer be determined by the link to the social perspective but will easily become a structural policy which means that employment policy will become a kind of reflection or mirror image - or an appendage.
It is incredibly important to talk about social integration, work for all, good quality work.
Many of these things are usually carried forward by the Commission.
I sometimes wonder whether the Commission is speaking with a forked tongue, for it often emphasises the importance of good social goals of this kind, but at the same time these views are missing from this particular communication.
I think this is so serious that I would like to formulate a kind of warning.
If it should be the case that this is not just a coincidence but a trend, the balance and the harmony which seemed to follow from the Lisbon decisions will be replaced by conflict on the labour market and what we used to call class struggle.
We are already seeing such trends today on Europe's labour market and these will become even clearer in the future.
If we have this type of conflict to fight against, I believe that this is almost the worst thing that can happen for economic development in Europe.
Furthermore, I would like to add something which has to do with synchronisation and coordination.
A kind of horizontal coordination of the economy and employment at European level is now being discussed.
I think that, here too, we must talk about social and environmental issues.
At the same time, there is vertical coordination between levels.
The biggest problem of all which we face, and which even the Commissioner, for example, knows that I always return to, is that it makes no difference how much we coordinate at European level if we do not achieve better co-ordination between European level and national level and as long as the national labour markets are not sufficiently open.
I would like to emphasise this particularly, as it is sometimes said rather vaguely that the national parliaments have to be given a greater place.
However we must be clearer and talk about how this is to be achieved.
My answer is always that responsibility must be given to the national parliaments.
Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Karas.
He has had a very challenging task to streamline the measures of coordination.
I fully welcome the efforts of the Commission in this respect and I want to thank our Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, for your courage in proposing these items.
I do not want to be the black sheep of the House today, but I think that we should also be critical when it comes to expanding methods of open coordination to different areas.
In the report, Parliament says that we have two items which are important.
If you look at paragraph (e) in the Karas report - I will read an extract from the paragraph: 'Whereas a better streamlined review of implementation in the form of a new implementation package requires information on the implementation of policies agreed on Europe leading to an evaluation of implementation in the relevant policy areas'.
This is a text from the report and it shows that, for Parliament, implementation of present coordination mechanisms is really important.
We have not seen enough concrete results from the coordination mechanisms and we need concrete results.
The other worry of Parliament concerns the role of Parliament and you can see from all of the reports that our role as a parliament, as a representative of the citizens, is very worrying for us.
In the working group of economic governors in the Convention of which I was a member, we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty.
Unfortunately, I was in the minority in this working group, because I think that the main aim of the open method of coordination is to be flexible, and that it should not be in the Treaty.
We should use the current mechanisms.
Madam President, I would like to express my full support for the report on which we are about to vote, particularly for its comprehensive approach to the sustainable development strategy, as defined at Lisbon and, then, more specifically, at Gothenburg: it is not a formula for lumping economic, employment and environmental objectives together under one umbrella but an integrated approach which orients sectoral and horizontal policies towards a new concept of development.
In practice, this will allow us to discharge our responsibility towards future generations and the countries whose development is lagging behind.
I would like to focus briefly on the instruments necessary for the practical implementation of this strategy.
If we genuinely adopt the approach that quality of social conditions and of the environment are central rather than secondary to growth and that is an essential factor in competitiveness, the most appropriate implementation instrument would appear to be the method of open coordination, although it does need to be strengthened and streamlined, as the report states, particularly as regards the involvement of the European Parliament, which, moreover, needs to be better, much better equipped in this regard.
The success of such a policy depends on the genuine participation of all the institutional levels and all the social players.
Without this widespread committed involvement, development will not be sustainable.
Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to sound the alarm, and in this I am supported, inter alia, by the Civil Society Contact Group.
The preliminary draft Constitutional Treaty presented by the Chairman of the Convention does not contain any reference to the concept of sustainable development.
If we do not reinvigorate what has already been affirmed by the Treaty and at Gothenburg, it will be a genuine cultural regression, a step backwards which, not least, will reduce Europe's influence as a global player.
Madam President, the Lisbon strategy is due for re-evaluation at the special summit next spring.
This is not just about evaluating whether the objectives have been implemented; measures will also need to be corrected and new elements introduced.
For example, the Council has decided to add a third dimension to the economic and employment policy dimensions: the ecological dimension, as a number of my honourable friends have already mentioned.
I totally fail to understand why the Commission refuses to include ecological objectives.
We have discussed the possibility of a new edition of the Stability Pact in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
My group, the PPE-DE, is against watering it down because that would undermine the stability of the euro and make people anxious.
I think that greater involvement of the social partners in a tripartite social summit and a strengthened macroeconomic dialogue are noteworthy ideas.
I think there are three important points in Othmar Karas's excellent report.
First, we need better coordination of economic policy, employment policy and social integration.
The annual guidelines are the main tool for coordinating employment policy.
It is a shame that numerous Member States agree on the objectives but then fail to put them into practice.
Secondly, Parliament needs to be comprehensively involved in preparations for the spring summit.
That means having enough time in the run up to the summit to examine the Commission's proposal.
We really must be allowed enough time.
We expect the Convention to further strengthen our position as representatives of the people and the EU Treaty is to be amended to give us more codecision rights at all stages of the coordination process.
Thirdly, on the future EU Member States: we need to integrate candidate countries at the very earliest opportunity if we want to achieve our ambitious aim of transforming the European Union into the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world within eight years.
We call on the Commission to ensure the relevant departments in these countries are involved in a technically - and more important - logistically efficient manner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0401/2002) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (Noise) (Seventeenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [PE-CONS 3666/2002 - C5-0501/2002 - 1992/0449A(COD)].
Madam President, we welcome the important step being taken today in the field of health and safety at work.
The proposal on risks to workers from physical agents was submitted eight years ago and the first part, on noise, was approved this year.
So we realise just how difficult, both technically and politically, this type of legislation is.
On behalf of the Commission, I should therefore like to congratulate the European Parliament, especially the members of the conciliation committee, on implementing what is, technically and politically, a particularly tricky issue.
Today's final draft of the directive contains three important achievements.
First, it provides greater protection for workers in all sectors of the economy, including sea and air transport, which were not covered under current legislation.
Secondly, it recognises that the music and entertainment industry is a special case and grants it a five-year transitional period in which to draw up the codes of conduct needed so that workers and employers can honour their legal obligations and, thirdly, it reduces the limit of exposure from 90 db, which was the limit set in the 1986 directive, to 87 db.
Clear progress indeed.
Approval of this directive completes the second stage of the Commission proposal on risks from physical agents.
More work is needed on the remaining two sections of the Commission proposal, namely electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to call on the co-legislators to keep up their efforts to complete this legal framework on physical agents, which will give us an integrated framework for protecting workers and which, it must be said, has been lying on the negotiating table for far too long.
Madam President, I would thank the Commissioner for having eventually dealt with the other physical agents, for in that way I do not have to say that there are still elements we have missing.
I am delighted, moreover, that the Commission has consistently placed the issue high on its agenda.
We all know that noise is a very serious problem for the working environment.
It is an area which has been fully explained in terms of science.
We know that, in actual fact, very little noise is needed to cause lasting damage to hearing.
We also know that damage to hearing can lead to a reduction in people's capacity to work or to their possibly not being able to obtain jobs in the labour market ever again.
It is, then, a very serious state of affairs we are talking about.
I am therefore extremely pleased at our being able, tomorrow, to adopt a directive that gives workers better protection than that which they have at present.
It is, then, a better directive with which we are concerned here, first of all because we are now at long last obtaining a proper upper limit on the noise to which workers may be exposed.
I should like to have seen a lower limit, which is something I also proposed. I should also like to have seen no account taken of protection from personal protection measures, but what we have here is nonetheless an improvement.
The other very positive factor is that the directive systematically attaches importance to the prevention made so much of in the framework directive.
Prevention is in terms of action values but, in connection with the directive, we have also attached importance to ensuring the presence of properly functioning hearing protectors.
There are, however, a number of other provisions that are to be avoided.
We must implement alternative working methods that minimise exposure to noise.
We must examine the work tools used in enterprises. Overall, employers' responsibility for making the directive work is emphasised in the directive itself.
The directive provides protection and, in addition, it naturally makes clear the responsibility of employers in individual work situations.
Finally, a couple of words about the music and entertainment sectors.
This is a much discussed subject.
We have heard about the British pop industry and about bagpipe players, all of which livened up the debate.
It is not that I wish to provoke anyone with whom we have been debating this matter, but I should very much like to repeat that noise is, and remains, purely and simply noise.
Irrespective of whether it sounds pleasant or unpleasant, noise can cause very serious damage to hearing.
We have only to look to our own experience.
We are of course aware of who is most often affected by the illness known as tinnitus.
It is, in point of fact, people who have lived with pleasant noise or who have been affected by very pleasant noise, namely music.
We know, therefore, that noise is noise. I am pleased that the directive recognises this so clearly.
The directive also acknowledges that the music sector may possibly have difficulty implementing the directive's provisions within the deadline that has been fixed.
It has therefore extended the deadline for implementing the directive.
I am also very pleased that we have attached importance to prevention and to getting things to work in practice.
We have established a transitional period, but this is also to be used for preparing standards governing the behaviour of the whole of the music and entertainment sectors.
I am very satisfied with these standards because they are forward-looking and because they will, in a practical way, help the sector to observe the rules.
It is also worth pointing out that those standards of behaviour, or ideas for standards of behaviour, arose in the course of the actual work done by the trialogue, and this is therefore a good example of the way in which cooperation through the trialogue can lead to constructive and positive results.
It is not just a question of being combative.
Good ideas emerge too, which can lead to constructive compromises, and that is something many of us are pleased about.
In that connection, gratitude must also of course be expressed to the Commission for the role it has played and to the Council for its constructive cooperation.
Finally, I just want to say how pleased I am that we have achieved such a broad compromise and such considerable support here in the Chamber.
I now hope that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support this compromise and so confirm what its MEPs normally say in the committee, namely that, when there is scientific data and clear evidence that an issue constitutes a problem for workers, we must also legislate to solve that problem.
That is a view I hope the ELDR Group will comply with tomorrow.
I look forward to our obtaining a really large majority for a good directive.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, to follow on from the rapporteur's closing words, both I and the PPE-DE Group are happy with the report and with the compromise which has been reached.
I think that this report lays another important stone in the edifice of health protection for European workers, even if, unfortunately, it will still be far too long before we have common European protection standards.
In this particular instance, the first proposal dates back to 1993.
The noise directive was certainly no easy task, with the Council and Parliament taking up somewhat different positions.
But the whole purpose of the conciliation procedure is to bring about agreement even so.
Such agreement is, by its very nature, always a compromise but, as I said, we all have reason to be satisfied with this particular compromise.
Objectively speaking, noise protection has been increased; the previous speaker explained the technical data and details.
But what is important is that it is clear-cut; there are no grey areas or confusing discretionary powers when it comes to implementation.
The employer's obligation to provide hearing protectors, check they are effective and make sure people wear them is new.
This sets out employers' general duty of care without any room for misunderstanding.
My group was also concerned that an allowance should be made for the music and entertainment industry when it comes to applying the directive.
This is a welcome move for reasons of legal truth and legal clarity because it makes no sense to have to keep turning a blind eye to the fact that the directive applies to orchestra members in theory but is never applied in practice for reasons of comfort or on aesthetic grounds.
It is therefore simply more honest to allow a transitional period here and let the individual Member States and social partners decide what they want to do themselves.
I should just like to emphasise that, however pleasing it is on paper, this directive needs to be applied in practice.
I am becoming more and more convinced that employee protection directives look very pretty on paper but that nobody actually wants to implement them.
That may have something to do with economic developments, but it is precisely during hard times that we need to make sure that directives are implemented.
I say that with one eye very firmly on the candidate countries because we must set a very clear example here too.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and I very much welcome the outcome of conciliation on the subject, but I think we have several causes for complaint as well.
Four subjects were covered by the original physical agents directive, noise was one, but the original 1986 directive on noise was due for revision in 1991.
Here we are almost at the end of 2002 before we finally have a revised text.
Vibration was another subject but it took Council eight years to reach a common position on vibration, and, as we have heard from the Commissioner, we still have the aspects concerning fields and waves and optical radiation to be dealt with.
Progress is painfully slow.
Yet, all around us in this high-tech era we are increasingly being bombarded by fields and waves from wireless local access networks, from blue tooth devices, from class I lasers and the like. I hope we will see a renewed sense of urgency on the part of Council.
The directive is to be welcomed.
It will bring about direct improvements.
Workers will be exposed less to noise at work.
Then their representatives will play a part in risk assessment in the choice of hearing protectors.
Our preventative audio-metric testing will be made available under certain circumstances.
All of these things and many others are to be welcomed.
For the music and entertainment sector, I think we have established a very good approach.
Member States will, as we have heard, draw up a code of conduct in consultation with the social partners and will give practical guidelines on how employers and employees can meet their obligations in that sector.
The approach has been very much welcomed by the Musicians Union of Great Britain who acted to coordinate the work of musicians' unions across the European Union.
In the interests of time, I will make just one other point.
Many voices were raised in conciliation about the importance of business impact assessment on proposals of this sort - rigorous impact assessment.
I will pose the question here that I posed in Committee: what value should we place upon whether a person in their 40s or 50s can actually hear and communicate with their infant grandchildren?
Because that is the part of the hearing spectrum industrial hearing loss often destroys.
So, let us have a cost-benefit assessment by all means, but let us take all of the costs and all of the benefits into account, not just narrow financial ones.
Madam President, we have moved a long way from when the rapporteur brought a report first to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.
I think we still have problems for the entertainment and leisure industry but the rest of industry and the workers will find this directive very easy to live with.
If the original proposals had gone through, industry across the EU would have been decimated and workers thrown out of work - particularly in the construction industry, cement industry, mining and quite a lot of engineering industry - so thank goodness we have returned to some sort of sensible solution and moved back to the Council position where hearing protection can be taken into account when measuring decibel levels.
I am glad we have moved back to the weekly measurement granted by Member States if they so deem necessary.
But the amendment granting the leisure and entertainment business a five-year delay for implementation while the Commission looked at the best way to regulate this industry, taking into account the special problems faced by the pub and club industry in particular, was unfortunately lost that in conciliation, although, with a code of conduct, it is better than was first proposed.
I grant you that.
But at the present moment the current noise directive is not being implemented in the pub and club industries, neither in the UK nor in Denmark or in many other Member States.
The reason it is not being implemented is because it is not workable.
My problem is that if we add another layer of bureaucracy for the pub and club industry like this, we will cause tremendous problems.
That is why I personally refuse to sign off the conciliation because I believe we could have got more from the Council.
I was on my own apart from one notable exception so I appreciate the vote tomorrow will not make any difference at all to the final outcome.
We have, through a lot of hard work, got a better deal for industry and workers alike.
We could have got a better deal for the entertainment and leisure sector and I am sorry we did not take that opportunity.
Madam President, may I just say what a pleasure it is to be invited to take the floor at five minutes to midnight.
I often think - because it is usually the case with employment legislation - that it is all a plot by the Secretariat to remind us of the folly of the working time directive, not that we need to be reminded of that particular folly on that particular directive.
Regarding this one, this conciliated text is in my view a bad compromise on a bad directive.
It would have been much better for both parties to have kept their original positions and for the legislation to have fallen.
Certainly I voted against it; I was the notable exception referred to by my colleague Liz Lynne.
I also voted against it in the conciliation committee for this reason, even though we did manage to dilute many of the dafter amendments during that committee process.
As far as the UK is concerned, existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate.
Mr Hughes mentioned the importance of business impact assessments and that they should be carried out thoroughly.
I agree with that.
It is significant that there has been no proper regulatory impact assessment at EU level to determine the costs and benefits of the proposed directive.
Certainly there was one done by the UK which established that the costs far outweighed the benefits and perhaps that is why the EU decided not to do one.
This legislation does not reflect the real world.
Coming two weeks after Parliament approved the atypical workers directive, where extra costs and red tape could mean the loss of 160 000 temporary worker jobs in the UK alone, this latest directive shows that the EU continues to operate in a time warp when it comes to employment and social legislation.
Finally, I would like to say that during the progress of the legislation through the European Parliament there have been three different ministers back in the UK, which may explain why the UK Government has made such a limp response to it.
The UK Conservative response will not be limp.
We will stand up for common sense and vote against it.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was slightly surprised by the last two speeches because I assumed that we had reached a reasonable compromise between the first reading and now in the conciliation procedure and that we had improved the Commission proposal on a number of counts.
I think the conciliation procedure was swift and determined to reach a result, the Council was constructive, and I rather had the impression that the PPE-DE and the Liberals had moved some way towards us.
I thought that sense had triumphed!
Nonetheless, and here I agree with the previous speakers, one aspect must give us cause for concern and that is implementation in the Member States, but not - as Mr Bushill-Matthews said - for technical reasons.
I think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern.
I heard today about a professional musician working with a famous German orchestra who turned down an interview with us out of fear of reprisals.
He was to have described his problems as a professional musician but was too frightened to do so, and I am sure he is not the only case.
Employee protection, as Mrs Stauner said, is a basic necessity in modern working life, not a superfluous luxury.
The directive has added some important aspects in order to give employees in all sectors, from music to industry, the security of knowing they have a right to instruction and information on the risks to which they are exposed and that employers must point these risks out to them.
There are several options open to the Member States here, not just passive hearing protection. They can also introduce new working methods and develop new jobs in which noise levels are kept to a minimum.
Mr President, as the final member speaking on this issue, I would like to repeat and underline that the directive will, over time, render occupational noise-induced hearing loss and associated conditions diseases of the past.
That is an achievement by the rapporteur, compounded by the fact that there were a number of national positions which were very difficult at the outset of this report, as has been said by other members.
A huge amount of work went into that position.
From the United Kingdom position, we were left with the situation where a number of issues had to be ironed out.
We now have a situation where our Government - and I am surprised at Mr Bushill-Matthews' statement on this: we may have had three different ministers involved, but the fact is that the United Kingdom Government - and this is one of the governments most interested in this particular health and safety measure, believes that this strikes a good balance between improved worker protection and the need to avoid excessive and unnecessary regulation.
I think it is important not to caricature health and safety measures when a huge amount of work has gone into ironing out those national positions.
We heard a lot from Mrs Lynne about the impact on musicians in the entertainment sector.
We have all in the United Kingdom heard much said on this.
The fact is that those sectors have been satisfied by what could have been a far more difficult directive.
The rapporteur is to be congratulated on the progress made.
That is why I will be voting in favour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0387/2002) by Mrs Evans on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on Directive 86/609 on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes [2001/2259(INI)].
Mr President, it is estimated that around 12 million vertebrate animals are used annually in the European Union for the development and the testing of drugs, vaccines, chemicals and other products.
A further nine million are bred and destroyed as surplus to requirements.
Since Directive 86/609, which controls the use of animals in experiments, was first implemented more than 16 years ago, a great deal has changed.
The original purpose of the Directive was to avoid distortions in trade.
The European Union did not then have a duty, as it does now, to consider the welfare of animals in agriculture, research, transport or single market policies.
Today, animal welfare is the subject of extensive public debate and interest and concern about the use of animals has escalated.
Also, enormous progress has been made in scientific knowledge and practice.
For these reasons, as well as deficiencies in the actual operation of the Directive, with many cases of infringement action taken by the Commission over the years, it is clear that this Directive is in urgent need of revision.
The Commission has already made a commitment to review the Directive next year.
I hope that the points on which we have focussed in this report will guide their work because there are many lessons to be learnt.
The first is the need for a central European Union inspectorate to coordinate the work of inspectors in the Member States but with the power to visit facilities and revoke licences if necessary.
In 1986, Parliament called for a standing committee to monitor the implementation of the Directive but it was not done.
I believe this has proved to be a mistake.
There is great variation between the Member States in the way that information is collated and in the way that replacement, reduction and refinement are applied.
For example, the Commission has already published two sets of statistics on the number and use of animals in experiments.
The data is required every three years.
It does not have to contain very much detail and there has been no standard format for presenting it.
Some Member States publish very detailed statistics annually while others publish the bare minimum as infrequently as possible. This has made evaluating the implementation of the Directive difficult.
We need data to be published annually and in a standard format.
The use of alternative testing methods is, of course, central.
Animal experiments should be seen as exceptions to the rule rather than normal scientific procedures.
Work on alternatives is progressing fast.
This is where Member States should be concentrating and giving priority.
Related to this is Article 7(2) of this Directive, which states that animals should be used for experiments only where there is no scientifically viable alternative.
Given that the Commission does not currently require detailed information on statistics, it is impossible to monitor whether this article is actually being implemented.
That is why the report recommends a central EU database including information on all animal experiments approved, currently performed and finalised.
This would allow for EU-wide checks to ensure that article was being implemented and that experiments were not being duplicated.
While the number of animals used for experiments had appeared to be reducing, the use of transgenic animals is rising.
This is something that could not have been foreseen in 1986 when the Directive was adopted.
There is inadequate provision for it in the Directive as a result.
Transgenic animals must be included.
Finally, many complaints from NGOs and other bodies and organisations relate to breaches of Article 5 on the general care and accommodation of animals.
This can largely be overcome by an EU-wide standard training course including animal welfare and the ethics of experiments.
There are four amendments to the report.
I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment.
I would also like to thank Mr NisticÃ² in particular for discussing his amendments with me.
I regret that I cannot support amendments 1 and 2 as they weaken the report considerably on a point which is of great concern, that is, the use of primates, especially wild caught primates.
I can support Amendment No 3.
I believe there is general agreement in Parliament and in the Commission that Directive 86/609 is neither suitable nor effective today and that we need new legislation.
I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament's recommendations.
I welcome the own-initiative report by the European Parliament on the Directive on the protection of laboratory animals.
I would like to thank Parliament and Mrs Evans for the initiative and the work accomplished.
The report comes at the right moment to maintain the momentum for the in-depth revision of the Directive.
In March 2003, we will convene a meeting of a technical expert working group.
Experts from all stakeholders should elaborate on specific issues including those raised in the report.
However, I would just like to say that development and testing of weapons on animals and the respective ban proposed in the report are not covered by Community competence.
The report further highlights several cases of incorrect transposition of the Directive into Member States' national legislation and cases of incorrect practical application.
We have been actively pursuing these cases and therefore four out of the nine cases presented in the report have already been successfully closed.
In conclusion, I consider the report to be most welcome.
It provides the key elements for the in-depth revision of the Directive.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support for the two-step approach we have taken for amending the Directive.
The first step is currently under way and concerns the inclusion of the procedure for technical adaptation into the Directive.
Parliament adopted the proposal in July 2002 without amendments.
However, a modification in the wording has recently become necessary and Council is likely to adopt a common position.
Therefore, for the second reading, I would like to ask you again for a rapid adoption.
The second step for amending the Directive will, of course, be the in-depth revision.
I would again like to emphasise that I consider the Parliament's report as an important input and I hope that I can count on Parliament's continued support in our efforts to further improve the welfare of animals used in experiments in the European Union.
Madam President, the European Parliament has, on a number of occasions, expressed strong feeling about this matter and declared itself to be opposed to the use of laboratory animals when experiments are repeats of experiments which have already been carried out in other technologically advanced countries, when alternative, internationally approved methods exist and when the products in question are not strictly necessary, as in the case of cosmetics.
Directive 86/609 establishes boundaries and standards which the individual countries of the European Union have to respect in order to ensure maximum protection for animals: I hope that these are applied throughout the European Union.
We must remember, however, that the people who devote their lives to scientific research are skilled professionals, as are the Commission's scientific consultants, who are therefore fully aware of this responsibility and perform experiments with the noble aim of eliminating diseases which are still incurable and fatal.
Moreover, we need to acknowledge that, for certain specific purposes, it is still necessary to use subhuman primates today. It is necessary for the purposes of assessing the effectiveness and safety of Aids vaccines - every year, another two million people die - for the production of monoclonal antibody vaccines to fight diseases such as cancer, polio, tuberculosis or malaria, and where there are no alternative methods in existence.
To prohibit these types of experiments on primates would be to jeopardise the lives of a great many children and adults, Commissioner, depriving them of drugs and vaccines which are essential for the preservation of their lives.
I have tabled three amendments. I am going to withdraw the second, but Amendments Nos 1 and 3 stand as before.
Amendment No 1 is particularly important to me, and I therefore hope that reason will prevail over emotion tomorrow, for No 1 is of fundamental importance for the protection of human health itself.
If Amendment No 1 is not adopted, I shall regrettably be forced - as I have already told the rapporteur - to abstain in the final vote.
Madam President, I should first like to thank Mrs Evans for an outstanding report and to thank Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for the positive reception she has given to Parliament's report.
I think we were right to highlight the Member States's poor implementation of the 1986 directive.
I also think that the report shows very clearly the need for tightening up the current rules.
I can fully support the Commission's being obliged, by no later than next year, to table a proposal regarding the way in which animal experiments are to be regulated in future.
Among the areas I would earmark for tightening up is the area of application.
I think it important that animal experiments should also cover the use of animals for educational purposes, and we must look at the conditions under which transgenic and genetically modified animals are used in experiments.
We must establish some clear ethical rules.
I also believe it is very important for us to obtain a central database for approved animal experiments, both current and completed and both successful and manifestly unsuccessful.
I think it important that we obtain a combined database of this kind so that we avoid repeating experiments that have already been carried out.
Finally, I want to support Mrs Evans's idea of obtaining better supervision of the circumstances in which animals are kept, possibly through a common EU inspectorate that can help ensure that the rules are observed.
May I say that I am able to support Amendment No 3 and that there will be a free vote on Amendment No 4 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
On the other hand, we are unable to support Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
I am looking forward to a proposal from the Commission that will live up to the expectations to which - inspired by Mrs Evans - Parliament's report has given expression.
Madam President, I will start by saying that I do not belong to the cross-party group of animal rights extremists either by nature or by inclination, I have never been a vegetarian and I am not one of those people who likes to sleep with their dog on their bed.
I firmly believe that we are not bound to love animals but that we do have a duty to respect them. This, too, is a way of measuring the degree of civilisation of a people.
The almost complete lack of attention on the part of many of the Member States to the need for proper implementation of Directive 86/609 on animals used for experimental purposes, the appalling shortcomings of the directive itself and the delay in realising the need for it to be updated are confirmation of at least two things: firstly, that animal welfare is a taboo subject in this wealthy, opulent Europe, and secondly, that international economic lobbies are still succeeding in preventing free, political debate on certain subjects.
Admitting, as I do, that scientific progress includes animal experimentation does not mean allowing the Member States to flout and repeatedly violate standards and to subject laboratory animals to unnecessary suffering.
Therefore, the European Commission must speed up its reform process in this area and step up its control and monitoring of non-compliant States, and Parliament, without allowing there to be tension between its head and its heart, must summon up the courage, with the resolution before us today, to take up arms and wage ideological war against the egoism and evil ways of mankind and, without jeopardising scientific research, confirm our unquestionable duty to respect defenceless animals.
Madam President, Commissioner, it is late, and I shall be brief.
I am delighted with this report.
My thanks to the Commissioner for what she has just said.
I am delighted that my proposed amendments were accepted by everyone in the Committee on the Environment.
My thanks also to my friend Mr NisticÃ², even if there is one question we disagree on.
I think it is morally reprehensible to take primates from the wild.
If we feel we cannot do without them, then we must breed them.
I come from a country where we would no longer dare keep such animals in a zoo, not even the SchÃ¶nbrunner Zoo, the oldest and most beautiful zoo in the world.
The last time a pharmaceutical company dared to bring two chimpanzees to Austria from Africa, they were rescued.
They now live, much beloved by the public, as Liesl and Hiasl in an animal rescue centre in Vienna.
As one famous English legal practitioner once said, you do not ask yourself, can animals think, can animals talk?
No, you ask yourself, can they suffer?
And that they certainly can.
Mr President, it is always a pleasure to hear a committed rapporteur and a committed Commissioner speaking on their common concern in this matter.
That, of course, has made the whole debate briefer because it is not interrogatory.
I want to say two things.
Firstly, it is extraordinary that a Directive promulgated in 1986 has still not been properly implemented in some Member States.
If Ms Evan's report does nothing else, it has brought to our attention the need to speed up the process, because that is at the heart of the reform of our procedures generally: implementation, how it is done, rather than innovation, is now always the motto.
I agree with Mr Lund about Mr NisticÃ²'s amendments.
I have to say with great respect that I do not think I can support Amendments Nos 1 or 2 which he has withdrawn.
The reason, very simply, is that it seems to me to devalue animals caught in the wild, as though they are a cheap supply that can be brought in whilst all our concern goes towards zoo-bred animals and the contents of laboratories.
I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future.
We have this triptych here neatly from Ms Evans: replacement, reduction and scaling down.
I would add reflection - we ought to reflect before every experiment is carried out.
Why are we doing this?
Is it being duplicated?
What will the results be?
It will be a good day for Parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration.
Madam President, a great deal has been said this evening on this subject.
Each speaker has explained his position calmly and resolutely, and, indeed, I do not even want to use all the time available to me for fear of repeating what has already been said.
Directive 86/609 laid down provisions which reflected the - as yet quite limited - understanding of that time.
Over 15 years have passed since that directive, during which time I would say it has had hardly any effect at all, for every day we receive news not of progressive alignment with the directive but of ill-treatment of animals and unlawful behaviour.
The States have to a large degree failed to comply with the directive; the whole of society - human society as well as, of course, the animal kingdom - has not felt protected.
The report contains a number of very specific provisions on the behaviour of what are, indeed, major countries - Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom - which have behaved in different ways but, in any case, in such a manner as to justify the assertion that almost all the States have failed to comply with the directive for a long time. This failure to comply has taken different forms but it is still failure to comply.
Few countries in the European Union have escaped criticism, and that may well be because they were not yet part of the European Union at the time in question and have therefore not been assessed.
I believe that there must be an undertaking in this regard.
The report's proposals are certainly sound, the recommendations made by the Commissioner - although I feel she is a little overoptimistic - are certainly sound, but the important thing is for the legislation to be implemented, and so we need inspectors, we need monitoring, we need all possible endeavours to ensure that the directive is respected, even before we start to revise it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place later today at 11 a.m.
Short-term residence permits
The next item is the report (A5-0397/2002) by Mrs SÃ¶rensen on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on a proposal for a Council directive on the short-term residence permit issued to victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities [COM(2002) 0071 - C5-0085/2002 - 2002/0043(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before we go into the discussion of Mrs SÃ¶rensen's report proper, I wish to express my appreciation of the quality of her work and congratulate her on her personal involvement in the fight against the veritable scourge that is the trafficking in human beings.
The proposal for a directive we are considering today is undoubtedly an extremely worrying problem; illegal immigration in its two particularly odious forms - on the one hand, the development of networks of smugglers who act for reasons that are far from humanitarian and, on the other, the exploitation of migrants in the trafficking of human beings.
More precisely, this directive concerns the victims of trafficking and smuggling under these two types of offence, which must not be confused with one another.
One of the key elements of dismantling networks that exploit migrants lies in obtaining information.
The victims are in the best position to be able to provide this type of information to the authorities.
And, without this information, the authorities will find it more difficult to combat trafficking networks.
The aim of this proposal is therefore to strengthen the instruments for combating networks, by establishing a residence permit for the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings with arrangements that encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities against the perpetrators of the offences in question, but avoiding any type of abuse in the way this mechanism is used.
It should be highlighted that, since trafficking in human beings and action facilitating illegal immigration are often interlinked, the scope of the text covers both offences, because these are basically parts of the same fight.
. (NL) Mr President, let me begin by thanking all those fellow MEPs who have contributed so much time and energy to what I think has been an extremely fruitful collaborative exercise.
It was in mid-September, and in this Chamber, that by far the most important conference on the subject of trafficking in human beings to date was organised by the International Organisation for Migration and the European Commission.
It resulted in the so-called Brussels Declaration, and in this Brussels Declaration you can clearly see the central importance of the directive that you have before you to vote on today.
It is important to point out straightaway that trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings form an integral part of our economy today.
It is essentially about treating people as if they were nothing more than merchandise.
At the same time victims of trafficking in human beings are victims of a whole range of abuses and criminal practices.
Trafficking in human beings has now also become the subject matter for committees, with nearly everyone seeming to want to take up a position on it.
What is frequently overlooked is that trafficking in human beings is proliferating because corruption, along with indifference and disbelief, is proliferating.
In a number of countries soon to become members of the European Union, parents sell their children in the hope of giving them a better future.
This proposal for a directive is a first and consequently important step towards eventual concrete action.
The directive requires the Member States to issue a short-term residence permit to victims of smuggling of human beings or of trafficking in human beings who are prepared to cooperate with the competent authorities.
The essence of the proposal is that, here, governments and the victims have shared interests, in particular that the criminal networks be shut down.
For the purposes of this special directive, the Commission has taken trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings together.
It is indeed the case that in purely legal terms they are two quite different things, but in reality the distinction is extremely difficult to make.
This proposal for a directive is however based on thorough practical knowledge of experts active in the field.
The experience we have acquired in Belgium for example proves that the instrument of a short-term residence permit does not miss its mark.
Other Member States too have such systems, albeit with varying degrees of success.
I fully support the Commission's proposal and it is fundamentally important that its content remains intact.
First and foremost this means that some of the amendments touched on by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are unacceptable, in particular, for me, Amendments Nos 7 and 27, for the simple reason that they tear the proposal apart.
They turn it into an empty shell.
Voting for these amendments will be barely concealed approval for the practices of organised crime.
What I want to say is that this directive stands or falls by the minimum social provision for victims.
A victim will never want to cooperate if he or she is not offered the beginnings of an alternative to the situation in which they currently find themselves.
Allow me to say a few words on two other points.
Firstly, there are some who would want this directive to apply immediately to minors too.
At first glance this seems a good idea, simply because we can never do enough for the extremely vulnerable position of minors.
What is forgotten, however, is that what this directive is offering in the end is only a minimum.
Minors are offered very much more today in all the Member States and it would therefore be a real step back if minors were only accorded such minimal protection and rights.
This does not alter the fact that there is a real need for a special effort for victims who are minors.
Finally, I would like to say something else regarding a number of original amendments from Mrs van der Laan - Amendments Nos 20, 25 and 35.
Her alert legal mind envisages the possibility that in certain cases contact between victim and criminal can be accepted by the authorities to further the investigation.
It is a tempting idea, but it is a legal minefield in a number of countries.
The risk of kidnappings or even of manipulation and intimidation is also very real.
Victims willing to cooperate with the authorities want absolutely no contact at all with the criminals, not even from a distance.
I should also like to emphasise that this directive sets aside a special place for specialised and recognised NGOs, but also for international organisations and government agencies.
As Mrs van der Laan has likewise rightly said - and, although this, because of a technical error, does not appear in the text in front of you, it has been noted on the voting list - NGOs also have a special part to play as intermediaries between the investigation and prosecution services on the one hand and the victim on the other.
It is also important in this regard to emphasise that where NGOs are concerned they must be NGOs recognised by the state.
After all, anyone, even criminals, can set up NGOs.
Or, as not uncommonly happens, NGOs can be infiltrated and manipulated.
I therefore think that everyone involved with this matter should sign a code of conduct.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international estimates indicate that traffickers in human beings transport up to 700 000 people every year, mainly women and children.
Every year, 120 000 women and children are lured into the European Union from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone.
These figures do not take account of either illegal immigration or the smuggling of human beings. This highlights the urgent need for coordinated measures against this form of organised crime.
The proposal for a directive, which provides for short-term residence permits to be issued to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities, is an important step.
Up to now, there have not been any pan-European arrangements for dealing with the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings.
However, we need common European standards if we are to combat this form of crime.
The short-term residence permits proposed here will not undermine the current practice of deporting illegal immigrants.
Instead, the authorities will be put in a position to obtain information and incriminating evidence from victims who cooperate, with a view to apprehending traffickers and smugglers of human beings and commencing criminal proceedings against them.
Immediate deportation of victims may improve the statistics, but it does not bring us any closer at all to achieving our objective of effectively combating organised crime, whereas short-term residence permits for victims who cooperate make it possible to identify structures, break up criminal rings and bring criminals to justice.
That must be our goal.
At this point I would once again like to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen very sincerely for all the commitment she has put into this report.
I would also like to thank the Commission and the other groups for their helpful cooperation, which I believe has led to a good end result in this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are about to give an opinion on an extremely important text, which deals with the question of combating the growth of networks of smugglers who exploit men, women and children in the form of trafficking in human beings.
The aim is therefore to issue a short-term residence permit to the victims of these networks who cooperate with the courts or the police.
A measure of this kind has been in force in Belgium, the Netherlands and in Italy and has had a very positive effect.
The report by Mrs SÃ¶rensen, whom I would like to thank in particular, makes reference to the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Non-governmental organisations must play a greater role in assisting the victims of trafficking in human beings and we have strengthened the rights of victims by enabling them to submit an asylum application.
It would be unfair to refuse them this right due to the fact that they often only have false identity papers.
Let us note that it is essential that the Member States be required to protect the anonymity of victims of trafficking by only organising trials held in camera.
We are therefore on the verge of making great progress in Europe in combating trafficking in human beings.
I would, however, draw your attention to Amendments Nos 7 and 27 which refuse the holders of a residence permit the right of access to the labour market, vocational training and education.
This right was laid down in Article 12 of the Commission's proposal.
Deleting this provision would completely distort the directive.
Victims who have no way out of their situation would have great difficulty in cooperating with the police authorities and would easily fall back into the hands of mafia-like networks.
This initiative will make victims stronger and will help them to cut ties with their illegal past as soon as they have severed relations with the criminal network.
Let us reiterate that the Member States are still free to make the issue of permits conditional upon victims' participation in a rehabilitation programme aimed to encourage their integration in the host country or their return to the country of origin.
We owe aid and assistance to the victims.
This is how to ensure they remain law-abiding men and women.
Mr President, Commissioner, every day, people in Europe whose only desire is to make a future or new life for themselves or their families on our continent are abused and violated.
Their longings are odiously exploited by all kinds of profiteers including those who transport these people to Europe and those who exploit their vulnerability within our own Member States.
Many young women see their lives wrecked through prostitution and drugs.
Others are exploited in hazardous occupations and are miserably remunerated outside any form of social protection system.
People smuggling and trafficking in human beings must therefore be combated by every means available under the rule of law.
This directive provides us with an additional opportunity to seize the big players.
We naturally have a responsibility to help the victims and give them the opportunity of a better life.
I believe that many of them may have reasons for remaining within the EU if they so wish, but that must happen through the customary channels.
With the help of the victims, what counts is getting at the big villains.
At the same time, a fair and sensitive balance must be struck between supporting the victims and tackling criminal activity - a combination of humanitarianism and the rule of law.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen's proposal improves the directive which can, however, be made better still.
She herself mentioned a number of proposals. Of relevance in this connection are individual organisations and responsible state authorities, but what also matters is having the directive specify that victims be allowed access to the labour market, something which is not at present a part of this proposal.
I want to second what has been said, to the effect that it clearly needs to be possible for people to extract themselves from the anxieties and serious problems that arise from their being so vulnerable.
I want to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen for a very good piece of work.
Mr President, there is probably no one here in the Chamber, or outside it, who would say that he does not want to combat this type of criminal activity.
I am fully aware that the police and prosecution services long for a framework directive.
As politicians, we must nonetheless make an overall assessment and, just as the previous speaker said, balance various interests.
I do not like texts that confuse crimes against the individual with crimes against the state.
We have had problems along these lines with previous directives dealing specifically with trafficking.
Naturally, we need bilateral police cooperation worthy of the name.
That, precisely, is one of the problems.
Directives do not help, therefore.
The majority of the people being dealt with at present are women and children who are being sexually exploited.
I cannot support this report because of what I take to be its cynical approach to these people.
Mr President, the Commission's proposal is a creditable attempt as a Union, to get a better grip on smuggling of human beings and trafficking in human beings.
The circumstances under which people enter countries illegally are tragic and degrading.
All legal means must be used to tackle the criminals who show no mercy in their quest to earn big money.
The means proposed here can make a contribution to this.
Similar legislation for victims of trafficking in human beings was successfully introduced in the Netherlands some years ago.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen however immediately puts her finger on the weak point in the Commission's proposal.
The definition 'victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration' is unclear.
She proposes following the lead of the UN protocol against smuggling of migrants and using the term 'victims of smuggling of human beings'. The Commission is opposed to following this lead precisely in order to prevent misunderstandings.
This directive in fact affects a different group of people from those in the UN protocol.
The directive is only concerned with those who can reasonably be regarded as victims and who have experienced harm such as threat to life or assault on their physical integrity.
I understand this reasoning, but think that the Commission's definition will provide for at least as many misunderstandings.
In effect we are talking about the same terms.
The problem is just that the term must bring to the fore that the people concerned have suffered disproportionate harm.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen tries to solve this by proposing the term 'victims of smuggling of human beings resulting in exploitation'.
This term does not fit the bill either however because what happens then to the physical harm the Commission is talking about?
Both definitions threaten to lead to abuse of the regulation.
The Council must consider carefully whether the offence of smuggling of human beings should be included in the directive in this way.
Especially as legislation in this area exists only in Spain.
I should also like to note that the deletion of Article 12 does not seem to me to be a good idea.
Access to the labour market, to vocational training and education is just one part of what this system should set up.
If it is omitted, what reason does the victim then have to cooperate with proceedings against the smugglers of human beings and traffickers in human beings?
It is precisely through the opportunity to earn a little money and to receive some training that in the end you give them more opportunities in their homeland and you also give the homeland itself more opportunities.
Mr President, the resolution before Parliament derives its legal justification from an institutional framework where it is not hard to acknowledge the commitment of the European institutions, particularly the European Parliament, to the important and necessary action to stamp out one of the most dangerous and vile forms of criminal trafficking in existence: the trafficking of human beings.
We must not forget that this encompasses the even more frightening phenomenon, which is often omitted and overlooked, of human organ trafficking.
In this connection, my country's legal authorities have already carried out many detailed investigations, especially with regard to the north-east border, which, in an irresponsible move, had its border controls removed a long time ago.
I will now turn to the content of the resolution. Without prejudice to the fundamental reasons behind this approach, which, of course, should be endorsed - for precisely these reasons and because of the need to take concrete steps to clamp down on trafficking in human beings and the promotion of illegal immigration - we must not ignore the risk.
The danger is that, through the practical application of these rules in support of those who cooperate, we may create clandestine means whereby the same organisations can, through false or perfunctory cooperation, establish another method to bring persons into European Union territory illegally.
It is therefore extremely important to limit the scope and legal procedures, and clearly delineate the legal procedures of this process, precisely in order to avoid delays being contrived and the possibility of re-entry.
Lastly, I would like to remember the victim of an horrific reverse race murder two years ago: a young Swede killed by racists in Salem, a suburb of Stockholm.
Mr President, I too would like to explain once again why we feel totally unable to vote in favour of this report; it is because the premises it is based upon are totally flawed.
Migrants put themselves in the hands of traffickers and smugglers of human beings because legal immigration into 'fortress Europe' is virtually impossible nowadays.
That and that alone is the starting point for all this.
That is why trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings happen in the first place, and it is because people who come here in this way are forced into acting illegally that they find themselves in a precarious situation.
It is for that reason alone that it is possible to exploit them in the way that they are being exploited.
To that extent, I can say that I find the Commission's proposal honest at least, because the title itself makes it clear that this is about ensuring that any form of illegal immigration is made more difficult, rather than about helping the 'clients' of traffickers and smugglers of human beings.
That is evident from the fact that this report also covers smugglers who do nothing apart from transporting people across borders in return for payment.
That is why I have only this to say: if this really were a matter of helping people, which some Members have suggested to be the case, then we should be working to dismantle border arrangements in a consistent way and to guarantee that people have the freedom to choose where in the world they live.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking everyone for their contribution to this debate and for the support expressed for the Commission's proposal.
We agree with the amendments intended to clarify the system that has been proposed. I am referring here to simplifying the residence permit, to the possibility of extending the reasonable reflection period on the basis of serious grounds and to the need for the victim who has been issued with a residence permit to remain available to the competent authorities.
Similarly, we can support the amendments specifying that the victim must be informed in a language they understand or that they can submit a request for asylum as well as the amendments stipulating that the decisions to withdraw or not to renew a residence permit can be appealed against and that the withdrawal of authorisation must have good reason.
We also support the amendments that seek to clarify certain concepts, such as the seriousness of the offences referred to or the examples of vulnerable persons.
We cannot, however, support the proposals that eliminate the granting of social benefits such as access to the labour market, to vocational training and to education.
We are talking about short-term residence permits and these measures will not only have a major economic impact but will above all provide an important incentive for cooperation with police authorities.
Similarly, we feel that minors must not be included in the common rules.
The provision of a specific framework that guarantees greater protection for minors, who are particularly vulnerable victims, is of the utmost importance.
Lastly, we believe that giving victims the opportunity to maintain relations with trafficking networks in order to work as informers could have terrible consequences.
We must be aware of the power of these networks, of the vulnerability of the victims and of the risk that such a solution would entail.
Lastly, we cannot accept the amendments which, although reasonable and well-founded, appear to exceed the legal basis of this instrument: I am referring to the protection of privacy, to the identification of the victim in a court case and to the recognition of harm suffered and compensation for this, which are covered in other texts, both at European and at national level.
I wish once again to thank Parliament for the support it has given this Commission initiative.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That now brings us to the next item on the agenda, but we have a slight problem. Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, is on his way here, but it will be a little while before he reaches the Chamber.
The sitting will therefore be suspended for a few minutes.
(The sitting was suspended at 9.35 a.m. and resumed at 9.45 a.m.)
The next item is the Commission statement on its contribution to the work of the European Convention.
. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the Commission will present its second contribution to the Convention on the future institutional structure of the Union.
To avoid any misunderstandings created by press reports, I would like to make it clear from the outset that, today, I am here to present, as agreed, only the text that the Commission has adopted.
The document on the Constitution of the European Union, which has been reported by the press, is nothing more than a working document, a feasibility study that Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Vitorino and I commissioned from a group of legal experts in the Commission, in order to have an initial idea of how a Treaty could be organised.
The document was essentially drawn up on the basis of the structure of the preliminary draft presented to the Convention by the Praesidium.
As it is simply, I repeat, a technical working tool, it was neither discussed by the College nor submitted for its approval, and the College has therefore no political responsibility for its content.
Although it was formulated mainly for internal use, I thought it my duty to inform Mr Giscard d'Estaing of its existence, and, for the sake of transparency, we have decided to post it on the Internet by the end of the day in order to make it available, as others have done in the past, as a working tool for the Convention and for all those interested.
To set the tone for my presentation and the subsequent debate, I would like to recall someone who played a leading role in laying the first foundations of the European project.
This is what Jean Monnet said about his famous method: 'I never thought we could change human nature.
But by changing the context in which people live, by giving them the same rules and the same democratic institutions, we can succeed in changing the way they behave towards each other.
Within the Community, Europeans are learning to live together as one and the same people.
We are not merging states, we were uniting human beings.'
If we want to look ahead, far ahead into the future, we need to climb onto the shoulders of the great statesmen who have gone before us.
That requires a responsible and humble approach, and it is with humility that I propose to follow Jean Monnet's intuition in order to meet the great challenges of the future.
To unite all the citizens of Europe, we must create true harmony between the States and between the peoples.
The debate that has taken place in recent months since the Convention opened has already clarified many unclear areas and answered many questions.
First, the debate has made it plain that citizens do not want the Union to withdraw from areas where it is present.
On the contrary, people want the Union to be more prominent in foreign policy, in justice and security and in social affairs.
Moreover, there is broad agreement on the Community method, which is at the heart of so many of our achievements.
Relations between the main institutions certainly need to be streamlined and clarified, but even the most sceptical have realised that without a strong Community element, Europe would become less effective and less democratic too.
Our contribution to the Convention seeks to respond to these concerns.
In short, it has three objectives: the Union must become more democratic, more effective and clearer.
The path to these goals has not yet been marked out in detail, but we already know where the starting and finishing lines are.
The reshaping of the Union must be grounded on its twofold nature as a Union of peoples and of States, together with a third source of the Union's legitimacy, the fact that it safeguards the common interest.
Our path must lead us to build the world's first true supranational democracy.
To give more democratic substance to our structure, we need to establish the roles and responsibilities of the main institutions more clearly.
We therefore have two proposals for reform.
The first concerns the appointment of the Commission.
The President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament by at least two-thirds of the votes cast in a secret ballot.
Once it has confirmed the appointment of the President of the Commission, the Council, by common agreement with him or her, will designate the other members of the Commission.
The European Parliament will then approve the whole Commission, as appointed by the Council.
The second innovation concerns the Commission's dual accountability to the European Parliament and the Council.
We propose that both institutions should have the right to pass a motion of censure on the Commission.
This will give the institutional triangle more balance and will strengthen the Commission's position as guarantor of the general interest.
Clearly, this is a particularly delicate and bold proposal, but, in my view, the proposed arrangement divides decision-making power more fairly between the representatives of the national governments and the representatives of the people, that is, between the Council and Parliament.
For the same reason, we propose to make codecision the rule.
All European legislation must be put forward by a Commission proposal, adopted by a majority vote in the Council and codecided by the European Parliament.
Lastly, as I have often said in this House, the time has come to put Parliament on the same footing as every other democratically elected parliament, by reforming the way the Union is financed.
Its responsibilities are typical of those of all the world's parliaments.
We want to give the European Parliament more power to make decisions on resources.
The Union's budget must therefore be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by a procedure derived from codecision, as I mentioned a moment ago.
As the Praesidium also acknowledges in its draft Constitutional Treaty, the Union must have its own resources. This would remove the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
Ladies and gentlemen, the key points in the Communication form a single unit.
The democratic legitimacy of our institutions, for example, is closely bound up with their functions.
Our main proposals in this respect can be summed up in three points. The first point is to abolish unanimous voting, as this rule has played a part in the darkest periods of the Union's recent history.
If the veto has frequently paralysed decision-making with 15 Member States, just think what could happen with 25 or more.
That is why I believe majority voting should be the rule.
However, the current system of weighting is extremely complex and a mystery to the citizens, and not just to them: experts find it impossible to understand too.
We therefore propose that the Council should take practically all decisions by a twofold, simple-majority vote, that is, a vote which represents both a majority of the Member States and a majority of the citizens.
More sensitive decisions would clearly require enhanced majorities.
The second point concerns the Presidency of the Council, an issue that has caused rivers of ink to flow.
I believe that the proposal for a President of the Union, put forward by several quarters, creates more problems than it solves.
On the one hand, it enhances the continuity and visibility of the Union, but, on the other, it denies the Member States and deprives us all of the opportunity for involvement at European level.
There are other concerns too.
Who would elect the President of the Union?
Who would this President be accountable to?
And above all, as Mr Verhofstadt remarked, what would this President do for the other 360 days of the year when the Council is not in session and George Bush is not calling?
It is clear that such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure.
We therefore recommend maintaining the system of rotation for the Presidency of the European Council, the General Affairs Council and the Committee of Permanent Representatives.
For all other Council configurations, we propose a new formula, that members of Council configurations should elect a president from one of their number, with a one-year mandate.
This formula will bring greater continuity to the Council's work and put the Presidency in the hands of persons who enjoy the full confidence of their peers.
The third point concerns our external representation.
The Union must act as one in the international arena in order to defend its values and promote its social model.
In terms of trade, the Union is already on an equal footing with the other leading players on the world stage.
Why, then, can we not be equally credible in the political arena?
This requires imagination and courage because it is vital for the Union to speak with a single voice in international politics.
What we propose is a new post of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs.
The Secretary will be appointed jointly by the European Council and the President of the Commission, and will also be a Vice-President of the Commission.
It follows that the Secretary of the Union must report personally to both the European Council and the President of the Commission.
As a member of the Commission, though, the Secretary will be jointly accountable along with the other Commissioners before the European Parliament.
As you can see, this is a major innovation, but, I repeat, it is unavoidable.
Given the magnitude of the change - and this is important - we plan to have a transitional period, at the end of which the Secretary of the Union will take full charge of his duties. I would like to outline these briefly.
The Secretary of the Union will autonomously exercise the Commission's right of initiative in foreign policy in accordance with the Council's guidelines.
The Council, or a group of Member States, may, however, ask the Secretary to present suitable proposals to the Council to achieve common objectives.
The Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs will also be responsible for implementing common decisions and, most importantly, the Secretary will be the Union's sole representative for foreign policy in relations with non-Member countries and other international bodies.
Various Union activities, such as trade and development cooperation policy, are connected with foreign policy.
Continuity in these areas will be ensured by collaboration between the Secretary of the Union and the President of the Commission who, in this respect, will coordinate matters.
The issue of the Union's external representation is also relevant to economic affairs.
Representation of the euro area in the international arena needs to be settled.
The euro's economic strength is now recognised: it also needs to become a force politically and make its presence felt in the wider world.
The third and final key point of our proposal is simplification and clarity.
The current volume of directives, decisions and regulations that combine to form our body of legislation is possibly the biggest barrier citizens face in understanding the European institutions.
The Commission believes it is time to put in order the instruments at our disposal.
We propose, therefore, to classify legislation into just three categories: organic laws adopted by enhanced majorities by the European Parliament and the Council; laws adopted by codecision by Parliament and the Council; implementing regulations adopted by the Commission in order to put these laws into effect.
The Constitutional Treaty must make a clear distinction between laws and implementing regulations.
Moreover, it must be clear who implements European legislation in practice.
We propose that the Commission should have exclusive competence for implementing - I repeat, implementing - European legislation, and, as I said, it will be accountable for this to both Parliament and the Council.
The principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology.
We therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained.
When the legislator decides to adopt laws at European level, I repeat, the Commission alone should have responsibility for their implementation.
However, where the Commission is to perform a legislative role by delegation, then it is only right that both branches of the legislative - the Council and Parliament - should be on the same footing as regards the possibility of monitoring the Commission's activity, referred to as 'call back'.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, When I quoted Jean Monnet at the start, I said that, at this stage of European integration, we need to look far ahead.
The debate aroused by the Convention in recent months has already widened our horizons.
The national parliaments and governments have believed in it right from the start, and sent major figures to represent them.
The goal of the Convention has become more ambitious.
It is no longer just a question of ensuring that the institutions work well after enlargement: it must establish the overall shape of the Union for generations to come.
I am pleased to see this development.
The Convention that Parliament and I too wanted so keenly is providing our fellow citizens and the whole world with an analysis of all aspects of our institutions.
I am also pleased that this is taking place in the light of day.
The coming months will see the emergence of a new, united Europe, and we can be proud that it will have come into being democratically and transparently.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we warmly applauded the President of the Commission just now.
I am pleased for him personally, but I am also pleased about the case he has been making.
We cannot always applaud the President of the Commission so enthusiastically.
Mr Prodi, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats wishes to sincerely thank you and the whole Commission for the work you have done.
I would also like to add that our group very much supports the Commission as regards the future of the European Union and its institutions.
That does not mean that there will not be differences of opinion between us on points of detail, and today's debate is one which forms part of a process in which we need to exchange views, and a process in which others are also involved, such as governments, with whom we ultimately need to achieve a result as well.
I believe that the most important thing in the debate over the coming months will be for the Commission and Parliament to ensure in no uncertain terms that the outcome of the Convention is underpinned by the Community method. The Community method means the institutions of the European Union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method.
I want to make this point crystal clear, and in the full public gaze: if at the end of the Convention the intergovernmental method wins the day, we could not support that.
In that respect, we are totally at one with the Commission.
We want a democratic Europe, and as far as we are concerned a democratic Europe means a representative democracy at EU level.
That means the European Parliament being closely involved in all legislative issues, as a 100% co-legislator, as Mr Romano Prodi said.
However, a democratic Europe based on representative democracy also means that we recognise the principle of subsidiarity.
If we do not want a chamber at EU level consisting of national Members of Parliament, then we also need to strive to define what tasks are European tasks.
All other tasks are tasks for the Member States of the European Union and it is the job of the Member States of the European Union to define what are national matters, what are regional matters and what are matters for local authorities.
The principle of representative democracy must apply at all four of these levels - local authorities, regions, nations and the European Union.
That implies that we need to link the Community method at EU level with the principle of subsidiarity.
We need Europe to be effective - let me emphasise that point - and to be clearer and easier to understand.
As far as we are concerned, a key issue and one linked with the Community method is that the Europe we are building should be a legal Community.
Because if it is not a legal Community it will be an intergovernmental Europe, and that would be opening the way to political opportunism, and history has shown that to be a very bad thing for Europe.
It is not possible for me to talk very much about the many points of detail in the four minutes I have at my disposal, but I urge us all to consistently be guided by the issue of method when we have individual decisions to make.
My request to the members of the Convention, and let me repeat it here, is this: make sure that the Convention achieves results.
If we do not manage to achieve any results in the Convention, and transfer this task to the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of that conference will owe less to the Community method than what we can achieve in the Convention.
That is why I am calling for our work in the Convention to be completed and for a willingness to compromise to be demonstrated in that forum, so that by the end of June 2003 we will be able to present a reasonable proposal for a European constitution.
(Applause)
Mr President, sometimes it is an advantage to be spokesman for the third group in Parliament because it has provided me with time to read the Commission's paper.
I can, therefore, say with some authority that I strongly welcome it.
It is a strong assertion of the Commission's orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies, centre stage inside the Convention.
It represents a challenge to those Prime Ministers who prefer to opine on the fringes of the Convention but who seem far too frightened to contribute official proposals.
As most of the items in the Commission's programme appear also in my draft for a federal Union it is clear that I shan't be your fiercest critic and, while I commend the firm rejection of an idea of a Super-President of the Council, I do have concerns and reservations about the proposal for an executive Presidency of the Council.
I wonder if this would not lead to more of the inconsistency and the conflict with the Commission that we have at present.
Surely it would be an improvement to follow the logic of what you propose for foreign and security policy, which is the virtual cloning of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, and to follow that practice in the other two areas where the Council enjoys executive authority.
Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its formations for economic policy and interior affairs?
Nevertheless, despite some reserves the Parliamentary delegation in the Convention will follow the principal lines of this proposal and I look forward to future close collaboration inside the Convention with Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, unlike my Liberal fellow-Member, I have not been able, in my capacity as spokesperson of the fourth group in this House, to read the Commission communication in the time available, as I have just discovered that it is 145 pages long, and I congratulate Mr Duff on his ability to speed-read this document!
Mr President, I would like to specifically mention that I welcome the fact that the Commission is at present making a substantial and constructive contribution to the Convention and has presented its views to us here at the appropriate time, because that guarantees that the Commission's contribution can be taken on board in the Convention's work.
In January we will be starting work on the actual content of the constitutional treaty, and I am sure that the Commission's proposals will play an important part then.
Mr President of the Commission, I am in agreement with the objectives you mentioned, because this is a matter of making the European Union more democratic, more efficient and more transparent.
I specifically welcome the fact that you highlighted the dual nature of the European Union as a union of Member States and a union of peoples, and I think that it is indeed one of the Convention's jobs to make the European Union the first genuinely supranational democracy in the world, as you just called it.
I would very briefly like to mention those points which, on the basis of what you have just said, I support. I have in mind the clear commitment to the Community method, your proposals for enhancing and strengthening the role of Parliament, and the extension of the codecision procedure to all legislative decisions.
I support the proposal for the European Parliament to elect the President of the Commission in future, and I also agree with your rejection of the creation of a permanent President of the Council.
I also support the proposals for law making that you have just mentioned.
I would like to touch on a problem that you did not mention in your speech, and that is the issue of dividing the treaty into two parts.
It is generally assumed that this is connected with the fact that the whole constitutional treaty is to be primary legislation.
However, no one has explained yet how that justifies splitting the constitutional treaty into two parts, and the question naturally arises of the different procedures for reviewing points of law stipulated in these two parts of the treaty.
That is why I would be interested to know, Mr President of the Commission, whether your proposal today provides for different review procedures in the constitutional treaty.
I ask because one thing is clear: under German law it would not be feasible, for example to facilitate adjustments to the 'second part' of the constitutional treaty, that is to say if it emerged that the EU was in practice to be given a 'competence competence'.
In other words, it must be clear that the second part of the treaty must also be subject to the ratification procedure by national parliaments in future, in which case, as I have already said, I would be interested to know what the Commission's line is on this.
Mr President, it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned!
There has been virtually no major stage in the history of European integration so far that did not begin with a vision on the part of the Commission, underpinned by a major plan and a White Paper.
This constitutional process is in fact the first major step where the Commission has lagged cautiously behind and has, if anything, been reactive instead of leading the way.
I nevertheless welcome what President Prodi has said.
He has summarised the results of the Convention so far, and he has come down on the side of the angels on some contentious issues - by which, if I may be so bold, I mean on the side of the European Parliament - and in particular he has come down on the side of a Community Europe, and against an intergovernmental Europe, and he has presented a whole raft of intelligent proposals.
I too have been unable to read this document as quickly as our friend Andrew Duff has, so I can only make a few limited comments.
One thing needs to be said about this paper - it does not make any sparks fly!
It does not generate any great enthusiasm or paint any broad canvases.
It does not attempt to involve the public, the citizens of Europe, in this mighty battle for power.
It is a very cautious, perhaps technocratic and certainly intelligent, and sometimes even clever paper.
Yes, you have come down in favour of the Community method, but in that case you should also have presented a bolder picture of European unity.
There are major tasks and important horizons involved in this process of European integration, but you have not presented them here.
The social dimension, which is may be the main issue on which the Convention will founder, scarcely gets a mention.
The same applies to European democracy.
This paper talks, for example, about a 'constitutional text' rather than about a constitution as such.
Yes, you are in favour of scrapping the unanimity rule, but it is nevertheless to be retained when it comes to modifying Commission proposals.
Unity and democracy are all very well, but being given power is a little more important.
As regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I cannot find any reference here to access to the European Court of Justice, which rules on fundamental rights.
The role of Parliament is to be enhanced, but the right of initiative remains exclusively that of the Commission.
Parliament is to elect the President of the Commission, but the President is also to be accountable to the Council.
And the responsibility of the Commission is far from clear, with the Commission being given greater scope for tactical manoeuvring, while the public is to gain relatively little.
I do not want to allow this to become too much of a critique.
This is a proposal that also makes the Commission Parliament's ally, but I would have liked to have seen more determination to tackle the really important tasks and to respond with a sense of vision, particularly as regards Europe's response to the dangers of globalisation, to the unprecedented intellectual and political challenge of developing a supranational democracy, of taking the separation of powers seriously, of taking the rejection of an intergovernmental Europe seriously, and of making the legislative process more open and giving the public access to all documentation.
I hope that we can still persuade the Commission not to be merely cautious in making common cause with us, but also to be our ally as regards new horizons in European integration.
President Prodi, we have listened attentively, of course, to your speech and have drawn some positive aspects from it as well as others with which we cannot agree.
This is to be expected and is healthy in a democracy.
What needs to be emphasised is that this is a significant contribution to the definition of the Europe of the future, which, alongside other contributions, will enable the Convention to continue its work to achieve a result which is based on consensus and which is politically realistic. This is the only way in which we can hope to wield some power and influence over the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
In addition to various proposals and concrete solutions that we will be discussing in the Convention and which of course reflect the position of the Commission and its idea of increasing internal power within the existing institutional framework, the main conclusion we drew from your words was the concern to answer one key question.
The fundamental issue that everyone, including the Commission, has to face is how to maintain an enlarged European Union's ability to pursue its fundamental aims of development and economic and social cohesion and freedom and security for the present and future citizens of its Member States.
We must acknowledge that European integration is an increasingly complex process, not only as a consequence of its internal dynamic, which is a victim of the natural conflict between national sovereignties and the concept of consolidating a European sovereignty, but also because this is happening against an international backdrop that is increasingly subject to the consequences and dangers of globalisation, to the threats of terrorism, to violent conflicts more or less everywhere, to financial, environmental, and energy crises as well as unemployment, exclusion and poverty.
Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that, in the Convention, all issues have been discussed openly, frankly and fairly.
We cannot have closed issues and nor must obstacles be thrown in the way of the debate.
The peoples of the current and future Member States demand and deserve this.
We feel that confidence in the Convention is, in fact, growing, because, in addition to the now traditional Community institutions, it also encompasses national institutions, in other words, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and of the candidate countries.
Without wishing to state that there are two sides involved, not least because, as a result of circumstance, all parties have become mixed up together within the Convention, and rightly so, the fact is that this national component provides added value to the debate.
I say this because, instead of there being one European public, we now have fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and later there will be even more national public opinions and it is to these that we should be addressing our words, because these have the ability to influence the direction Europe will take.
Let us speak, however, in practical terms.
What is at stake here?
In political terms, what is at stake is questioning, debating and defining 'things' as simple as the democratic legitimacy and the governability of the European Union; also at stake are the aims of the Union and its place in the world, the allocation and the definition of EU competences and their adaptation to the Community acquis, the simplification of the Union's instruments, its democracy, transparency and efficiency, the role of national parliaments, the efficiency of the decision-making process and the functioning of the institutions in an enlarged Union and the drafting or otherwise, of a European Constitution.
Everything, then, is at stake and rightly so, because this is how debates should be undertaken.
Consequently, the first question that we should ask is: what sort of Europe do we want to build?
To this end we need to define this European model in political terms.
This task is the responsibility as well as the duty of everyone.
The Commission has today once again performed this task and I could add that we have confidence - still - in the nations and, consequently, we believe in Europe.
We trust in the Nation-State, and consequently believe in a Europe based on its nations having the freedom to take decisions which is underpinned by the States having equal legal status.
We have confidence in the peoples of Europe and therefore believe in a Europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite, which is greater bureaucracy.
We have confidence in diversity and we therefore believe in a Europe that respects the traditions of its Member States, preserves their cultural heritage and safeguards their respective languages.
We have confidence in subsidiarity, and therefore believe in a Europe that does not seek to retain for itself decisions that could more advantageously be taken by the Member States.
We have confidence in solidarity, and therefore believe in a Europe in which economic and social cohesion also results in the prosperity of the peoples and of all the remote and outermost regions without exception.
We have confidence in peace, stability and security and therefore believe in a Europe that is united but not uniform, which can be mobilised by great causes, and which is governed by values and guided by principles.
I shall conclude by saying that the obvious target of the Commission's contribution to the debate here is the Convention.
The Convention is now entering the critical stage of its work, and so we hope that the proposals that it puts forward, which we would like to be politically realistic and consensual, fulfil their task of enabling the Heads of State and Government who are present at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take the best decisions on behalf of the Member States and the peoples that they represent.
This is, furthermore, our duty.
Mr President, not unexpectedly, the Commission is proposing that it be given more power.
The European Parliament and the EU's prime ministers are also agitating to be given more power.
It is not difficult to foresee the compromise at the Rome Summit in December of next year.
The prime ministers scarcely wish to relinquish foreign and security policy, so they will choose someone from the European Council to represent the EU to the outside world.
They may, for example, get Tony Blair to become the EU's first president and then make Mr Aznar President of the next Commission.
Instead of concerning itself with foreign and security policy, the Commission would be given power over the developed cooperation on juridico-political and police matters for which, of course, Mr Aznar has a special predilection.
The Commission may also be given increased executive powers, and Mr Aznar's leadership become a proper government that stands accountable.
Yes, but to whom?
It will scarcely be the European Parliament alone but, presumably, Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposed Congress in which the national parliaments too may be taken hostage and find themselves with nothing but a congress of yes men, designed for applauding the prime ministers' election of commissioners by majority voting.
In return, the European Parliament will see the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure abolished and so be given more power over expenditure.
It will also see common decision-making extended to include more areas and so be given greater influence over legislation.
The EU's prime ministers are being given more power and the Commission is being strengthened, as is the European Parliament.
When all the supranational institutions are reinforced, someone must lose out, and it is the voters, who will no longer have the final word concerning legislation in quite a few areas.
They are left with less democracy, every time that more supranational and undemocratic power is handed out in the EU.
Mr President, the draft institutional reform that the Commission is today presenting to the Convention and to Parliament, and the essence of which at least was communicated to the press two days ago, is clearly breaking new ground in its proposals on the responsibility of the Commission before the Council.
This 'innovation', however, serves as a pretext in all areas to increase the powers of the body, previously considered to be the sole guardian of Europe's general interest.
That, however, is a biased approach.
Let us take the case of the monopoly of initiative that the Commission is proposing to consolidate and to extend to the whole of what it calls the legislative domain.
Why should 20 commissioners have a better understanding of Europe's general interest than all of the governments within the Council?
Admittedly, it is said that each government protects its national interest, but their debate makes it possible to go beyond that.
The same applies to the market: each consumer protects his own selfish interest, but nevertheless, all their transactions set prices which provide the best general approach.
The Commission, with its monopoly of initiative, therefore finds itself in the position of a planner who claims to know prices better than the market.
In a world of openness, freedom and democracy, this is unacceptable.
The monopoly of initiative, strengthened by the requirement for unanimity within the Council in order to dismiss the Commission's proposals and by extending the majority needed to accept them, distorts the entire European decision-making process and certainly contributes to the rift perceived between the Union and the citizens.
In our opinion, we must reform it by taking an overview of the institutions.
Either we open up the monopoly of initiative to other players such as the European Parliament and the national parliaments, which possess an undeniable democratic legitimacy, or we maintain it, but then, in return, we are making a right of veto official for each national parliament.
