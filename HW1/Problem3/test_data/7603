Commissioner, I fear that, as the European Union and as the European Commission, we have lost the battle for our positions.
We have lost at the level of communication and I believe that we need to take particular care here.
Our message must be crystal clear.
We want a balanced and logical compromise that will cover all sectors of the Doha round.
However, any such compromise cannot be at the expense of the agricultural sector of the European Union.
Hence, for us the position is the mandate from the Council of Ministers and the revised common agricultural policy.
Finally, Commissioner, I should like you to explain to us something you have said on numerous occasions recently: what does 'the European Commission will demonstrate conditional flexibility' mean?
I fear that this is being exploited by our trading partners in order to exert greater pressure on the European Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Mandelson here today.
I listened to what the Commissioner had to say this morning.
He spoke of real cuts in agricultural subsidies by all and he used the phrase âoperating to the limit of our flexibilityâ.
I want to ask him about that flexibility and the mandate he has from the Council of Ministers with regard to trade concessions in agriculture.
Has the negotiating mandate set out in the Council conclusions and the Luxembourg Agreement changed?
While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position, I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit.
The Commissioner also said that he had negotiated alongside Commissioner Fischer Boel in Geneva last week.
Does he agree with her statement last week that if we accepted the G20 proposals in their entirety we would lose up to half a million jobs in the supply chain, with beef production in the likes of Ireland and France being wiped out and poultry production disappearing altogether?
Finally, I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that, as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait, I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is clear that the WTO crisis is deepening.
There is a risk that the failure at the WTO ministerial meeting last week to bring members closer to trade deals represents another step towards the final betrayal of the very idea of a Development Round.
Some have even said that the meeting was counterproductive, with an atmosphere even more difficult than before, but perhaps the silver lining is that developing countries are united in insisting that rich countries put development at the heart of the process as a matter of course and deliver on their extremely long-standing promises.
More than two thirds of the WTO membership â developing and least-developed countries â declared that they were prepared to make a deal, but that industrial countries have to make the greatest contribution to show real leadership.
I am glad the EU signalled that it was prepared to move closer to the G20 position, particularly by lowering domestic support, but there are still loopholes in the EU offer that would undermine the potential of a true development deal.
The US offer is of course still far removed from what is necessary to stop dumping and protect food security.
As regards the special and differential treatment in agriculture, the Development Box, it is not clear whether the Commission will support the G33 request for a significant percentage of products to be covered in order to guarantee food security.
I would be grateful if Commissioner Mandelson could set out the EU position and hopefully distinguish it from the extremely damaging proposals from the US.
On NAMA, the Commission is still demanding too much extreme liberalisation, which will threaten the very survival of some developing countriesâ local manufacturing and it is hardly in the spirit of the Development Round to demand action on applied tariff levels rather than, as usual, bound tariff levels.
It looks very unlikely that we will have an agreement in July and the timetable is too hurried.
We should have a reflection period on the reasons for the failure of the Doha Round.
We must learn lessons from this and ensure things are better processed through a much reformed WTO and obtain a clear understanding of the role of trade and delivering sustainable development.
Perhaps in that way we can devise a Development Round generally worthy of the name.
Â Â  . Mr President, what we are debating this afternoon is not just what has emerged from the WTO meeting in Geneva but also the future of the WTO as an institution.
The crisis within the WTO makes it more likely that the institution will no longer be able to act as anything more than an arbitrator and will no longer be able to take the initiative in proposing new rules, with the consequent threat of world trade being once more in thrall to innumerable bilateral agreements.
I have three questions I would like to put to Commissioner Mandelson.
Firstly, are all the parties involved in the trade talks fully aware of just how urgent it is that the Doha round be brought to a good conclusion?
My second question follows on from the first and it is this: what is the Commissionerâs view as regards the role of the United States and the G-20, and to what degree, Commissioner, do you think they are willing to take action?
My third question is the most urgent.
Is the Commission clear in its own mind about what it will do if the Doha round fails, and what sort of agenda does it have prepared for that eventuality?
I want to put to the Commission two proposals as regards this trade agenda.
Above all else, the way ahead through multilateral agreements must be kept open for as long as possible.
Bilateral agreements always present world trade with innumerable sorts of trade rules that make it less manageable and less effective.
On top of that, they also present the threat of a new economic protectionism.
My second proposal has to do with the role of developing countries, which must not be allowed to fall victim to the power of any future bilateral agreements.
The Commission must offer such countries technical support in order that they may not, in negotiations, lose out to the big ones.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commissioner, not just for coming here today to listen to the debate, but also for the help I believe he gave to Members of Parliament in Geneva last week.
I could not be there, but they did express their thanks for the way he kept them informed.
I got the impression from your address, Commissioner â which I thought was quite frank â that, to choose my words carefully â and I could have used stronger words â you were pretty fed up with the way the US was involved in the negotiations.
In fact, it would appear that it was pretty intransigent.
Although you cannot always believe what you read in the press, according to a press release you had asked the US trade representative, Susan Schwab, what she would be able to offer if the EU were to give the US everything it wanted on market access.
Apparently she was unable to answer that.
I wonder whether the US has a mandate.
When we were in Hong Kong, Rob Portman seemed never to be able to negotiate.
Whenever I listened to him, there was a particular problem with West African cotton.
Certainly when producers lobbied him in Hong Kong he got very upset and seemed not to be able to make any comment.
That was not a big issue for the United States and not a big issue in terms of trade, but it was very important.
What is the fallback position if nothing happens in the next month in the negotiations?
Where do we go?
What is the situation?
On a minor point, Mrs Harkin mentioned agriculture.
What is the position?
There is a huge worry, certainly in the United Kingdom and, I am sure, across Europe about hormone beef coming into the European Union under a trade negotiation with the US.
Is there a real risk that might happen, or can we stop it?
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that the World Trade talks are in serious crisis, but I hope Members will not talk us into an assured failure.
It is clear that a successful round depends on tackling agriculture.
With up to 85% of their populations living in rural areas it is not surprising that the worldâs poorest countries will judge any package on the basis of its impact on their farmers.
What I find more baffling, frankly even inexplicable, is the notion that the talks could flounder on the US and to a lesser extent the EU position on agriculture.
Agriculture represents only 2% of our wealth, therefore it seems perverse to make this a sticking point when we have so much to gain from improved non-market agricultural access and in particular from services liberalisation.
Since the beginning of the Doha round, the EU has undergone substantial CAP reform.
In Hong Kong we offered to end agricultural export subsidies by 2013; our Everything but Arms scheme offers duty-free access for products from the poorest countries.
While I believe we can and should go further and I commend the Commissioner for his flexibility, particularly the flexibility he showed in Geneva, this is a flexibility that is sadly lacking in our negotiating and trading partners.
What I would like to ask the Commissioner, given his extensive contacts with other negotiators, is whether he can tell this House what sort of package he believes it is necessary for the United States to put on the table in order to break this log-jam.
Susan Schwab has indicated that she remains committed to a successful outcome.
What does she need to bring to the table to show that the US is prepared to put its farm subsidies where its mouth is?
Â Â  Mr President, we seem to lose sight of the development aspect of the Doha Development Round as it grinds on.
There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations.
There have been noticeable losses to countries like Mauritius, which now run the risk of being relegated to the category of poorest countries.
There have also been major losses for Irish agriculture.
Recently a farmer â who is a third-generation sheep farmer â took me to see his last flock of sheep.
In our once flourishing sugar industry, the lights have been switched off and the door closed in our last factory.
Although I would like to see some tangible progress for the poorest nations, I suppose I should be grateful that in this latest round of talks no more Irish agriculture has been given away.
However, if the Commissioner needs to find leverage to shift the US position, I suggest that he works to get GM crops categorised separately from their natural equivalents.
This would give us and the least-developed countries a distinct advantage over the US, which would find it hard to separate GM crops and natural equivalents.
When the Commissioner does that, would he also again talk to Commissioner Fischer Boel about allowing countries in Europe to have GM-free status?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Mandelson for the spirit of openness he showed the four of us who made up Parliamentâs delegation in Geneva last weekend.
It was very rewarding and I think that we cooperated very well.
There is an intrinsic value in us obtaining a new WTO agreement.
Doing so requires confidence, both in the WTO and in multilateralism itself.
It is, after all, the only system that has delivered real liberalisations of world trade.
I do believe, however, that we are right to demand more than just an agreement from all the parties.
We deserve an ambitious agreement, an agreement that provides greater market access for both agricultural products and industrial goods for everyone, both in industrialised countries and in developing countries, and one that does not leave out services.
This is a crucial matter if poor countries are to develop, but also if our own European companies are to have access to new markets.
In the long term, no one would gain from a âDoha lightâ deal or a complete failure of the Doha Round.
I therefore do not believe that there is any justification for the entrenched positions that we see many of the parties taking up at the moment.
It is easy to see the problems with the negotiations.
The economic reality should be enough to convince all the parties to make that little bit of extra effort, particularly the EU-Brazil-USA triangle that was so much in the spotlight over the weekend in Geneva.
All of these countries have strong practical reasons to take a further step.
In the USA, for example, even the most dogmatic advocates of agricultural protectionism should be able to see that it is better to give up their agricultural subsidies in the course of the negotiations and receive market access to key regions in exchange, rather than to be forced to give them up by a dispute settlement body following a breakdown of the talks, and then receive nothing at all in exchange.
The sugar panel that came down against us and made us reform our subsidies to sugar producers ought to have given us the same insight.
The EU should also understand that it is absurd to fail to secure much more important market openings for industrial goods and services as a result of clinging on to an agricultural subsidy that we all know is fundamentally untenable.
It is therefore pleasing that the Commission appears to have come closer to meeting the demand from the G20, the group of advanced developing countries, to reduce the high levels of customs duties on agricultural products.
This is crucial if we are to salvage the prospects of achieving an agreement.
We must now ensure that we apply a flexible approach only in connection with genuinely vulnerable products and not in order to satisfy those special interests with the loudest voices.
If anyone should understand the importance of trade without customs and barriers then it should be us, here in Europe.
We, who see the benefit of it every day through the internal market.
Â Â  â I was part of Parliamentâs delegation in Geneva and I should like to share a couple of positive points with you: the first was the positive cooperation between the Commission and the MEPs that were there.
As previous speakers have said, there was daily contact with MrÂ Mandelson and MrÂ Fisher Boel.
This ensured that there was a constant flow of information, which meant that the MEPs could achieve more.
The second is the image of the EU as a proactive bloc that is prepared to negotiate, in contrast with other partners, in particular the United States.
On the downside, there is no doubt that the negotiations did not achieve a great deal, which is bad for the world and for Europe.
In Europe we need to strengthen competitiveness, growth and employment.
To this end, we need to ensure effective access for industrial companies â non-agricultural market access (NAMA) â and for more dynamic services to markets; we need to guarantee respect for intellectual property and to negotiate an environmental and social level playing field that regulates international competition.
I have one or two questions.
Firstly, what is Europe's actual ability to find a solution, even a partial one, to these problems in the Doha round?
Secondly, if, as we expect, an agreement is not reached in July, what strategy will the EU adopt?
You mentioned a new set of proposals in September.
Can you give us some details about that?
Third question; is the great difficulty in achieving results at the current Doha Round down to routine problems or does the multilateral model of the worldwide harmonisation of trade, which I am personally in favour of, need to be completely revamped and perhaps supplemented?
Â Â  Mr President, as Commissioner Mandelson knows, increased trade and prosperity go together.
Increased trade and prosperity means a reduction in migration, a more stable society and peace.
The Third World needs as big a share of world trade as anyone else, but the current regime of tariffs and subsidies stifles it.
Why not drop barriers against the Third World in return for domestic, legal and infrastructural progress?
The EU will not look again at tariffs before 2013 and precious time will be lost.
Now we come to the issue of globalisation.
Why on earth are such high tariffs being put on shoes from China?
Are we afraid of Chinaâs massive population out-producing Europe?
We must think again; trade is a two way thing.
Buying from China means that 500 million Europeans will get an entry into a market of 1.3 billion Chinese.
That is an enormous opportunity for European producers.
So I would urge the Commissioner to please have the courage and the daring to reduce tariffs and subsidies drastically and stimulate free trade worldwide.
Let us not just talk about reducing poverty and making poverty history, but let us take real concrete steps to promote trade, which offers the only real solution.
Â Â  Mr President, what I want to say to CommissionerÂ Mandelson and his staff is: many congratulations on the success of the negotiations over the past few weeks!
It has proved possible, once and for all, to pass the buck to the United States; the European Union has at last managed to escape from its assigned role of stonewaller, and it is plain for all to see that the time has come for the others to make their moves.
Another good thing is that the parties to the negotiations took their leave of each other at the weekend in an atmosphere of calm, rather than, as they did after Hong Kong, laying into each other at the tops of their voices, and that gives cause for hope in the coming weeks.
One ought not realistically to be able to expect a result by June or a line to be drawn under it by then.
A number of things, though, will be important over the weeks to come.
For a start, our economy needs markets to be really open, particularly in the emerging economies.
Secondly, there must be no unilateral concessions where agriculture is concerned.
Thirdly, not even in the next few weeks must there be any premature political deals.
Fourthly, a bad result would be even worse than none at all, for it would be a disaster for our national economies if we were to offer acrossâthe-board reductions in customs duties and subsidies in the agricultural sector or in NAMA without getting in return real improvements in market access for industrial products.
Fifthly, it is absolutely vital that the European representatives to the G8 summit should raise the subject of the Doha round and put it at the top of the agenda there.
It is vital to all the interested parties that this round should not fail, but should instead be able to yield gains in prosperity for all WTO members on the basis of clear and unambiguous results.
With this in mind, I wish all the EU negotiators all the best for the coming weeks, in the shape of tenacity, luck and success.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for what has been a very constructive and helpful debate.
I would like to thank those who have supported the Commission in its negotiating stance and its negotiating approach.
It is never easy finally to judge precisely the best thing to do at the best time, but we do our best and I think it is true to say that amongst the key negotiating partners the EU has considerable support for the approach that we are taking.
This is not as important as the support we have from our own side, from our own Member States and from the Members of this House.
I shall make one observation immediately.
We have a number of interests in these negotiations â agricultural, non-agricultural, relating to services liberalisation and rules.
Our job as negotiators is to get an outcome that is balanced across the range of those negotiating subjects.
We will give in some places more than we will give in other places.
There will be swings, there will be roundabouts, we will gain, and we will lose.
Nobody can make a final judgement about what Europe will be able to gain from these talks until the very end â not simply when the key modalities are put in place, as I hope they will be this summer, but when all the other negotiations have taken place on the individual country schedules and when all the negotiations about rules have also been put in place.
It is very important that those who are particularly concerned about agriculture in Europe understand and accept that we will not pay over the limits in agriculture for what we want elsewhere in the talks.
We will do what is fair.
We will do what is reasonable.
We will do what is in our mandate as far as agriculture is concerned.
That is clear to me.
It should also be clear to our Member States.
Having said that, it is important to keep a sensible perspective in these negotiations.
We must be careful not to devote such energy to protecting our defensive interests in agriculture in these negotiations that we fail to prioritise our offensive interests in non-agricultural market access and in services.
There really must be a sense of proportion and balance as regards how we weigh the various economic and social interests that are at stake here.
As far as the United States is concerned, let me just say this in response to one speech: I do not feel that, should the talks fail, we as European negotiators are in a race with the United States to see who can shift the blame most effectively to the other.
I look to the United States as a genuine partner, as a country and an economy that shares some of our interests but at the same time places a different emphasis from us in various areas of these negotiations.
We will not reach a successful conclusion unless the EU and the US work together as a team â not at the expense of other negotiating partners, not instead of sensible negotiations and links and agreements that we will have with our negotiating partners in various areas of the negotiations.
However, if at the end of the day the EU and the US are at loggerheads and simply cannot agree the ground on which they will stand together to bring these talks to a successful conclusion, then there will be no successful conclusion to these talks.
We will lose from that, the United States will lose from that, the global economy will lose from that and in particular developing countries will lose from that.
I should like to thank Members who have spoken, including those who have asked what my Plan B is if these talks fail.
I am afraid I am not preparing for failure: I am going to continue to negotiate for success only, whether it be in relation to hormone beef, which is not part of these negotiations â we do not welcome US hormone-treated beef in the European Union for health reasons, not trade reasons â or in relation to GMOs, which again are not the subject of these talks and where our policy firstly has to be in line with the regulatory framework we adopted in the EU a few years ago and in line with WTO rules.
It is this that governs our approach, rather than something I am negotiating in these talks.
I am glad that we â the Commission and Members of this Parliament â are able to cooperate in Geneva and elsewhere.
I do not cooperate with this Parliament as an act of generosity on my part.
There is nothing altruistic about this.
The reason I cooperate is because I want the Members of the European Parliament there on these occasions.
You give me valuable insights, you collect information and intelligence, you are able to tap different sources of opinion, which I do not always have easy access to, and you are also, on a good day, able to help us deliver a message to our negotiating partners.
That is why I welcome Members of this Parliament being present and why I shall remain very firmly in cooperation with you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the origin marking of certain imported products (O-0065-2006 â B6-0316/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliamentâs Committee on International Trade, while I note what the Commissioner has just said about the excellent climate of cooperation and joint work between Parliament and the Commission, I would like in this case to express my regret about a small incident relating to the formal communication of this proposal to Parliament for information, which has prevented us from reacting properly, although we are still in time.
I am aware that this proposal was sent within the documents of the 133 Committee, communicated as usual by the Commissionâs secretariat to the secretariat of the Committee on International Trade.
Nevertheless, I would like to point that, for both practical reasons and on principle, informal communication does not replace formal notification of Parliament for information purposes.
In any event, Commissioner, I would like to make it clear that we do not believe that the Commission has acted intentionally, and we can therefore start dealing with the issue itself, which is very important to the Europeans.
Firstly, with regard to the fundamental issue, I would like to point out that I am in favour of your proposal to establish an obligatory system of origin marking in the European Community.
I believe that this initiative moves in the right direction.
In short, the proposed origin marking system will inform European consumers of the precise country of origin of the products they buy.
It moves in the direction of things we have approved previously, such as the traceability of agricultural products.
The European Commission rightly sees consumers' rights as an important, even constitutional, priority.
Nevertheless, it makes little sense to have rights if one does not have the information required to make them effective.
Freedom of choice does not exist if consumers are not in a position to exercise it properly.
If they are to have confidence, consumers must be satisfied with the degree of information and protection they are provided with.
In fact, there can be no trade without confidence.
A precise origin marking will not just benefit consumers, since this proposed Regulation will also have beneficial effects for European industry.
Our products must increasingly be associated with a high level of quality and style.
That is what will allow us to survive in the globalised world, in sectors with such high levels of quality and design as textiles, clothing, jewellery and footwear, for example, and also automobiles, since that is another sensitive sector.
Consumers throughout the world are often prepared to pay more when they know that a product has been manufactured in the European Union and that is one of the 'natural' advantages that we must safeguard.
In relation to the negotiations this weekend in the WTO, I would also say that I believe that such a sensitive issue to Europe as geographical indications is relevant to this line of thinking: we must safeguard what characterises us at world level.
This is therefore a point on which we fully support the Commission: we do not understand the attitude of many European Union States which are currently blocking the decision in the Council.
We believe that this is an important step towards increasing our presence and competitiveness at world level and I believe that this falls within our collective responsibilities.
The Commission and the Members States should not just listen to the views of importers, wholesalers or companies that have already relocated their production to other continents, however respectable they may be.
They should also listen to the legitimate demands of consumers and of European industry, which needs to accept this origin marking.
This is also a question of justice.
Our main trading partners impose the âMade in Europeâ upon us, so why do we, for our part, not contribute to increasing the prestige of this marking?
Globalising does not mean surrendering our experience and capacity, it means strengthening them.
I hope that the Member States who are opposed to this fair initiative in the Council will understand that.
Â Â  , . Mr President, I should like to start by saying that this Commission and I, as Commissioner for Trade, are fully committed to working very closely with Parliament, in line with the framework agreement governing relations between the two institutions.
As this question rightly points out, the legal basis for this measure â Article 133 of the EC Treaty â does not provide specifically for consultation of the European Parliament on this proposal for an âorigin markingâ scheme.
However, in line with our commitment to keep the European Parliament fully informed, on a par with the Council, of the conduct and conclusion of international negotiations, as well as legislative initiatives, the proposal and the accompanying impact assessment were transmitted on 12 January 2006 to the European Parliament via the Committee on International Trade.
I should like to refer to paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution that you have before you.
The language of that paragraph is slightly unfortunate because it could, as it is written at the moment, be read as if the Commission had not sent any document at all on âorigin markingâ to Parliament.
As I said, we sent it as an Article 133 document to the INTA Committee.
I believe that it would certainly be fairer to me and to the Commission â and more accurate â if an adjustment were made to the wording.
Our intention has been, and continues to be, to act in line with both the letter and the spirit of the framework agreement.
To meet the commitment in that agreement, and in addition to the many formal and informal contacts that I have with you, the Commission tries hard to share a maximum of information with Parliament, just as I did last week in Geneva.
In particular we sent to the INTA Committee copies of all policy documents that are being discussed in the Councilâs 133 Committee.
If a more formal interinstitutional way to bring this issue to your attention should have been used on that occasion, the opportunity was certainly not missed on purpose.
I very much welcome the interest you have already shown in this proposal through several questions on the subject, which we have answered.
So let me now come to our proposal.
We have proposed a mandatory origin marking scheme, to create transparency about the origin of certain imported goods according to a single standard by which origin is determined.
This system will allow consumers to take informed decisions; it will reduce the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking.
We believe it will help improve the image of European goods and will help our competitiveness.
While it is clear that âmade inâ marking as such does not contain information on the social, labour or environmental conditions in the country of production, origin information helps the consumer to choose between different available alternatives according to their preferences and the background information they already have.
As regards WTO compatibility, the Commission believes its proposal is in line with international rules, notably Article 9 of the GATT. That provides that WTO members may adopt and enforce laws and regulations relating to marks of origin on imports, notably to protect consumers against fraudulent or misleading indications.
Concerning the enforcement of the proposal, the Commission considers that customs authorities are well placed to ensure that the requirements of the proposed scheme are respected, just as they do with many other rules on environmental, health and technical issues.
That part of customs work is crucial to ensuring that our businesses can trade on a level playing field and that consumers draw the full benefits of globalisation.
I should add that in addition to possible controls carried out before the products are released into the internal market, the regulation provides for Member States to check origin marking on goods that are already on the market.
That should enable Member States to draw on other expertise in policing the scheme, for example by working with those who are presently involved in the enforcement of national rules concerning the voluntary use of origin marking.
As you will be aware, Mr President, the Commission proposal is being debated in the Council and I am of course ready to keep you informed as discussions on the proposal move forward.
Â Â  Mr President, I totally endorse what the Commissioner said.
What I can never understand in these situations is why a country â and I can think of one in particular, because we had this problem in Hong Kong â is so afraid of having its own name on a product.
If you look, for example, at Canada, it almost seems frightened to have its name on products.
These countries should be proud of it and see it as a wonderful opportunity.
It is not a question of protecting EU trade, of protecting EU jobs; it surely is a question of protecting the consumer across the world.
I therefore find the attitude of these non-EU countries difficult to understand.
Having said that, perhaps we ought first of all to put our own House in order and have country-of-origin marking within the EU, which we do not seem to have at the moment.
That might help considerably.
The Commissioner briefly mentioned one issue that is particularly important: counterfeiting and fraud.
Origin marking would be of considerable help there.
But I say again that while the matter may not come under this remit â and the Commissioner was quite right to say I was wrong in assuming that hormone beef was part of the trade negotiations â all this is connected with world trade and it is the kind of issue that will come up.
I do not want to see origin marking as a non-trade barrier.
I want to see it as an opportunity for countries outside the European Union to be able to be proud of what they produce, providing it is produced â and here I totally agree with the Commissioner â to the same standards that we have within the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin on certain products imported from third countries is unquestionably very important, and represents noteworthy progress in implementing the principles of fairness and transparency in international trade.
Origin marking contains a great deal of information enabling European consumers to make more informed choices.
This, right away, enhances their rights considerably.
These new arrangements can and should have additional impact, insofar as a clearer comparison can be made of the expected quality of a product, and the processes involved in making that product.
At the point of purchase of the products covered by this proposal, European consumers will, among other things, be in a position to compare various approaches to environmental, social and safety, and other such important issues.
It is plausible that this may have a very positive knock-on effect on European production, and especially SMEs and the sectors most vulnerable to external competition.
Such effects should not be seen as the result of adopting a protectionist stance, but as the fruit of a tighter approach to transparency and fairness.
Taking a firm decision to go down this route may, according to the European public, lead to the pursuit of a process of gradual liberalisation of international trade, thereby ensuring it is not wooed by the appeal of protectionist, anti-liberal rhetoric, which is always capable of rising to the surface on all sides of the political spectrum.
This is therefore a fair and timely proposal that should be implemented at the earliest opportunity.
Those opposed have not presented any salient arguments against it.
The Commission should implement the initiatives that will help overcome any lingering resistance, so that the EU can take this vitally important step towards promoting genuinely free and fair trade.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compulsory origin marking proposed by the Commission must be supported because it has a dual purpose: to make Europeans, as consumers, better informed and to optimise the industrial system of those European countries that are investing a large amount of resources in innovation, with the aim of transforming their production apparatus into something of excellence.
We must strive for equal rules with those trade areas â China, the US, Canada, Japan â that have already introduced origin marking to be restored to a minimum level, in the knowledge that such a move does not bring with it any risk of illegality.
A more transparent market and more controls are needed, legal uncertainty needs to be reduced, and counterfeiting and unfair competition need to be clamped down on.
The compulsory origin marking of imported goods may be indirectly or directly useful in all of this.
It would not incur extra costs for producers, exporters or European consumers, thus making it easier to create a level playing field with those trade partners that have already implemented the standard, in line with the political and cultural decision that was and is aimed at creating, expanding and strengthening an increasingly large and free world market.
Compulsory origin marking will also make it possible to promote the high-quality, and I stress high-quality, manufacturing industry in many European countries, which is wrongly regarded as inconsequential.
This attitude is, in itself, also a major social issue that Europe must not overlook if the Lisbon objectives are to be pursued in practical terms rather than with abstract statements.
Finally, this is an opportunity to put some questions to the Commission.
What is the Commissionâs strategy when it comes to strengthening the external aspects of European competitiveness, given the extremely close relationship between industry and trade, between production and promotion?
What resources does the Commission intend to use in order to strengthen these aspects?
Why has the Commission confined itself to including in the proposal only products from those sectors that asked to be included and not extended it to all industrial products, as the United States has instead done?
These are a few questions that it seems only natural to ask in an increasingly globalised world, which must develop freely, without protectionism, but which must do so while also respecting the rules that govern the general interest, above all of the citizens and of consumers.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate enables us to make two contrasting observations to the Commission.
On the one hand, in fact, we condemn the fact that the Commission did not inform Parliament of the initiatives undertaken with regard to origin marking.
This constitutes a breach of the Interinstitutional Framework Agreement of 26Â May 2005, and I do not believe that a justification citing ArticleÂ 133 of the Treaty can be accepted.
On the other hand, however, the content of the proposal, on which Parliament has nevertheless succeeded today in issuing its opinion, enables me to express the support of my entire group for a long-awaited initiative that has already been warmly praised in the past by Italyâs centre-right government.
Yet, it is an initiative that some people still insist on not supporting, demonstrating political short-sightedness and a lack of interest in consumers.
Origin marking for certain categories of highly important products, from footwear to clothing, is wrongly seen by some people and in some sectors as a measure that has the same effect as trade barriers.
That is not so; one need only point out precisely that famous ArticleÂ 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, ArticleÂ 9 of the GATT and the recent opinion of the Councilâs Legal Service.
What is more, major trade partners and competitors of the Union, such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada, have equipped themselves with legislation on this matter.
By adopting a regulation on origin marking, Europe too would at last be putting itself on an equal footing with the countries mentioned above, and be preventing unjustified discrimination that would heavily penalise not only European producers, but especially all consumers, including non-European consumers.
The origin marking of products represents a guarantee for consumers that they are finally in a position to link their choices to safety and quality assessments, in addition to assessments of the social and environmental conditions existing in the country in which the products originate.
We need to proceed with transparency and clarity, criteria that are demanded by everyone but then all too often ignored.
We call on the Commission to do everything in its power to ensure that the Member States adopt a determined approach to consumer protection, which can be guaranteed only by the rules in force within the Union, rules that protect quality and safety, and by the label of origin, which guarantees that no one, either inside or outside the EU, can bypass those criteria.
We call on the Commission subsequently to monitor the application of the rules, in terms both of labels of origin and of product composition, and we are grateful to the Commission for its swift action, because the swifter the action, the greater the protection of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, protectionists are reluctant to admit that their proposals are protectionist but, rather, often hide their intentions.
Mandatory origin marking is an example of this.
I think now is the time to kill off some of the myths that the protectionists are spreading about this particular proposal.
The first myth is that consumers are calling for this measure, but the truth is that most do not care.
The advocates use the Commissionâs internet consultation on this issue to back them up, but they neglect to mention that 96.7% of the responses came from a single country, namely Italy, where industry is the driving force on this issue.
The second myth is that marking gives consumers relevant information, but in the global marketplace products and components more often than not have multiple countries of origin.
It can be directly misleading to specify a single country of origin.
The third myth is that marking strengthens European competitiveness, but new technical barriers to trade to protect European industry have nothing to do with competitiveness, which is strengthened only by open markets within a good business environment.
The fourth myth is that mandatory marking would provide more consumer protection, as if safety were a question of geography.
This could, at the very most, be of relevance in the case of agricultural products, but they are exempt from this proposal.
The final myth is that it is an inexpensive proposal, but the Commission's own impact assessment states, for instance, that imported clothes would, on average, be EURÂ 1 to 1.50 more expensive, while a pair of shoes would be EURÂ 2 dearer.
Thus the cost would be in the millions, maybe even the billions.
In my opinion, origin marking is a badly disguised form of protectionism that will be expensive, and all this merely in order to force on foreign competitors new barriers to trade that do not qualify as tariffs.
Why else would there be such a clear repudiation of the idea of introducing âMade in the ECâ labelling, something that is dismissed by saying that it would create unnecessary costs for European producers?
It is currently prohibited to require origin marking by other Member States, as that constitutes protectionism.
To now require it of third countries without recognising that, in this case too, it is protectionism, smacks of hypocrisy, in my view.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, who regularly draws attention to the Council's lack of tact when it does not involve Parliament sufficiently in decisions on international trade.
We have a long way to go to get the governments to understand the need to get the citizens, and therefore their legitimate representatives here in Parliament, involved in major decisions on international trade.
I would also like to congratulate MrÂ Sturdy on his wisdom in working towards this compromise.
I will be voting in favour of the joint resolution, even though it regrettably restricts itself to taking note of the draft regulation on origin marking.
Clearer political support will be needed in future, in view of the marked divisions in the European Council.
Unfortunately, the text of the draft regulation contains some editorial errors, and would benefit from some operational clarifications.
For example, Article 3(2) of the French version of the draft regulation refers to the Member State '' ['where the goods must be marked'].
It is clear that this reference should be to the destination Member State, as the goods are marked in the country of manufacture, not in the State where they are sold.
Turning to the operational clarifications, we absolutely must, for example, clarify the concept of the 'last substantial processing', which determines the origin of goods whose production involved more than one country, in accordance with ArticleÂ 24 of the Community Customs code.
Finally, we need to ensure consistency with customs legislation, particularly in the context of the control procedures planned for the future reform of the Community Customs Code, of which the Committee on International Trade would like to be informed, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the traceability of products and, in more general terms, intangible elements are elements that add value to products, are necessary in the fight against fraud and counterfeiting and, finally, are a vital tool in the economic and social battle awaiting us.
This economic, social, and also environmental battle, as you know, is a battle for respect for our values.
If we want our convictions to be respected, with regard to both social and environmental clauses in international trade agreements, we must require imported products to be traceable, and our internal market will be an important weapon in this battle.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am glad that almost every Member who has contributed to this debate has supported the original proposal made by the Commission.
Very properly, some important questions have been raised about our ability to meet new customs codes, etc. These are important technical issues that we shall continue to address and to discuss with Members of this House.
However, overwhelmingly, there is support for the essence â the principle â of our proposal.
If we can overcome our disagreement about the method or manner or channel of depositing this proposal with Parliament, we would benefit from concentrating subsequently on the substance of this proposal.
Very simply, it seeks to re-establish a level playing field with our trading partners, many of whom have already instituted forms of origin marking.
It creates transparency about the origin of goods and establishes a single standard by which origin is determined.
It permits informed consumer decisions.
It reduces the incidence potentially of fraudulent or misleading origin marking and it contributes to improved competitiveness.
For the consumer to be king â or queen â the consumer needs full information, or as much information as possible.
I do not think it is unreasonable that amongst the information that consumers receive is the place of origin of the production or supply of particular goods.
Let me just stress that it is not a âbuy Europeâ campaign.
Products will not be stamped âThis is foreign â do not buy itâ!
That is not part of my or the Commissionâs motivation.
Indeed, the more people know about the origin of goods and come to associate that origin with particular features or the quality of those goods, it may encourage them to buy those goods from those sources and places of origin.
Why not?
However, that is not the point.
The point is not whether we want to encourage people to buy goods from particular places of origin or discourage them from doing so, but to give them the information to enable them to make an objective judgement about where they purchase goods.
I hope that Members of this House will see the âorigin markingâ proposal as an alternative to protectionist instincts and measures and not as paving the way for them.
I do not believe that we run the risk of putting up new non-tariff barriers to trade.
I would certainly be very resistant to that.
People in Europe are entitled to express or to demonstrate whatever preferences they have.
Those preferences will include the origin or source of production of those goods.
This is no more than a simple way of enabling them to do so.
Â Â  In accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolutions(1) at the end of the debate.
I would point out that the Committee on International Trade has withdrawn its motion for a resolution B6-0381/2006.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Somalia(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to start off this debate, which I am sure will, as usual, meet with considerable agreement from all sides of this House.
I dare say we will also have considerable agreement from the Commissioner, though I would point out that the Commission usually does agree with us and that is encouraging.
As a fellow native of the British Isles â although I come from the Scottish European rather than the Anglo-Saxon political tradition â I would ask Commissioner Mandelson to engage in some discussion with us today, unlike his Commissioner colleagues.
Would he outline in particular what the Commission thinks of paragraphs 8 and 6 of this motion for a resolution and, crucially, what the Commission is going to do about them?
It is difficult to look at Somalia and feel anything but sadness and frustration.
It presents us with a fundamental dilemma.
If the locals, left to their own devices, get it wrong, in our eyes at least, what, short of stepping in and running their country, can we actually do?
Military engagement is not our way.
We do not have the stomach or the appetite for it, or indeed the wherewithal for such action.
So what can we do?
As a Scot, I look with admiration at the role that Sweden and Norway, small independent Northern European countries, have played in promoting dialogue within Somalia and the parties there.
As a humanitarian, I look with pride at the humanitarian aid we have given.
The discussions in the newly formed international Somalia Contact Group are going to be crucial to the strategy which this motion sets out.
The discussions in that group are the only way forward in terms of finding a solution.
Continued engagement in dialogue, sweetened by aid to those most in need, is the European way, and in the long term that is far and away the most successful.
Right now Somalia has taken a turn for the worse.
Hopefully Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, can help to bring it back on track.
I look forward to hearing from our Commissioner as to how the Commission will spearhead those efforts, and I assure him of this Houseâs support.
Â Â  . Mr President, when considering the case of Somalia, I think it is worth taking something of a backward look into its history.
What the West did to Somalia involved the application of every bad policy imaginable.
Let us recall the intervention in 1993, which ended up as a fiasco.
Germany had stationed troops there, who were meant to be supporting Indian troops, but these never actually turned up.
We have to face up to the fact that, as soon as the troops were withdrawn, there was scarcely any interest in Somalia any more.
Things in Somalia have now rearranged themselves.
The coalition, whose members are described as Islamists, have, slowly but surely, achieved military dominance, and the troops that the press describe as being supported by the USA â the Warlords Alliance, that is â have been pushed further and further back.
It is obvious that the US administration, in particular, has backed the wrong horse and now sees its own policies in virtual ruins.
The question now arises as to what the European Union can do about this state of affairs.
It would be quite utterly wrong to support one of the parties to the conflict on the ground, and it needs to be stressed above all that since, at the moment, Ethiopia and Eritrea have a manifest and considerable interest in using Somalian territory as a place in which to settle their differences by force of arms, it is very important that the European Union should, through diplomatic channels, make it perfectly plain to both of them that this is just not on.
As things stand at present, I see absolutely no sense whatever in foreign military intervention in Somalia, within which there are certain regions that are stable; Somaliland is one of them.
For that reason, no troops must be sent, nor must there be any support for the deployment of them, or else we will again end up with what has come to pass often enough already, namely, the creation of a Frankensteinâs monster, for support was given to this or that grouping, which then did the very thing that it was intended should be avoided.
I therefore urge that any action there on the part of the European Union be diplomatic in character.
Â Â  . Mr President, Somalia has not had effective government for more than 15 years now.
Instead we have seen bitter and tragic civil war between warring factions, Islamic militia and factions controlled by rival war lords.
On 4 June 2006, to the surprise of many, the Islamic Courts militia took control of much of southern Somalia, including the capital Mogadishu â partially destroyed by now â when they drove out the powerful faction leaders who had controlled Mogadishu since 1991, when the central administration was toppled.
That has dramatically changed the political landscape in the region and the power shift has left the outside world in an unsure position as to with whom it should or could negotiate and develop a relationship.
What is required from the EU is to recognise what has happened and to support the work to date of the Arab League, for example, which initiated a dialogue in Khartoum on 22 June between the Transitional Federal Government institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts, which controls the south.
They have agreed for now not to fight each other and to engage in dialogue for peace and reconciliation.
We must also support the efforts of the African Union to monitor and, if necessary, enforce peace to protect civilians.
The truth is that serious concern exists on a number of levels.
The first concern is what to make of the Union of Islamic Courts.
Is it a body that can be trusted and a partner for peaceful discussion?
I know that the US has recently opened a dialogue with various parties about prospects for confidence-building measures.
The other, and more real, concern is that in an effort to achieve stability and an end to violence, strict and fundamentalist Islamic law will be enforced on large populations.
That is very worrying and the concern is well founded.
Yesterdayâs media reports of a cinema crackdown in Somaliaâs Galgadud region, where two people were shot after protests following the closure of a cinema there, are of great concern.
Also yesterday, the Islamic Courts vowed to practice Sharia Law throughout the country and, in particular, in Mogadishu.
Sheikh Abdullah, one of the co-founders of the Union, said yesterday: âHe who does not perform prayer will be considered an infidel and our Sharia Law orders that person to be killedâ.
That kind of language is inflammatory and dangerous.
The EU needs to monitor what is happening carefully and be careful which sides it supports.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, for many years now the people of Somalia have been suffering the plague of civil war and this House, gravely concerned especially about the violation of human rights, has previously passed a number of resolutions on that country.
The long-term lack of an effective government in that country has led to an anarchistic vacuum as far as central power is concerned.
As a consequence, Islamic Courts militias and various radical factions are fighting for control of parts of Somalia, at the expense, as is inevitable in such circumstances, of the safety and well-being of innocent civilians.
Especially worrisome and worthy of condemnation has been the recent fighting in and around Mogadishu and in the Jowhar region.
While expressing support for the initiatives by the UN, the African Union, the Arab League and IGAD in bringing peace and reconciliation to Somalia, this joint motion for a resolution calls upon all parties involved in the cancerous internal war in that nation to strive to pursue the path of dialogue and peace and offer the necessary cooperation to the transitional federal government and Parliament as the legitimate central authorities in Somalia, governed by the framework of the Transitional Federal Charter.
At the same time, it urges the international community and the EU to increase their help, especially through humanitarian aid to Somalia.
One hopes that eventually this poor developing country will gradually begin to find a decisive way to much-needed peace and prosperity, for the benefit of all its citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Horn of Africa is plagued by disastrous political failures, not just of the making of local powers, but also compounded by a series of misguided international actions and mostly inactions.
The failed state of Somalia is just the most glaring example.
The procrastination of the Ethiopian regime in solving the border question with Eritrea and the awful human rights, democracy and development records of the regimes in both Asmara and Addis Ababa are another sad example of international neglect of the region.
So it is no wonder that international terrorists are taking advantage of so much conflict in such a lawless region.
It looks as though they are getting more of what they want for their murderous purposes.
Rumours are spreading that the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is dragging IGAD into violating the arms embargo imposed by the UN Security Council in Somalia.
He is sending hundreds of thousands of troops into Baidoa.
Last week I was in Washington and New York and I got confirmation from important sources within the administration and the UN that preparations by the Ethiopian army to march even further towards Mogadishu are under way.
They are backed and blessed by the US in a very misguided policy.
It is as if the lesson has not been drawn from the latest fiasco that drove the Islamic Courts into power in Mogadishu.
This will provide even more grounds for the terrorist actions of al-Qaâida.
There could be a reignition of the Eritrean-Ethiopian border conflict not just in Somalia but in the region as a whole.
There could be more rebellions inside Ethiopia, leading to disintegration.
The EU has to take a stand on that, and I would urge the Council and the Commission to warn against this interference and to ensure that the Somalia Contact Group be given all the support it needs to work towards a political solution that does not fail, as the previous 14 attempts have done.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has not shown enough conviction in supporting the efforts to restore peace and democracy within the institutions set up by the National Reconciliation Conference, held in September 2003 in Nairobi.
It was at this Conference that the Transitional Federal Charter was adopted.
The installation of the federal parliament, the election of the president of parliament and of his vice-presidents, the appointment by parliament on 10Â October 2004 of Abdullah Yusuf Ahmed as president of the republic, and the appointment of the Prime Minister of the federal government were important steps, but the help and support provided by the Union was too half-hearted, and the lack of prompt action to help the population has left the way open to a resurgence of radical fundamentalism, which poses more and more of a risk because it is allied to terrorism.
Since 1991, the civil war has been bathing Mogadishu and the neighbouring areas in blood, with devastating consequences for the population.
In the past, global and regional terrorism, with training camps in Somalia, was responsible for the Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Mombasa attacks, and in the past few days in Mogadishu, the Union of Islamic Courts has executed at least 350 civilians.
We, in this Parliament, have continued for many years to stress the need for Europe to pay more attention to Somalia's problems and to its ambition to become a democratic State once again.
A large majority of the federal parliament has given its support over the last few days to international peace-keeping forces intervening in Somalia as part of the national security plan.
This is in an effort to respond to the Islamic courts.
We need to be alert to the danger posed by the political destabilisation plan implemented throughout Africa by the vast network of international extremism, and of the danger posed by Osama Bin Laden's message supporting the supreme council of Somali Islamic courts and opposing the legitimate president of the republic.
The Union and the international community must support and protect the role that President Abdullah Yusuf Ahmed is performing in his country through constant dialogue between institutions and civil society, the aim being to establish federalism in Somalia, while respecting the identities and rights of minorities.
We call for the Security Council to partially lift the arms embargo within Somalia so that the national security forces can be legitimately strengthened, and for the international community to consolidate the East African presidentsâ anti-terrorism initiative, which was created in 2003.
Measures to counter the dangerous domino effect of terrorism throughout the Horn of Africa must be made effective.
The Union must appoint a special envoy for the Horn of Africa and formally establish a Somali diplomatic representation in Brussels.
There is an urgent need to speed up our efforts to support the president, parliament, the government, the judicial system and the security forces and to protect the health and lives of the Somali population.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rule of the Union of Islamic Courts has been established in southern Somalia.
From the beginning of July this year, radical forces have gained increasing influence in the territory controlled by the Union.
The new leader of the Council of Islamic Courts is Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, a 60-year old radical Muslim cleric.
Sheikh Aweys is suspected of working with Al-Qaeda. After 11Â September 2001, the United States added Sheikh Aweys to the black list of international terrorists.
Sheikh Aweys does not recognise the UN-backed Somali Government with which Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, the first leader of the Council of Islamic Courts and viewed as being a relative moderate, signed a peace treaty after assuming power in Mogadishu.
Islamist factions have announced their intention to seize power across the whole of Somalia and there is a real danger that the Union of Islamic Courts will attack the northern part of the country which, until now, has been considered a relatively peaceful region.
It is made up of provinces that are divided into two autonomous regions, Somaliland and Puntland, which have strategic ports along their coastlines.
These actions would mean that Somalia would turn into another Afghanistan, ruled by the Taliban.
The human rights situation in the territory controlled by the Union of Islamic Courts has deteriorated to a dramatic extent.
Last week, Martin Adler, an independent Swedish journalist, was murdered at a rally organised by Sheik Aweysâ supporters.
One of the first decrees to be passed by the Islamic radicals in Mogadishu was an order to close cinemas and halls where the World Cup was to be shown.
Press agencies report that the Islamic military police shot two people and wounded four others during the Germany-Italy match.
The cinema owner and a young woman were killed when the cinema where the match was being shown came under fire.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if the radicalisation of the conflict in Somalia is to be avoided, then it would be helpful if the Islamic Courts had a part to play within the countryâs transitional federal institutions.
It is crucial to strengthen the Somali institutions by acknowledging that the Courts have, at least until now, supported the system of clamping down on the so-called warlords, who were tolerated and subsequently supported by United States governments.
The European Union should take a leading role again in Africa, just as Italy should in Somalia and throughout the Horn of Africa because of its historical precedents.
For example, we should lift the ban on Somali immigrants entering Italy, which was something that MrÂ Dini wanted.
The ban merely weakened the good relations between Italy and Somalia and made sure that Somalis dispersed to countries throughout Europe with the exception of Italy, where historical ties and responsibilities should have encouraged them to go.
Italy accommodates immigrants from many countries with which it shares neither historical responsibilities dating back to colonial times nor cultural affinities, while it ignores Somalia.
It would make much more sense for each European country to take on the needs of its respective former colonies, and each country would obviously also have to be entrusted with a mandate for an international protectorate over those countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my great concern regarding the continuing civil war in Somalia.
Somalia has not had an effective national government for over 15 years.
This situation is a serious threat to the peace and reconciliation process in that country.
It is also a threat to security and stability in the whole region of the Somali Peninsula.
We have to unequivocally condemn the recent fighting in Mogadishu and the events in Johwar and in other parts of the country, which have claimed the lives of many Somali people.
At the same time, we must appeal for no actions to be taken that might cause tensions to escalate.
We must appeal for the dialogue to continue and for the interim federal government and parliament, the central authorities which govern Somalia on the basis of a temporary federal act, to be involved in the cooperation efforts.
We also must not forget to provide the Somali people with humanitarian aid, aimed at helping the displaced and communities in need.
We should therefore support all action taken to uphold International Humanitarian Law and to guarantee humanitarian aid agencies access to communities requiring aid, as well as ensuring the safety of staff working for humanitarian organisations.
Â Â  . Mr President, this Parliament and the Commission are certainly joined in seeking a peaceful and democratic existence for the people of Somalia.
That has been brought out in the debate this afternoon, following MrÂ Smithâs original introduction of this subject.
I hope I shall be able to respond to paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular, concerning governance and institution-building in Somalia and protection of humanitarian relief and humanitarian relief workers, as he asked me to do.
The discussion today on Somalia is timely, as the situation of the country and the region as a whole remains very fragile.
The Commission is very much concerned about the risk of Somalia returning to war and to chaos.
Ever since the establishment of the Transitional Institutions in 2004, the Commission has been spearheading the international communityâs efforts to support the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions.
My colleague, Mr Michel, follows the situation very closely and is in regular contact with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Ghedi of Somalia, as well as with leaders of the region.
I should like to focus my speech on three main aspects: firstly, the current state of play in the dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Council of Islamic Courts; secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia; and, thirdly, the extent of the Commissionâs support for the peace process as the most valuable way to promote respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.
Concerning the first â the current state of play in the dialogue between the institutions and the Islamic Courts â on 22 June the Transitional Federal Government and representatives of the Union of Islamic Courts met in Khartoum and reached an agreement of principle to engage in dialogue, to mutually recognise each other and to convene for further substantive talks on 15 July, again in Khartoum.
This agreement was welcomed by High Representative Solana and by the Commission.
The Commission takes the view that there is a window of opportunity for an inter-Somali political dialogue and it is crucial to engage the Islamic Courts with a view to reaching a political solution within the framework of the Transitional Federal Institutions.
Confronting the Islamic Courts is not the solution: it would not only radicalise the positions of all involved but also offer an opening to the extremists to further their agenda to create an Islamic state, to introduce Sharia Law and provide a safe haven for al-Qaida cells.
Secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia is crucial.
It is essential that all regional partners show unity of purpose and engage constructively in the Somali peace process.
Destabilising interventions in Somali affairs by other countries in the region must be rejected and condemned.
We are committed to work closely and support the initiatives of IGAD, the African Union and the League of Arab States in finding a political solution to the crisis, as Mr Coveney was asking us to do.
The Commission intends to anchor Somalia in a broader regional strategy for peace, security and development for the Horn of Africa.
The outline of that strategy was presented by Commissioner Michel to the IGAD Heads of State last February.
Finally, the Commission is the main donor for Somalia, with an ongoing overall aid programme of EUR 300 million.
We have supported the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and the establishment of the Transitional Federal Institutions and are now committed to further enhancing the functioning of the Transitional Institutions.
On 28 May 2006, President Barroso and Commissioner Michel signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Transitional Federal Government.
I can confirm that the Commission intends to make EUR 22 million available immediately to support the short-term governance and capacity-building priorities set out by the Transitional Federal Government.
We remain unequivocally committed to supporting the peace process.
The Commissionâs humanitarian arm, ECHO, is also providing direct relief assistance to the civilian population affected by the fighting, as well as by the consequences of drought.
Everyone has a responsibility for ensuring the safe delivery of that humanitarian assistance and providing the safe custody and security of the humanitarian workers, all of whom are involved in this very valuable work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Mauritania(1).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite being an ACP member state, Mauritania is one of the worldâs forgotten countries.
For too long, the countries of Europe turned a blind eye to the dictatorship of President Ould Taya, who imprisoned, tortured and banished opponents of his regime.
Parliament and the European institutions remained silent when we submitted a request for an observation mission to be dispatched during the 2003 presidential elections, even though some candidates were being held in prison.
The Union was overcautious following the events of 3Â August 2005, which brought down the dictator, without a single drop of blood being shed, even though we knew that the country was on the verge of exploding.
I am pleased that I organised the first discussion platform in 2004 at the European Parliament, gathering together, on neutral ground, Mauritanians from civil society, political parties and official representatives in an effort to pave the way for democracy.
We are paying tribute today to the Union, which supports the democratic process on which Mauritania has embarked, on the basis of a public consensus behind the Military Council for Justice and Democracy.
Pledges have already been made by this transitional authority, with the creation of an independent national electoral commission, with the abolition of media censorship and with the organisation of a referendum, on 25Â June 2005, the smooth running of which was hailed by international observers.
I am also pleased that the Union has committed itself to sending a long-term observation mission to monitor the elections taking place this November, thus ensuring that every Mauritanian citizen can exercise his or her voting rights.
Finally, the revenue from oil exploitation must be used for education, health care and the development of the peoples of Mauritania.
The exploitation of oil, which will not last forever, must not be done in a manner that is detrimental to marine and coastal biodiversity, but must protect the Banc dâArgouin, for example, from all forms of pollution and ensure that the fishery resource, which is so important to the people of Mauritania, is managed in a sustainable way.
I am pleased that the authorities, together with the Union, have embarked on a more open debate on the fishing agreements with a view to reaching a fair agreement.
The ban on factory ships such as the âAtlantic Dawn', for example, is a prerequisite for reaching such an agreement.
Finally â and here I conclude - the anti-immigration cooperation project must help to create jobs in Mauritania and to give migrants a reception that is worthy of the values espoused in Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the press is now talking about Mauritania in terms of its being a model for democracy in Africa, and the EU has officially re-established relations with it, but is the situation really that good?
It certainly is not!
That there is to be a referendum in Mauritania on a new constitution, and, in particular, that the Presidentâs powers are to be limited by it, are things to be welcomed, but, according to the information available to us, there is still slavery in Mauritania, and that is utterly unacceptable, and something must be done about, not least on the part of the EU.
The name of Mauritania also comes up whenever discussion turns to the way the European Union deals with refugees, a very large number of whom are sent there, where they are left to their fate.
The EU is making its defences against refugees more and more military in character â the Frontex agency is one example of this.
Major military manoeuvres recently took place in Cap Verde; the plan had originally been that they should be held in Mauritania, and the reason why they were not was that France objected.
I have had sight of the scenario for these manoeuvres, which do indeed have something to do with repelling refugees.
The UNHCR has since noted that no checks on individualsâ refugee status are now carried out in such places as Lampedusa, where refugees from Mauritania are living, and the concept of what are termed âsafe third countriesâ is now being introduced, the eventual effect of which will be that refugees will not be able to get into the European Union in the first place.
We must therefore insist on help being given to people in need.
What the EU is currently doing is building up what amounts to a deportation machine, and it must not be allowed to get away with it.
Help must also be given with the ongoing democratisation of Mauritania.
Â Â  .
Mr President, taken together with Morocco, Mauritania constitutes an ancient culture, one that for centuries traded heavily with Europe and can boast highly-developed literature and traditions of well-organised trade, chivalry, large-scale agriculture and early forms of industry and craftsmanship.
It has always enjoyed a flourishing culture, much of which one can sense there even today.
This makes it all the worse that some of us Europeans should have completely forgotten this country.
I hope that we will now give more attention to Mauritania, and not just because of the refugee situation, difficult though that indeed is, or because of the discontinuation of the fisheries agreement.
I believe that this is a country that deserves our full support.
The referendum was a strong indication of a democratic trend in a country that is an important bridge between the Mediterranean and West Africa and has enough to contend with in the shape of natural disasters and challenges to be faced, in doing which it has developed an astoundingly innovative talent for agriculture.
I am also at one with those who argue that this country, with its natural reserves and maritime resources, is one that needs to be handled with great care, but that must not, contrariwise, mean that we want to plunder its waters of their treasures, on which the country is dependent, while also being dependent on the extraction of certain raw materials that occur there and constitute virtually its only source of income.

The policy we apply in this respect must, then, be a very careful one â one that will build up Mauritaniaâs abilities to help itself, enable it to emerge from the state of being an often grossly exploited country and return to it its proud and ancient tradition of independence in a new and democratic form.
This can be accomplished only if the powers of its President are limited, if the records of voters and residents are improved, and if truly democratic elections can be held with all Mauritaniaâs people participating in them on an equal footing.
Â Â  . Mr President, at last the Republic of Mauritania appears to be gradually and delicately beginning to move towards the eventual restoration of democracy and respect for human rights.
So far the transitional authorities in the country are seen to have kept their promises as regards the timetable for elections and the referendum conducted last month, despite the difficult practical problems, showed an overwhelming electoral majority in favour of urgent and vital constitutional changes.
The transition towards democracy is fully supported by the newly formed political parties and by civil society and there seems to be, at least in principle, agreement to allow the return of refugees from neighbouring countries to which they had fled, justifiably fearing for their safety.
If they are properly managed and corruption is kept at bay, the new petroleum resources being exploited in Mauritania offer the possibility of providing financial wealth for the benefit of the general population, especially in fields such as health and education.
This joint motion for a resolution aims primarily to offer support to the people of Mauritania in their difficult and eagerly awaited transition to democracy, in the hope that this worthy goal will be achieved amicably, peacefully and within the expected time parameters previously agreed with all the parties concerned.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, on 3Â August 2005, the regime of the former President Ould Taya was overthrown, with a military council declaring its intention to put a stop to totalitarian practices and to establish democracy.
One might therefore imagine that these are merely declarations designed to justify what the international community referred to as a coup d'Ã©tat.
Then, it quickly becomes clear that not a single drop of blood has been shed, that the transitional authorities have begun talks with all of the political parties and civil society, have set out an electoral timetable and have taken the unusual step of deciding to stand in the next elections.
One therefore has the feeling that something is happening in Mauritania and that this might be an opportunity to free this country from the dictatorship.
From now on, our role consists in supporting the democratic process under way while respecting the timetable that the people of Mauritania have themselves set out. In this connection, I am delighted at the way in which the last constitutional elections were held.
I support INEC, which must nevertheless ensure that every Mauritanian citizen can obtain his or her identity papers so as to be able to vote in the next elections and that Mauritanians living outside the country can take part in future ballots. I also support the political partiesâ having the means to express themselves and to campaign on electoral platforms that act as a vehicle for proposals designed to improve the circumstances of the people of Mauritania.
Â Â  .
Mr President, when you hear of yet another putsch in Africa, you tend to think it is about one autocrat replacing another and carrying on plundering the country; fortunately, though, what happened in Mauritania after the putsch of 3Â August 2005 appears to be something different.
It is not just that things went to a timetable, with a constitutional referendum in the June following the putsch, and elections now expected to be held in November, but also, everything has been done in agreement with all the political stakeholders, the Military Council, the transitional government and with the institutions â such as the independent electoral commission â that have been set up.
That in itself I regard as pretty remarkable, and a joint delegation from the ACP and the EU went there to review what was going on, affording a good example of how North and South can come together to consider problems and conflict situations.
Now that we have completed the ArticleÂ 96 process with Mauritania, I would like to see us making aid fully available again, but we do have to take care that income from the oil reserves, which were plundered as a result of a contract with an Australian firm, appears as income in the countryâs budget, so that the resources it possesses really can be made available to the people.
We have already heard what the key issues are.
There are refugees who must find their way back home.
There are others who must get back to their economic activities in various sectors, and I hope that we will all join together in supporting this country as it continues on the road ahead.
Now in particular, at a time when it appears to be on the right track, we must not lose sight of the need to encourage all the interested parties not to deviate from it.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, at the risk of repeating what others before me have said, I too should like, on behalf my group, to stress the importance of what is currently taking place in Mauritania and to point out that since the coup dâÃ©tat, about which several Members have spoken in this House, Parliament has never focused on the situation in this country, which has been somewhat abandoned by us all.
I therefore believe that this resolution comes just at the right moment, at a time when an important democratic process has just got under way in the country.
What must be stressed above all today, with this resolution, is the will of the European Union, and of our Parliament in particular, to pay attention to the situation in Mauritania and to the way in which it is evolving, and to help, as much as we can, to implement and to pursue the democratic process since, on 25Â June 2005, in fact, it was possible to hold the constitutional referendum.
There are still, of course, a number of duties to be carried out on Mauritania's part; as MrsÂ Carlotti mentioned a moment ago, the electoral register, in particular, still needs to be completed, a duty to which we refer in the resolution.
It also remains for Parliament, for its part, to support a request coming from the Mauritanian authorities, namely that an election observation mission be sent by the Commission to Mauritania for the forthcoming elections: the legislative and municipal elections in November and the presidential elections in March.
I believe that this is important and that Parliament and the Commission must take the necessary initiatives on this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, following last yearâs coup dâÃ©tat the EU decided to open consultations with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania under Article 96 of the revised Cotonou Agreement.
The opening meeting was cordial and constructive.
It was attended by representatives from Mauritanian political parties and civil society, who were given the opportunity to air their points of view, and by a group of ambassadors from ACP countries.
Mauritania gave 23 undertakings in the areas of respect for democratic principles, fundamental freedoms and rights, the rule of law and good governance.
A further undertaking was also given regarding monitoring and reporting.
At the opening meeting, the Commission encouraged the Mauritanian authorities to ensure the widest possible registration of voters in the country and abroad, as well as participation in the constitutional referendum and in the several elections due to take place during the transition period.
The Commission also encouraged the creation of an electoral level playing field through the adoption of equitable mechanisms of party financing and the guarantee of impartial behaviour by the military, the transition government, the administration and the judges.
The Commission invited the transition authorities to take account of past problems, the most important of which are the sequels of slavery and the consequences of the inter-ethnic violence of 1989-1990 that led to loss of life and property and to the departure to neighbouring countries of tens of thousands of Mauritanian citizens.
While recognising that the duration of the transition period will not allow the new authorities to solve all problems, the Commission encouraged them to take decisive action in all those areas.
The undertakings given by Mauritania have, in the Commissionâs opinion, addressed all the main problems that the country is facing.
Their formulation by the authorities was largely based upon the conclusions of the October 2005 National Consultation Workshops, which benefited from the participation of all stakeholders and reflected a broad national consensus.
Progress in the implementation of Mauritaniaâs undertakings allowed the EU to recognise that steady progress had been made and to conclude the consultations at the end of May 2006.
However, given the measures still to be put in hand, the EU will conduct an enhanced political dialogue with the government over an 18-month monitoring period.
In that context, the deployment of electoral observation missions for the forthcoming elections is foreseen and a first evaluation mission by the Commission will indeed take place next week.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on freedom of expression on the Internet(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by reminding you of the declaration of the World Summit on the Information Society, which took place in Tunis in November 2005 and which attached great importance to the information society in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms and in particular freedom of expression and of opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and have access to information.
That is why it is so sad and regrettable that today we have to point out that dozens of people are in prison in various countries of the world, though particularly in China, simply because they wanted to communicate and express themselves via the Internet.
Nevertheless, although there is no doubt that the censoring governments are mainly responsible, we must always remember that, in many cases, western companies, many of them European, supply those governments with the instruments and capacity to be able to carry out their control and censorship.
This is true of companies such as Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Telecom Italia, Wanadoo and certain subsidiaries of France Telecom.
For all of these reasons, the intention of this Resolution is to roundly condemn the restrictions to freedom of expression that certain governments impose via the Internet, and in particular the acts of persecution and detention that some of them carry out.
We therefore expressly call upon the Council and the Commission to raise this issue in their bilateral meetings with the countries mentioned in the Resolution, particularly China.
Secondly, we want to call upon the Council and the Member States to make public, through a joint communiquÃ©, their commitment to protecting the rights of Internet users and to freedom of expression on the Internet.
Thirdly, we call for restrictions to be placed on certain companies that make profits in certain countries at the expense of curtailing human rights.
In summary, in todayâs world, one way to promote and respect human rights is to guarantee freedom of expression on the Internet and to prevent censorship, persecution and imprisonment.
We must therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to take account of the need to pay attention to these particular issues, including when drawing up their aid programmes.
Â Â  .
Mr President, not everywhere in the world is access to the various media open to everyone; it is often the case that the Internet offers opposition elements the only chance of getting their position across to the public, and recital C of this resolution expresses that very well, although we must of course ask why this is so.
All this has a great deal to do with media concentration; for example, there are very many people who find it absolutely impossible to get access to television or newspapers.
The resolution is critical of the censorship of the Internet that goes on in certain countries, and that is very much to the point, but it is another example of what happens in this House very often, in that we point the finger only at the others, without considering the situation in the European Union itself.
Censorship of the Internet is not a good thing anywhere, not even in the Member States of the European Union.
Let me give some examples of what I am talking about.
In Germany, the Chaos Computer Club has been subject to recurrent repression over recent years, and there are, for example, such sects as Scientology that have taken legal action to close down sites that examined them in a critical way.

The two particular pretexts for censorship that are adduced are, on the one hand child pornography and on the other right-wing extremism, but, although both are deserving of forthright condemnation, child pornography is criminalised throughout the world, and those who, wherever they are, access such sites make themselves liable to prosecution, while right-wing extremism â one example of which is what MrÂ Giertych came out with in this House a few days ago â is something we have to deal with politically.
It is also very important, when considering the Internet, to point out that search engines are now adapting their power to the rules, so that certain material no longer shows up when they are used.
What is going on here is piecemeal commercialisation, so that only certain content â which has been paid for â can be found on webpages.
What must be spelled out in plain language is that there must be no censorship of the Internet in the European Union, and that means, too, that the Commission must do something about this and banish such censorship from the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, this resolution is a broad one attempting to deal with global access to the web, which is a huge issue.
It welcomes the statement from the world summit in Tunis last November on the prime importance of the information society for democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression and opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and give access to information.
The reality is, of course, that the web provides a fantastic vehicle for change in countries that have to date suppressed freedom of expression and frustrated democracy.
For that reason, the Internet is a real headache for totalitarian dictators and governments, who go to great lengths to restrict and prevent its free use.
This resolution uses strongly worded language and condemns a number of countries who are openly attempting to restrict and censor information over the web, referring to them as enemies of freedom of expression.
Many of these countries continue to imprison persons who are referred to as âcyber dissidentsâ and we call for their immediate release.
This is particularly the case with China, and we have named a whole series of people involved.
The resolution also tries to deal with the more sensitive issue of involvement by Western, and specifically US and European, technology and companies in providing the capacity for certain governments to censor and filter Internet material.
The great firewall of China is perhaps the starkest example of such censorship.
The Chinese authorities have successfully persuaded companies such as Yahoo and Google to allow filtering of their search engines.
For example, if one types in Tiananmen Square in China, one is likely to get an architectural history of the buildings around the square.
We call on the Commission to put together a voluntary code of conduct, working with rather than lecturing to companies operating in repressive countries, in an effort to reduce the capacity to prevent freedom of expression.
Â Â  .
Mr President, countries such as China and Cuba, Burma and Belarus â and the resolution names dozens of others â are placing tighter and tighter restrictions on the use of the Internet, and it is understandable that they should do so, for if there is anything that is a vehicle of free expression of opinion, that serves the opposition and the development of opposition to totalitarian states, then the Internet is it, and Internet service providers have always made a great thing of the freedom, specifically of information, that the Internet affords.

Yet it is quite often American and European ISPs that make it easier for free expression of opinion to be interfered with by, for example, agreeing to allow their services to be censored.
American companies, for example Google, Microsoft and, in particular, Yahoo, have, in China, stirred up a hornetsâ nest.
A number of other companies have, of course, been doing the same thing: Secure Computing and Fortinet in Tunisia and Burma, Cisco Systems too, but European firms are also among them, examples being Telecom Italia in Cuba and Wanadoo â which belongs to France Telecom â in Tunisia.
It is of course intolerable that Western businesses should be helping repressive governments to trample human rights underfoot.
The first thing to be done is for the European institutions to draw up a code of conduct in which they undertake not to have a hand in actions aimed at repressing what goes on online.
It must also be stressed that businesses providing search, chat, publishing or other services on the Internet must do everything they can to ensure that the rights of consumers to use the Internet are fully safeguarded.
In China, there are now 48 cyber-dissidents behind bars, simply and solely because they deviated from the path through the Internet mapped out for them by the authorities.
It is, to my mind, unthinkable that Western businesses should give active assistance to these repressive and authoritarian regimes by maintaining censorship.
That sort of collaboration runs counter to fundamental European values such as the free expression of opinion and freedom of information.
Free expression of opinion must remain a priority on the Internet, indeed, on the Internet in particular.
American legislators are working on a , and it goes without saying that Europe cannot stand on the sidelines.
Even if we insist on legislation, I would prefer to see an attempt made at working out a code of conduct in order to see what we can sort out with the companies in question.
We must also make it perfectly clear what we stand for.
At the end of the day, of course, the problem does not primarily lie with the Internet companies, but with the repressive regimes themselves.
Trade and communication with such countries can often have a beneficial influence, and of that I am, generally in favour, albeit not, of course, if we allow these regimes to bully us as regards what we trade in or what we communicate.
Â Â  . Mr President, in our globalised society, the Internet is a fast and user-friendly means of communicating among individuals or in a group, of buying and selling, of accessing information and of creating material.
The Internet has become an open global public space in which everyone is, in principle, free to move around and to express him or herself.
The World Summit on the Information Society has placed fundamental human rights at the core of the information society.
The fact is, we are not all equal when it comes to freedom of expression on the Internet, and some States have begun to ban citizens, journalists and others from expressing themselves.
Worse still, Reporters without Borders has made an alarming finding concerning Internet repression and reports that a very large number of Internet users are being held in prison, particularly in China.
Our resolution enables us to take a strong stand against these attacks on peopleâs freedoms and to condemn the States that carry them out.
We call on the Council and the Commission to demonstrate the same rigour in their international relations and their aid and cooperation programmes.
Yet, we also want to appeal to the responsibility of businesses, particularly European ones, which, by providing technologies or services, are more or less involved in these acts and which ought to commit themselves to subscribing to a code of conduct preventing them from playing a part in censorship, in repression and in persecution.
We cannot advocate freedom of trade while refusing to protect individual freedoms.
The Athens Forum on Internet governance, scheduled for November, must enable the European Union to put the recommendations from this resolution into practice.
Â Â  . Mr President, the resolution which the European Parliament is to adopt today is really a resolution on defending freedom of speech, which forms the basis of any democratic society.
We might dare to say that the Internet protects this freedom better than any other medium.
However, the governments of many states are trying to influence online content.
The Internet is viewed as a wild and dangerous river and there are legislative initiatives in many states aimed at regulating its current.
By the same token, however, these states are unfortunately running a serious risk of restricting freedom of speech.
After all, a PC and a printer can become a printing press which could be used to print pamphlets, public notices or even whole books destined for unofficial circulation.
A computer connected to the Internet is nothing more than a radio tuned to .
Moreover, it is an interactive radio, where anyone can express their views and make comments.
It is a serious threat to any totalitarian country or any country that restricts access to information to a certain extent.
It is only possible to censor individual pages on the Internet.
It is impossible to censor the whole network but the temptation or threat to do so still exists.
The Chinese Government, for example, has created an Internet police force which checks whether any of the dozen or so million Chinese Internet users have infringed the network usage regulations.
Any infringement may result in up to 10 years in a labour camp.
The owners of Internet cafes employ monitoring staff to check whether any banned content appears on the usersâ screens.
This content is filtered using keywords.
If the words âTibetâ, âdissidentâ or âChina and human rightsâ appear, the page is then blocked.
The Internet, which is fundamentally anarchic by nature, is a thorn in the side of governments and bureaucrats, who are not absent from cradles of democracy such as Europe and the United States, either.
We should remember that the long-standing struggle between freedom and censorship never ends and that it is also a battle between good and evil.
We have to remember that the freedom the Internet gives us also brings with it the danger of spreading antidemocratic and immoral information.
Â Â  . Mr President, freedom of speech and opinion are fundamental values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Freedom of speech should be guaranteed, irrespective of the way in which views are expressed.
The Internet has, in recent years, become a new, universal form of communication.
According to current estimates, there are around 600Â million Internet users and this figure is increasing on a daily basis.
The Internet is a medium which allows freedom of expression.
This freedom also extends to groups such as human rights campaigners, democracy activists, political dissidents and independent journalists.
As it is an open forum, it also contributes to the growth of democracy, something that was observed during the World Summit in Tunisia in November of last year.
However, not everyone likes such an open medium.
Governments that are accustomed to controlling the press, the radio or the television now want to control the only independent medium which keeps slipping out of their grasp, namely the Internet.
China, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Nepal, Cuba and Belarus are using increasingly sophisticated methods to control and restrict freedom of speech.
What is worse, companies such as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are agreeing to censorship at the request of governments, as is currently the case in China.
This situation is unacceptable.
Freedom of speech is an inalienable right.
We have to act to prevent any attempts to restrict it, including on the Internet.
We have to create a net management system where only illegal activities, such as the dissemination of child pornography or other forms of abuse, will be restricted.
To restrict freedom of speech on the Internet is to muzzle those who speak uncomfortable truths, which are a part of the very values that we have to defend in particular.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think there are controls and controls.
We pass laws every month for controls and limits that protect the vulnerable.
Restricting pornography that uses or targets children should not be seen as an affront to true freedom.
As a mother, I believe that robbing children of their innocence is a crime.
Indeed, the Christian gospels say it is worthy of a millstone around the neck.
For a child, abuse, whether it is at the hand of a lecherous adult or the Internet, becomes a psychological millstone that blights the child for life.
With the use of technologies like MRI and chemical screening, we now know that pornography alters childrenâs developing brains and stimulates the production of highly addictive brain chemicals.
Researchers have even likened the long-term use of Internet pornography to the devastating effects of heroin.
We must do what we can to make the Internet safer.
If Yahoo and Google can censor the web to suit a totalitarian Chinese Government, they can certainly censor the web for the benefit of our children.
Â Â  When discussing Internet censorship, it is easy and satisfying to be able to condemn a dozen or so countries spread across a few continents.
However, I am afraid that, other than making ourselves feel better, our actions will remain purely symbolic.
Perhaps we should look at the facts, particularly those which relate to European countries and companies.
Let us take Belarus as an example.
It is a neighbour of the European Union and a typical enemy of online freedom.
If we mention Belarus in the same breath as the Maldives or Nepal, we will not be helping any of these countries in practice.
If the Italian company Telecom Italia is the network operator in Cuba, then the Communist regime censors freedom of expression with this European companyâs agreement.
If a branch of France Telecom decides to introduce broadband services together with a Tunisian operator, this move takes place at a time when the Tunisian Government is cutting off access to all opposition Internet sites in that country.
These are the facts.
Let us not use avoidance tactics such as discussing issues over which we can only exert a moral influence.
Let us focus on issues we can influence in practice.
Â Â  Mr President, thanks to science and technology, mankind has begun to conquer space and has walked on the moon.
We have also created wonderful communication tools such as the Internet.
However, we should remember that technology has also been used to commit millions of murders, acts of moral corruption and those which destroy human dignity.
Thus, although science and technology are undoubtedly good in themselves, they, like all human activities, should be constantly subject to monitoring, limits should be established and ethical principles should be followed.
These principles allow us to distinguish good from evil, which does not have to mean limiting expression.
Modern technological problems extend far beyond the scope of technology and become moral problems.
We should encourage real freedom, namely freedom from evil, and not wilfulness and lawlessness which destroy and demean humankind.
There are many examples of dangers that result from the Internet.
The ones which cause most outrage and that are most serious are Internet sites which feature child pornography and those with paedophile-oriented content.
They reflect how rapidly and how low mankind can fall.
Â Â  . Mr President, the motions for resolutions on freedom of expression on the Internet propose the means to promote access to the Internet free of repression by national authorities.
These suggestions concentrate on measures to improve Internet governance and fight human rights violations.
The World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis in November 2005 reaffirmed the links between the development of the Information Society and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and access information.
This consensus reached during the summit is a basis for us âto prevent and counteract threats, risks and limitations to human rights posed by the misuse of information and communication technologiesâ as outlined in the Commissionâs communication of April 2006 on the summit follow-up.
In this communication, the Commission âencourages the companies concerned to work on a code of conduct on this crucial issue, in close cooperation with NGOsâ.
This code of conduct would constitute an important step towards inspiring these countries to establish respective ethical standards.
The promotion of freedom of expression figures highly on the agenda of the Communityâs corresponding external assistance programmes, in particular the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
This will remain unchanged in the coming years under the new financing instrument for democracy and human rights.
Furthermore, we have a policy of bridging the digital divide between rich and poor countries.
The more Internet use spreads, the more difficult it becomes for repressive governments to control it, despite the whole panoply of censorship methods.
The Commission is actively promoting the summitâs recommendations in this area.
Before concluding, let me add a few more words on Internet governance.
The Tunis Agenda called for the establishment of a forum for multi-stakeholder policy dialogue, the Internet Governance Forum, which will first meet at the end of October in Athens.
Europe should play a central role in this process.
I am therefore hopeful that the European Parliament will take this opportunity to launch this dialogue with the representatives of European civil society before the Athens Forum.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates, that is to say in a moment.
Â Â  Firstly, I would like to praise this proposal for its timeliness.
As electronic communications spread rapidly, it is really very important to focus attention on freedom of expression on the Internet as well.
Freedom of expression is an important issue.
It must obtain in all circumstances, although at the same time we need to remember that freedom of expression carries with it a special responsibility.
We have to ensure that the Internet does not contain material which conflicts with humanity, human rights and democracy.
We need to be especially concerned about children and young people, who are our societyâs most valuable asset.
They represent today, and the decision-makers must try and ensure that they can use the Internet to obtain relevant and appropriate information and avoid anything that runs counter to values which are enduring and which protect human life.
Freedom carries with it a responsibility.
That is worth remembering at a time when the main theme in society often seems to be worthlessness.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, my oral amendment is to avoid ambiguity in recital C. I propose to insert the word âunfortunatelyâ between the word âwhereasâ and âSomaliaâ and to replace the words âwith a view to restoring orderâ with the words âwith a view to taking chargeâ.
That is in an effort to ensure that nobody would interpret recital C as justifying the setting-up of radical Islamic courts with a view to restoring order.
I hope that the other groups will agree with the PPE-DE Group on that issue.
I believe it is a sensible and understandable oral amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, that has to do with the last paragraph, in relation both to Somalia and Mauritania.
I would ask that the resolutions we adopt should, in so far as they relate to Africa, be addressed to the Panafrican Parliament as well.
Â Â  Mr President, what has just been said about Somalia should apply in exactly the same way to Mauritania.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what we in fact need to do, having listened to the Commissionerâs explanations and in order to demonstrate Parliamentâs goodwill and the Committee on International Tradeâs willingness to cooperate, is to delete from paragraph 2, in which the Commission is mentioned, the adjective, which I will read out in English since that is the original language,
âevenâ.
We also wish to insert the word âformallyâ, so the text concerned will read: â(...) the Commission did not send the proposed regulation to Parliament (...)â.
The text âformally to Parliamentâ is therefore added. I believe that that is going to improve our relations with the Commission.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . The origin marking of a product represents the strength and the transparency of the product, a guarantee for the consumer and a necessary act of protection with regard to a nationâs work and its businesses.
The protection of European products (at least when this is entrusted to the clarity of markings, of production processes and of all those guarantees on products that a consumer has a right to know about and that, if you will, are also ethically necessary) is also crucial to the âfair competition' that precisely the dominant criteria of the âfree market' (which should therefore be free, but properly competitive) require.
Origin marking is not in itself a sufficient guarantee of the above, but it does at least represent a first step.
Making origin marking compulsory, as what we are discussing here provides for, is only a first, crucial step in protecting against those products that are flooding the European market, competing unfairly with our products and causing damage to our businesses and our work.
The traceability of a product â the complete transparency of the production process would be better â and an appropriate acknowledgement of the quality and the research and also of the craft and industrial traditions of the nations of Europe are also guarantees designed to protect consumers, as well as European businesses and industries.
That is why I voted in favour of the new regulation, even though I must stress that I regard it merely as a first step.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 6 July 2006.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, several events have taken place since we were last together before the summer. I would like to mention them in order to provide a context for our work and in order to inform you of the activities of Parliamentâs bodies over the summer.
Firstly, the war in Lebanon: given the tragic events that were taking place, I felt that Parliament could not remain on holiday and had to react.
I therefore called an extraordinary Conference of Presidents of political groups that was held on 20Â July.
That Conference of Presidents approved a clear statement that was considerably more vigorous than that of the Unionâs Foreign Affairs Council that had taken place beforehand on 17Â July.
In it, we called for an immediate ceasefire in the region; we were also the first to call for an international force to be deployed within the framework of the United Nations, with significant European Union participation.
The chairmen of the political groups called unanimously for the Unionâs institutions and Member States to speak with one voice. Unfortunately, that did not happen.
On 1Â August, in view of the continued escalation of violence and the attacks against civilian populations, the Conference of Presidents held another extraordinary meeting, this time open to all Members of Parliament.
That Conference of Presidents roundly condemned the attacks on civilian populations, such as those that had just taken place against the Lebanese town of Canna.
We again appealed to the Council to call for an immediate ceasefire.
In accordance with the resolutions of that Conference of Presidents, I negotiated a statement by the Bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which was published on 7Â August â a statement unanimously approved by the members of that Bureau, the Presidents of the Parliaments of Tunisia, Egypt and Greece and myself.
It was the first time that European and Arab political leaders had expressed a united position on this crisis.
On 24 August, the Bureau of the EMPA met in Brussels; it had previously summoned all of the MEPs who are members of that Assembly.
The EMPA Bureau approved a statement that called for European participation in the intervention force and decided to send a delegation to Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
Finally, on 25 August, as you know, the governments of the Unionâs Member States decided to respond to our appeals for action and also to the appeals to them from the United Nations to send a significant contingent of troops from European countries to operate on the ground.
As you will appreciate, these meetings had to be called at extremely short notice and not every Member who might have decided or wished to take part in them could be notified of them in time.
I regret that we had to hold those meetings so quickly and I am therefore delighted that we have included a debate on this issue on this first agenda.
Everyone is aware that this is the biggest military mission the European Union has ever undertaken, that it represents a challenge in terms of our political credibility and that, in addition to our role of peace keepers in an area that affects us very directly, the Union has the opportunity to support diplomatic action throughout the region and to relaunch the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
The second issue that has kept us busy over the summer is the influx of illegal immigrants from Africa, particularly on the shores of the Canary Islands and Lampedusa.
I have been in constant contact with Commissioner Frattini, whom I would like to thank for the decisions he has taken and for the impetus he has given to cooperation amongst the countries of Europe in resolving certain cases of illegal immigration that are particularly dramatic from a humanitarian point of view.
We should be aware, however, that 10Â 000 people have arrived in Lampedusa this summer and 20Â 000 in the Canary Islands â almost 2Â 000 just yesterday. That figure is four times higher than last year and hundreds of people have died at sea trying to cross it.
We must also be aware that those people do not want to stay in Lampedusa or in Lanzarote.
They want to get to Europe. What is happening there therefore affects all of us.
It affects Europe as a whole, in terms of both its immigration policy and its development policy.
I would like to draw Parliamentâs attention, the attention of all of us, to the fact that we are not dealing with an emergency of an exceptional nature which only arises from time to time: we are dealing with a structural problem that is going to become more serious every summer because the income and demographic differences between Europe and Africa will increase this immigration, and Europe must respond by implementing a policy of development in Africa and cooperation amongst the European countries, to this end implementing a common immigration policy.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that, as you know, this summer we have also seen the preparation of an attack on an immense scale against the airlines linking the United Kingdom and the United States, reminding us that we are still facing the threat of terrorism.
We have also been reminded of this by the fatal attacks in Turkey, in which European citizens have lost their lives.
This must increase our efforts to tackle the phenomenon of terrorism, using acceptable methods that respect our freedoms.
During this part-session, on Thursday, we will have the opportunity to debate the sensitive issue of the personal data of passengers on commercial flights, which is still of concern to us.
In this regard, I must inform you that Ireland has appealed against the Directive on data retention, and this calls into question the delicate balance that we had achieved between Council and Parliament.
These are the events that will characterise the work that Parliament must do from now on.
Â Â  It is my sad duty to inform you that not everybody will be here for the parliamentary work we are beginning today.
One of us will be missing, our Hungarian fellow Member, IstvÃ¡n PÃ¡lfi, who died on 15July at the age of 40.
A member of the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, MrÂ PÃ¡lfi demonstrated his parliamentary commitment through his active participation in the Committee on Regional Development and in the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.
At the time, I sent a message of condolence to his family on behalf of all of you, and a book of condolences is now available at the front of the Chamber for those Members who wish to leave a personal message.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to observe a minuteâs silence in memory of our fellow Member, IstvÃ¡n PÃ¡lfi.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 31Â August pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to replace the item on Zimbabwe with an item on Transnistria.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in Zimbabwe is, of course, a dreadful, tragic and disastrous one, but, since there have â unfortunately â been no new developments on this front, it would be perfectly possible to replace this item in this part-session by the item on Transnistria, where, on 7Â September, there is to be a referendum, with the possibility of the situation there being made considerably worse.
Those Members who argue that this is not solely a human rights issue may well be right, but the situation in Transnistria does have to do with the human rights of those who live there, and do so under dire conditions.
I would therefore ask that we should, on this occasion, consider Transnistria rather than Zimbabwe.
It might be possible â if you, Mr President, agree to it â for the chairwoman of the relevant delegation to say something more about this by way of justification.
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak in favour?
Â Â  As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I would indeed suggest that we should show our solidarity with Moldova by emphasising first of all that we are following international law and secondly that we in this building continue to be of the opinion that, according to international law, separatist Transnistria has no possibility or right of secession from Moldova.
We recognise Moldova within its borders.
This will send a very important signal to this country, so I once again sincerely request that we attempt to take a preventive approach.
This will also show that we have set a precedent in our House, in the sense that we do not follow behind events, but are confident in our position and demonstrate that in a precautionary manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I would not deny that Transnistria is a very important issue, but it merits a debate in this House on Tuesday or Wednesday.
It should be a full debate within this House, because this is a key issue connected with the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Regrettably, on Thursday afternoon, half the Members will not be here to debate this serious issue.
My argument, therefore, is that â as has been agreed by the PPE-DE Group â we should maintain the human rights debate on Zimbabwe, where there is an appalling humanitarian situation under MrÂ Mugabe, and we should have a full debate on Transnistria at the next plenary part-session.
Â Â  I note that we are beginning the parliamentary year with a disagreement between the two largest groups, and that is just as it should be.
We shall clear it up by means of a vote.
Â Â  The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, the fortnightly retrial in Libya of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor â ongoing since 13Â June â resumes again tomorrow.
This House has been consistent in its support for and action in defence of those people.
In particular I should like to thank the President for his intervention in this case with the Libyan authorities at the beginning of July.
I am appalled that the Libyan prosecution has again called for the death penalty during the most recent court hearing on 29 August.
Reports from recent meetings indicate that the retrial will be concluded within a few months.
We have heard that before.
Three months have passed already, and this has been going on since 1999.
I should like to call upon the Commission and the Council â and again upon you, Mr President â to redouble diplomatic efforts with the Libyan authorities in order to bring this matter to a speedy and just conclusion, with the immediate release of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor.
Â Â  We shall do so again.
All of the European institutions, and in particular the Presidency of Parliament, will do everything they can to help resolve this unfortunate issue.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to discuss the situation in Slovakia.
It seems to have been forgotten that, following its victory in the election, the Direction â Social Democracy Party (Smer) formed a government coalition with the extreme right Slovak National Party (SNS).
At the beginning of August, this red-brown coalition gained the support of the members of the Slovak Parliament.
In July, I took the opportunity to express my concern and disapproval regarding this coalition, which are shared by many of my fellow Members, but the Prime Minister, MrÂ Fico, did not follow up on our request to reconsider whether such a coalition was appropriate.
Unfortunately, recent events have shown that our concerns were well-founded.
Members of the Hungarian minority were recently attacked for speaking Hungarian, and the leader of the SNS, MrÂ Slota, has continued to make xenophobic and nationalistic speeches.
By agreeing to this coalition, MrÂ Fico has left the door open to such outbursts, and there is a fine line between words and actions.
Politicians need to demonstrate responsibility; making alliances with extremists who hold these kinds of views will necessarily have harmful consequences.
For me, the violence we are seeing today is a cruel reminder of the darkest days of Europeâs pre-war history.
Â Â  Russia has realised that NGOs are the best way to influence public opinion.
Such organisations and foundations have become quite common throughout the states of the former empire.
By using its favourable situation in the global energy market, Russia is able to allocate more funds for propaganda campaigns.
To this purpose, a special Euroregion Livonia-Baltic foundation has already been established with representative offices in Estonia, Latvia, Belarus and the Kaliningrad region.
The official aims of this foundation include promoting business relations and cultural cooperation between the Baltic States, the Kaliningrad region, Belarus and Ukraine.
However, the founders of the foundation initiated by Russia are already known for their blatant actions against the construction of spent-fuel storage facilities at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant.
The EU, while encouraging democratic processes in the post-soviet countries, is jeopardising its initiative in the information war.
I have already invited the European Parliament, and I am doing so again, to more actively promote the democratic process in the post-soviet countries and clearly express its opinion on the anti-western propaganda in the EUâs eastern neighbours.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with all the nuclear power stations we have in Europe, we are all in greater danger than we think â in Denmark, too, which has in fact declined to adopt nuclear power.
Take the Swedish nuclear power station, Forsmark.
The person formerly responsible for security there, Lars-Olov HÃ¶glund, has said of this power station that it was pure luck that it did not go into meltdown at the beginning of this August.
He calls the situation the most dangerous since Chernobyl.
It was also a week before either the Swedish public or operators of similar power stations in other countries were made aware of the event.
In general, details of the safety of nuclear power stations and of the requirements imposed on them by the authorities are not available to the public.
That this is the case in Swedenâs otherwise very open society is, of course, also somewhat alarming.
There is a lack of information where nuclear power is concerned.
The important lesson to be learned from this episode is that nuclear power is not safe and never will be.
It creates huge problems and, to top it all, undermines democracy.
We must ensure that we put a stop to this development as quickly as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, 12Â September will see the eighth anniversary of the unjust detention in the United States of America of Antonio Guerrero, Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, Gerardo Hernandez, RamÃ³n LabaÃ±ino and RenÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, Cuban patriots whose sole motive was to protect their country from falling victim to terrorist attacks promoted and carried out by Miami-based organisations.
It should be noted that, in the opinion of the United Nations Working Group looking into the case of these five Cuban citizens held in the United States of America, their trial did not take place under objective and impartial conditions, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta deciding unanimously to annul the verdict handed down in Miami.
These eight years have been characterised by illegal acts, unacceptable punishment, pressure and blackmail, and breaches of human rights; for example, the US Administration has not allowed the wives of RenÃ© GonzÃ¡lez and Gerardo Hernandez to visit them.
Mr President, justice must be done by putting an end to this cruel and inhuman situation.
These five Cuban patriots must be released and their convictions overturned.
Â Â  Mr President, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group requested an oral question in the debate on forced labour camps on Italian soil whose inmates included Polish nationals.
This item was not included and I would like to ask you to include it in the next plenary session.
The matter is incredibly important.
We are dealing with a blatant case of slavery.
People have even been killed in these work camps in the heart of Europe.
There are signs that this is a more widespread problem that also affects other Member States.
We have adopted hundreds of resolutions on human rights violations in various countries throughout the world, and yet here we have a serious infringement of human rights in the European Union itself.
We should deal with this issue as a matter of priority.
The European Parliament should call for Member States to address the issue of foreign workers.
Mr President, I appeal to you and to all my colleagues from other political groups to look into this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, it is said that the EU project has no greater ambition than to see the destruction of nation states and to have unwanted and unrealistic federal fantasies imposed upon them.
There is an EU programme called Interreg â detailed in the British press today â which demands the setting-up of âtransnational regionsâ.
These include parts of Europe that are not even part of the EU: the southern part of Norway is in one such region; northern Norway and Iceland is another.
Perhaps this is one reason why Iceland has decided not to even think about joining the EU for many years to come.
My question is, who asked the bureaucrats to spend time considering such stupidity?
You will be distressed, however, that these crazy folk have fallen foul of the law of unintended consequences.
They have hastened the day when Britain says goodbye, for, as Winston Churchill once said, âUp with this we will not putâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating you on the victory of Spain's national team in the World Basketball Championship.
Of course, you must not think that you beat us Greeks; we let you win the match because we have connections with your royal family.
That is why we gave the game away.
You spoke earlier of illegal immigration in the Canary Islands.
We have the same problem daily in the Aegean.
Borders have not been defined due to relations with Turkey and so, every day, we have several such illegal visits to Greece.
We are a country of 10Â million inhabitants, 2.5Â million of whom are illegal immigrants: one in four inhabitants in Greece is a foreigner.
It is an unbelievable figure.
We are a country with deficits â the only country in Europe with deficits.
We have the worst unemployment and we have 2.5Â million people below the poverty line.
Please relieve us of this burden and we do not mean with policing measures; we must give the countries which immigrants leave the best economic support we can, so that they stay at home.
Â Â  Mr President, over the last few weeks we have seen the sorry spectacle of the EU dithering, this time while Lebanon burned.
There was, eventually, a derisory offer of 200 peacekeepers from France â even Bangladesh managed more than that, and quicker!
Remember the tsunami?
The US had 150 helicopters and a battle fleet on their way within hours, and the EU held meetings.
The Balkans: NATO was on the ground sorting out the mess, and the EU held meetings.
This grandiose, self-styled supranational government finances the people who voted in Hamas terrorists and now threatens Polish shipyards with closure.
But you will not face up to Iran!
Some summer recess!
Â Â  Mr President, over the summer I took the opportunity to be briefed by some of those in industry in my region.
When I met the leaders of the milk industry â the representatives of the farmers who produce milk in Northern Ireland â I was somewhat disturbed to find that the reduction by the European Union of the export refunds on milk powder, as well as other export refunds, has driven the price received by the farmers in my region to an all-time low.
If this is not reversed, then, quite frankly, the European Union will be guilty of putting the dairy farmers in my region out of business.
That is totally unacceptable.
I ask the Commission to take this on board immediately, before it is too late.
It is not too late to put together a restructuring package for the industry.
The worst thing about Europe is that we always act when it is too late.
If we act now, we can act in time.
Â Â  Mr President, in mid-July, Belarus, the State located right at the very centre of our continent, pronounced a verdict on Alexander Kozulin, a leader of Belarusian Social Democratic Party who dared to challenge Alexander Lukashenko in the presidential election.
He was sentenced to five and a half years of imprisonment.
The country chairing the European Union has announced a declaration not only on behalf of 25 Member States, but of 12 other European states as well, calling for the immediate release of Alexander Kozulin and other political prisoners.
I have just talked to Irina, the imprisoned manâs wife.
She said that she was allowed to see her husband only once a month and that he suffered from worsened vision, heart weakness and flare-up of osteochondrosis.
I am positive that following its recess, the European Parliament should react to the first conviction in Belarus, which was based not on a mock criminal act but on a political offence â for the so-called âincitement to mass disorderâ.
I think that the President of Parliament and the political groups should express their opinions, if possible.
The regime in Minsk does not expect any sharp reactions from Europe to this and similar situations.
This should not be the case.
Â Â  I would like to say a few words regarding JÃ¡n Slota's announcement about adopting a principle of zero tolerance towards Roma people, because all summer I have been thinking about how important it is for us to finally talk about the insults being cast at the Roma.
JÃ¡n Slota asserted his anti-Hungarian and anti-Roma views with impunity during the election campaign in Slovakia this spring more and more vociferously, a fact which we have drawn attention to on a number of occasions.
This widely known nationalist party leader, who is deliberately inciting anti-Roma sentiments among the Slovak population with his unconstitutional and prejudiced utterances, has already taken up his duties as a member of the Slovak Government, as a coalition partner.
Similar utterances during Meciar's government had almost irreversible consequences for Slovakia's Roma population.
According to estimates, there are currently 800Â 000 Roma living in Slovakia under very difficult social and economic circumstances.
The most important task facing the country and the government is to put an end to the Romaâs exclusion.
However, they fail to do so.
The current political atmosphere is justifiably frightening and uncertain for the Roma population and other minorities living in Slovakia, who suffer direct or indirect prejudice every day.
However, these typical utterances from JÃ¡n Slota cannot be allowed in a democracy under any circumstances.
Â Â  Mr President, over the past few weeks our Slovakian friends have informed us of a number of aggressive acts and provocations targeted at people from the Hungarian and gypsy minorities.
The incidents involved physical assaults and offensive insults written on banners at a sporting event.
For example, a young woman from the Hungarian minority was brutally beaten for speaking on her mobile phone in Hungarian.
These cruel acts have shocked the Slovakian-Hungarian public, as there have been no such atrocities over the last eight years.
These alarming outrages against the minorities are completely against the European Unionâs ethics and principles, which Slovakia guaranteed to abide by when it joined the EU.
In the European Union there is no room for acts that threaten the peaceful coexistence of minorities, especially if these acts are incited by governments or politicians.
I ask that we take steps together against the extreme anti-minority remarks made by certain members of the Slovakian Government so that they do not provoke any more aggressive incidents.
If we want to stay loyal to the Unionâs principles and to respect individual and collective human rights, we must act immediately before the atrocities lead to tragedy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to return for a moment to the matter of seasonal workers in Italy.
Dozens of people are indeed thought to have disappeared.
It is likely that they have died.
I would like to support MrÂ Wojciechowskiâs proposal.
However, I would also like to strongly emphasise that the Italian police are collaborating with the Polish police.
This cooperation is unconditional, as the governments of these two countries are also working together.
I would also like to join those who would like to ask the European Commission and the governments of the Member States to check whether this was an isolated case.
If so, then let it be the last.
Let us pay more attention to the issue of temporary work, especially seasonal labour, in our Community.
I would also, very briefly, like to ask for a positive response to the idea of providing public aid for the shipbuilding industry in Poland, which has undergone radical reforms.
I would like to ask the Commission to adopt a positive stance on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, this weekend there was a fire at a plant in Caldas de Reis in Galicia that stored chemical products.
As a result, toxic substances were discharged into the river Umia.
The Galician authorities reacted immediately and took emergency action aimed at controlling the spillage, guaranteeing the water supply to the people of SalnÃ©s and protecting the natural and seafood wealth of the ria.
In a short space of time, action was taken effectively in an excellent spirit of cooperation amongst the administrations.
I would like to send a message of support and solidarity from the European Parliament and call upon the Communityâs authorities to monitor the process and assess whether any initiative or proposal for Community protection against these risks is appropriate.
Â Â  â Mr President, on 27Â August, this season's 14th Formula 1 Grand Prix was held in Istanbul.
At the end of the race, the trophies were awarded by the self-styled 'president' of the pseudostate, MrÂ Talat, in his capacity, according to the Turkish organisers, as 'president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'.
According to the rules of the International Automobile Federation, trophies may only be awarded by the head of state or the prime minister of the country or the president of the federation.
This, therefore, is a case of political scheming on the part of the Turkish Government, as MrÂ Talat does not hold any of these three offices.
Even MrÂ Yialtsintas, the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Istanbul which organised the race, stated to the newspapers that this act was premeditated because the race was an unexpected opportunity for MrÂ Talat to be promoted.
I therefore ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long we are to stand and watch these excesses by the Turkish authorities which, apart from insulting our intelligence, are an insult to the values of honesty and transparency promoted by the European Union.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am rather confused.
We are currently in the middle of the Belgian municipal elections, and I have seen Commissioners getting actively involved in the election campaign.
I know that, in the previous Parliamentary term, Commissioners were required to remain uninvolved; I do not know whether this requirement still applies, or whether the Rules of Procedure have anything to say on this subject, and so I do not know whether I should register my indignation at these practices.
Â Â  We shall pass your question on to the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to raise with Parliament the deteriorating situation in Darfur.
Tension is building up very seriously and a large-scale military confrontation is threatened, as thousands and thousands of Sudanese troops are now moving into the region with trucks, bombs and guns.
We also face a massive humanitarian catastrophe, as the hard-line Sudanese junta absolutely refuses to accept the UN troops, as agreed by the Security Council last week in New York.
We face competing pressures on the budget and I would hope that this Parliament will remain faithful to the view that Darfur should not drop out of our set of priorities at this crucial time.
Could I also ask you to contact High Representative Solana to ask him to make urgent representations to the Sudanese, and to the African Union to make sure that the latterâs mandate can be extended until such time as that United Nations force can be deployed in this tragic region of Sudan.
Â Â  Certain vulnerable parts of the world attract more attention from the international community than others.
Increasingly, there are also various individuals with a pronounced humanitarian calling who are attempting to draw attention to the horrors and injustices of the world.
One such individual is Tomo KriÅŸnar, a citizen of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union, who travelled to Chad and later Sudan as the Special Envoy of the President of the Republic of Slovenia.
His intention was to help the Sudanese people and alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.
During his visit to Sudan, Tomo KriÅŸnar followed the refugees in Darfur and reported the situation in Sudan to the world.
On 19Â July of this year the Sudanese authorities detained Tomo KriÅŸnar on alleged charges of espionage and illegal entry to the country.
He was sentenced to two yearsâ imprisonment, a fine and deportation.
According to the latest, as yet unofficial reports, he has been pardoned.
This encouraging result is due to the efforts and commitment of Slovene diplomats and international support.
I should like to thank the European Union in particular for its help in securing his release.
Despite the fact that Tomo KriÅŸnar has been pardoned, I call on European politicians to continue to pay attention to Darfur, especially as regards of human rights violations and the severe humanitarian crisis in the region.
Â Â  â Mr President, over recent years we have witnessed a constant increase in the rate at which forests are destroyed by fires, especially in southern Europe.
In Greece, we have had serious fires: in Halkidiki, which is perhaps the most important and beautiful tourist spot in Greece, approximately 60Â 000 decares were burnt.
This is a major blow to the environment, tourism and farming.
We need:
- firstly, compensation for the victims.
Europe is the state, the organisation of solidarity and must act as such;
- secondly, we need direct protection from the risk so that the soil is not washed away;
- thirdly, we need prevention for the future.
Here we must examine the matter in depth to see how we can plant species which do not burn as easily as pine trees;
- fourthly, we need to examine how we can stop ecological deterioration, because the greenhouse effect is the reason why fires are increasing.
We have a duty to protect the environment and man.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, the President of the Commission, often speaks of a Europe of results, but he seems to be referring exclusively to economic policies.
I would like to ask the Commission to be equally ambitious when it comes to fundamental rights.
I am thinking of a number of incidents in particular that took place this summer, when gay people wanted to go out on the streets and demonstrate for gay rights.
In a number of cases, those gay pride marches were banned and the authorities failed to protect the marchersâ rights.
There have been other cases of homophobia, for example, involving the Minister for Education in Poland.
I am very surprised to see how reluctant and timid the Commission is when it comes to such incidents, which are clear violations of fundamental rights.
I would like to ask the Commission to make use of Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which makes it possible to start an investigation into such incidents â I am not even talking about sanctions â but I would like there to be an investigation to see if these ministers can be held responsible for violations of fundamental rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of the Slovak Republic I would like to take this opportunity to condemn and apologise for the attacks committed recently against persons belonging to national minorities.
At the same time, however, I would like to emphasise that the Government of the Slovak Republic is thoroughly investigating the incidents that have occurred in the Slovak Republic; the Minister of the Interior has briefed the relevant parliamentary committee on the progress of these investigations and I also want to assure you that in its declaration the Government of the Slovak Republic has clearly declared and emphasised that it will adhere to, support and promote all civil rights, including the rights of national minorities.
Â Â  The Lebanon crisis has highlighted a new situation in the Middle East.
Iran has emerged as a major player supporting the terrorists in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, supplying them with high-tech Russian weapons and striving to have its own weapon of mass destruction.
The power behind all this is absolutely irresponsible.
Let us remember Stalin, who said on the eve of attacking Poland: âWe need a big war to reach our goalsâ.
Iran is heading in the same direction without even explaining anything.
Now we are sending forces to Lebanon that will not act against the aggressive Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis but rather merely take part in a play directed by others.
If we are afraid of saying that neither Iran nor other states refusing to recognise Israel must be in these forces, our behaviour is immature.
The European Parliament must adopt a conceptual resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to articles in the Greek press, the six biggest Greek banks, which account for over 80% of the Greek banking market, reported net profits of EUR 1.6Â billion during the first six months of 2006.
This is a 64% increase compared with the same period last year.
The unprecedented profitability of this sector is the result, among other things, of high interest rates in the retail financial services sector.
As the European Union has rightly identified this sector as a target sector of its unification policy, I should like to point out â and this observation is directed at the European Central Bank â that specific and effective measures need to be taken to achieve greater convergence of retail interest rates in the eurozone.
Â Â  Several groups in the European Parliament, as well as the socialist party groups, expressed their concerns over the coalition formed in Slovakia in the summer that included one party leader who has been making hate speeches for years as an incitement against minorities.
Unfortunately, their fears have come true.
The hate speeches made by this nationalist party leader let the genie out of the bottle, and have given encouragement to extreme nationalists, who have already physically assaulted members of the Hungarian minority on a number of occasions.
This is the first time in the last decade that such attacks have occurred in Slovakia.
Unfortunately, Prime Minister Fico was slow to distance himself from all of this, and was certainly not unequivocal when he did so.
I am sure that the Slovak Prime Minister is slowly realising that the European Union will not tolerate any government playing with the fire of nationalism.
This smouldering fire of nationalism ought to have been put out in Slovakia immediately.
The prime minister is wrong if he holds the minority's representatives responsible for this.
It is unlikely that Martin Schulz, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Hans-Gert Poettering or Elmar Brok spoke out last week in favour of stirring up the Hungarian coalition.
Europe's values do not allow nationalism.
Isolating Slovakia is of no interest to anyone, but it is the duty of every one of us to overcome nationalism and racism.
Â Â  There has been tension with the new government in Slovakia where a situation arose that violated EU values.
Physical violence has occurred, and openly racist graffiti appeared, simply because someone was speaking Hungarian, because they belonged to a different nationality.
Prime Minister Robert Fico was slow to respond and did not distance himself appropriately from the xenophobic behaviour and anti-Hungarian attacks.
In fact, the way in which he has responded is astonishing.
He is making attacks, political judgments and is looking for a scapegoat.
Sure enough, he has found one in the legitimate representative of Slovakia's Hungarian voters, the Party of the Hungarian Coalition.
Why is all this happening?
Our fears have been realised.
The crucial mistake occurred when an extremist, mainly anti-Hungarian party became a member of the government.
This opened the floodgates and intimidation has gained credibility.
What lesson can we learn from this situation?
EU institutions should pay closer attention to current events in our Member States, and if necessary, should respond and act immediately in order to nip disorder and lawlessness in the bud.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to condemn the arrest of three journalists from three different channels in Cyprus by the occupying forces occupying 40% of the Republic of Cyprus.
I also wish to express here the anger of the media and of the world of journalism about the arbitrary and boorish conduct of the Turkish occupying forces and of the occupying regime towards media workers.
We, as the European Parliament, must make demands in the same way as the United Nations and the international and European organisations defending the freedom of the press and individual rights.
We must act with decisiveness to put an end to the high-handedness of the occupying forces and the occupying regime and to effectively protect the mission, the work and the rights of journalists.
I would mention in passing that the journalists were brought before unrecognised courts and sentenced and that the fines imposed on them were paid by the Turkish Cypriot press associations.
Â Â  Mr President, it is useful to meet our constituents during the summer break, and in two-and-a-half hours last Friday I heard of the plight of Irish dairy farmers resulting from the over-severe implementation of CAP reform by the Commission and the Council.
The implications of this are very traumatic, because incomes will fall despite the compensation that is on offer.
To ask farmers to increase their scale to make up that difference is just neither practical nor possible.
I urge this House to stress to the Commission and the Council that, while we may be counting beans in terms of budgets, they are dealing with people and families and their actions are having a very severe impact on them.
This is a matter I will be raising directly with the Committee on Agriculture.
