Both Mr Patten and Mr Nielson have been very critical of the way in which development aid has been administered.
Mr Patten has said it is embarrassing for the EU and the Commission and called it the worst way of providing development aid. For Mr Nielson, it was enough to call it a 'a pizza service without delivery' .
I am also very pleased that Mr Nielson has instituted an investigation into the extent to which the delegations are fulfilling their responsibilities in the high-risk countries.
He has also promised that disciplinary action will be taken if they are not in fact fulfilling these, and I am very pleased about that development, but do not imagine that we shall forget you.
Finally, I wish to say that I think it was a shameless attack which Mr Dell'Alba made on Mrs Stauner.
Mr President, let me first say a few words regarding the quality of the work of our rapporteur Mrs Stauner.
She has been criticised, particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, yet she has produced an outstanding piece of work, and I wished to make that point today.
Let me also say a few words regarding the speeches made by the Socialist Members.
In all sincerity, without adding to the controversy, I feel that we have nothing to learn from the European Socialists regarding the use of funds.
Let me say a few words on the RÃŒhle report.
We were all extremely shocked both by the massive misappropriation of European Development Fund resources and also by the Commission' s attitude, which was to carefully conceal its dealings from the Court of Auditors, the former UCLAF (unit for the coordination of fraud prevention) and the European Parliament.
In spite of this particularly scandalous state of affairs, we have nonetheless adopted a positive attitude and have attempted, along with the new Commission, to provide valid and practical solutions to the underlying problem.
The purpose of the agreements between the European Union and a good number of third world countries is to enable the latter to have balanced and sustainable development but, in order to do so, the funds allocated would actually have to get to the end-users and, as we have known for a long time, corruption and fraud are depriving entire regions of the greater part of these sums.
To take just one example, the medical aid granted the Ivory Coast, particularly to combat AIDS, we are talking about some 38% of the aid being misappropriated, or almost EUR 30 million!
Mrs RÃŒhle' s report represents, then, the very last warning issued to the administration of the European Development Fund, who have until October to implement radical reforms in order to fulfil the expectations of Parliament, all the citizens of the European Union and, most especially, the populations of the countries concerned, who still have a vital need for European aid.
So, until October, when we shall meet again.
Mr President, could I just remind Mr Poettering and his friends in the PPE group that, when the Court of Auditors drew up its report on the financing of political parties, it was his group which was criticised and it was the Socialist and Liberal groups which received a clean bill of health.
Maybe this is due to the fact that the PPE-DE group is not one group, that the British Conservatives are allowed to run their own shop and that they keep their own accounts.
It is they who must improve their books.
Mrs Stauner had to be stopped for speaking too fast at the beginning of this debate.
It is a telling metaphor for the work she did in committee.
She ran ahead of the committee without the rest of us realising what was going on.
She tried and condemned the Commission for not sharing the outlandish views she has of financial management and control.
Even the Court of Auditors does not agree with her.
The job of the Committee on Budgetary Control is not to hang the Commission out to dry for the duration of a parliament, but to ensure that Europe's citizens are served by an executive that implements its political priorities efficiently and effectively.
Fortunately that view was shared by the majority of the committee.
One of the disastrous consequences of this whole standoff has been the proposal that is before us tomorrow for a framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission.
This agreement will restrict the rights of individual MEPs, of rapporteurs, to ask for information from the Commission.
It is a short-sighted proposal and if we do not postpone the debate until September then we should vote against it.
Finally I should just like to say, as we are about to listen to Mr Chirac and what he has to say about the French presidency, that I hope that he will also listen to what this Parliament has to say, and in particular to Parliament's view that it should be able to decide for itself where it meets, when it wants to meet, and that this should not be imposed by the governments of the Member States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, the statements made by some of my fellow Members have already contributed significantly towards expressing the discontent aroused by the report on discharge.
I should like to address you in the same vein.
Mrs Stauner' s initial report on discharge for the year 1998 gave rise to a great many questions and criticisms, which were expressed, in particular, in the vote in favour of an amendment noting the discrepancies between the compromise resolution and the explanatory statement.
In drawing up her second report, the rapporteur apparently did not take account of her fellow members' general lack of satisfaction.
Once again, we must deplore Mrs Stauner' s method.
She kept on asking the Commission for more and more information, going beyond the recommendations made in the resolution adopted on 13 April.
Today she is still asking questions which have already been explicitly answered.
This attitude has led the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to make radical changes to the draft report.
This is the reason why the text on which we are to vote during this part-session is substantially different from the initial draft.
This text does now afford us a more comprehensive overview of the Commission' s implementation of the 1998 budget, but at the price of a political conflict dominated by a feeling of frustration.
We can only deplore the far from constructive attitude of the rapporteur both within the parliamentary committee and with regard to the European Commission.
We cannot fail to note the same petty political excesses that some of us already condemned in the initial report on discharge for the year 1998.
Our objective must be to work in close collaboration with the Commission in the interest of our fellow citizens and of the implementation of our policies, and to make the discharge report a proper assessment of the implementation of the European Union budget in both quantitative and qualitative terms.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs - and indeed the people of Wales, because I did not realize they were so concerned about the Commission's welfare that they had elected someone to represent the Commission's views in Parliament rather than their own!
I would also like to say, just to correct something that Mrs Morgan said earlier, that I am very lucky in this debate, because my party declared in our manifesto - which helped so many of us on this side get elected - that we would not give discharge to any EU accounts until the Commission reform process had been successfully implemented.
I cannot therefore follow the lead of our excellent rapporteur, who recommends granting discharge to the Commission, for the reasons I have already given and because many people outside this place have been wondering what actually improved between 1996 and 1998.
Most people believe that things got worse within the Commission in that time rather than better.
I only joined the Committee on Budgetary Control a couple of months ago, and to me the meetings and the reports of the last two months have raised probably more questions than they have answered.
To close, I would like to ask two of those questions.
Firstly, can the Commission confirm whether Mr FlÃ©chard is related in any way to Mr Delors and/or members of his cabinet?
Secondly, can he confirm whether any of his or Commissioner Kinnock's cabinet have actively lobbied MEPs for support of the Socialist Group, and in particular for Mrs Morgan's amendments on the Stauner report?
If they have, would this not be an abuse of their position?
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Stauner, my colleague and good friend, for her report.
Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998.
I have carefully read the Court of Auditors' report on the accounts for that year, particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds.
I have come to the conclusion, having had a lot of experience in Parliament and with European affairs, that things have been steadily improving and that 1998 was one of the best performances we had.
The difficulties which occurred - a 4% possible error in the area of agriculture and a little more in the area of Structural Funds - did not result from the failure of the European Commission to dispense those funds in an efficient way, but from a failure - and it was a small failure - to control the Member States and the European governments and to ensure that the Member States and their administrations had done the job in the way it should have been done.
That is my first point.
The second point is in relation to FlÃ©chard.
I do not think it is reasonable to inform the people of Europe that there was a loss of EUR 14 million to the European budget arising out of this case.
To say this is to use a sort of accountancy jargon that puts the whole issue beyond the understanding of the ordinary European citizen.
The truth is that in the FlÃ©chard case, FlÃ©chard was suspected of fraud, the Irish government fined and punished them to the extent of EUR 17 million.
FlÃ©chard took the Irish government to court and won an injunction preventing the Irish government from taking the EUR 17 million.
The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement.
The worst thing you can say about that settlement is that it was made on a legal basis which was not in effect when the crime was committed, but was in effect while the case was still open.
It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration.
Finally, the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not, as in the past, interfere in their responsibilities, and that when the Commission takes national governments to task, it can rely on our support.
Mr President, I would like to repudiate in the strongest possible terms, the accusation levelled at me by Mr Dell'Alba that I used my role as rapporteur for the discharge of the budget for the 1998 financial year for personal ends - I repeat, for personal ends - and his comment that as a German, I, or rather, we Germans, if I understood the translation correctly, would do well to put our own house in order.
It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament.
I urge you to take suitable steps towards ensuring that Mr Dell'Alba avails himself of democratic manners like everyone else, even if - as I readily grant him - he obviously finds it difficult!
Statement by Presidency-in-Office of Council - Action programme of French presidency
The next item is the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of Council on the French presidency' s action programme.
It is my very great pleasure to give the floor to the French President, Mr Jacques Chirac.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, thank you for welcoming me here today.
Since 1 July, France has held the presidency of the Council of the European Union, and I shall be chairing the meetings of the European Council on two occasions.
I therefore thought it appropriate to present the priorities of the French Presidency to this House.
Last winter, when I was invited to participate in the inauguration of this new Chamber, I made a commitment to involving Parliament fully in the work of our presidency.
I think it natural and necessary to conduct discussions and debates within the European Union in close collaboration with the men and women that represent the citizens, the men and women elected by the people of Europe, who have the task of representing their opinions in the debate on the future of Europe.
Therefore, the French Presidency, represented in particular by Mr Hubert VÃ©drine, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mr Pierre Moscovici, Minister of State for European Affairs, intends to maintain an ongoing open dialogue with Parliament.
The citizens of Europe want more transparency in the operation of the European institutions.
The time when decisions could be taken behind closed doors has passed.
Nowadays, discussions within the European Union must take place in the light of day and, of course, here in the European Parliament.
We shall also be working hand in hand with the European Commission.
I should like today to express my confidence in and support for Mr Romano Prodi, the European Commissioners and all the parties cooperating with the Commission.
Having come into office in quite exceptional circumstances, they have managed to lay the foundations for a radical reform which will bear fruit in the future.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just fifty years ago the 'Schuman declaration' laid the foundations for the building of Europe, undertaking primarily to reconcile Germany and France.
I should, at this point, like to pay tribute to the memory of one of the great and ardent Europeans who paved the way for Europe, Pierre Pflimlin.
He devoted his life to France, of course, and Europe, a bold and noble idea of Europe.
This House acknowledged his commitment by electing him its president.
We have lost a great and fine figure in this venture we are all involved in.
Ladies and gentlemen, half a century of European construction has given rise to a profoundly original European Union, based on the common will of the nations which make up that Union, and today we clearly feel that we are entering a new phase in the history of European construction, which has already brought us peace, economic success and social progress.
The fine and necessary project of enlargement is going to change the European Union, its modus operandi and, perhaps, even its very nature, at a time when it is intensifying its political dimension.
At the same time, as the areas in which the European Union is becoming involved are expanding, the citizens are demanding, quite rightly, that it should be more democratic, more transparent and more efficient, and that it should be more diligent in respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
The debate on the future of Europe has thus been launched, and this is good news because is it essential in crucial periods to look further than the immediate concerns and time limits, and to set the course for the future.
I had the opportunity to express my views on this subject last week.
My comments were intended to shed light on the future and to express what the Europe of tomorrow could and should be.
They, of course, extend beyond the limits of the French Presidency of the European Union.
One thing is clear, however, and I stressed this in Berlin: all further progress of the European Union is conditional upon the success of the institutional reform.
If the IGC were not successful, then it would be pointless to consider the next stages.
The French authorities are fully aware of the responsibility they bear in this respect and they are approaching this presidency with the ambition to achieve progress or a successful conclusion in all the matters impacting on future development.
They shall do so with a commitment to safeguard, and improve, that which gives our whole project meaning: the protection of fundamental values and the respect of national and cultural identities, the continual determination to reconcile economic performance and social progress and to fulfil the practical expectations of the citizens, and the strengthening of Europe' s role as a major player on the international scene.
This is the spirit in which France intends to take forward the remarkable work achieved by the Portuguese Presidency, in close liaison with the Swedish Presidency which is to follow us on 1 January next year.
We have outlined four objectives for this six-month period: firstly, to make the European Union ready for enlargement, next, to place Europe more at the service of growth, employment and social progress, to bring the European Union closer to the citizens in order to drive the message of our shared project home, and finally, to affirm Europe' s position in the world.
The Presidency' s first focus is on making preparations for the future of Europe, post-enlargement.
As I said, the reform of the European institutions is one of the primary issues of our presidency.
Let us not make the mistake of underestimating the importance of the matters on the agenda.
The composition of the Commission, revision of the weighting of votes and the extension of qualified majority voting are all of critical importance given the prospect of the enlarged Europe.
If we do not manage to resolve these matters, the European Union will be sentenced to paralysis in the short term, and I am convinced that all the Member States are aware of this and are in favour of finding solutions.
The French Presidency is also determined to make progress on the matter of intensified cooperation, which was added to the IGC agenda at the Feira European Council.
The objective is not to set the divisions between Europeans in stone, but rather to introduce greater flexibility into the operation of the enlarged European Union by allowing those who wish to do so to travel more quickly along the common path.
You may rest assured that we shall provide ourselves with all the necessary means to make a success of these negotiations, in which the European Parliament will, of course, continue to be very closely involved.
The European Council in Biarritz, two months before the Nice Council, will be an informal summit, chiefly devoted to institutional reform.
It should give the necessary impetus for an agreement to be signed in December, an agreement which is worthy of the importance of the issues involved.
None of us, neither you nor us, can be content with a minimum agreement.
(Applause)Reform of the institutions will pave the way for enlargement of the European Union.
I am, as you know, a staunch supporter of enlargement.
It will be an achievement for peace and democracy in our continent, and it will make the European Union all the stronger.
The French Presidency is, therefore, determined to achieve real progress in the accession negotiations with all the candidate countries, based on their individual merits and implementing the principle of differentiation.
Our objective at the European Council in Nice is to arrive at as comprehensive as possible an overview of the state of negotiations, in order to provide effective guidance for the work of future presidencies and to clearly signpost the route to accession.
Bilateral dialogue with the candidate countries will, moreover, be stepped up, and dialogue will also be emphasised in the European conference of Heads of State and Government which I shall be convening in Nice prior to the European Council.
The second focus of the French Presidency is a Europe at the service of growth, employment and social progress.
Opting for the euro means opting for growth and employment.
It is a success.
We can already see the positive effects in all the countries of the European Union.
Coordinating our monetary policies, however, must necessarily be accompanied by serious social ambitions and improved coordination of our economic policies.
For many long years, France has been putting the case for employment to be the focus of the concerns of the European Union and the central objective of its policies.
A great deal of progress has been made thanks to successive presidencies, particularly in Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne.
The Lisbon European Council in March marked a crucial phase. It was there that we affirmed our strategic objective to restore full employment and activity for all, increasing employment rates among the working-age population of Europe to 70%, and we set ourselves a target of 3% average annual growth.
The French Presidency will be following up the action initiated by this Lisbon Council.
On the first day of France' s presidency, I was keen to invite the European Trade Union Confederation to visit me.
As you know, I attach great importance to affirming the European social model as based on social dialogue, on social protection appropriate to the requirements of our time and on acknowledgement of the role of the state as the guarantor of social cohesion.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights will have to support this model.
Our priority, then, will be the adoption of a "European social agenda" .
Economic growth and industrial modernisation are meaningful only if they represent a rapid fall in the rate of unemployment which, despite the positive results recorded throughout Europe in recent years, is still far higher than in the United States or Japan.
Europe at the service of the nations also means the determination to make great efforts to achieve social justice, improve the protection of children and boost commitment to combating exclusion in all its forms, particularly in the face of the new challenges of the knowledge-based economy.
The social agenda will make it possible, on the basis of the communication which the Commission has just submitted, to outline a five-year working programme involving all the operators concerned: Member States, the European Parliament, the Commission, unions and management.
We are looking for ambitious projects in fields as important as social protection, the involvement of employees in company decisions, reconciling family life and a career and lifelong training.
This is how we intend to support our European social model: by making progress on practical projects, backed by a strong political will.
At the same time, we must step up liaison and coordination between our economic policies.
This is necessary in order to consolidate the euro and to make sure that the current growth in Europe lasts.
The French Presidency is today proposing to improve the operation of the 11 euro states, shortly to become 12, by making its work more visible and more authoritative, to enhance the coordination of our budget policies by making the Community inspection procedures more effective, to make progress in the harmonisation of our tax policies in the wake of the European Council at Feira and, finally, to take action to prepare our citizens for the forthcoming advent of the euro.
It is vital that the citizens accept the euro.
Everything possible must be done to make a success of this crucial phase in both practical and human terms.
Finally, we must put Europe at the forefront of the information society, build up growth in the European Union on the basis of our training schemes - some of the best in the world - our tremendous scientific and intellectual potential and our industry, which is a world leader.
France will be endeavouring to develop fully the decisions taken under the Portuguese Presidency: support for innovative firms thanks to new risk capital developments, the establishment of a Community patent, the framing of a European scoreboard for innovation, the creation of a highly flexible network of scientists and the development of European projects, the fight against cybercrime.
We must also ensure that the benefits of these new technologies are accessible to all, avoiding the creation of a digital divide, and, in particular, supporting Internet connections for all European schools by the end of 2001, as decided.
We shall also be very attentive to enhancing Europe' s position in the highly strategic biotechnology sector, while, of course, monitoring the observance of the ethical rules which must be applied to any scientific, inventive or industrial activity involving living organisms.
Growth and solidarity must benefit all the regions of the European Union, particularly the island regions which must be helped to overcome their handicaps.
The Presidency will also ensure that links with the outermost regions are consolidated and intensified.
The new terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam now have to be implemented to ensure that the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments benefit from the rights, advantages and specific Community policies due to their specific features and constraints.
The third focus of the French Presidency will be to bring Europe closer to the citizens.
This is now the legitimate concern of all successive presidencies leading the European Union.
Europe still seems far too remote in the eyes of many of our fellow countrymen, who find it hard to see what Europe gives them or can give them in their everyday life.
It is high time that the European Union took more notice of the matters of concern to the ordinary citizen. Let us achieve a Europe of the people.
The adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up with the active participation of Members of this House will make it possible to enshrine in a single text the values, principles and rights which are the basis of our Union: civil and political rights, economic and social rights.
It is crucial that the Convention responsible for framing the text completes its work in sufficiently good time in order to be able to deliver the charter by the end of this year.
We shall also be promoting this Europe of the people by building the Europe of mobility, of knowledge and of young people.
While respecting Member State authority in the field of education, we must also staunchly support individual exchanges, particularly at university level.
Looking forward to the European Council of Nice, the French Presidency will be surveying the obstacles to the mobility of research workers, students and teachers, and investigating ways to overcome them.
We must be ambitious and adopt a substantial increase in exchanges within the European Union as our goal.
It is the synergy between European laboratories and firms, and the strengthening of the many important centres of research and innovation in Europe, which is at stake here, not to mention a certain vision of dialogue between cultures and cultural diversity and, ultimately, European citizenship, the feeling of belonging to the same political and human unit.
In more practical terms, the French Presidency intends to achieve progress in initiatives likely to improve the daily life of Europeans, firstly in terms of public health and consumer protection.
The traumatism caused by the mad cow epidemic and by other similar threats is forcing us to set up an independent European food authority.
I know that I shall be able to count on the support of this House in this undertaking.
We must also achieve recognition for the precautionary principle at European and international level, and make progress in the labelling and trackability of genetically modified organisms.
Let us never forget that agriculture is the first of our common policies.
The French Presidency will be particularly attentive to the WTO in the context of enlargement negotiations and in considering the problems encountered by specific industries, such as pig farming and the fruit and vegetable and banana industries.
As for the environment, the main focus will be on the safety of maritime transportation and the transportation of dangerous substances and petroleum products.
The ecological disaster caused by the wreck of the Erika is all the more intolerable in that it was due to human negligence.
The French authorities are firmly resolved to make tangible progress in the coming months, on the basis of existing and forthcoming proposals from the Commission and from the authorities themselves to prevent our coastlines suffering a recurrence of this tragedy.
Apart from this, Europe will continue to be in the vanguard of the fight to protect our environment.
The environment must be ever better integrated into European policy.
We are familiar with some of the environmental risks connected with the globalisation of the economy, which may irreversibly compromise the living conditions of future generations.
Accordingly, the French Presidency is committed to arriving at a good agreement, as good as possible, next November, at the Hague conference on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and will ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is properly implemented.
(Applause)In the field of justice and home affairs, the French Presidency will ensure that the decisions taken in Tampere in October 1999 are followed up in an ambitious manner.
There must be progress in implementing a European asylum and immigration policy with regard to three specific points: the issue of long-term residence permits, the harmonisation of reception conditions, and the fight against illegal immigration and the associated 'industry' .
We all have the Dover tragedy in mind.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Presidency will draw up specific measures regarding sanctions against parties responsible for trafficking.
There will also be particular emphasis on combating drugs and the financial crime often associated with it.
In particular, Europe will have to contribute towards the adoption of measures to combat money laundering effectively in support of the action undertaken in the context of the G7 Okinawa Summit, in Japan. I shall have the opportunity to stress this point.
Finally, we are resolved to make progress in achieving a European area of justice based on the mutual recognition of legal rulings and judgements.
Permit me, in concluding this chapter on the Europe of the citizens, to say a word or two about sport.
Now that the Euro 2000 football championship, which gave Europeans so much pleasure and so many thrills, is over,
(Applause)we must ensure that the European Union takes the specific nature of sport and its social role into more careful consideration.
There is a real problem which must be investigated and solved.
The French Presidency will make every effort to do so.
(Applause)The fourth and final focus of our presidency: a Europe with a strong international role.
In terms of the common foreign and security policy, the French Presidency will make a point of affirming the European identity, with the support of the High Representative and the Commission.
One of its priorities will be to consolidate the Europe of defence and security which has experienced spectacular progress in recent months.
This legislation must be put into practice and developed.
In the operational arena, we are to hold the Conference on the commitment of capabilities, in order to give the Helsinki objectives due credibility.
We would also like to see the interim bodies in place in Brussels since 1 March fulfilling their given role in the transition to the final phase.
In particular the interim Political and Security Committee, intended to replace the Political Committee, should gradually become the mainspring of the CFSP, supporting and with the support of Mr Javier Solana.
Finally, the arms industries must confirm the ambitious European defence policies by their harmonisation and their cooperation programmes.
The results of recent months have been very positive in this respect, in terms of helicopters, missiles and the future transport aircraft.
In all these areas, the French Presidency will spare no effort to ensure that Europe provides itself with ample resources for its foreign policy, in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, of course, with its allies.
Geographically speaking, in addition to the summits scheduled with its major partners - the United States and Canada, Russia and Ukraine - three main priorities are discernible in the field of the CFSP:
the Balkans, and the continuation of the stabilisation process which has commenced, in both the military and the economic sector.
The European Union must provide the countries in this region with a clear European perspective in order to persuade them to undertake reform and to cooperate at regional level.
This is the purpose of the summit the Feira European Council proposed should be held between the European Union and the counties of the Western Balkans;
the Mediterranean, with the fourth meeting of ministers in Barcelona and, circumstances permitting, the first Euro-Mediterranean Summit to be organised in Marseilles.
This will offer an opportunity to give new impetus to the Barcelona process by means of adopting a peace and stability charter and by strengthening economic and cultural links between the two shores of the sea we share. Then there is Asia, with the third Asia-Europe summit (ASEM) and the bilateral summits between Europe and China and Europe and Japan.
Here too the French Presidency wishes to develop fully the relations it considers essential in order to construct the balanced multipolar world of the future.
The French Presidency is also keen to ensure that the new convention between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries is implemented efficiently.
Europe must be strong and open to the world.
It must therefore play its role fully and consistently and show solidarity, in order to enable a new round of global and balanced negotiations to be launched within the World Trade Organisation.
As you can see, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the route map that France has set itself for its Presidency of the European Union is both ambitious and very specific.
In the first place, we must ensure that the institutions of the European Union are operating properly at this time when the Union is set to radically change its appearance.
Tomorrow, the number of Member States will have more than doubled and we must find procedures to enable decisions to be taken and Europe to make progress while strengthening its efficiency and legitimacy.
This is precisely what is at issue.
The European Union will only retain its dynamism and its strength if we are able to ensure that it is appreciated by the very people it serves, i.e. the citizens of Europe.
The European Parliament also shares these concerns.
By working hand in hand, with mutual trust, on each of these matters, together we shall succeed in taking Europe through the phases that are essential for the future.
It is my conviction that, in six months' time, when I come back to this Chamber to review our Presidency, Europe will not be quite the same.
We shall have consolidated the edifice by making it more welcoming both for those that already reside in it and those that wish to enter.
(Applause)
Madam President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the French Republic, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to stand here before you at the start of this new Presidency.
It is always a very exciting moment when the torch is handed over in the race to achieve Europe' s goals, and the fact that we are in the year 2000 makes today even more special.
Europe has already taken great strides towards its goal of economic regeneration during this first half of the year thanks to the Lisbon and Feira European Councils.
Progress has also been made towards an extraordinary enlargement of the Union - enlargement which you have described, Mr Chirac, as a 'fine and necessary project' - and towards strengthening its institutions in preparation for enlargement.
I would like to welcome your incoming Presidency, Mr Chirac, and say a few words on a couple of issues you raised in your speech.
Firstly, I would like to say that I support one hundred percent your commitment to developing Europe' s social agenda.
When I presented the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 in February, I announced that one of our major objectives would be to develop a new economic and social agenda for Europe.
Less than five months on, I am extremely encouraged by the progress which has already been made in the implementation of the economic aspects of that agenda.
The social aspects of Europe' s development are the other side of the same coin, and that is where we will focus our efforts during these next six months.
The Presidency will, in particular, have to tackle a whole range of major issues in relation to which the Commission has already tabled proposals.
Just a few days ago, the Commission adopted a social policy agenda outlining what needs to be done over the next two or three years to ensure that the conclusions of the Lisbon and Feira European Councils are translated into practical actions.
I feel that this document strikes a good balance between the political directions agreed at Lisbon and Feira and our duties and powers under the Treaty. It should therefore meet with consensus at the Nice Council.
Indeed, it is important for the Union to avoid creating inequalities in our society, all the more so in that we now have the right economic conditions to reduce these inequalities.
The Commission therefore supports the Presidency in focusing on these issues.
The anti-racism directive was recently adopted in a record time of only six months, and we now look forward to seeing the French Presidency take up the other aspects of this extremely important anti-discrimination package with the same drive.
Indeed, the primary function of any anti-discrimination programme must be to secure equal opportunities for men and women, and we must also do everything in our power to put an end to that most detestable form of slavery, the trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation.
One of the forms of inequality still present in European society is inequality of educational opportunities.
At Lisbon, an action plan was adopted which now needs to be implemented, and I know that the Presidency will be taking strong measures to ensure that all our young people develop the abilities they need for integration into a knowledge-based economy.
It is also our duty to advance this knowledge and increase the mobility of students, teachers and researchers in both quantitative and qualitative terms, as was proposed, at last, at Feira.
I am glad that this subject has been raised, for it is an issue of major importance, the furthest-reaching implications of which have not yet been fully examined.
Another source of inequality is the poverty trap in which too many European citizens find themselves.
At Lisbon, the European Council committed the Member States to making great efforts to eradicate poverty, and a High Level Group on social protection is working with the Commission on this ambitious strategy.
It is truly scandalous that extreme poverty still exists within our societies.
At the Nice Council we should be aiming to achieve a consensus of positions on social exclusion, and the Commission has already put forward proposals on the matter.
The Feira European Council also gave strong support to the Commission' s proposals in the area of food safety and committed the Member States to making progress on setting up an independent food safety authority as soon as the European Parliament has delivered its opinion.
I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest.
Once we have put forward our proposal, I look forward to seeing the plans for the authority move swiftly ahead under the French Presidency.
We owe this to our citizens, who will not tolerate it if we drag our feet on matters of food safety, but we must also have a common approach to this issue if we are to maintain our internal market.
We have all learnt from the recent problems and I feel that everyone is now ready to shoulder their responsibilities.
The European public is extremely concerned about environmental issues, and I stand alongside the French Presidency in the intention Mr Chirac has expressed to make the protection and improvement of the environment one of our key priorities.
Important decisions on climate change will have to be taken in November at the 6th session of the UN World Conference on Climate Change in The Hague.
At this conference, which will be one of the most important to take place since Kyoto, the Union will have to confirm its leadership role: we must fulfil the commitments we made at Kyoto and maintain the pressure on our partners to fulfil theirs.
The impact of our transport and energy policies on the environment, and, in particular, climate change, will be a key theme in two documents the Commission intends to submit to Parliament and the Council this autumn.
The first is a Green Paper on the common transport policy and the second is a strategic document on different energy sources and the security of energy supply.
These are issues of considerable concern to the European citizens, and they expect us to take effective action, especially as the situation now stands.
The citizens are also extremely concerned about oil pollution disasters on their coastlines, and if we want to avoid repetition of these disasters the Council and the European Parliament must act swiftly and adopt a package of measures on maritime safety, as we have already proposed.
Another important issue which is of concern to the citizens is the use of genetically modified organisms and biotechnology.
We must ensure adequate protection of human health and the environment while at the same time allowing society to benefit from the development of modern biotechnology.
We therefore urgently need to adopt the new framework legislation on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.
This series of provisions strengthens and improves the existing framework, and it is important that we achieve a balanced response that inspires both public and market confidence.
We therefore have a common, ambitious programme for the next six months and it seems to me that the various lines of action can all be traced back to a strong desire for a better quality of life.
At all levels of society, the citizens are calling throughout Europe for an improvement in social, ethical and environmental quality. We must heed this call.
This is why I want to end by emphasising the need for a constructive relationship with our new neighbours.
One of the major challenges facing the European Union is the need to stabilise our continent, and promoting stability in the regions on our borders must clearly be a central part of that strategy.
We therefore fully support your proposal to organise a political summit between the European Union and the most democratically advanced Balkan countries.
The Commission has already started to lay the foundations for this Balkan summit and we look forward to working closely with the French Presidency in order to make more detailed preparations.
I have recently had occasion to reflect on the increasingly important continuum of interaction between the European institutions.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, our legislative system has been working ever more efficiently under the new codecision procedure.
This procedure applies to a greatly increased range of legislation, yet there has been less need to resort to conciliation.
A recent survey shows that more than half the legislative proposals put forward over the past year were adopted in two readings and almost a fifth required only one reading.
This means that the legislative process is maturing and becoming more and more consensual.
I find this encouraging, given that the Commission has recommended to the IGC that the scope of the co-decision procedure, together with the qualified majority voting procedure, should be extended.
It will give even more democratic legitimacy to the European legislative process, and this is vital to the political health of the Union.
President Chirac, I welcome your commitment to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, that is to the necessary reform of our institutions.
Your commitment gives a clear, positive signal to our candidate country negotiating partners.
In Biarritz and in Nice, Europe will need all your skills and a great sense of responsibility on all sides.
We are all aware of how essential it is to reinforce our institutions and make them function more effectively. This is the essential precondition for enlargement.
We will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail. Today, let me simply stress an obvious point, which is, moreover, the crux of what we want to achieve in Nice and beyond.
With 27-28 or more States, the Union will need stronger institutions, not weaker ones. We will need a stronger, not weaker democratic commitment and a stronger, not more elusive legal system.
In this respect, it therefore an illusion to believe that the 'Monnet method' is a thing of the past, something that could be more effectively be replaced with ad hoc arrangements.
The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice are our institutions, and they provide the guarantees and the checks and balances without which nothing lasting can be built.
Because they are so essential we must work to improve them, and this is the task to which we are all committed for Nice.
The next six months are clearly going to be busy, and I am convinced that by the time France hands over the torch to Sweden, we will have made very considerable progress in building the Europe our citizens want and expect.
Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen of the House, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to welcome in the French Presidency.
By a fortunate coincidence, at this crucial point in our history one of the founding countries, the homeland of Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Pierre Pflimlin, is presiding over the fate of the European Union.
So let me at this early stage express my best wishes for the success of the French Presidency, the President and Government of France, and let me also say that there is not just a desire for success, there is a need for success, a great success.
The President presented four major working areas for the next six-month period.
In the first place, we share the French Presidency' s opinion that institutional reform is a basic prerequisite for the further development of the European Union, especially for these fine plans for enlargement and the commitment we have undertaken.
What we need is, if I might use the English phrase, a 'nice treaty in Nice' , and I am counting on you.
This, however, is precisely why we need to be able to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty,
(Loud applause) because we must effectively establish our community of values and, in this respect, I should like to pay tribute to the French Presidency' s determination because it must not be forgotten that you have defended these principles in your own country and in Europe, and we consider that if we wish to solve the problems we face at the moment looking to the future - and I am thinking of the case of Austria - it is essential that we are able to include both this affirmation of a community of values as well as methods of defending these principles in the Treaty.
There is another aspect of the French President' s speech which is important. He criticised decision making behind closed doors.
It would be a good thing if this were applied to the Intergovernmental Conference.
I was pleased to see the French President, in his Bundestag address, defending the method of the Convention, whereby the Members of the European Parliament, the members of the national parliaments, representatives of the governments and the Commission work together.
Why should we not extend this method of constitutional reform which you so ardently desire, in order to build upon what we have already, and not to build castles in the air?
Well, because, if a constitution has to be drawn up, it should be drawn up on the basis of the three-way division of power between the institutions.
The Commission and the parliaments and the Council and the Court of Justice must all be strengthened.
(Applause)
There is one fundamental question - in Santa Maria da Feira there was discussion of closer cooperation - but such closer cooperation is extremely closely related to the rule of majority decision making in Council and to codecision involving Parliament.
It is all part of the same package, and it is something that requires serious work.
In the second place, you also mentioned safeguarding the European social model, reiterating the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit - which we feel are a move in the right direction, the direction of defending the trio of 'employment, social cohesion and competitivity' . I shall take the liberty, Mr President, of adding two further fundamental questions to this agenda.
One of these is the future of public services, of universal European services,
(Applause)
and the other is the bearing they have on economic and social cohesion, in order to prevent an increase in the economic and social divide which may already exist.
We think this must be included in the package.
We welcome the Commission' s initiative, at the instigation of Mrs Diamantopoulou, and we hope that we shall be able to make progress here, in a manner that is most directly linked with strengthening our economic and monetary power too.
Now we are in the happy situation of having twelve members within the euro zone, and soon we are set to make it fifteen, but we nonetheless have to defend and consolidate the euro.
This is an absolute priority!
The third point, a Europe that is closer to the citizens.
In this area, regarding the environment, consumer protection and food safety, we are absolutely in agreement.
A Europe closer to the citizens is precisely what we were asking of the Commission before voting on its appointment.
We consider this an excellent arena for action to bring Europe closer to the citizens.
There is also one sensitive subject in this area, and that is sport, which you gave as one of your priorities.
I shall not confine myself to congratulating you, I should also like to say that the composition of the French national team is decidedly a pioneering way of seeing the multiracial and multicultural Europe of tomorrow,
(Loud applause)
and we believe that we must strive to eradicate this obscure capitalism which mars sport and to promote sport and the advancement of European youth.
In conclusion, Madam President, let me turn to foreign policy.
I would urge the Presidency not to make extravagant gestures so that we do not end up paying for commitments which do not match up to our ambitions.
If we want to be involved in foreign policy, then we must do so in a responsible manner, keeping our promises, in such a way as to circumvent a conflict between Parliament and the Council, which would be liable to obstruct development in this area which is so vital for Europe.
(Loud Applause)
Madam President, I want, on behalf of my group, to express a very warm welcome to Mr Chirac both in his role as President-in-Office of the Council and for coming here as President of France to underline the importance which France and he personally attach to the work of this presidency.
Last Sunday, thanks to "the blues" , France became Champions of Europe. I hope that, under your Presidency, France will once again become a champion for Europe!
We have listened with great interest to your speech today and to the speech you made last week in Berlin.
Both make important contributions to the European debate.
The Europe of tomorrow matters to all of us.
Much in the European debate is unsettled. What is the territory of Europe; what are its function, identity and values?
In launching such a debate you have done Europe a service.
However, the incentive to speculate on tomorrow's Europe should not become a disincentive to act on today's Europe.
As we contemplate enlargement, today's Europe of fifteen has, as you have remarked this morning, major tasks in hand.
One cannot underestimate the importance of the "Amsterdam leftovers" as we prepare ourselves for this enlargement.
You have spoken of having more than an accord Ã  minimum.
We certainly agree with that.
My group attaches very great importance, as you have done today, to a charter of fundamental rights as part of the package that we contemplate in Nice.
Like you, Mr President, we believe that Europe should be based on the values of freedom, dignity, tolerance, democracy and rights.
We respect the role of the European Commission in bringing balance to our debate and our respective interests.
We value the access which our citizens have to democratic checks and balances - through this House and elsewhere - in the formulation of European legislation.
We value transparency and working in public on the record, not behind closed doors.
We value the rights of citizens to appeal to the European Court of Justice where they perceive injustice.
None of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism.
We must be cautious about a drift in that direction.
My group believes that a strong Europe needs European institutions with a key role for the European Commission.
I agree with you that we should have a constitution for Europe.
We can launch a debate on that but clearly it is too complex a question to resolve in the next six months.
I would express one hope: that this debate does not become a third lock on the door of enlargement.
Helsinki set two tests: firstly we must reform ourselves in Nice; secondly the candidate states must take on board the acquis communautaire.
We should not add a third lock on the door by saying we must have a constitution before they join.
It is our historic task to bring about a successful enlargement.
I know from your remarks that you agree with that.
It is important to give that reassurance.
I believe that France, once again, has the opportunity to champion the cause of Europe.
We wish you and your government every success in the next six months.
Madam President, Mr President, your country has taken the leadership in European football and is now required to take leadership of the European Union at a key moment in its history.
I know full well that a presidency must assure continuity in the running of the institutions, but there are times when necessary changes in direction have to be made.
I think we shall be facing such times in the next six months.
Your Berlin speech where you argued in favour of implementing a process to develop a European constitution is, like several of the suggestions you have made today, a positive sign for the future.
I should like, for my part, to raise three issues on which your presidency ought to be focussing, in my opinion.
I shall begin with something that is of prime importance to all of us: the institutional reform which is the necessary precondition to enlargement.
This reform must be ambitious.
It cannot be confined to technical amendments just to keep the European machine ticking over.
To put it plainly, the three points left over from Amsterdam in no way represent an adequate agenda.
Nor is the response of emphasising the mechanism of closer cooperation a satisfactory one, not - let me explain this - if one is really concerned to make up the significant democratic deficit which typifies the way the European Union operates at the moment.
Intensified cooperation has one great merit, it makes it possible to avoid deadlock, but it is also a significant risk factor if careful attention is not paid, taking the European Parliament and the Commission out of the loop, and bringing the intergovernmental solution back with a vengeance, a solution which has for many years been identified as inadequate and, indeed, far from democratic.
Moreover, the ambitious and necessary plans for a European constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights, one of which is being postponed indefinitely, the other being assigned a non-binding status, should not be used to conceal the paucity of the rights acquired in the coming months.
You declared, Mr President, that we must reassert the values uniting us and defend the spirit of the founders of the European Union, whose goals were peace and stability in Europe.
We have, admittedly, achieved peace and stability within the European Union, but let us not close our eyes to the facts.
The globalisation of issues has gained the upper hand in the course of recent years.
The imbalance between north and south has grown worse, as all the international reports confirm.
Poverty in the world is not on the decline, quite the opposite.
Sources of fresh conflict are making themselves felt throughout the world, as well as ecological chaos, particularly climate change, whose worst effects are felt in precisely those areas where the populations are most disadvantaged.
In the face of uncontrollable events, the implications for the future are disconcerting, and the Hague Summit should represent a change in this respect.
The European Union must take the offensive.
I heard you say that you were in favour of this, under France' s leadership.
This is where we run up against contradictions, however.
I believe that it is not possible to wish for peace and sustainable development while actively endorsing the rationale of economic and commercial warfare worldwide, and that includes favouring the arms trade over conflict prevention.
Our pattern of development is in question.
We have to rethink our economic choices, in the knowledge that right now, instead of distributing current wealth, the industrialised countries are in fact stealing from the wealth of the future.
In connection with this, and, in my view, this is the third crucial issue for the next few months, which I would like to outline briefly, we must fundamentally reconsider the so far harmful role of the World Trade Organisation, which acts more like a world trading organisation.
Your country, Mr President, is one of the most critical European countries in this respect.
It is also in France that the people are most hostile to the dictatorship of free trade.
We await from you practical proposals for the WTO to be restored to its original role, that of a regulatory body for world trade, in a worldwide context dominated by the primacy of human and social rights, health and the quality of the environment.
By achieving this, the European Union would gain credit not only within the European Union but also throughout the world.
(Applause)
Mr President, there was a time, when you yourself, Mr Chirac, took sides against the foreigner.
What a contrast there is between your Cochin address and your speech to the Reichstag, in which you gave a foreign parliament the first taste of your federalist thinking, supporting the idea of a European constitution!
Have you changed or have times changed to this extent?
Does one have to be modern to have the support of a few well-meaning broadsheets?
Or indeed, as in the case of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is the need of the moment all the explanation necessary?
Was it really necessary - although not very Gaullist even in 1974 - to become a centrist under Mr Mitterrand, even though the support you gained on the left was more than offset by the support you lost on the right?
You recommended saying 'yes' to Maastricht because the 1995 presidential elections were drawing close.
It would have been a simple matter to dismiss the single currency, the so-called single currency, and put it off forever but you preferred to reduce France to the mediocre level of a general council, rather than the rank of a statesman.
Because Mr Mitterrand had had his Treaty, you wanted one of your own, in Amsterdam.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam proved insufficient, you are looking for another, this time in Nice.
Basically, you are acting like a political schemer of the Third Republic, constantly underestimating France' s potential and overestimating that of your rivals.
You have not noticed that in the nuclear age, the electric age, strength no longer lies in numbers, and that, in order to maintain its leading position, France must continue along the path initiated by General de Gaulle.
(Mixed reactions in the Chamber) Defending France' s interests alone in all areas - but you are, of course, all anti-Gaullist over there, that goes without saying - in all areas and always, being restricted as little as possible by international commitments, such as Europe, NATO, the UN, G7 -8 -9, not waging war on behalf of others, not ratifying the treaties before the others do.
How can you possibly claim that this supranational Europe strengthens France' s hand, when France holds only 11% of the votes within European bodies, a percentage which does not even match its economic power and still less its position in the field of leading edge technology?
By instigating a simplification of the closer cooperation procedures, you have offered our European partners a two- rather than a three-way directorate.
I hope that those who are excluded from this will be opposed to the attempt which, in fact, is playing into the hands of the Germans.
Is that not right, Mr Cohn-Bendit?
Belittling France by allowing important decisions to be taken without France' s agreement, when, through this closer cooperation, European treaties may, if necessary, be amended to the detriment of France...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, Mr President, France is assuming the presidency of the European Union for the next six months.
While it would seem necessary and legitimate to seek to reform the institutions and to give them a new lease of life, given that the system is so flawed and lacking in democracy, we should nonetheless not forget the main thing, which is the welfare, respect and full development of the peoples which make up the nations of Europe.
I am a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities.
This name in itself represents our programme, whose prime objective is to ensure that the identities and aspirations of each country are taken into optimum consideration, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
Following the crisis of the Santer Commission - which rocked the institutions - why the devil did they bury the expert committee' s report exposing the serious mismanagement within the institutions?
We must learn the lessons of the past in order to make preparations for the future to avoid, once again, strengthening the powers of the Commission, a technocratic structure operating without transparency or democracy.
Should we not challenge the political dimension it has granted itself?
We cannot be content with a Europe adopting ever more dehumanised texts that are too far removed from the needs of the people, who are often the victims of such texts in their daily lives, especially when the vague nature of such texts often means that the final decision is made by the Court of Justice which, by dint of its power of interpretation, sets itself up as a true legislative authority, but without any political supervision.
We reject government by officials as much as we reject government by judges.
Consequently, the IGC must not be the instrument of a reform which will turn the Europe of tomorrow into a technocratic monster, ever more ignorant of the peoples' legitimate concerns and of the opinion of the national parliaments that represent them.
We cannot agree to this reform granting some states the right and the power to force binding texts on states which are unwilling.
The institutional reform we are promised is putting a stranglehold on our nations, especially the smallest ones.
New administrative and voting systems are being created which give power and hegemony to those that some people call pioneer states.
This is not acceptable.
Diversity must be respected, and we must allow diversities to be expressed, for they are the true wealth of Europe.
Whereas the construction of Europe ought to be seeking to achieve coordination between the policies of Member States, the objective of integration is leading us towards an intolerable process of uniformisation.
This accelerated uniformisation, the origin of the single model, runs counter to the very thing that we strive to safeguard every day, namely diversity.
How is it possible to claim to defend the individual' s aspiration for a better life when every day challenging our cultures and our traditions a little more?
The fact is, behind the institutional debates, there are a number of particularly important subjects, such as employment, health, food safety and the protection of local products.
In addition, there is the entire debate on balanced regional development and respect for the users of territories, and also the future of public services and state monopolies.
We maintain that the French-style public service, which is of particular structural value in terms of regional planning and social cohesion, such as postal, railway and energy services, etc., must be defended against the Commission' s position.
Does defending the national interest make one anti-European?
Does asking for the directives such as those on 'birds' , 'habitats' , 'open air markets' or 'biotechnologies' to be amended make one anti-European?
On the eve of enlargement, we need to carefully consider this acquis communautaire that some parties would like to make 'immutable' in principle, with scant regard for democracy and subsidiarity.
In conclusion, Mr President, we hope that you will have the determination to restore the right of expression to the elected representatives and the various peoples of Europe in order to prevent a new rural and territorial divide.
In order for France to speak with a single voice, it is the voice of the people which must be heard. The 'blues' showed us the way.
It was a fine victory, Mr President, but the championship was possible only thanks to the Europe of the nations!
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I have listened with great interest to the speeches by the representatives of the various groups and I am pleased to have this opportunity to express a few thoughts on these.
I should like, first of all, to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, who summed up the situation at the beginning of the French Presidency with great clarity.
I am pleased to learn of the intentions which he announced on behalf of the Commission, which are generally in line with those of the French Presidency.
We already had an opportunity to note as much yesterday as, according to the tradition, there was a working meeting between the government, all the Commissioners, the Commission President, the Prime Minister and myself. This enabled us to observe the synergy between our concerns and ambitions.
Mr Prodi mentioned codecision in particular, and expressed his pleasure at the fact that this procedure was being gradually improved and was becoming more common.
He looked to the IGC to extend the use of codecision.
This is, as you know, one of the objectives of our presidency, along with the extension of qualified majority voting.
Chairman Poettering made a brilliant and generous speech, for which I must thank him particularly. I appreciated it greatly.
He mentioned a number of subjects. Mr Chairman, the presidency can already answer your question regarding greater transparency on the part of the Council.
It has been announced specifically that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for European Affairs will come to the European Parliament after every 'General Affairs' Council to inform Parliament and to ensure the necessary dialogue with Parliament.
This is one step in the direction you suggested, and I hope that it will serve to improve relations between our two great institutions and also, of course, to clarify the development of the subjects under discussion.
We also share your concern to have strong institutions, as you emphasised.
I said as much yesterday in Paris, at the meeting with the Commission.
I said this to Mr Prodi.
This is a prerequisite if our work is to be effective and if the European Union' s role on the international stage is to be asserted properly.
Let me add, to respond to a concern you expressed, that I endorse completely the idea you put forward to the effect that we need a single institutional framework and, above all, no parallel frameworks.
That goes without saying.
Everything that can give new impetus to the construction of Europe must be achieved both within the institutions and in accordance with the acquis communautaire.
This is perfectly plain as far as the French Presidency is concerned.
I have taken note of the wish to see that the Court of Justice is given the necessary resources.
Chairman BarÃ³n Crespo, who appears to be as familiar with the subtleties of the English language as he is with the French, mentioned a number of subjects which lie at the heart of the presidency' s thinking.
Regarding the European social model, one of the main objectives of the French Presidency is to arrive at an agreement on the social agenda in Nice.
We shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective.
Regarding public services, a subject mentioned by a number of speakers, the last of whom was Mr Saint-Josse, I should like to say that the French Presidency is very attentive to this matter.
We are well aware of the need to modernise and adapt public services, but we also know that they are a key element in the equal rights and opportunities of all citizens within a country and that this equality cannot, of course, be subject only or mainly to the criteria of profitability, which would inevitably lead to people in unprofitable situations being deprived of services provided in other circumstances to people in cities, for example, in more favourable economic conditions.
(Applause)
Quite obviously, this is not France' s ambition.
For a long time I have represented an extremely poor, rural constituency in France, and I can tell you that I consider, and have always considered, that it had just the same entitlement - and indeed the same duties to contribute in the form of taxation - with regard to the main public services, the lifeblood of the nation, as any district in Paris.
We shall therefore take great care to ensure that the necessary modernisation of public services is not confused with making them profitable, which would be a serious mistake.
(Applause)
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned many other things, particularly closer cooperation, development of the social model and enlargement.
He also mentioned the charter of rights.
This is something to which we also attach great importance.
We should like to see the convention, in which Parliament is to a great extent involved, issue its conclusions very quickly, before Biarritz, if possible, so that we can discuss them there.
That also means that the charter must include all the values, all the principles and rights on which our convictions and our societies are based, i.e. not only civil and political rights but also economic and social rights.
(Applause)
France is extremely keen to see economic and social rights clearly expressed in this charter.
Indeed, this is the main demand from the European Trade Union Confederation, one I find legitimate and justifiable.
If we wish to have a European social model, then it must be based on clear principles, which must be clearly defined, and they would best be expressed in the charter.
The problem, which a number of speakers mentioned, of integrating the charter into the treaty is one which has yet to be discussed.
The convention' s conclusions have not yet been published. We should await their conclusions on this subject.
At the present stage, the opinions of the various operators involved are still, I would say, rather contradictory and have not, in any case, been firmly expressed.
We need time before we give our opinion on this.
I am not absolutely sure that a clear decision can be taken in Nice.
If it is possible, so much the better.
At any event, France' s ambition is to see the advent of the charter in Nice, a charter with the scope and ambition to which I referred just now.
Chairman Cox, like Mr Poettering, pointed out the importance he attached to strong institutions.
My response is similar.
I think it essential to have strong institutions, i.e. which have the necessary power to accept their responsibilities, but also the power to avoid deadlock.
It is clear right now that we are in a situation where the prospect of enlargement may lead to deadlock if we do not take the action required to enable Europe to overcome the sluggishness which is going to increase with enlargement.
This, indeed, is the reason why we attach so much importance, firstly, to the problem of the weighting of votes and, secondly, to the problem of closer cooperation.
Closer cooperation is in no way intended to create a Europe divided between those in the vanguard and those lagging behind, but simply to give the necessary impetus to the proper operation of Europe and thus to enable those that wish to go slightly faster in certain areas to do so, which will necessarily result in others being carried along in its wake.
This is an extremely important and almost institutional factor in pulling people along.
Mr Cox, you need have no fear on the subject of enlargement, which other speakers also mentioned, and which President Prodi discussed in a particularly firm manner.
If we want to make absolutely certain of the success of institutional reform, i.e. the IGC and the related Treaty of Nice, it is because we want enlargement to go ahead as speedily as possible.
Enlargement as quickly as possible is not, of course, synonymous with political decision.
Enlargement is not a political decision.
It is a shared political determination to be capable of applying the same rules throughout the Europe of tomorrow.
Of course, it presupposes a determination to enlarge on the part of the European Union: this is clear and not seriously challenged by anyone.
It also, however, presupposes a determination on the part of the candidate countries to undertake the reforms necessary to be able to join the European Union, without which the Union would be disrupted and the states joining without having undertaken the necessary reforms in order to adapt to the Community standards would face major social, economic and political difficulties.
In this spirit, we are absolutely determined, Mr President, to ensure that the negotiations undertaken with each candidate country are continued and intensified.
We shall carry out our work in this field as quickly and as well as possible, with a view, I would stress, as President Prodi said just now, to enlarging as quickly as possible.
There is no doubt about it.
The point of constructing Europe in the first place was to establish peace, and to cause it to take root, after so many pointless fratricidal wars; establishing peace and, consequently, democracy, since they go together.
Peace and democracy cannot be established within just one part of Europe, they must be established throughout the whole of Europe.
We can discuss Europe' s frontiers afterwards - that is another matter - but peace and democracy must apply to the whole of Europe.
Enlargement, then, is not just a moral requirement of candidate countries, but is also in the fundamental interest of a Europe that one wishes to see existing tomorrow, based on the principles of peace, democracy, human rights and freedoms.
(Applause)
Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation.
I have just answered this.
He also mentioned the state of the world today in terms which, I must admit, moved me and which I endorse.
It is true that we live in a world where the gap between rich and poor is increasing.
The UNDP report for 1999, by which I mean not the report tabled this year but last year, gave an example which, although not significant, is still striking, saying that the three largest private fortunes in the world today are equivalent to the sum of the gross national products of all the least developed countries, representing 600 million people.
What is more, it can be observed that this phenomenon is on the increase, and so is the resulting exclusion, and this is one of the main dangers of today' s world.
Major debates are underway on the subject of globalisation, as Mr Lannoye pointed out.
I am not, of course, going to enter into such a debate right now, even though Europe cannot remain apart from these debates, and so the Presidency, like the Commission and Parliament, must necessarily get involved.
Globalisation is clearly inescapable and inevitable and is, for the most part, the result of the development of techniques and technology.
It also provides some advantages because it does facilitate trade and, nowadays, trade is the greatest creator of wealth.
It does, therefore, have positive aspects, which it would be foolish to deny.
It also has dangers, however, in three areas in particular.
Firstly, the danger we have just mentioned: the exclusion of those who cannot go as fast as the others.
This is true in terms of the citizens within a single country and today we can observe an increase in exclusion despite strong growth and declining unemployment.
It is also true in terms of nations, where we can see rich counties getting even richer and poor countries, alas, becoming even poorer, as Mr Lannoye said just now.
(Applause)
This is a shift in world society to which we must be very attentive and which we cannot, of course, accept.
The subject is to be discussed, moreover, in the near future in G7 and G8, but it is a subject of concern to everyone, especially Europe.
The second risk of globalisation which has also been mentioned is the serious threat to the world' s ecosystem.
As soon as one seeks to maximise profits, which is understandable to a certain extent because profits are a factor in progress, but as soon as one seeks to maximise profits without real restrictions that are internationally acknowledged and imposed in order to prevent excesses, then there comes a time when the damage inflicted on nature is such that it is no longer able to regenerate.
It is not obvious, but it is a real problem, which must be taken seriously.
(Applause)
The typical example mentioned by a number of speakers was the Hague Conference to be held in autumn on greenhouse gas emissions.
If, as seems likely and even highly likely, scientists' conclusions indicate that these emissions present serious risks to the ecological balance of our planet, thus seriously compromising the legacy we are leaving to future generations, then there are grounds for carefully researching ways to control these emissions.
For, as things stand at present, it is true to say that globalisation is going in exactly the opposite direction to this.
The final disadvantage, the final risk of globalisation, involves everything related to large-scale crime.
With the development of globalisation and advanced technology, with the Net, we can clearly see a trend for the considerable development of cybercrime in all areas: drugs, terrorism, crime of every kind.
Therefore, globalisation does entail risks, but what exactly does that mean?
It means that we cannot challenge globalisation as such, because it is going to spread, whatever we do. We have to make the best of it, and this can be done by controlling it and giving it a human face, which means that we must be aware of the risks it involves.
This is the clear message that all major institutions, particularly the European Union and its institutions, must send out throughout the world.
(Applause)
This answer is also addressed to Mr Wurtz who also mentioned these problems, along with others, of course, particularly with regard to the Europe of the citizens.
I of course share his feeling that Europe must be first and foremost a Europe of the citizens.
We must respond to the concerns of everyday life.
We do not do this enough, that is true, even though, in my opinion, a great deal of progress has been made in this area.
The social debates which have been underway for three or four years now within the European Union could not have taken place seven or eight or ten years ago, when they would not even have been considered.
So, there has been some progress.
I have expressed my views on globalisation.
I do not believe, Mr President, that Fortress Europe is any sort of ambition or, indeed, any sort of reality.
Europe is open, by definition.
Europe' s commitment is to supporting a range of values, a culture and an identity which represents, I would say, the synthesis of the cultures and identities of each of the nations in Europe, hence the importance of maintaining cultural diversity and defending each European nation' s right to retain its own culture, identity and language.
On this basis, union, according to the old adage of strength through unity, is the only way to safeguard these cultures and identities in future when confronted with the multipolar world which is developing today and which is universally in evidence.
Tomorrow, we will be faced with a vast China, a vast India, a large South-East Asia and an organised South America, not to mention North America.
It is quite clear that if we are content to remain where we are now, divided to a greater or lesser extent, then we shall purely and simply vanish.
It is only by being united and, at the same time, retaining our own identities that we will be able to survive and, in this context, we must not be a fortress but we must, nevertheless, combine our forces and our efforts.
Finally, Mr Wurtz mentioned the notorious Tobin tax.
I should just like to tell him that the reform of the international monetary system is on the agenda, as he well knows, and that, clearly, we must combat the instability of the financial markets.
That is obvious, and I am, of course, committed to this.
It is one of the subjects we shall also be discussing at the G7 meeting in Okinawa.
In this spirit, I am willing to admit that we shall have to look closely into all the possible means of achieving this twofold objective of stability and equity, adopting an open-minded and realistic approach.
For a long time now I been taking not of Charles Pasqua' s comments on gastronomy, and indeed on other matters, and so I was very interested to hear him speak, there is no question of that, even if I did not completely recognise the Europe that we are building together from his remarks and description.
Clearly, we are not looking at matters from the same perspective.
(Laughter and applause)
In particular, he brought up the word 'federal' or 'federation' many times in his speech.
This is an old and very French argument that we have had in France and, indeed, it is based on the fact that the meaning we give this word in France differs from that given in other languages, especially German, and this interpretation has led to misunderstandings that have, of course, degenerated into arguments.

Both Charles Pasqua and I have served a man who we admired greatly, President Georges Pompidou, who was accustomed to saying, as he did not appreciate pointless arguments, "Federation, confederation or a federation, it is all a con federation in the end" .
(Laughter) Perhaps it was a rather provocative thing to say, but there was also an element of Cantal or Auvergne good sense behind this comment.
I would make a friendly suggestion that Charles Pasqua thinks about this.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr de Gaulle will probably understand that I do not share his views.
Once again I heard him out, but let me take the liberty of saying that there is one right that I am not prepared to grant him, and that is the right to claim to be speaking on behalf of General de Gaulle.
(Applause)
Last but not least, Mr Saint-Josse mentioned a number of matters which have already been touched upon, and I should just like to pick out one or two of the arguments he pointed out.
Firstly, cultural diversity and implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.
I unreservedly endorse the expression of this necessity, and the spirit thereof.
It is true that our cultural diversity is a source of wealth, and that the principle of subsidiarity is an absolute necessity.
Decisions must be taken at the right level.
Let us not go back over the past, or over a few examples that would make easy targets. In order for the principle of subsidiarity to be properly applied, however, we need standard rules.
I am thinking of a specific decision taken by the Commission, and subsequently challenged, particularly on grounds of non-compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
I observe, however, that it was the governments that asked the Commission to take this decision in the first place.
(Applause)There is therefore some ambiguity, if you will, and the more of us there are, the more essential it will be to enforce strict application of the principle of subsidiarity. This, of course, means that there must be a standard set of rules to avoid any sort of ambiguity.
I repeat, and I said this in Berlin in another context and from another angle, we must be able to identify clearly who is responsible for doing what, otherwise it just will not work, as we saw in the example I mentioned just now.
(Applause)We must make ready to state clearly what Europe is doing, what each of the nations that make up Europe is doing, and what, within the nations, a number of administrative levels participating in the political and human life of these nations are doing.
I am thinking, for example, of the German LÃ€nder, but there are, of course, many other examples that could be cited.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have had the opportunity to make a few comments on the very interesting contributions made by the representatives of this House, and I thank you for the welcome you have given me here today.
(Loud applause)
I should like to thank the President, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the very full answers he has given the group chairmen in this House.
We shall carry on with our debate.
The President is forced to leave us because the family of the hostage held on Jolo, Sonia Wendling, asked to meet President Jacques Chirac, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to see how all these poor hostages might be released as quickly as possible.
I am sure, Mr Hager, that you share the anxiety of these families.
Madam President, you could not be more wrong.
It is a matter of deep regret to me that the President-in-Office of the Council left the House just as the representative of the last group of delegates was about to speak, thereby registering his disinterest.
The honourable members are left wondering whether this is an act against the Independents or against the first Austrian representative to speak in this debate.
I fear that in behaving as he has done today, the President-in-Office of the Council, who spoke out against exclusion earlier on, is guilty of that very thing I therefore refuse to give my opinion on the programme of the French Council Presidency, owing to a suspected lack of interest, and I regret that such a signal has been sent out at the beginning of the Council Presidency.
In spite of the foregoing, being an optimist, I hope that in future this Council Presidency, like others before it, will take cognisance of its neutral position, and that at the end of the day, normality will also return to the group.
Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me, as president of the French delegation within the PPE-DE Group, to take the floor on the day that the French Presidency of the European Union presented its priorities.
In his speech last week in the Reichstag in Berlin, which was universally recognised as historic, the President-in-Office of the Council opened up new perspectives for the French Presidency, and also, I hope, for the presidencies which are to follow.


He not only asked the real questions as to why we should build Europe, who should be involved, and how it should be done, he also provided answers key to the future of a European Union embarking on an unprecedented enlargement.
To those who prefer to focus only on the short-term but certainly essential reforms that are awaiting the French Presidency and that must result in the future Treaty of Nice next December, I shall respond that these major reforms will only be achieved successfully if they are guided not only by modern European history, but also by an ambitious and realistic vision of what the Europe of tomorrow must be - a strong, democratic and free Europe that carries some weight in the eyes of the world.
We all know that in order to meet the considerable challenges which Europe faces today, we shall together have to work out how to clearly define our plan for Europe, all together.
We must be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for having had both the courage and boldness to encourage our partners to engage in discussions but also to suggest the guidelines for these.
Our fellow citizens await a Europe which at last has the determination to review its modus operandi and to strive to achieve greater clarity, greater transparency and greater efficiency.
The reforms of the Commission and the Council must respond to these requirements.
We must keep in mind that, even if it is not an easy task, France and its partners are under an obligation to achieve results.
We must reach an agreement, and a good one at that.
Far from clouding the issue, today' s debate has offered some clarification as to the direction of the action to be undertaken in the months and years to come, which I shall sum up as follows: bringing Europe closer to the citizens, all the citizens without exception, be they close to the decision-making centres or remote, economic modernisation and a social Europe, efficiency and a strong presence in the world.
I have every confidence in Jacques Chirac, President-in-Office of the Council, and in his ability, along with our partners within the European Union, to meet these historic challenges.
Mr President, I have a point of order under Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure, which moreover is expressly quoted on page 25 of today' s agenda.
According to the schedule, the Council was to have 30 minutes' speaking time.
President Chirac spoke for one and a quarter hours.
According to the schedule, Members of Parliament were to be allowed to speak, but the President did not silence the people interrupting Mr de Gaulle.
Instead she cut his speech to a strict three minutes, even though she had allowed the other speakers an extra minute and, finally, she did not allow the speaker on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members to speak.
He was entitled to speak before the response from the President-in-Office of the Council.
The President has not fulfilled her obligation to run debates in this House objectively.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on setting the course we are heading for beyond the French Presidency, but this forces us to mention the questions that will be raised, regardless of whether the intergovernmental conference is successful.
Our heading cannot be just the institutional construction which we know particularly appeals to the French.
It must also answer the question: what do we wish to achieve together?
Are we ready to draw the conclusions of the great leap forward undertaken by the French President' s predecessors?
I am thinking particularly of the matter of adopting the euro.
The questions that we must also answer are those that our fellow citizens are asking.
They aspire to see Europe operating better.
Whatever the advantages of talking about our visions for the future, right now we have to respond to the aspirations of the men and women who make up Europe, and in order to do so, all the members of the French executive must be involved in order to make a success of this presidency.
I believe that the projects undertaken by Lionel Jospin' s government, in France and in Europe, give the President-in-Office of the Council every opportunity to fulfil this objective.
We must also make a success of this agenda, and this means, first and foremost, making a success of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Key political questions will have to be settled, but if we want the European Union to be in a position to make decisions, then first and foremost we have to move into the realm of the qualified majority.
Moreover, Parliament requested that intensified cooperation be included on the intergovernmental conference agenda.
We are pleased to see that this has been possible.
We should like to see the right of veto cancelled for the transition to intensified cooperation, but this increased flexibility should not pave the way for an increasingly intergovernmental mode of operation.
Then, I should like to tell the French Presidency that it can count on Parliament' s support to prefer rather that we have no Nice Agreement than a mediocre Treaty.
Beyond the Intergovernmental Conference, we are also awaiting a review of the working methods and organisation of the European Union' s institutions.
We are thinking, obviously, of the reform underway within the Commission, but also and perhaps more importantly, within the Council.
The French Presidency has set itself the objective of placing Europe at the service of growth and full employment.
This is a renewed objective, for which we think a necessary objective is to step up work within the euro-11 group, soon to be the euro-12.
We are delighted that the French President has made a commitment to the greater visibility and authority of this body, which we consider to be a useful one.
As regards the social agenda, once again we are pleased to see that the prospect of full employment is henceforth seen as embracing the whole of the European Union.
We are delighted, moreover, to see the commitment of Lionel Jospin' s government to bring a number of essential directives to a successful conclusion.
I am thinking primarily of the directive on information and consultation of employees, as well as the working time directive for mobile workers.
The French President spoke of the Europe of men and women, the increased attention we must pay to the concerns of our fellow citizens.
In this respect, the work undertaken within the Convention on framing the Charter of Fundamental Rights is absolutely essential.
At the European Council in Biarritz, the Convention members will be ready to propose a comprehensive text which is to include economic and social rights.
However, the European Council will also have to be prepared for Parliament demanding time and again that the possibility of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty should be tabled.
We consider this to be an essential point.
What is the point in recognising rights if no legal recourse is possible?
With a view to creating a Europe that is closer to the citizens, I shall not go through the French Presidency' s entire programme, I have just two points to make.
One of these concerns the "money laundering" directive which, I believe, offers the progress that our fellow citizens wish to see.
They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area.
In the field of reciprocal recognition of legal rulings, we are continually faced with situations where the divergent nature of our judicial structures involve our fellow citizens in serious personal deadlocks.
We need progress here.
Mr President, one final word to express how important we think it is that the French Presidency should also transform the acquis of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the subject of services of general interest.
These services of general interest contribute to the social and territorial cohesion of the European Union, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The test we are going to have to face in this respect concerns the directive on postal services.
Such services are also part of the modern world, for example Internet access for all.
We hope that the French Presidency will be able to propose a framework directive on this subject.
Mr President, the programme which the French President has just presented is both ambitious and realistic.
I was, however, hoping for a clearer commitment regarding the fundamental rights included in the Union' s agenda, for two reasons.
In the first place, these rights must be enshrined in the forthcoming Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In his speech, however, the President did not cite the examination of this charter as one of the main points of the European Council in Biarritz.
In his response to the first speakers, he suggested that there could be some discussion of a proposal for a charter in Biarritz, but with a content that, he is well aware, would make it almost impossible to incorporate into the Treaties at the European Council in Nice.
Is France, the homeland of human rights for two centuries, not going to set a more ambitious objective?
This would be a great disappointment.
In the second place, since Amsterdam, fundamental rights have formed the foundations of our Union and should represent the constant reference for any Member State action.
The creation of an area of freedom, justice and security is the most difficult undertaking before us, especially given that unanimity is still the rule.
This is a good subject of investigation for the intensified cooperation to which the President recently referred once again.
The President was the first to refer to the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty in connection with the Haider case.
In adopting such a stance, he set a very high standard, not just for the Austrian Government but, indirectly, for all the others too.
The measures the French Presidency has already announced in the areas of justice and home affairs appear to live up to this challenge.
They are, however, merely plans at this stage.
Let me therefore address the French Presidency with the words the Greeks used to address the most promising athlete in ancient times: hic rhodus, hic salta [here is your Colossus, now jump!].
Mr President, Minister, let me share a few comments with you in the intimate surroundings of the end of the day's sitting.
Apparently, Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity.
I do not know, after listening to President Chirac' s comments, what political party he is going to wind up in at the end of his career, but the transformation is extraordinary, and it is true that we have taken twenty-one years to persuade President Chirac that Europe is something other than that which he believed when he made his Cochin address in 1978.
I should like to say that I am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard over such a long period to persuade Prime Minister Jospin to at last grasp the European cause firmly.
He is not always against it and it is safe to make minor observations like that without getting irritated!
I simply meant that I am convinced that it is no longer enough today to repeat things endlessly: President Chirac said many things that I agree with.
Ambitious, yes, it is ambitious, but let us see tangible proof of this ambition!
I am sorry, for example, that he did not repeat what he said in Berlin regarding the agenda for a constitution.
In Berlin, he said we should have enlargement plus constitution at the same time.
I would have liked him to say the same thing before this House: enlargement plus constitution, at the same time, so that we might have a constitution by 2003 or 2004 or 2005 as well as enlargement.
Secondly, speaking of a constitution, we must be careful not to be too naive.
Who does what?
It sounds good but what does it actually mean?
For Europe means shared authority, and increasingly shared authority: in other words, the constitution ought to tell us who does what, and how, together.
That is precisely the problem!
If it were quite as simple to perform political surgery, we would make faster progress.
And then I must say that, as Paul Lannoye said, I am saddened when I hear people discussing foreign policy and sparing no expense on arms and defence without even mentioning conflict prevention.
Europe' s role is also to invent an alternative foreign policy based specifically on preventing conflicts, on the need for ever fewer arms.
I am not saying that we do not need arms, I am not so naive, but I do not want European foreign policy to be exemplified merely by top fighter planes and soldiers obliged to go to Bosnia or Kosovo, but instead by our ability to prevent a conflict arising in Bosnia or Kosovo.
From this point of view, I would say that President Chirac is going in the right direction and I think that Prime Minister Jospin would be able to catch up with him if he were more clearly and resolutely pro-European.
Mr President, Minister, one presidency follows another, but, hearing Mr Chirac, we realise that the speeches and the pious hopes regarding exclusion remain the same.
It must, however, be noted that the fate of the fifty million poor people or the fifteen million unemployed people in Europe remains the same, whatever the presidency.
Europe is democratically bankrupt. The operation of the institutions is quite outside the concerns and outside the control of the citizens.
Europe is a liberalising machine deregulating public services at the expense of the people' s basic needs.
Europe is a fortress favouring illegal trafficking in modern-day slaves, as the Dover tragedy showed.
The demonstrations in Seattle, Geneva and Millau, however, show that another sort of Europe, another sort of globalisation, is possible.
To achieve a democratic Europe, let us begin by bringing down the Schengen fortress and agreeing that all men and women have the same freedom of movement as capital, and let us regularise the situation of illegal immigrants.
To achieve a social Europe, let us begin by banning layoffs on the part of firms in profit.
Finally, to achieve a Europe of justice and solidarity, let us begin by setting up, and not just talking about, a Tobin tax, up to a level that would make it possible to guarantee the subsistence of the billions of children and adults totally without resources.
For the people, these requirements are the priorities in the debate, which is certainly needed, on the weighting of votes or the right of veto.
Mr President, Minister, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals in the TDI Group who, as everyone knows, are European federalists.
For this reason, we will be paying extremely close attention to any institutional steps towards closer cooperation, which must be clearly and firmly established within the Community framework.
I shall use my speaking time, however, to remind you that this Parliament asked the IGC to grant Parliament the right finally to decide on its own location.
This is a fundamental right, and three hundred Members of this House, moreover, made it very clear that they are unhappy about being forced to come to Strasbourg twelve times a year.
I hope that the French Presidency will take due account of this issue, which we consider to be extremely important.
It is no coincidence that the Friday sitting has been abolished, Minister.
It is because many Members of this Parliament are fed up with the problems they experience in getting to Strasbourg and in working properly in these conditions.
Mr President, in view of the way in which the list of speakers has been manipulated today in order to put paid to my colleague Mr Hager, I have only this to say to you: if the Austrian referee Benko had broken all the rules in the game between France and Portugal, as Madam President has done today, then France would not even have reached the final.
That is the funny side of it.
The less amusing aspect of the conflict we are engaged in today is that there are several hundred delegates sitting here who are actually willing to accept this without protest!
Mr President, we are delighted with what Mr Chirac, the President-in-Office of the Council, has said at a time when we have the strong feeling that there is a deep crisis in Europe and when we would like to know where we stand.
I should like to discuss the three factors which I think are at the root of the crisis in Europe today.
The first is a profound questioning of all the institutional players in Europe; the second factor is the distance and the lack of understanding that separate the general public from the European institutions, and the third factor, which is the key to the first two, is a loss of perspective.
For a long time, we in Europe felt that we knew where we were going.
This is no longer the case. That is why many of us welcomed the speech made by the President of the French Republic to the Reichstag, particularly his decision to declare the European Constitution to be the key to all future mechanisms for change.
Today, he has chosen not to use the same words.
Many of us regret this because we feel that his statement that the ideas he expressed in the Reichstag went beyond the French Presidency of the Union, represents a fresh approach.
We feel instead that the issue of Europe' s prospects, the issue of the architecture of a new Europe and the issue of the future European Constitution belong right at the heart of the French Presidency of the Union.
These are not secondary or incidental issues, to be addressed at a later date; they should be addressed as a matter of priority and are at the heart of the discussions that we will be holding.
If we are unable to respond to the issue of Europe' s prospects, we will not be able to respond to the technical issues that face us.
This would be a missed opportunity for us.
I shall sum this up in one sentence: work on the Constitution and therefore on Europe' s prospects must be clearly launched during the French Presidency.
It must be launched at Nice.
Mr President, Mr President, the French presidency' s programme is interesting and in no way devoid of substance.
There is a lot one can agree with.
I nonetheless wonder whether it is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity to talk about housing, health care and sport.
Ought the EU really to be devoting itself to those kinds of issue?
The idea of a community of values is important, but opinions are divided on how this is to be achieved.
Many of us are disappointed at Prime Minister Jospin' s statement to the effect that there will be no change during the French presidency when it comes to the 14 countries' boycott of Austria.
The intensive discussion in recent weeks of our visions of Europe' s future has been stimulating, but it causes disquiet in the candidate States.
Where exactly does the EU stand?
This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred.
The unclear signals give scope to populists with nationalist agendas in the candidate States who want to prevent their countries from becoming Members of the Union.
Was it a coincidence that no statement was made at Feira to the effect that we should be ready for enlargement by the year 2002?
Does the French presidency' s policy concerning a further Intergovernmental Conference at the end of 2003 or the beginning of 2004 imply support for Chancellor SchrÃ¶der' s proposal for a new conference on the division of labour?
Even in that case, the signals are unclear, which is alarming for the candidate States.
To conclude, I would point to one instance of unilateral action which is worrying.
Why did France discontinue Slovakia' s membership of the OECD, citing the EU' s directive on TV issues?
Was it right to do this off its own bat, without checking what the other Member States thought?
What was the reason for its action?
This has also given rise to concern in the candidate States about the attitude we take to their legislation and to their legitimate interest in being involved in OECD cooperation, which is economically important.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency' s ship is heavily-laden and we hope, particularly having heard Mr Chirac' s answers, that it arrives safely in Nice, in six months.
Nice is founded on an ancient Phoenician settlement, originally named Nicaia, meaning victory, and we are certainly expecting victory on the part of the French Presidency, both for the current citizens of the Union and for those who will be joining it.
We were pleased to note the Presidency' s will, ambition and clear-sightedness, particularly with regard to the contradictions inherent in some of our European policies.
Global warming is one such problem.
Like a sword of Damocles, it hangs over not only the Union, but over the whole world.
Integrating this essential factor into all European policies is the political challenge to which we must respond.
I am not convinced that this is the direction we are currently taking, in spite of all the fine words that have been spoken here this morning.
Mr President, the historical issue concerning the French Presidency, for I do feel that it is a historical issue, is first and foremost to open up the way for the construction of a Europe for all Europeans.
We invited the new democracies in Eastern Europe to join us now that they have put the ordeal of Communism behind them and we were right to do so. Nevertheless, we were fully aware that we would not fit greater Europe into the institutions of little Europe.
Since then we have dawdled and dragged our feet over the reform of these institutions.
Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall and one year after the Helsinki decisions on enlargement, I see the new Intergovernmental Conference under the French Presidency as the kick-start that all Europeans expect of Europe. I say this because it is not only the size of Europe that is changing; it is also its very nature.
If we consider Europe as a whole, we must define Europe and define its borders, its values and the European project. Any definition of borders raises the problem of Turkey, which, to my mind, should become an associate country rather than a fully integrated one.
We must also think of Europe in a different light, not as a huge nation-state, with a super-government, a super-president, a super-administration or even a super-tax.
Instead, we should see Europe as the construction of an area of genuine federalism, which protects the diversity of people and of nations, which has a clear constitution that defines and limits the powers of Europe and which applies the principle of subsidiarity and ensures that this will be strictly complied with.
Today, the French Presidency has an obligation to achieve results.
As the French President said, unless the IGC is successful, there is no point in thinking about the following stages.
A review of decision-making mechanisms in order to prevent paralysis and a review of the functioning of the Council and the Commission are all on the agenda and I think that the projects for tomorrow and beyond must not conceal what is required today.
The success of the IGC now will actually be the best basis on which to build the huge project for the greater Europe of tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency is going to be a particularly busy one.
The Portuguese Presidency has done a great job and achieved major, innovative results at the Lisbon Summit. Now the Member States of the Union need to implement the results swiftly.
However, not enough progress is being made at the IGC.
There is a need for stronger political will and for the political level of the negotiations on reforming the Union to be raised immediately.
It is therefore important that the debate on the future structure of the Union has been reopened following the positions adopted by Minister Joshka Fischer.
Now, the first task must be to define at Nice certain priority issues referred to by President Chirac in his introductory speech, such as closer cooperation, the adoption of majority voting as the rule and the adoption of a decisive Charter on Fundamental Rights which will be included in the Treaties. This would be a basic step towards defining a European Constitution.

We feel that these decisions are crucial in terms of the reform of the Union: without them any discussion of its structure will be academic, and it is clear that, now that the single currency and the Central Bank have been established, Europe is in need of new political unity and, as has been said, a fresh boost for economic growth and social cohesion.
President Prodi reiterated these points.
I therefore feel that we can assure the French Presidency that we will make every effort to make these next six months a success: we are aware that there are considerable political differences between the countries and that now is the time to adopt clear positions.
In our opinion, there is a clear dividing line between those who want enlargement to bring less political integration and those who consider that greater political integration and clearly defined timeframes will be necessary.
We feel that opinion is also divided over the form that the Union' s institutions should take after enlargement.
There would appear to be a choice between developing the supranational components - strengthening the role of Parliament and the Commission - and enhancing the intergovernmental aspects.
We would like to make it possible for the countries who so desire to cooperate more closely to present a united front in a number of sectors such as economic and monetary union, which is still far from being fully achieved, internal security, and defence and foreign policy, which represents an open, dynamic core of more advanced integration.
As regards management of the economy, we support the establishment of a Euro-12, for we feel that, with the introduction of the euro, this is necessary for the Central Bank as well.
We consider it essential to maintain the fundamental goals of the European Social Model - adapting it, of course, to the diversification requirements determined by the new economy - and introducing new forms of flexibility which are different from those governing the labour market: flexibility which makes its own rules.
We believe in increased synergy between the European Parliament and national parliaments, but we are against commingling which undermines the fundamental consideration that the European Parliament is the parliamentary organ of supranationality elected by direct universal suffrage.
I would like to make one last point regarding the European Union' s role in the international institutions.
President Chirac delivered a highly Europeanist speech to the Bundestag, and committed himself to revitalising the development of the European Union and providing it with a Constitution voted in by the European citizens.
We support these proposals.
President Chirac once again expressed French support for the German application for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council, confirming his intention to strengthen the French-German axis in the context of a purely intergovernmental vision of the future structure of the European Union.
For a long time we have felt a review of the membership of the Security Council to be necessary, but we consider that it would be more appropriate for representation to the Council to be by major continents, such as Africa, South America and Europe.
Since we feel that the intergovernmental, supranational and parliamentary aspects should be balanced within Europe, we consider that it is the European Union as a whole which should be represented at the Security Council.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the requests, proposals and projects presented during these past weeks by Mr Fischer, Mr Bayrou, Mr Monti and Mr VÃ©drine and by President Chirac in Berlin, and Mr Chirac' s speeches here today are all evidence of the fact that, despite setbacks and despite our differences, we have entered a new stage of European construction.
The positive results we hope for from the Intergovernmental Conference should allow us to proceed to the necessary reform of the institutions in preparation for enlargement.
In this context, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament will each have to play an equally important and equally influential role, but these roles must include active cooperation.
It is the citizens who are calling for it, the citizens who are the true protagonists of the Europe of today, but, more importantly, the protagonists of the Europe of tomorrow, an enlarged, integrated Europe which is capable of meeting the challenge of globalisation.
The success of the euro will not be sufficient on its own for us to hold our ground against the United States and the China of tomorrow.
It is true that we must move forward in the area of the common foreign and security policy and support our currency politically as well, but progress has to be made in the defence of the fundamental values of our Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must reflect this.

It is the duty of confirmed Europeanists such as ourselves, who believe in the social market economy, to fight the scourge of unemployment, and in order to do this Europe must encourage the small and medium-sized businesses and foster the development of trade, agriculture, tourism and craft trades, but, in the context of subsidiarity, it must also reduce the burden of taxation.
However, as President Chirac stressed, we must educate our young people, prepare them for the challenge of globalisation, and not only from a professional and cultural point of view.
We must educate young people to stand up for principles, and the fight against drugs and the development of the social function of sport may well play a significant part in this.
But, Mr President, the best results take time to achieve: they are like mosaics, built one piece at a time.
Yet are we sure that this Presidency will achieve the goals it has set itself just because it is French and France was one of the founder countries of the Union?
It will have the sure political and parliamentary support of the Forza Italia delegation in the PPE-DE Group, for the Italy of today and of tomorrow will certainly be a protagonist in the construction of that Europe in which we all believe so strongly.
Mr President, what a change we have seen from Mr Chirac' s speech of a few years ago!
He is a President who in fact started out as an extreme eurosceptic, if I may use such an expression, but today he has made a truly European speech, which was applauded equally by the left and the right in this Parliament.
I feel that I must congratulate the Socialist government on having convinced the French President so thoroughly.
It is greatly to the President' s credit that he used words which sometimes tend to divide us.
I am thinking here of the word 'federalism' , and he said that everything depends on what one means by this.
That is precisely the problem with several words that are used in the current debate.
The European Union has always had certain federalist characteristics such as qualified majority voting instead of unanimity in decision making within the Council; a directly elected Parliament, an executive Commission which is independent from governments; Community law which takes precedence over national law, amongst other things. All of these are federal characteristics.
On the other hand, the European Union is a long way from being a centralised federation, like many of the world' s federations.
This is a decentralised federation in which the Member States play an extremely important role in decision-making and remain in control of the Treaties.
All this ambiguity means that we should perhaps not allow issues of terminology or theology to divide us, but should instead unite on the specific changes that we need to make to the system.
The same applies to the word "constitution" , which can also evoke quite different things.
As a citizen of the United Kingdom, a country which does not even have any kind of written or codified constitution, I should like to ask the following question: what is a constitution?
This depends on what you mean.
People interpret things differently and, with this word too, we run the risk of allowing vocabulary and theology, if I may use that term, to divide us, instead of uniting over the content.
To some extent, we already have a constitution, which consists of the Treaties.
The Treaties, after all, define the Union' s sphere of competences, the powers of its institutions and the procedures for adopting legislation or the budget.
To some extent, therefore, they form a "constitution" .
Mr Pasqua defined the constitution as the foundation of a new legal order.
Is this not precisely what we have founded in Europe?
Instead of allowing ourselves to become divided by the philosophical point of what makes a constitution, we should look at how our present constitution needs to be improved.
First, it must be more readable and easier to use by consumers, i.e. the general public.
The European University Institute in Florence has submitted a fine project for our consideration, which makes our Treaties considerably shorter, more readable and easier to use, without even altering their content.
We must also look at the changes we need to make to our constitution.
On this subject, we must above all do what President Chirac suggested, which is to ensure that, in a Union of almost 30 members, there is no risk of action being blocked.
This is not really a question of creating a hard core.
There is no hard core. What is a fact, however, is that certain areas, or certain States, sometimes create delays, which are sometimes temporary.
There is therefore no need to create a hard core and we should instead create a situation in which our constitution prevents action being blocked.
We therefore need to strengthen qualified majority voting, to extend it as far as possible, and where this is not possible, to return to the issue of closer cooperation.
These are the two crucial points for the IGC.
Concentrate on these and above all, do so before enlargement.
Do this at Nice then, and not afterwards.
Mr President, I congratulate the French Presidency of the European Union on its ambitious approach in all areas and for its intention not to end the Intergovernmental Conference with a minimal agreement, but with results which make enlargement a real possibility.
Due to time restrictions, I will only refer to three points.
Firstly, closer cooperation and integration.
They will only be useful, Mr President, if four conditions are met: firstly, the Community dimension of the Union must be increased, rather than the intergovernmental dimension; there must be more integration, not more cooperation.
Secondly, the existing institutions must be used, not replaced with new bodies.
Thirdly, we should not have cooperation or integration of a variable composition, since that would mean a Europe Ã¡ la carte, that is to say, an ungovernable Europe.
Fourthly, in the same way, we should prevent this leading to factions or closed blocs which would divide the Union.
In other words, we want closer integration which is open to all current and future members of the Union.
My second point relates to the functioning of the Euro-12, which must be improved, but not by reducing further the current democratic deficit.
The Commission must therefore have genuine powers for making proposals, and not only for recommendation, and Parliament must participate seriously, starting with consultation, but extending to codecision.
My third point, Mr President, is that I am also one of those who believes that we need a Constitution for the Union.
My question is, why not take a first step now by approving the basic treaty prepared in Florence on the initiative of the Commission?
This does not change anything, but it does mean something very important: that the citizens may finally become aware of which system is governing them.
It would at least be a step forward in terms of this clarification which we are all requesting, but which we never get to see, at least with regard to something which must not be forgotten, Mr President, i.e. the distribution of competences in the European Union.
We are leaving it for the future.
Is the ratification process in certain countries not going to jeopardise this?
I leave that question open.
I will end here.
The ambitions are fine, but we want facts and we expect to see them at the end of the French Presidency.
Mr President, since we are in the run-up to the Treaty of Nice and since we have had the pleasure of reading a number of valuable speeches by Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac, it may be a novel idea for Germany and France to share the Union' s presidency for a year.
But under one proviso: that a fundamental breakthrough be reached in the field of European cooperation in line with all these fine speeches we have had the pleasure to hear and read.
This is not only meant as a pleasant intro, because what I want to establish above all is that the French-German axis should not only generate philosophies for the future but should also solve the institutional problems of today and tomorrow.
Whatever happens in Nice, decisions need to be taken on decision making.
As we see it, all European legislation, which does not affect the constitutions of the Member States, should be decided on by qualified majority, with codecision from Parliament.
In addition, decisions need to be taken on vote weighting and as we see it, it should be the size of the population in the Member States, as is the case in this House, that is the deciding factor.
Decisions need to be taken regarding the number of Commissioners - in our opinion, this should be one per Member State - and on the number of MEPs - we said a long time ago, 700 is more than enough.
Also, decisions need to be taken on the Court of Justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I completely echo Mr Gil-Robles' views that this should be included in the Treaties and that cooperation should be stepped up.
As far as the latter is concerned, it is vital that we tackle the Union' s structure.
Both Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac are right in this.
I am not averse to a federal structure for the European Union.
It could even be termed confederation, as President Chirac said earlier today.
It is high time that we had a European constitution which is organised in the way that the university of Florence recently proposed.
It is high time Mr Prodi had the authority and rights which a European government should in fact have.
It is also high time we had a bicameral system, but not of the kind proposed by Mr Joschka Fischer, with a European Parliament, as we have now, and a second parliament comprising representatives of the parliaments of the respective Member States.
It would be far better to convert the European Council of Ministers to a kind of Federal Council.
Interestingly, this is a term which Mr Chirac used in his response to the questions.
Surely this is the most natural way to provide Europe with a bicameral system consisting of a parliament and senate.
All we need to do is to turn the European Council into a senate.
Finally, such a constitution should very clearly and precisely define Europe' s and the Member States' respective remits.
As far as I am concerned, the European package as a whole could quite easily be fleshed out a little bit and the powers of the European Member States could be increased once again, as long as it is clear what is European and what is national, and as long as we find our way out of the diffuse intergovernmental and Community structure in which we find ourselves at present.
It would be ideal if the decision was taken in Nice to devise a project of this kind in two to three years' time.
I hope that the words of Mr Joschka Fischer and those of Mr Chirac will not remain words but will be turned into action.
I should appreciate a reaction from both honourable gentlemen who stayed behind during lunch.
Mr President, Minister, the French Presidency has committed itself to a courageous, ambitious, brilliant agenda, considering some of the difficulties we are experiencing at this time.
The important aspect of President Chirac' s speech was, we felt, our common values and intentions.
In our opinion, a Europe which builds its future with constancy, continuity and responsibility is the best guarantee that the founding fathers' blueprint is implemented faithfully, that the endeavours of all those who have worked on it over the past 50 years are at the basis of its success and that Europe is built on solid foundations.
It seems appropriate to break down the complex problem of the institutions: we must conclude the IGC on the three topics left over from Amsterdam and closer cooperation.
This is the only way we can move forward in the intense debate on the future of the European Union and reconcile the economic development of Europe with the strengthening of the European Social Model and with the fight against social exclusion and modern forms of poverty, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, step up negotiations on enlargement and increasingly consolidate the European Union' s role in the world.
In this context, we consider it essential to reinforce the European Commission, a supranational, independent body, the full expression of the unique characteristics of the structure of the European institutions.
Enlargement is the conclusion of a political process which began with the reconciliation of the countries of Western Europe 50 years ago.
This historic event must not be dismissed by replacing the Berlin wall with another wall, the wall of specific interests, egoism and bureaucracy.
However, as the French Presidency rightly pointed out, enlargement must not weaken the Union' s action either.
Mr Chirac' s words on the future of the European Union are reassuring, particularly because he spoke of a new stage which would start after the conclusion of the IGC, on subjects such as the consolidation of legitimate democracy in decisions, security and defence, the accentuation of the unique characteristics of the European institutions, a clear definition of responsibilities and the consolidation of the principle of subsidiarity, matters which cannot be ignored in the near future.
The subject of closer cooperation has been widely debated and disputed. It used to be known as the 'two speed' Europe and is now referred to as the 'hard core' .
Some see it as an opportunity and some as a threat.
In any case, all are in agreement that this situation should not lead to division but should spur us on to reach together those new frontiers which the current European model does not allow us to reach but which, in the future, it will have to.
I would inform our French friends that Italy, which has been at the forefront of the European project ever since the beginning and which, we hope, is soon to enter a period of political stability, will be become increasingly active, implementing tangible actions, alongside the countries which sincerely desire to reinforce the Union' s foundations and to achieve the most important and ambitious cooperation objectives.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I shall not speak for long, so as not to delay even further the lunchtime of those Members who are still present.
First of all, I wish to say how delighted I am to be here with you and to be speaking on behalf of the French Government, since I was a Member of the European Parliament, before it was located in this superb hemicycle - between 1994 and 1997.
I should like to thank the numerous speakers who have expressed their thoughts, all of which were extremely useful, and particularly those who spoke in French, although it is not their mother tongue.
More specifically, I should also like to acknowledge the encouragement given to the French Government by Pervenche BerÃšs and Klaus HÃ€nsch, as well as the ambition sought by some speakers, such as Mr Watson. I would also like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit with regard to the vision that drives my government and which has perhaps made an effective contribution to certain positions.
This presidency is being held against the backdrop of a vast movement, which has two components.
Firstly, we are in the process of preparing for an enlarged Europe, the united Europe of tomorrow and, as Mr Madelin said, this may involve changing the nature of the Union in addition to changing its size.
Secondly, we must bring this Europe closer to its citizens and ensure that it goes further towards fulfilling their aspirations.
It is quite clear that, in the wider debate on this issue, there are two phases.
There is the shorter-term phase of this Presidency, which is taking place at a pivotal and undoubtedly decisive moment, and then there is the longer-term phase, in which broader approaches will be outlined and in which the future of Europe will really take shape.
Here I am talking about a Europe of thirty Members.
Unlike Mr Bayrou, I do not think that it is fair, appropriate or timely today to eradicate these two phases, as it were, and to introduce them both under the French Presidency, because that would entail the risk of complicating the outcome of the IGC or, quite the opposite, to minimise this outcome, and ensure that it would only appear as an annex.
Let us focus on the task in hand.
Let us see this IGC through with ambition.
In doing so we will have established the basis which will enable us to move further towards European construction.
What will we be doing, specifically in this IGC?
Our position is quite clear.
It is our view that the IGC must succeed, that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds, but not at any price.
Our obligation concerns the means, not the outcome.
As Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said just now, we want a "nice treaty" in Nice, which means a good treaty, not any old treaty.
As Mr Corbett pointed out, it is true that the most important points are, in particular, the extension of qualified majority voting, which generally goes hand in hand with codecision with the European Parliament, and closer cooperation, because this is a bridge between the first and second stages, between the present and the future, since it improves the functioning of the European Union and because it enables us to think about the Europe of tomorrow.
At the same time, however, the French Presidency considers all these things to be connected.
Now, following the Feira European Council, and we are delighted that this is the case, four issues have been raised and we must reach a substantial agreement on all of them, by which I mean all four of these questions, and not only concentrate on one or other of them.
That is why we will be changing our working methods.
We intend to apply ourselves to this task, fully aware that it will be difficult, and we offer our thanks, of course, to the Portuguese Presidency, which has prepared the groundwork very well for us.
We shall work with determination, specifically by taking the negotiation into a more political phase, which will perhaps be more ambitious.
To this extent, Mr HÃ€nsch is right: the Franco-German partnership that has been re-established and the Franco-German ambition that has been recharged will prove extremely useful.
With regard to the Charter, I must pay tribute to the work carried out by President Herzog and to the Convention. This is a very original type of body, which brings together members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, representatives of Member States and of course, a representative of the Commission.
I wish to assure the European Parliament that this Charter is one of our priorities and we hope that the Convention will prove worthy of the task so that we will be able to discuss it in detail at the Biarritz European Council, with a view, as the French President has said, to making as much progress as possible with the content.
I am aware of the more or less unanimous feeling of the European Parliament about the restrictive nature of this Charter.
We shall see how much arbitration is required, but the French Presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue, given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the European Union' s institutions.
Beyond these issues lies that of the European Union' s constitutional prospects.
The first problem with this issue is the agenda, which I think would be difficult to set at this stage.
The important thing is to pursue this idea whilst seeking to define its outlines more clearly and whilst thinking about the best method for continuing this exchange of ideas. Like Mr Corbett once again, I feel that we must realise that the term "constitution" may mean the will to speed up European construction and European ambition, but that the term "constitutional" leads, and will inevitably lead, to debate, because it could give rise to, or be nourished and fed by, or include, contents which may turn out to be rather different.
Several Members of this Parliament have proposed that we should start by adopting the study carried out by the European University Institute in Florence. From what I have seen, they are certainly interesting, at least at this early stage, but I am bound to say that they will require a thorough examination.
The Commission will shortly be giving its opinion on this study, Mr President, next week, I believe.
Member States will also have to study this document, which inevitably raises many questions.
It makes some useful contributions, but, at the same time, the question of whether it really simplifies the situation remains.
This is an important matter that cannot be taken lightly and that is certainly not what the French Presidency will be doing.
To conclude, I shall just make two observations on issues that have been raised by two Members of this Parliament, specifically Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, who talked about environmental problems.
Our commitment to firmer Union action with regard to the environment and our will to put the conclusions of the Kyoto Summit into practice should not be underestimated.
I also wish to say that, with regard to the size of the environmental dimension in all policies, the French Presidency will fulfil its obligations during these six months, in collaboration with the Swedish Presidency, which will follow us, to ensure that continuity is maintained
I shall now finish, but nobody in this place will be surprised, particularly coming from me, if I say a few words about Strasbourg, specifically in response to Mr dell' Alba.
We have taken note of the fact that the European Parliament voted to remove Friday mornings from the part-session.
I will say quite frankly that the result of the vote gave us cause for regret and we hope that this is not an attempt to whittle away at Strasbourg' s role or to revive the issue of Parliament' s location.
I shall say quite clearly that France, - and here once again for a moment I am speaking on behalf of a major national delegation in the Council - would not be able to accept this.
We should really stop endlessly trying to keep the debate on Strasbourg alive.
The Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Amsterdam, are very clear on this point.
Instead, we should concentrate on the practical, material aspects of the issue.
I am fully aware of the problems encountered by some Members of the European Parliament and I must tell you that the French authorities are extremely sensitive to these issues.
We are anxious to see improved air connections to Strasbourg.
Through the Presidency of the European Parliament, we have sent a questionnaire to Members, in order to find out their specific, individual needs.
We hope that we will have a large response.
We are also considering establishing a cross-border platform to coordinate neighbouring airports, which will make it easier to reach Strasbourg, both by air and by road.
Honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, these are some of my thoughts, certainly not all of them, that have been stimulated by this debate, which was of extremely high quality and very encouraging for our Presidency.
Knowing that they both have pressing engagements I should like to pay particular thanks to Mr Moscovici and President Prodi for staying with us until the end of the debate.
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for the fact that we are starting a few minutes late. However, there has been an important trialogue meeting, which the representative of the Council, Minister Moscovici, had to attend, and because he was held up, we have waited for him.
He will have no chance at all to acclimatise because we are going to start straightaway with the statements from the Council and the Commission on the delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections, as per the agenda.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioners, please forgive me first of all for my lateness, which is not due to any lunchtime whim but simply to the fact that Jacques Chirac, the French President, was with us.
Mrs Fontaine accompanied him, which prolonged the essential trialogue that we held with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, by a few minutes.
Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious economic, social and political crisis.
Despite some infringements of human rights, which have been rightly condemned by the international community, the country has remained, in essence, under the rule of law. It has been able to do so largely because of the dynamism of civil society and of the independence of its judicial system.
Over the last three years, a reversal in its external economic situation has weakened its economic fabric, which is structured but ageing.
Shifts towards authoritarianism and lax management of the economy have continued to tarnish the country' s image, undermined the confidence of the community of sponsors and has encouraged the people to challenge the government.
This discontent was expressed in February' s referendum on the constitution, which was the first time that the Presidential party had lost an election since independence in 1980.
Legislative elections were therefore a major issue for the ruling party.
In order to hamper the success of the opposition, the ruling party risked heightening tensions by conducting a tough election campaign and by making the unequal distribution of farmland the issue for mobilising the rural world and veterans of the war of independence.
With regard to this issue, the Head of State has allowed a huge movement for the occupation of properties to develop and has halted the legal framework for future compulsory purchases.
These shifts, which I have just mentioned, have resulted in the deaths of 33 people, they have made the economic crisis worse and have distorted fair competition in the elections, thereby creating a real risk of instability in southern Africa.
The European Union nevertheless considered it important that elections should be held and that the results should be credible and acceptable.
It therefore sought the agreement of the Zimbabwean authorities to send, as far in advance of the elections as possible, a large mission of nearly 200 observers, thereby demonstrating the Union' s interest in seeing democracy consolidated in that country.
Nobody can deny the fact that this presence contributed to reducing tensions and to restoring a climate, which was as conducive as possible, in such a highly sensitive context, to the free expression of the whole population' s right to vote.
I wish at this point to pay tribute to Mr Schori, who led this mission, and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team.
Although our observers noted that the degree of violence, irregularities and intimidation in the period leading up to the elections meant that the words 'free and honest' could not be applied to the fifth legislative elections in the history of Zimbabwe, they nevertheless emphasised the efficient organisation of the voting itself, the large turnout - I believe it was the largest since independence was achieved - and the peaceful atmosphere in which it took place.
The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either.
On behalf of the European Union, I should also like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people, who, by taking part in these elections in such numbers, have proved their determination to take their destiny into their hands in a peaceful and democratic way.
I am also pleased to note that the results of the elections have been universally accepted by all participating parties.
The entry into Parliament of a significant opposition - in fact it almost has a majority in the seats that were contested in these elections - suggests that constructive debates will be held.
Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history.
The fundamental problems still remain, of course, and they remain intact.
This is why the Union is urging all political forces in Zimbabwe to mobilise and to bring together the threads of dialogue, in order to set the country firmly on the road to recovery.
The Union hopes that the new government will adopt, with the help of the country' s new representatives, credible measures for getting the economy back on its feet, measures which are likely to restore the confidence of local operators and of donors.
For twenty years, the European Union has shown itself to be Zimbabwe' s leading partner in its development.
Zimbabwe is a friendly country and a partner country under the LomÃ© Convention and the European Union hopes to continue this policy, with acknowledged respect for human rights, for democratic principles and for the primacy of law.
Because the Union wishes to continue to intervene on behalf of those who have been worst affected by the crisis, it is particularly willing to provide assistance for the necessary land reform in order to reduce poverty, despite the fact that this has not been implemented in an orderly, transparent or rational way.
The European Union wants to believe in the future of a democratic and prosperous Zimbabwe, which is a factor for the stability and the harmonious development of southern Africa.
Mr President, first of all may I say that I would have been delighted on this occasion to have spoken after Mr Schori who has obviously done an outstanding job - as the presidency said - in Zimbabwe.
I think all of us who wish Zimbabwe well would want to congratulate him and all those who were in the EU observation team.
They have all done a magnificent job.
They clearly managed to fulfill their objectives under very difficult circumstances and they discharged their mandate in an extremely effective way.
The mobilisation of a full and experienced team on the ground less than four weeks after an informal decision by European Union foreign ministers is a tribute to the enormous efforts of everyone concerned.
This and the professionalism of the observation mission enabled them to surmount numerous political hurdles.
It made the operation a reference point for electoral observation in countries in crisis.
It is widely acknowledged that the European Union mission contributed to reducing the levels of violence, and I think it is also recognised that it helped to build up the confidence of civil society during the elections.
Once again may I stress that the reputation of Mr Schori and the role that he played were key factors in our judgment for the success of the mission.
I believe that the mission constituted the most credible observer voice during these critical times in Zimbabwe. This was reflected in extensive press coverage during the whole period, both locally and internationally.
What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation, also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe.
We have of course had a chance of becoming acquainted with the main outlines of the report, though we are looking forward to the opportunity of studying it in detail.
I know that the first part of the report follows the interim report which the honourable Member made, and is an account of the violence and intimidation which sadly marked the early stages of the election campaign.
We know from what he has said that the report analyses the voting process and the conduct of the poll and I think - though I would not want to take words out of his mouth - that by and large the actual conduct of the poll seems to have been pretty satisfactory.
Finally, and most importantly, and this is what we are looking forward to hearing from the honourable Member, the report focuses on the consequences for Zimbabwe's future.
The honourable gentlemen is right to recommend that the European Union should in the coming weeks and months monitor very carefully what is happening in Zimbabwe and provide assistance and support wherever it is appropriate for us to do so.
We would certainly want to endorse this, and my colleague Commissioner Nielson and I will certainly intensify our efforts to strengthen channels of communication, both formal and informal, with President Mugabe and his government, to facilitate the transition to effective multi-party democracy.
The honourable Member has spoken of how important it is that the government should prosecute those who have been involved in political violence or guilty of other human rights abuses; he has also stressed the importance of the courts determining the outcome of any challenge to the election results. It is very important that the government should respect their decisions.
These are both enormously important points and touch, of course, centrally on the credibility of the whole democratic process.
Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads.
The outcome of the legislative elections could mark a major transformation in the country's political culture, the transition to a multiparty system in which Parliament will replace the ruling party Zanu PF politburo as the main policy-making institution.
President Mugabe's electoral strategy, focused on land reform and support for the war veterans, failed to address the country's economic plight and this was obviously reflected in the votes polled by his party.
The new government of Zimbabwe and all those who want to see the country rise above its present serious difficulties, whether they relate to the economic situation, the question of land reform or the terrible scourge of HIV, must now address the challenges effectively, collectively and constructively.
We have considerable influence as a major donor. This influence has to be used to encourage the government to take positive steps for re-establishing the rule of law and good governance as a first step towards a more general recovery, and I know this is a point which my colleague, Commissioner Nielson will want to speak about after me.
But, once again, I would like to offer my personal congratulations to the honourable Member on a very difficult job, extremely well done.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten
You have already indicated that owing to the problematic nature of the issue, two Commissioners are going to give their opinion on it today.
I am therefore looking forward to hearing Commissioner Nielson' s opinion.
Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the EU electoral observation mission.
They have managed to do excellent work under very difficult conditions.
The result of these elections offers the EU a new opportunity for reviewing our cooperation with Zimbabwe.
According to the report by the heads of mission there is scope for positive development in Zimbabwe in the political, economic and social fields.
Options for the EU to assist in such development should not be excluded, as they say.
Zanu-PF will have to develop new and more appropriate policies in order to approach the international community for finance to stabilise the economy and restore growth, but the legitimacy of Zanu-PF is at stake because of the extent to which intimidation and electoral malpractice helped it gain victory and because, even discounting the impact of such factors, the MDC won 58 seats, almost as many as Zanu, with 61+1.
The Movement for Democratic Change will not want to share responsibility for the crisis the country is undergoing or for the painful measures which will be necessary for economic recovery.
Zimbabwe's EUR 110 million 8th EDF national indicative programme has a direct poverty alleviation orientation.
Its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture, health and education.
The Commission's approach so far has been that aid directed to the protection of basic social services and the reinforcement of civil society should be maintained even during periods of crisis.
A total of EUR 19 million is about to be released for a micro-projects programme which in the interests of consensual policies has been delayed until after the elections.
It can thus now go ahead.
The Commission has maintained its support for land reform through this micro-projects programme, which is actually for poverty alleviation assistance for legally acquired land in resettlement schemes.
However, in April the Commission froze the EUR 2 million for technical and policy support for land reform.
