Parliament will, of course, be able to address the issue in a fully informed manner in the future, although, at this point, we can certainly condemn and deplore the use of any form of violence by any party whatsoever in an attempt to resolve issues.
It is therefore absolutely essential for Parliament to discuss the major issues of globalisation now and then to lay down a clear political line to follow, undertaking to define tangible parameters to shape the globalisation process, ensuring that its ultimate goal is the development of a new, comprehensive humanism which places at the centre of history the dignity of the human person rather than large-scale financial interests.
In this sense, far from being an inevitable source of suffering, globalisation is proving to be a great opportunity to genuinely change the balance of play in the world and confront the dreadful scourges afflicting much of humanity which, in these times in which we live, mean that none of us can be sure of our moral innocence.
Even if we take into account the not insignificant humanitarian decisions taken at the G8 summit, it is not easy to accept the considerable unwillingness to change the development model, even partially, step by step.
The model remains essentially focused on consumerism and an unregulated market rather than on accepted criteria of solidarity and participation.
The basic need is therefore to identify a political and institutional position which is acceptable to everybody and which can be used as a guideline for the globalisation processes. This clearly has to be something more than just the G8.
We must speed up our work on this issue if we want to avoid irreparable damage, for we must start from the realisation that the globalisation of politics - the democratic control of the processes of globalisation - proceeds at an exasperatingly slow pace compared to developments in other sectors.
There is no current "off-the-shelf" recipe, but I feel that we could start from proposal of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prizewinner who envisages a permanent summit made up of the European Union, the G8, the World Bank, the group of 77 developing countries, Onlus and undertakings to launch and manage a great, worldwide Marshall Plan based on a common universal strategy.
That could be described as a utopian dream, but, as Thomas More, the father of Europe would say, without a utopian dream, what would our politics be?
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe the G8 summit in Genoa will come to be regarded as a milestone in our political life and will probably be seen as marking a turning point in European and international political life. This is not, unfortunately, because of the joint undertakings given by the richest countries in the world to respond to the serious problems facing the poorest countries - and let me point out that the North-South gulf has never been so wide - but rather because of the particular context in which this summit took place.
Mr Vitorino has rightly reminded us of certain decisions or at least guidelines that were adopted at that summit, but I do not think we should give them more importance than they deserve.
It is true that we heard a rather timid acknowledgement of the importance of relieving the debt burden on the poorest countries, but no more than that.
It is also true that a global health fund was set up to combat infectious diseases, but the total funding is pretty inadequate; it was set at EUR 1.3 billion, while the UN Secretary-General believes that EUR 10 billion is needed.
On the other hand, there is no sign of any common resolve to rectify the inequalities by achieving the long-promised objective of contributing 0.7% of gross domestic product to development aid.
There is no more talk of that.
The participants did, however, vigorously reiterate their faith in the virtues of the market, free trade, the development of new genetic engineering technologies and the international trade rules.
Today, the European Union certainly wants to launch a new WTO round, but is that any answer to the problems caused by the unfair WTO rules?
The WTO' s decision-making rules are indeed unfair in that they penalise the poorest countries compared with the rich ones, if only by giving the poor countries limited access to the information that would enable them to play a proper part in this decision making.
So, no response at all, no real response to the demands and protests of tens of thousands of demonstrators - and, more generally, of a very broad sector of European public opinion - who reject or challenge a globalisation that is essentially financial and commercial.
It is not globalisation as such that they are protesting about, but its basically financial and commercial nature.
I think that distinction needs to be made.
I therefore believe that the European Union must take specific initiatives in this regard and first of all it must no longer seem deaf to the voices of protest.
In this context I welcome the Belgian government' s proposal to debate the Tobin tax at the next Ecofin summit.
I think that is a good initiative, which ought to be followed by others of the same kind.
First and foremost, however, we need to establish a real dialogue with the parliaments: Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is right to say that parliaments are, after all, the prime representatives of public opinion; that is obviously true.
The European Parliament and the national parliaments must be the forum where the governments explain their initiatives.
In addition, however, to the parliaments - for we are no longer living in the conventional world of politics we knew 50 years ago - we must talk to the associations, talk to organised civil society.
In my view, that is essential.
Many associations have put forward important ideas and serious arguments; to dismiss them is a political error.
Like everyone here, I deplore and condemn the violence of the Black Blockers demonstrators but, at the same time, I can only condemn the unacceptable behaviour of the Italian police who trampled on human rights in Genoa.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the morning after the G8 meeting my group, which was very much present in Genoa, immediately called for this debate to be entered on the agenda of this new session of Parliament.
The conservative majority in this Parliament, which is feeling very defensive, prevented this debate from concluding with a resolution in which Parliament expressed its opinion.
It will not, however, manage to prevent us from raising the serious questions arising from the events at Genoa again and again on our political agenda, in one form or another, throughout the coming period: the aftermath of Genoa is only just beginning.
One of the issues raised by Genoa is the very legitimacy of G7, or G8, perceived as a kind of board of directors of the big powers of this world.
I will not go into that today.
Another issue raised by Genoa is, of course, this whole problem of violence, in particular the unheard-of repression of peaceful demonstrators, who were pursued even to the headquarters of the Social Forum of Genoa.
Yesterday we took the initiative, in association with the Green Group, the Attac association and socialist MEPs, of organising a major debate on the subject with the coordinator of the Genoa Social Forum, Mr Agnoletto.
The extremely grave incidents that were discussed and described during that debate made us even more convinced of the need to shed full light on the course of events that led to the dramatic incidents and acts of violence we saw and on the entire chain of responsibility for respecting the rules and values in which the European Union believes.
For the rest, I proposed that we set up a monitoring committee right here to work in liaison with Italian members of parliament, the Social Forum in Genoa and other partners who wish to help discover the whole truth of the matter.
In the same spirit, we have reiterated our support for players in the social movement who do not want to see their message be perverted by acts of violence of the Black Block type, which our enemies find easy to manipulate.
We will not allow this magnificent commitment on the part of our citizens to be discredited, let alone criminalised, in this way.
That brings me to the third, and perhaps in our view the principal issue of the aftermath of Genoa, namely the political responses we will or will not be able to make to the questions asked by these men, these women, these innumerable young people who are quite wrongly labelled anti-globalist, whereas most of the time what they seek is a democratic globalisation based on solidarity.
At a time when the European Union is debating its future, its ambitions on the world stage and its relations with civil society, we for our part do not see these questions as a threat to be averted, but far more as a chance we must seize if we want Europe to move forward.
Madam President, the positive results of the G8 must bind our governments to respecting the agreements established on combating poverty and regulating globalisation; we must not see, as we have in the past, the commitments made not being respected or being excessively delayed.
Two thirds of the world live in conditions of extreme poverty.
Our aid must be targeted at genuinely benefiting communities rather than adding to the economic and political wealth of governments who have contributed to exacerbating the wretched conditions in which their peoples live and continue to prevent respect for human rights.
We call for focused actions targeted at implementing initiatives which are genuinely useful for the people, and we must also, therefore, attempt to rethink the concept of globalisation.
Is a European way possible?
Can we prevent globalisation becoming a boomerang which always strikes the poorest communities?
I regret to say that, at Genoa, according to some elements of the media and certain politicians, public disorder pushed the issues discussed and the guidelines defined by the summit leaders into the background and yet, for the first time in the presence of representatives of the developing world, issues were tackled which are fundamentally important for the peaceful future of the human race.
Unfortunately, even the legitimate opinions of the peaceful demonstrators were obscured by the globalised violence of those who have become professional rioters.
Faced with the urban guerrilla warfare which has reproduced the acts of violence perpetrated at the Nice and Gothenburg Summits, we must tackle two pressing issues.
Firstly, how can we ensure that democracy is respected on similar occasions in the future?
In other words, we must ask ourselves how future summits held in European countries need to be organised in order to ensure that the meetings of representatives of the different institutions are productive and not the cause of fruitless, violent controversy.
Secondly, what political and cultural measures can we take to prevent legitimate demonstrations of dissent turning into organised, exploitative acts of violence?
Is there an area of justice within which Interpol could play a role of preventing and controlling the spread of violence and terrorism?
Moreover, in the face of Commissioner Vitorino' s call for greater cooperation to prevent violence, we wonder why Echelon which, with the help of Great Britain, listens in on everything that happens in Europe, did not warn us before Gothenburg and Genoa and help to prevent the violence which took place there.
These are worrying questions and we will come back to them.
It is not Italy which needs to be placed under observation but that part of Europe which speaks of human rights in this Chamber and then allows those same rights to be violated, and the self-interested generosity of certain left-wing voices which condemn violence as a means of persuasion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, Europe needs to act today to make it possible for the goals set at Genoa to be implemented. Its governments must not exploit tragic events that should be tackled by a common effort, for the purposes of internal politics.
Europe must regain a sense of European Union rather than national self-interest!
Madam President, when it comes to political responses to globalisation, we ask you not to force us to choose between Genoa and Durban, between the G8 summit of the major democracies of the western world, the Genoa Summit, and the UN meeting in Durban.
Of course, we will choose the Genoa Summit over international fora where it is the dictatorships of this world that have the majority and the decision-making power and whose final decisions are those of a racist conference, not a conference on racism.
Otherwise, we would be saying we are dissatisfied with both the G8 method and the method of this European Union.
We feel that the western democracies must relaunch the method of democracy and the rule of law, that they must attack rather than playing a defensive game and must relaunch the initiative of the globalisation of rights and democracy.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if the European Union genuinely has the political will, it should not be possible, at this advanced stage in the process, for the statute of the International Criminal Court to still not have been ratified.
It should not be possible for the universal moratorium on the death penalty not to have been approved by the UN.
It is on these issues that the western democracies must fight back.
On the subject of the G8, these summits must be made public.
It is not a question of coopting representatives of NGOs or representatives of the poorest countries. It is a question of involving the parliaments and all the citizens, broadcasting the debates on these issues to them live via audiovisual communications and the Internet, opening the doors of these international summits to all citizens and revitalising the democratic model and the rule of law.
This, I believe, is the way to improve the G8 summits and this European Union, and it is the alternative to satisfying those who call for institutions in which the worst dictatorships in the world have the right of veto to be at the central controls of globalisation.
Madam President, I have asked for the floor in order to protest vehemently against the extremely serious allegation made against the Italian police force. This accusation is completely unfounded and unjustified.
Clearly, the Member in question is unaware of how things really are and I would therefore ask that his comment be removed from the Minutes or that the European Parliament considers, in this House, the consequences of such a serious statement, which I do not feel should have been made in this Chamber.
Mr Ferri, that was not a point of order.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency and Commissioner Vitorino for their introduction and to make two points of a political nature.
Firstly, I think everyone is aware of the active, prominent role taken for the first time by the European Union at the G8 summit.
Although it may well be true that the results could have been better in practical terms - as other Members have stressed - I would like to quote a politician who is not from my own culture but who is known to many in this Chamber: "The longest journey begins with a single step!"
And without a doubt, a completely new way of working was established in Genoa compared to that adopted for all the other G8 summits.
Secondly, I am sure that the goal of all the Members of this House is to achieve increasingly closer Union between the peoples of Europe, and that we base our future work and our political activity on consensus, democracy and the law.
Well then, with regard to the Genoa Summit and the messages which subsequently emerged through the media, what concerns me is an attempt to deny representative democracy. I find this unacceptable.
It may be part of the culture of others, but we must reject violence because violence is contrary to the way civilised human beings relate to each other in our culture and, above all, we must adopt an approach which is totally different from this blanket opposition.
I will end with two brief points for consideration.
We did not support the resolution because - as I am sure some of you will remember - in July, we wanted a debate to be held so that we would arrive prepared, as the European Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, at the Genoa Summit.
This was refused us: we only had time for an oral question.
Secondly, in my opinion, in view, apart from anything else, of the tendencies of some of the previous speakers, I would wait for the conclusions of the work currently being carried out by the Italian judiciary before firing accusations or making scathing judgments about the work of the Italian police force.
Madam President, the course taken by the G8 in Genoa provides food for thought for the governments, particularly the governments of the eight protagonist countries, but also for the Commission and the Council, the institutions, the parties and the movement in which an interesting debate has been opened on the very definition of "no to globalisation" .
This is not the time to tackle the issues of public safety and law and order, which are now assuming a European dimension, as has been pointed out, and which require effective responses which also respect rights such as the right to freedom of association and demonstration which is enshrined in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I am glad to see that Parliament' s Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has decided to prepare a recommendation to the Home Affairs Council before it next meets in November.
However, we cannot fail to express here our deep pain at the loss of a young human life, that of Carlo Giuliani, and our unequivocal condemnation of the violence perpetrated by minority groups in Genoa and elsewhere, and our concern at excessive crowd control measures employed to protect the citizens by sections of the police force who had assumed responsibility for the citizens' safety.
An inquiry into all this is being carried out by the Italian parliament as well as by the Courts, and we ourselves will be able to make use of the results very soon.
With regard to the agenda, it has to be said that, as an informal event, the G8 summit is in danger of raising expectations which are hardly ever matched by practical undertakings.
However, partly due to the attention that the movement has succeeded in drawing to these summits, it would be almost impossible to avoid addressing the role of the poorest countries and undertaking more convincing action with regard to the issues of debt, poverty, trade, the fight against disease and the environment.
To sum up, although it is the responsibility of the movement to reflect on its future, starting with the methods it should use to fight globalisation, and to reflect on the danger of it encouraging unfocused, provocative protectionist tendencies, the task of orienting the global processes, which have hitherto favoured economic concentrations, speculative investment and wide gaps and intolerable injustices, falls to the institution.
The next appointment will be the WTO round of negotiations, when the responsibilities of the European Union and the Commission will be far greater than at the G8 summit.
The European Commission' s "Everything but Arms" initiative was consolidated by the final statement from Genoa.
It is our responsibility to uphold it consistently in our relationship with our citizens and the poor countries which are excluded from the flow of world trade.
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of Italia dei Valori, an Italian political movement belonging to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which was present at Genoa and witnessed the events which took place there.
In short, we feel that a summit such as the G8, in the form it has taken hitherto, is substantially unproductive.
Never more so than at Genoa has it been clear that similar displays of muscle and power on the part of the world' s greatest nations are just cinema which certainly does nothing to alleviate hunger in the world or to enhance equality between peoples if it is not matched by practical action to cancel the debt, redistribute wealth, safeguard material rights and eliminate all exploitation of developing countries.
Secondly, amongst the great many people who were exercising their genuine, lawful right to demonstrate for their convictions, there were also many troublemakers who infiltrated the demonstration in order to perpetrate unjust and unjustified acts of violence and thus sabotage the work of both governments and demonstrators.
It is necessary - and this is the third point - for Parliament too to issue, first and foremost, a clear, unambiguous statement condemning and reproaching these people for their actions: they are the criminals who sparked off the violence.
Fourthly, with regard to these criminals, I regret to say that the law and order agencies of the Italian government partly failed in their task.
Their endeavours were both excessive and inadequate: inadequate in that their information activities, intelligence and preventive protection measures did not suffice, and excessive in terms of the crowd control measures employed by certain sections of the police force; this was true only of certain sections of the police force but, regrettably, methods of crowd control were used which could and should have been avoided.
Lastly, of course this sort of behaviour is to be condemned, but we must not focus on individual members of the police force but on those who gave the orders or who should have controlled or coordinated the activities from both the technical and police points of view.
We regret that this has not been the case.
Let us await the conclusions of the Courts and the Italian Parliament calmly and let us hope that, in future, there will be no more acts of violence.
Madam President, the Minister began her speech by talking about her generation.
I belong to the generation that, in Italy, is called the 'ebb' [apolitical] generation - I am too young for either '68 or '77 - and I am used to thinking of the police and the carabinieri as those who ensure personal safety and who have made it possible to defeat terrorism in Italy.
The most surprising and shocking thing for me in the Genoa events was therefore to actually see how, within the forces of law and order, something tiny, a mere change of government, a defamatory campaign by the anti-G8 movement, inadequate organisation and a bunch of violent hooligans, was enough to bring out in some of them - I stress some of them - a desire to become the instruments of blind and profoundly stupid intimidation.
This, Mr Tajani, Commissioner Vitorino, is a European, not a national issue.
The divide that, from Nice to Gothenburg to Genoa and, perhaps tomorrow to Laeken - even if the Minister' s fine words perhaps give us grounds for optimism - is being erected, for right or for wrong, whether we like it or not, between people who, in good faith, want to take action for a better world and the institutions - the police, Parliament, government - is something that should concern us all, on both left and right.
I am convinced that if police cooperation had been applied effectively and with respect for individual rights, if free movement were a true right, with the same level of priority as the free movement of capital, if the Charter of Fundamental Rights were in the DNA of all of us, the worst events of Genoa would, perhaps, not have taken place.
That is why I believe that, to prevent another Nice, another Gothenburg or another Genoa, we need two things, and the first of them is transparency.
In Italy, the Courts are already hard at work, as is the parliamentary committee of inquiry.
Here, we must make a precise assessment of the lines along which the cooperation between European police forces was conducted and ascertain whether or not the Charter of Fundamental Rights was violated in the treatment of prisoners.
The second and last thing, Madam President, is to understand whether suspension of the Schengen rules can justify the indiscriminate, collective ban on free movement.
These are the things we must do in this House, and I hope we shall all work together to achieve them.
Madam President, the G8 meeting in Genoa gave nothing of substance to the poor people of the developing world: that is the truth.
Worst of all, it laughed at the request by Kofi Annan for the allocation of a sum that would have been at all adequate and not just alms for the fight against AIDS.
The pretensions of Western leaders to lead the world and their agencies for managing the world economy along free-enterprise lines have, since Seattle, been the object of criticism and active protest from a movement of thousands of associations and millions of people and even some States - I am thinking of South Africa - who are asking for an alternative, democratic model of globalisation oriented towards satisfying the often tragic needs of communities, especially in the developing world.
In Genoa, then, the Genoa Social Forum - that is, a thousand or so organisations, all of them peaceful and non-violent, half of them Italian - called on 300 000 people to come together and express their dissent and their alternative goals.
You have all seen the pictures and film footage of what happened in Genoa in the media.
That is proof, Mr Ferri!
I have read the newspapers and watched television.
A few hundred hooligans, then, between 600 and 800 according to the Italian police themselves, were left to run riot in Genoa, even though it was known where they were staying, to destroy businesses, banks and public property, while the full strength of the police was most brutally unleashed against the peaceful demonstrators.
They broke into the residences where they were sleeping and beat them; hundreds of young men and women were arrested, and in the police barracks they were beaten up, insulted, tortured, forced to stand for hours with their arms against a wall and their legs apart, forced to sing fascist anthems and praise Mussolini; and the girls were even threatened with rape.
I was in Genoa over those days and I was a direct witness of the police jeeps driven at full speed and the police charges against peaceful marches, as well as the hundreds of tear-gas grenades thrown at thousands of defenceless people, amongst whom were children and disabled persons.
I then went to the prisons where hundreds of young people had been transferred - Italians, Spanish, Germans, Austrians, Swedes, Swiss, aged between 18 and 20, and I collected their statements: all of them, I repeat all of them, had been beaten, insulted or tortured, many had stitches in their heads, and all that had happened in the barracks after their arrest.
Right-wing authoritarian processes have a history in Europe!
Together with the underlying factors, this history includes accidental events, on the one hand, and the complicity or inertia of the moderate, liberal and Catholic right on the other.
The attitude emerging here of underestimation by the Council, and also by part of the political groupings represented here in Parliament, of the general trend dramatically revealed in Genoa which is taking hold of Italy, is therefore - if I may say so - irresponsible, not only towards democracy but also towards these groupings themselves.
For much less, for Haider' s idle talk, Austria was subjected to surveillance and sanctions by the other 14 Member States of the Union.
Mr Vinci, there were also charges against the police and not just the police excesses that I have condemned, let us make it clear.
But that is not the problem I want to deal with today.
There is one point, however, which unites us all, which is: what can Europe do?
Minister, you have said that Europe can be a model in facing the problems of tomorrow' s globalisation.
That is true, but not this Europe, let us be frank, Minister.
Yes, the Europe of human rights, for which we were the cradle, the Europe of respect for minorities and diversity, the Europe of the 'No' to the death penalty, which responds to the concerns of so many, perhaps the majority of human beings.
But it would really respond to their concerns if Europe had a voice and an instrument to express this idea forcefully in the world.
A divided Europe can have no part in this.
The G8 summit did not give the idea of a Europe able to back up its decisions.
The G8 summit has given the world the idea of the great superpower and a divided Europe that is weak and ineffective because it is fragmented.
This is the real problem facing us.
If we want Europe to respond to the concerns of globalisation, let us move ahead on the road towards building a political Union and giving Europe a single voice.
If, at a G8 summit, there were not four European states speaking but just one speaking on behalf of the whole of Europe, there would no longer be a great America and a number of little States; there would be two voices with the same weight.
Minister, your government could make a great contribution in this direction at Laeken by presenting and taking forward a draft Constitution that is not divorced from the reality of the problems, as the debate still is today, but which, in a few years' time, when the euro has become the common currency and globalisation is no longer a contentious issue, can be an instrument for Europe to speak in the world with a single voice and as a single political unit.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events of Genoa show us several things.
The first, I would say, as regards the European or world leaders, the Euro-globalists who were barricaded in that town, is quite simply that they may govern badly, but they protect themselves well.
The second does not, for all that, tempt us to support the brutal and deliberately violent counter-demonstrations that were organised and that did not create too much indignation among their ranks so long as they were used against the national right-wing parties.
When the targets are Flemish, Italian, French, German or other national militants, that is seen as entirely acceptable and there was no shortage of leaders within the French socialist party to encourage and organise the so-called democratic harassment.
Until the day when, like the man hoist with his own petard, the socialist leaders find themselves at the receiving end of the stone throwing.
Indeed the bloody events of Genoa show that protests against globalisation are not the expression of a moral protest born of the desire for a fairer redistribution of the wealth of the planet.
In fact today, like yesterday, the issue is political and ideological.
Lucas Casarini, leader of the White Overalls movement, said as much in an interview with La Repubblica.
Negri, imprisoned for armed insurrection against the Italian state and now partially free, expressed the same view in a book.
These people are no longer socialist internationalists, proletarian internationalists, but they are still internationalists.
The people who demonstrated in Seattle do not represent the voice of the poor throughout the world; they are a political instrument directed against the Western world.
In Genoa, they launched their attack from the very heart of the empire they supposedly wanted to destroy; but in reality another equally subversive form of globalisation is dialectically opposed to liberal globalisation.
We do not support either one of them; the real reply lies in the defence of national identities.
Madam President, after the spirit of Rambouillet at the first G5 summit, we have reached the sad events in Genoa and many of us are beginning to think that these summits have become too large, unwieldy and bureaucratic and have lost the old, productive atmosphere of confidential meetings.
The Commission spoke about this a while ago and this is certainly a subject to examine in greater depth.
On occasions such as these, however, many of us have also realised that there are forces in Parliament that are able to exploit even tragedies for their own ends, for the death in Genoa was a tragedy. This was simply to achieve their political objectives: that is, to discredit the centre-right government in Italy.
To achieve this outcome, they use the European Parliament, organising in Parliament, as they did yesterday, for example, meetings with exponents of antiglobalisation movements that spread ridiculous, false accusations and offend a European Union Member State by calling it an incomplete democracy that should be placed under supervision.
I regret to say that an active part is played in these demonstrations by Italian Members of this House - I need only name Mr Vinci - who perhaps do not realise that they are discrediting not so much the centre-right government but the whole of their country.
My question is quite obvious and simple: if a left-wing government had been in power in Italy, would there have been the same mobilisation of forces in this Parliament, with pilgrimages by our fellow Members who had never dreamt of going to previous summits but who - as if by coincidence - were present in Genoa?
I hope that the protests in Genoa and elsewhere never succeed in preventing world leaders from continuing to talk to each other, as could well happen.
Madam President, the Socialists are opposed to globalisation if it stands for survival of the fittest, but welcomes globalisation with a human dimension.
Worldwide, we are becoming increasingly connected and dependent on one another.
It therefore makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to hide behind national, European or other borders.
At the same time, however, we also see the other side of globalisation.
World trade is flourishing, but the richest countries earn 37 times more than the poorest countries, and despite the enormous increase in world trade over the past few years, the chasm between rich and poor has only widened.
One in five people who live in this global village still have no access to education or health care.
It is precisely in this global village that this complete and utter imbalance concerns us all.
Europe - which, to me, encompasses the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the Member States - must stand united.
This is something we can do and thereby be able to play a crucial role.
We can fulfil a pioneering role as the largest trading power.
We must defend our social model within and outside our borders, and, therefore, assume our responsibility, as well as support new social and innovative solutions.
We must, for example, lend support to those poor countries which are endeavouring to produce cheap AIDS medication.
We must make this possible and also defend their rights.
If we act on our own behalf, let us then show that we mean business.
Certainly at a time when the United States now and then threatens to stray from multilateralism and withdraw behind a wall of self-interest, it is extremely important for Europe to fulfil this active global role.
This then, of course, raises the question of what role that is and what the activities are we should be carrying out.
I would like to list a few promising initiatives: "Everything but Arms" , our action programme against AIDS and the initiatives by Messrs Jospin and SchrÃ¶der concerning the Tobin tax.
Would the Commission and Council be prepared at least to have such initiatives seriously looked at and to back them?
I would also like to mention our weaker points: the refusal to reform agriculture in the short term.
I also have in mind the fact that, while the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has earmarked EUR 120 million for our Global Health Fund, this is money taken from our own pocket.
That is similar to helping ourselves to one of our own cigars.
Moreover, when can we expect Parliament' s proposals, for this measure will surely require formal approval.
We are here in Parliament to ask for extra funding, and not for one of our own cigars.
I am also thinking of the Member States which do not spend 0.7% of their GNP on development and cooperation.
If Europe wants to be a friend to those who wish globalisation to have a human dimension, if it wants to listen seriously and be an example to all those who take to the streets out of concern, it will have to make it happen by taking action of its own and adopting appropriate policy.
This is, in my opinion, the cornerstone of a partnership with developing countries.
This is also the basis of success for a fresh WTO round.
However, this is a different Europe from the Europe which sides with the few who are out to seek personal gain.
If we really want the law to apply to everyone, then we have here in Europe a brilliant opportunity to make it happen, and the Social Democrats are happy to take this road.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the denial of democracy and a social dimension in European integration is creating conflicts.
What is our response?
Countless young people have waited all summer for this first session of the European Parliament.
In Genoa, they encountered a state and a Europe which have deeply traumatised them.
Their trauma is heightened every day that we fail to give them a satisfactory response.
What is this Parliament' s response?
On the first day, Mr Poettering congratulated Mr Berlusconi.
The Christian Democrats and right-wingers in this House have rejected the resolution and made it clear that they will also reject a committee of enquiry.
Let me make it clear what they are identifying themselves with: police violence, systematic brutality and even torture in the prisons or at the time of arrest, hundreds of arbitrary arrests, sexual harassment, and Nazi slogans in the police stations.
I was in Genoa for a week.
I visited the prisons.
I spoke to the people in charge, and I took notes for ten hours with people who had been systematically abused and mistreated, in some cases for up to thirty hours.
Yet you want to sweep everything under the table!
The Christian Democrats are allowing the Italian right to dictate the course of today' s debate.
One of them even had the gall to say that there is no evidence.
Ladies and gentlemen, please vote for an enquiry. We will provide bags full of evidence of hundreds of cases of torture, abuse, brutality and excesses by the police.
This is not merely a matter for the Italian police, for these young people all over Europe have waited for this first session, hopeful that the guardians of fundamental rights sit here in this House and that this House will not remain silent or make common cause with Italy' s rightist government.
Let me say a few bitter words as an Austrian.
What would have happened if these appalling events at a summit had taken place in Austria a year ago?
One dead, 500 injured, 470 arrested and imprisoned, with 90% of them having to be released later due to lack of evidence because the police had picked them up at random as much as 50 km outside Genoa and trumped up evidence against them.
This has a European dimension, and this House must address the issue....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, the political results of the G8 summit, let us be frank about it, were virtually nil or even negative, and yet everything was clouded, as we all know, by the violent clashes.
We register here the strongest possible protest against the Italian government and police forces, who were tolerant and permissive with the violent, but savage against the innocent.
Europe has been able to judge, and it has judged with dismay and indignation the atrocious images of acts carried out in the developing world, persecutions as seen in Chile, as have been perpetrated by a Member State of the Union.
We also here express our utter condemnation of the mindless violence by some groups of demonstrators and our severe criticism of those organisers who reject violence in words but who were unable or unwilling, in fact, to break off all relations with those in the movement who preached or advocated violence.
Any tolerance in this respect plays into the hands of the enemies of the people' s cause. Any naivety by those who believe that it is enough to be right for right to prevail and who do not take the trouble to oppose, isolate and exclude the violent of all kinds is not a virtue but bears a poisonous fruit.
It is a real boomerang that will hit back against the need to extend and expand the great movement against neo-free trade globalisation.
Madam President, the European Parliament should take a very balanced view when its debate covers the responsibilities of national parliaments, so as not to give the impression of interfering in the various countries' affairs in one way or another.
On the G8 I share the opinion of the Council and Commission on the good and bad sides of it, but I also wonder why, every time an international summit is organised, from Seattle to Gothenburg to Genoa, conflicts break out that threaten public order, as if people were trying to fight an invisible tyrant.
We should reflect on this paradox and initiate a dialogue with the young people, giving politics back its role.
Violence is rejected without equivocation.
Violence is incompatible with democracy, and extremism is often the cradle of violence.
The violence in Genoa is being investigated by the Italian magistracy, in whom we should have every faith.
There is, however, a political issue: there are various ways of defending institutions.
We should not confuse the Black Block that was looking for violence with those who were exercising their right to demonstrate in the streets.
That confusion leads to a spiral that produces more violence and sows the seeds of terrorism.
In these situations it is very difficult to enforce the law without using force, but that is the responsibility of governments.
To isolate the extremist movements we must start with the moral authority of national and European institutions and the ability to show every respect for the rights of the citizenry.
Madam President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is going to make a recommendation on the proposal presented to us by the Justice and Home Affairs Council with a view to ensuring public order during meetings.
We are going to place value on the need to defend the freedom and fundamental rights of citizens.
Since the Treaty of Nice, the European Parliament has had the duty to exercise the right to monitor respect for these rights and that is conferred on us by the Treaty.
We must also exercise democratic control of the security measures proposed by the Council, of their proportionality and effectiveness.
I am not going to throw accusations at the Italian police, but I believe that to suspend the right to movement of certain citizens while allowing the entry of the people who did what they did in Genoa could be described at the very least as ineffective and inefficient.
We are going to do all of this.
But I believe that today, Madam President, what we must demand of the European institutions above all is a political reaction to a situation which is not a natural catastrophe, for which a civil protection plan can be presented, as Minister Duquesne appeared to do a few days ago in our committee, but a political phenomenon which we must react to.
And that reaction must also, and above all, come from this European Parliament.
We in this Parliament have the obligation to create fora for political mediation given a demand which is becoming stronger and stronger, and we must do so above all because the European Union has this democratically elected institution.
It is the only international organisation which has one and, given the widespread feeling that there is a lack of opportunity to exercise political demand in an international forum, we must be able to take a step forward and to offer this forum as soon as possible, in the hope that the other institutions will do the same.
Madam President, in spite of what was said earlier on the other side of this House, it is clear that the police exercised systematic physical and psychological torture in Genoa.
Like others, I regret that we do not have a resolution in front of us in which we could have expressed our complete condemnation of police brutality and of the violence of the Black Block at Genoa, our conviction that those responsible must be brought to justice, our commitment to uphold the right to protest peacefully, and our determination to clarify the growing evidence that much of the violence and damage to property which occurred in Genoa was the work of agents provocateurs.
But we have another task before us and that is to address the reasons fully why 300 000 people chose - in their own time, and at their own expense - to go to Genoa, just as hundreds of thousands have gone to Seattle, to Gothenburg and elsewhere to demonstrate about the continuing debt burden of the poor, about the increasing and grotesque inequalities between rich and poor and about the growing corporate control of many aspects of our lives.
That means that we need to confront the reality that the neo-liberal economic policies of the European Union are currently part of the problem, not the solution.
For example, it is the EU which is ruthlessly driving forward the agenda for a new, ambitious, comprehensive round of trade talks at Doha in November in the face of opposition from the majority of developing countries and of social movements around the world.
Commissioner Vitorino said that there was agreement in Mexico last weekend.
Well, there might have been agreement between the Quad countries, but it certainly was not endorsed by the African countries, the LDCs, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the list goes on.
Moreover, in most EU Member States, the level of official development assistance remains far below the UN target and, contrary to the Gothenburg declaration, the Council is proposing for its 2002 budget a further 3.2% cut in commitments on foreign aid compared to last year' s budget.
As Members of the European Parliament, we have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of the European Union continue to enjoy the right to protest peacefully.
We also have a responsibility to listen to what they are demonstrating about and to respond because, if we do not, we cannot be surprised if the reputation of the EU institutions as remote and out of touch continues to grow.
Madam President, I went to Genoa at the invitation of the Genoa Social Forum and I was surprised because I had never seen such police conduct, and I say that having fought for democracy and freedom in Spain since 1966.
Not even under the Franco dictatorship did the police behave as I witnessed in Genoa.
It was more similar to the situation which I experienced on 11 September 1973 in Santiago, Chile, when Pinochet' s coup d' Ã©tat took place.
This raises a serious problem for the European Union: to guarantee that, just as the G8 can meet, all people, young people who want a different world, can also meet in a democratic fashion.
That is the responsibility of the European Union, of the European Parliament.
I therefore believe that we will have to ensure that progress is made in terms of democracy and freedom for all.
Mr President, although we do not yet know the full story of the police violence inflicted on the anti-globalisation protestors at the recent G8 summit in Genoa, there is enough evidence to suggest that the death of the young protestor Carlo Giuliani was not just caused by a police blunder.
Similarly, the methods used by the Italian authorities do not seem to be just the result of the police being unable to cope with the rioting, which we of course condemn.
After all, the private Italian network Sette broadcast scenes of people dressed like Black Blocks calmly chatting with the anti-riot police and then going away.
Even if it does not suit those who have a narrow conception of the sovereignty of states, we must make it clear that the events of Genoa do not come only under the heading of Italy' s domestic affairs but directly concern the European institutions, and chiefly among them the European Parliament because it is directly elected.
First of all, Europe is concerned because the Union must not simply be a stepping stone of liberal globalisation, but also an area of freedom in which the citizens have the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights and, more recently, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, when citizens of all nationalities come together to exercise their collective freedom, their freedom of opinion and their right to demonstrate, it is the duty of the European Community to guarantee that they can effectively exercise these rights.
Secondly, Europe must not remain inert in face of such disturbing manipulative operations.
Europe cannot allow a government in its midst to use methods that are so incompatible with the values of democracy and freedom in which it believes.
Lastly, as responsible democrats we cannot allow the violent actions of a minority of activists to be lumped together with the pacifist beliefs of thousands of people protesting against liberal globalisation, for the Union must, in its turn, become the motive force of democratic globalisation based on solidarity.
I deplore the rejection of the proposal to table a European Parliament resolution on the subject.
I would have liked to see a committee of inquiry set up.
Like some of my socialist comrades and other colleagues, I will play an active part in the monitoring group referred to by Francis Wurtz and we will carefully examine the conclusions of the Italian committee of inquiry.
Mr President, the efforts of big business to rule the world, now that the Socialist camp no longer ranks as a formidable adversary, the anti-grass roots policy punishing workers in developed countries and plundering the riches of the developing world are obviously - please do not laugh, Sir - going to provoke a reaction on the streets.
Despite attempts to lead and mislead, such as we have heard here from the Council and the Commission about involvement in dialogue with civil society, we are certain that this movement is set to become even more radical and to turn even more resolutely against the capitalist system.
And at the same time, unbridled police violence is being used, such as that seen in Gothenburg and, even more so, in Genoa.
Without wishing to play down the responsibility of the Italian government, we would point out that the suppressive measures taken in Genoa originate in the European Union with the Schengen Agreement, police collaboration, the decisions taken by the Council on 13 July and the preparations to crush demonstrations in Belgium.
No matter, history teaches us that, however strong the oppressors, however much violence they use, the oppressed eventually come out on top.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several among you have called for a dialogue with civil society in general and for a dialogue with this Parliament and the national parliaments, in particular.
It is precisely because the presidency - not only myself, but also the Belgian Prime Minister - takes this dialogue so seriously that the Prime Minister has sent me to represent the presidency here today and naturally the intention is not to limit myself to a brief explanation, but to follow attentively everything you have to say and to remain calm in the process, even if I completely disagree with some of the speakers.
But that is part and parcel of it.
I have thus carefully listened to all the speeches from the left, the right and the centre in this debate, and you can be certain that a number of elements will definitely inspire us.
Even if it is correct that the Belgian Prime Minister, following Gothenburg, said that the law enforcers and armed forces in my country have extensive experience of all kinds of disturbances. Given the fact that the capital of my country sometimes deals with more than 2 000 of these annually, we do not want to give anyone the impression that we are not taking the situation seriously.
As a personal comment, obviously, I said that, in my opinion, the spectacle of a totally secluded zone for a summit meeting, as was the case in June or a number of weeks ago, is a very brutal spectacle.
But at the same time, it was tragic to have to witness the extent of the street violence.
It is absolutely awful if situations escalate to such a degree that, as we have personally witnessed, young demonstrators are killed during these disturbances.
This is not acceptable, this must be prevented.
There are very few, extremely few causes worth dying for.
One should obviously have the right to demonstrate, protest and say whatever it may be in whatever way, but it is not acceptable that some are killed in the process, or are physically or mentally injured.
You can therefore count on us to do whatever is necessary during all council meetings of the next couple of days and weeks.
My baptism - and I hope it will not be a baptism of fire - will take place tomorrow evening.
The informal meeting of Foreign Trade Ministers in Bruges starts tomorrow evening and will be followed by a whole series of meetings.
We will make every effort to ensure that the right balance is struck between openness and accessibility whilst ensuring that safety is maintained and that escalations of recent weeks are avoided.
I wish to make that very clear to you.
For the rest, Mr President, I am also convinced that the debate on globalisation has only just got off the ground and that we will be discussing it for the foreseeable future.
Needless to say, we will not always agree on everything, as I have already said, but that does not matter.
For the debate to be fruitful, it is of the utmost importance not only to hear what the other person has to say, but also to try to understand what the other person is saying.
For example, I have said that law enforcement and the way in which the law is enforced falls within the exclusive remit of the Member State.
That is correct, but I also said at the beginning of my speech that in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, within the remit of the Union and by means of existing instruments, we will do whatever is necessary to prevent as much as possible the escalation of violence.
We will return to this topic during Question Time, when I will have the opportunity to give you more detail in my answers.
We welcome dialogue, certainly constructive dialogue, but not only do we need to listen to each other, we must also try to understand one another, particularly if we do not share the same views.
Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I believe that this debate is leaning towards recognition of the need to structure the political debate on how to regulate globalisation.
In this regard, I believe that the Commission has put forward several suggestions here on 'how to structure this debate' .
We acknowledge, and I want to say this quite clearly, that the European Parliament, the elected representative of European citizens have a key role to play in structuring this debate.
For we need to embark on it with a degree of humility; we are all looking for answers, but nobody can say with any conviction that they have all the answers to the complex issues facing us all.
That is why I want to point out, in reply to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, that President Prodi genuinely wanted to attend this debate today.
He had intended to take part in the debate had it remained on the agenda as originally scheduled, i.e. this morning.
However, Parliament changed its agenda and Mr Prodi had to return to Brussels for the summit with the People' s Republic of China, so that he was unable to be present here today. I therefore have the honour and pleasure of taking part in this debate with you.
My second point relates to the issue in question.
I believe the Commission has worked well with Parliament on the substance of the Genoa decisions.
I can tell you that we too believe in the global approach.
In our view, some progress has been made and some positive decisions were taken at the G8 summit.
Of course they do not go far enough.
There is no doubt that the financing of the global health fund to combat disease is inadequate, as we agree, but at least we can say we played our part in funding it.
Along the same lines, let me tell you quite frankly that I do not understand how, in relation to the negotiations on a new World Trade Organisation, we can be reproached for favouring a purely pro-free trade vision of world trade.
We work together very closely with Parliament and what we are trying to do is to establish areas of negotiation that also take direct account of issues such as the environmental balance, the social agenda and the interests of the less-developed countries.
I therefore believe that the Mexico conclusions are entirely consistent with the policy advocated by the Commission for regulating globalisation.
Lastly, in reply to Mrs Frassoni, let me emphasise that you must take my words in their strictest sense.
What I said, and in fact that is what Article 33 of the Treaty also provides for, is that the maintenance of law and order is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.
I acknowledge, however, that the question of law and order also has a European dimension.
In 1997, the Council approved a joint action on the maintenance of law and order.
It may be that few people paid attention to the contents of that decision at the time, but it exists and the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 13 July are based on this joint action dating from 1997.
The joint action provides for cooperation between law enforcement and judicial authorities in order to safeguard public order at European-level meetings and places it within the framework of the Europol Convention.
That means we have a legislative text that regulates European cooperation on the maintenance of law and order.
We also have the Schengen Agreements.
In this regard, I must tell you that in the case of the Genoa meeting what we saw was joint action by what one might call the 'two Italian governments' . The idea was first put forward by the previous government and then put into practice by the new government.
So it is quite clear that the Commission' s neutrality is beyond all suspicion in the debate within Italy.
The truth is that the Italian government respected its obligations under the Schengen Agreements by reintroducing border checks at the time of the G8 summit in Genoa.
Obviously, when it comes to monitoring the implementation of the Schengen Agreements, both the Commission and the European Parliament have certain responsibilities.
They are limited responsibilities but that, Mrs Frassoni, is another matter entirely.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Data protection in electronic communications
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5-0270/2001) by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector [COM(2000) 385 - C5-0439/2000 - 2000/0189(COD)];
(A5-0284/2001) by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the strategy aiming at creating a safer information society by improving the security of information infrastructures and through the fight against cybercrime.
Mr President, it is a pity that, after a whole day during which Parliament has debated matters in which it has no legislative competence, only in the afternoon and then the evening will we actually be talking about areas in which we do have legislative power.
It is rather a bad Parliamentary habit, and we should try to resist these headline-grabbing temptations.
Having said that, the European Commission' s proposal for a directive is an important document and will help to protect rights and also freedoms on line, not only as regards the electronic communications of citizens within Europe, and thus we congratulate the Commission on the work that has been done.
I must start, however, by saying that the Commission itself should, I believe, take greater account of the fact that the difficulties and delays in implementing directives in the Member States mean that we are in danger of having European laws that are increasingly specific and detailed, which attempt to keep up with technological progress, but then we find ourselves updating a 1997 directive, now four years old, when this directive has still not been implemented by all the Member States: it is a specific directive relating to a general directive from 1995 which itself has not yet been adopted by the Member States.
It is therefore this legislative method that should probably be debated!
Having said that, however, I genuinely believe that important measures for protecting European citizens' privacy are guaranteed and specified, measures that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights and its rapporteur fully upheld in committee and which were adopted.
I would now like to focus on two points that are, perhaps, more politically controversial: the power of public and state authorities to have access to European Union citizens' personal data, and unsolicited commercial e-mail.
On the first point, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights accepted the European Commission' s desire not to grant the kind of carte blanche or blank cheque that some countries in the Union would have liked, to be able to intercept and access European Union citizens' personal data, for instance by accessing data collected by telephone companies.
The Commission is right to insist on and uphold this point.
We hope that it will also follow us in a further request expressed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, of placing a precise obligation on all derogations from the directive or European regulations that are not completely exceptional, based on a specific law accessible to the public, and limited in time; this will have the consequence, which we have written into the report, of prohibiting generalised surveillance.
I think it is important that the Commission should uphold this, because I believe the greatest threat to citizens' privacy is the omnipotence of the state in accessing personal data.
On the other point - unsolicited commercial e-mails - I have preferred, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has followed me, not to accept the Commission proposal of imposing a harmonised Europe-wide opt-in system, but to leave each Member State the choice of opting in or opting out.
I believe, in fact, that both systems are ineffective at stopping so-called spamming: true spammers who block up electronic mail boxes are people who do so fraudulently, hiding their addresses, and so have no interest in respecting either opting-in or opting-out.
In the absolute ban of opt-in, I see a threat to the freedom of expression of those who conduct e-commerce correctly: for freedom of expression it is not so easy to separate commercial messages from non-commercial messages, and there may be journalistic or political texts that are sponsored and as such could be treated as commercial messages.
I also believe that today there are instruments for self-regulation, filters and technologies that can solve the problem much more flexibly and effectively than the courts can.
Furthermore, the costs that the consumer has to bear are set to fall with the liberalisation of telecommunications that the Commission is pressing for in the other directives in the package.
Therefore, with flat rates and broad band connections, even the cost problem of connecting for a few seconds is becoming less important.
That is why, faced with the possible risks of the opt-in system, we are opposed to a single, harmonised European system.
Mr President, we are all of us affected on a daily basis by the risks presented by the new computer-related crimes.
It happens every time we shop using credit cards, use a telephone, open our e-mail or travel by plane.
We are concerned here with traditional crimes which affect us partly due to information technology: child pornography, counterfeiting, xenophobia and the trades in drugs, human beings, human organs, weapons etc. However, we are also concerned here with new types of crime directed against the way in which society operates: the spreading of viruses, unauthorised access, hacking, denial of service etc.
Traditional methods of combating these crimes are inadequate, even if on-line crime is just as criminal as off-line crime.
The underworld is threatening society with new methods from a digital platform.
Criminals exploit the differences in legislation between one Member State and another, and so the EU must maintain a united front.
The Commission has tabled proposals to which the Committee is giving impetus and which it is developing.
We seek common definitions for solving conflicts of competence, as well as the closer harmonisation of criminal law and the law of procedure and the mutual recognition of preliminary investigation procedures.
We want to make Europol and Eurojust more effective but, at the same time, set clear limits.
Now, controversial demands are also being made for the interception, registration and storage of our communications.
Where these are concerned, the Committee demands respect for fundamental rights, such as the secrecy of correspondence and telephone calls, and strict requirements for the whole area.
The Committee also demands a ban on such invasions of privacy, except in those cases in which the measure fulfils all the following requirements: it is necessary, has proper justification, is the only possible solution, is proportionate to the crime, is limited in time and has been decided upon in the courts.
No one wants a big brother society.
We in the European Union must comply with the demand we ourselves have made for cheap Internet access for all citizens, which means that we cannot transfer the costs of this to companies.
We want to encourage voluntary cooperation and have therefore proposed the setting up of an open forum to which a variety of players can contribute their experiences and pool these for the benefit of all, a forum in which understanding can increase, awareness of these problems be developed and best practice be promoted.
In this forum, industry and legal authorities, together with consumers, will be able to create a code of conduct and develop early warning and crisis management systems, and it will be possible to develop preventive technology and protective measures and to make these more widely available.
Coordination within the EU is also required so that our measures are not rendered ineffective at a global level.
Member States and candidate countries should be invited to develop common tactics and a cohesive EU policy within international bodies such as the UN, the OECD, the Council of Europe and the G8.
The committee was unanimous and gave its support to the message of the report, which is about improving respect for personal privacy now that evermore effective measures to combat computer-related crime have to be developed.
Finally, a big and heartfelt thank you to everyone who has assisted in the preparation of this report.
There are a lot of you, since there are many conflicting interests that have been reconciled.
A brief word about the two amendments that have been introduced to the report.
They can be seen as technical in nature.
The first is aimed at adding the word 'terrorism' , since the committee unanimously adopted this as an oral amendment which has since in some way been lost from the text submitted to plenary.
The word 'terrorism' must, of course, be present in a report on cyber crime.
We also want to change the term 'labelling' .
This change is proposed because 'labelling' obviously does not cover what we intend as effectively as 'certification' , which is the term we wish to introduce.
The term we use in Swedish, 'mÃ€rkning' , is tricky to translate.
This is mainly a translation issue, then.
I now turn to the Cappato report. Because I do not have very much time, I shall concentrate entirely on the opt-in/opt-out debate.
It is too early at this stage to abolish subsidiarity and force everyone to give up the status quo with its freedom of choice and instead to introduce an opt-in clause.
There would then be a risk of being criticised for over-regulation.
We should be in danger of having a new 'cucumber debate' , with the EU being criticised for its passion for detailed regulation.
Through being contrary to two important directives in the area of information technology, such a move could damage future legislation in this area and render our existing legislation inconsistent.
The debate on constitutional issues could also be harmed because such action could lead to a loss of confidence in the EU.
This would apply especially to the European Parliament if we were to adopt inconsistent positions.
We are in the middle of a process of technical development, involving filtering and broad band, which may mean that this opt-in/opt-out debate will be out of date and a thing of the past in three years' time.
I do not think that we should become bogged down in an outmoded position and, at the same time, abolish the possibility of choice without obtaining any added value, for a European opt-in solution would not put an end to spamming, a lot of which originates outside the EU.
The United States itself has not harmonised its legislation, for example.
An opt-in system involves problems in drawing the line between commercial information, on the one hand, and information about society and voluntary organisations, on the other.
It could also prevent the development of newspapers on the Net and create difficulties for small companies which have to store their information in case they are prosecuted. How, moreover, would the punishment be meted out?
Finally, we politicians must not legislate as soon as we see a phenomenon we do not like.
As politicians, we do not always know what is best for each individual person and company in each particular case.
Our job is to speed up the development and distribution of the technical products which will make spamming a thing of the past and to press for supervision, something which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s amendment in fact does.
Finally, we must, as politicians, defend freedom of expression and not restrict it unnecessarily and without due care.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to speak about the issue of electronic data protection, which has already been mentioned. To come back to the points made by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, I have heard in many forums and many other communications media in the Internet and e-mail that there has been a great deal of annoyance among users.
This is logical, for if we examine the principles of opt-in and opt-out using the example of letter mail, opt-out simply means that e-mails are paid on delivery, i.e. by the addressee. After all, it is the users who pay the Internet access fees.
I would get very annoyed about this too.
This is not to say that this is a bad intervention, but I would vote for an opt-in system for e-mails.
Otherwise, I think that the directive' s major shortcoming is what is not regulated, namely monitoring by the state, which is explicitly excluded.
I think that this poses the greatest threat to fundamental rights in the European Union - and fundamental rights are there to protect citizens from the state.
This is excluded here, which means that the directive is inadequate.
The rest offers quite a good level of protection.
However, if we draw together the opinion on cybercrime and Parliament' s opinion on terrorism, it is quite striking that a great many things are thrown together and criminalised: for example, "everything which is illegal offline should be illegal online" .
This is the case anyway, so we do not need any directives on cybercrime.
No one has yet given me a plausible explanation of why we actually need this, and which new laws will be adopted and crimes defined which are not already covered elsewhere.
In my view, this whole cybercrime issue is primarily intended to legitimise intervention in fundamental rights.
Finally, I should like to remind you of an anniversary which took place two days ago. A hundred years ago, the typewriter was banned in Turkey.
Why?
Because it was feared that it would enable people to communicate anonymously; they could no longer be identified by their handwriting, and this would open the door to crime.
Banning the typewriter was intended to prevent this.
Perhaps this would be appropriate once again today?!
Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s strategy on cybercrime.
This is, as Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld said, a very controversial and difficult area which raises issues of how to regulate the Internet and yet not stifle its development; and also significant issues regarding crime surveillance and privacy, data protection and retention, yet we need to be aware the cybercriminals do not respect our personal integrity.
We now have a growing phenomenon of so-called data streaming - hacking into computer systems and stealing credit card details in bulk.
The total cost loss to the UK last year was GBP300 million, an increase of 55% on 1999.
We need more secure systems if we are to boost consumer confidence in using the Internet.
Commissioner, in your strategy I want you to prioritise tackling the very disturbing growth in child pornography on the Internet.
We need to clamp down on sexual exploitation of children.
Again, there has been a very massive growth in cross-border child pornography.
In the UK, members of the so-called "Wonderland Club" , an Internet paedophilia ring, were arrested and found to have sites in 12 different European countries.
In my own region, the Greater Manchester Obscene Publications Unit has had success in cracking down on paedophilia with new Internet tracing software.
That is why, with the backing of many of the children' s organisations across the European Union, we are calling for a number of actions.
We want you to look at the possibility of involving credit card companies and Internet service providers in supporting the blacklisting of sites trading in illegal pornographic content.
We want to see the expansion of 24-hour hotlines and electronic watchtowers.
We want to see the creation of a European rating system for child-friendly Internet providers and the display of child safety messages.
We want child pornography on news groups blocked.
We want closer involvement by Europol in prosecuting cyber paedophiles and better cooperation between European law enforcement agencies.
The European Union must act to ensure that there are no safe havens in Europe for cyber paedophiles.
Our message, therefore, is that we are stepping up our action and closing down these sites.
We want you, Commissioner, to take action in this area.
Mr President, may I say that both the committee and the rapporteur have taken a very balanced and level-headed approach to this issue. Unfortunately, virtual reality, while it has a great deal going for it, engenders not virtual but very real crimes which we need to deal with without making bogeymen of ourselves.
We must be ready to prevent and punish these crimes as and when they appear.
Secure infrastructures and crime prevention need to go hand in glove with respect for freedoms and personal data protection.
This is something which we should never forget and which needs to be kept in a state of equilibrium.
Obviously we need coordination at international level and obviously the role of the Member States and of the European Union is to operate in international organisations with an appropriate strategy because we cannot resolve the problem alone.
The Internet is international and needs to be addressed internationally.
Obviously we need better definitions of the various types of crimes.
We cannot talk in general terms and what appear to be the most important issues today, i.e. pornography, hackers and racism, will not necessarily be the most important issues tomorrow.
Commercial crime is also very important and I think that we need to work with industry and the banks here if we are to be sure that the solutions found are indeed the most suitable.
One particular aspect, which colours all the rest, is intellectual property, which is in huge danger and could end up disadvantaging authors and artists.
I think that we need working protection rather than excessive measures which will stop the Internet from operating.
The debate is now suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.
Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2002
The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2002.
Mr President, with this speech, I should like to resume the dialogue between the two arms of the budgetary authority, namely the European Parliament and the Council.
This dialogue was started in the framework of the Interinstitutional Agreement by means of various trilogues and a consultation meeting in July, on the very day that the Council adopted the draft budget for 2002.
I know that during the most recent discussions of your Committee on Budgets, quite a few members expressed their regret about the outcome of this consultation. As this outcome cannot be seen as an actual result, people have started to call the validity of this exercise into question.
I should like to make two observations in this connection.
First of all, we must see this consultation between the members of the Council and Parliament as an initiation of the dialogue between the two arms of the budgetary authority.
Even if this consultation does not reap any immediate benefits, the discussions at the Council will still be affected by this during the coming months until the end of the budgetary procedure in December.
In addition, it is true that, at the time of the consultation, the Council' s preparatory activities for July' s sitting had already reached an advanced stage, and that compromise solutions had already been found in order to remove various obstacles which had emerged between the Member States themselves.
But it is also true, as I am sure you are aware, that the package which contains the compromise of the draft budget has already been influenced by the positions adopted by the European Parliament and which were known to us on account of the many contacts we have with this institution.
Those contacts, which start out in February and March, coincide with the informal trilogue in the capital of the presidency, and will be developed at different levels until the Council in July.
I can assure you that, without this permanent dialogue, the draft budget which is now before you could have taken on a completely different format.
Today, I should like to make you aware of the fact that the Belgian Presidency sets great store by sound cooperation with Parliament.
I should therefore like to explain to you directly the Council activities which have led to the draft budget for 2002 which is now before you and on the basis of which you will be preparing your first reading in the next two months.
First of all, I should like to outline the guidelines which have helped the Council compile this draft budget.
To start with, the draft budget is completely consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and the improvement guidelines for the budgetary procedure.
The Council deems it of particular importance to keep to each of the annual maximum amounts for expenditure, as laid down in the financial perspectives and based on the recent EP and Council decision to adjust the financial perspectives with regard to budget implementation, and on the technical adjustment to GNP and price development, implemented by the Commission.
The Council has ensured, insofar as is possible, that sufficiently wide margins will be maintained in respect of the maximum amounts for the different categories, with the exception of categories 2 and 7.
Secondly, the Council has taken into consideration the budgetary guidelines for 2002 which it adopted in March of this year.
You have undoubtedly noticed that the Council has adopted decisions of this kind for the first time.
I am of the opinion that it is a sound approach. It constitutes a move towards greater transparency and hence an improvement in the budgetary debate.
You have for some time now adopted budgetary guidelines yourselves which are used throughout your debates.
The same applies to the Commission which establishes its priorities every year.
The Council has therefore ascertained that the different EU measures are appropriately funded from the financial resources available within the maximum amounts set according to the financial perspectives.
For this purpose, the Council has, with regard to commitment appropriations, taken account of the evaluation of the options to implement the appropriations.
Finally, the Council has devoted special attention to the development of appropriations for payments by curbing their growth compared to 2001, taking particular account of the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with outstanding amounts and national budgetary requirements.
I should like to underline that these efforts to moderate are spread across the compulsory and non-compulsory expenses.
I should also like to take the opportunity to remind you that the Council deems it desirable that the Commission once again, as it did last year, submit a letter of amendments with the proposal to include in the final budget for 2002 an estimate of the surplus available from 2001.
Based on the above, the draft budget for 2002 provides for commitment appropriations the sum of EUR 99 009 million, i.e. an increase of 2%, and for payment appropriations EUR 95 598 million, which is also a 2% increase.
The draft budget submitted to you is a compromise by means of which all policy areas and priorities of the European Union can be financed without placing too heavy a burden on the Member States who try to keep their public finances under control, and where room is given, especially under the maximum amount of category 3 of the financial perspectives and category 4, for fresh priorities.
With regard to structural campaigns, the Council has allocated a high level of commitment appropriations, taking into consideration the pledges made in the framework of the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999 and the Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999.
The pledges in this draft budget and the programmes which have been adopted within the framework of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council are in line with the jointly agreed scheduling.
Administrative expenditure has been discussed in great detail by the Council.
An attempt has been made, where possible, to meet the needs of the different institutions and to take account of the specific characteristics and the general objective of a moderate increase in administrative expenditure.
I remain convinced that Parliament will follow the same path in the future budgetary procedure.
In this connection, the Agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council during the consultation of 20 July pertaining to a joint declaration is a good omen.
Indeed, both our institutions have agreed to ask the Secretary-Generals of the institutions to draft a report for the budgetary authority, which includes a multi-annual analysis of category 5, and which is set for discussion in the Council for budgets in November.
This report must set out the proportionate benefits achieved through strengthened interinstitutional cooperation, as well as the economic proposals required so as not to exceed the maximum in category 5. Both aspects have a bearing on preparations for the forthcoming enlargement.
I will not close off this general presentation of the draft budget for 2002 without mentioning two major issues in respect of which the Council has adopted a wait-and-see approach, because a number of elements, which were not to become apparent until later on in the budgetary procedure, have been missing.
These issues are the BSE and foot and mouth crises on the one hand, and the fisheries agreement with Morocco on the other.
As far as funding the effects of the BSE and foot and mouth crises is concerned, during the consultation of 20 July between the European Parliament and the Council, we concluded an agreement on a joint declaration in which the two arms of the budgetary authority were informed that, under the maximum of sub-category 1A of the financial perspectives, as laid down in the draft budget, a sufficient margin should be maintained to meet the needs in connection with the BSE and foot and mouth crises.
We would ask the Commission to submit a detailed analysis of the needs and to meet those needs, first of all by using the appropriations still left from 2001, and secondly, by including the required appropriations for 2002 in its letter of amendments this coming autumn.
With regard to the financial implications of the absence of a fisheries agreement with Morocco, and the funding requirements to restructure the fishing fleet in question, the Council has stated that it would reconsider the situation in the framework of this year' s letter of amendments, which is required under the Interinstitutional Agreement.
For all those reasons, the Council has maintained the preliminary draft budget submitted by the Commission for the international fisheries agreement, and has asked the Commission only to earmark these appropriations for other fisheries agreements.
I would take this opportunity to remind you of the fact that the appropriations for the international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, come under compulsory expenditure, irrespective of where that is: on the budget heading, in reserve or on a BA budget heading.
I do not intend to give a complete outline of the draft budget.
That can be found in the exhaustive explanation which has been sent to you.
What I would like to do is to go into more detail, that is to say per category of expenditure, of what the Council has laid down in its draft budget for 2002.
Concerning category 1 of the financial perspectives for agricultural expenditure, the draft budget has taken into consideration the implications of the decisions taken by the European Council of Berlin in March 1999 concerning the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy.
Despite this, with regard to sub-category 1A of the financial perspectives, which covers the common agricultural policy, the Council has specified amounts which are generally EUR 200 million lower than the amounts which the Commission had proposed in its preliminary draft budget.
This reduction does not provide for the discussion of the letter of amendments, which the Interinstitutional Agreement prescribes, and which requests that particular account be taken of the development of the markets and the state of negotiations on the different common market organisations.
This reduction is mainly linear and particularly discounts the budget headings pertaining to the effects of BSE and foot and mouth, as well as the headings pertaining to the common market organisations, which form the subject of current negotiations.
Moreover, as I explained a moment ago, the Council failed to adopt the principle of a reserve of EUR one billion, which the Commission had proposed in order to cover the effects of the BSE and FMD crises, and increase the margin in the process.
The Council prefers to wait for the letter of amendments which is due this autumn.
At first reading by the Council, this leads to an increase in expenditure of the common agricultural policy by 2.3% compared to 2001.
With regard to expenditure for agricultural development, the Council has adopted the proposed appropriations of the preliminary draft budget and has, consequently, incorporated the entire sub-category 1B of the financial perspectives.
The Council has included in the budget the whole of category 2 of the financial perspectives, which is dedicated to structural measures, as commitment appropriations, in line with the conclusions reached by the European Council of Berlin in March 1999.
In addition, the Council has accepted nearly all payment appropriations from the preliminary draft budget and only reduced the Community initiative programmes by EUR 375 million, in view of the expected delay in the implementation thereof.
In respect of category 3 of the financial perspectives, which is dedicated to the financing of internal policy, the Council is committed to funding the multi-annual programmes in an appropriate manner.
That is why it has accepted the amounts which the Commission had requested in its preliminary draft budget, especially for the framework programme for research and development of the trans-European networks.
However, based on the anticipated price development, the Council has curtailed the commitment and payment appropriations, which are not accompanied by multi-annual programmes, together with appropriations for agencies.
In the context of this category, I should like to point out that at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget, namely on the budget headings which were intended for this purpose in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, in order to launch Eurojust and the SIS2 system for Schengen.
As you can see, the Council has ensured that its draft budget adequately covers the priorities within the internal policy of category 3 of the financial perspectives.
Consequently, the Council has created a precautionary margin of EUR 110 million, which is more generous than the margin provided for in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
This margin should be sufficient to cover your priorities, a number of which were listed by your rapporteur, including e-learning and immigration.
I should now like to turn to the financing of the EU' s external action, included in category 4 of the financial perspectives.
The Council has, to a very large extent, followed the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
Indeed, the Council has maintained major appropriations and carried out only minor reductions to the commitment and payment appropriations, geographically divided across a limited number of budget headings.
In addition, as already mentioned, the Council has maintained the appropriations for international fisheries agreements in their entirety.
Finally, I regret that during the consultation meeting of 20 July, no agreement was reached concerning the amount of appropriations that need to be earmarked for the common foreign and security policy.
That is why the Council has adopted in its draft budget the amounts which the Commission had proposed in its preliminary draft.
I must confess that I do not entirely understand the requests to reduce the amounts to be allocated to common foreign and security policy.
You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest and are really the minimum required to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage, especially in those regions which are being plagued by the crises with which we are all familiar.
The wish to reduce those amounts could, more than anything, affect the European Union' s credibility, and I do not believe that that was your intention.
I therefore hope that it will become apparent as the budgetary procedure further unfolds, and especially from the outcome of your first reading, that you have been open to my reasoning, which is the Council' s reasoning, and that you will reach the same conclusion as I have with regard to the justification of the amounts proposed in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
As you can see, the Council has attempted to allocate adequate resources to the different priorities concerning the EU' s external action.
Nevertheless, the Council has added a margin of EUR 100 million under the maximum of category 4 of the financial perspectives, which will enable you to confirm your priorities in this sector.
When the Council compiled its draft budget for administrative expenditure which falls within the scope of category 5 of the financial perspectives, as already stated, it followed an approach which aims to meet the needs of the institution as far as possible, taking into account their specific features.
With regard to the Commission' s staffing requests, the Council continues to support the reforms and voted in favour of 78 new posts at first reading.
As for the other 239 posts, the Council had not adopted a position on this matter on 20 July.
I would like to do this in light of the decision on the Regulation on the final termination of service by Commission officials.
The draft budget provides for a margin of EUR 53 million under the maximum of category 5 of the financial perspectives. This is to enable accommodation of fresh needs in the field of administrative expenditure, and the European data protection monitor, in particular.
I should like to finish the overview of the different expenditure categories with the expenditure on pre-accession aid.
The Council has, in this respect, maintained the amount that the Commission had earmarked in its preliminary draft budget for commitment appropriations.
As for payment appropriations, a sharp increase by 20.9% compared to last year is provided for, following an adjustment in the form of a reduction by EUR 380 million of the amount which the Commission had included in the preliminary draft.
This increase reflects the priority which the Council, backed by the European Parliament and the Commission, affords this expenditure.
I would not wish to close off this presentation of the draft budget, compiled by the Council on 20 July last, without underlining my intention to bring this budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion and, like last year, to reach agreement at the consultation which precedes the Council in November.
It is, therefore, my wish that the budgetary talks be continued in the same spirit, so that for the budget year 2002, a budget of European Communities can be set up which affords us the means to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union is set to face shortly.
I would like to finish off by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, for their positive contributions.
, chairman of the Committee on Budgets. Mr President, President-in-Office and Commissioner Liikanen - nice to see you.
Commissioner Schreyer did say that she would be unavailable and that you would be standing in.
It is like old times.
I bet you are really glad to be here.
Thank you, President-in-Office, for your kind words, but to be honest with you, I was extremely disappointed with the outcome of your first reading and especially with the way the conciliation went.
Maybe we were spoiled last year during the French Presidency, which at least made some concessions, but this year it was back to normal.
For 12 years I have made the same speech - I did not do it last year - saying that this is a budget for the Council' s first reading made by Coreper and the politicians have no input into it.
We try to get you to make political decisions, we put forward all our arguments and spend hours doing it (we have a very nice lunch in the meantime) and we get absolutely nowhere.
It is a dialogue with the deaf.
We talk and talk and we change absolutely nothing when it comes to the Council' s position.
The difference between our two institutions is that we act as a Parliament should act.
A Parliament should have a budget that reflects its political priorities.
We do not spend money for the sake of spending money.
We look at political priorities and then decide what should be allocated to them.
What the Council wants to do is just keep expenditure to a bare minimum, no matter what the consequences or what it costs. We try to discuss issues like school milk.
We made our point. Nothing happened.
We spoke about the problems with the Structural Funds. Nothing happened.
On the internal policies, the medicines' agency and orphan medicines were one of the issues mentioned.
At the SAB last year we had an agreement with the Council to increase the funding for orphan medicines and what do you do this year?
You take 1.9 million off it.
It just does not make sense.
When we talk about trying to take Cyprus and Malta out of category 4 and put them where they should belong, you are not interested.
And then when we talk about the compensation for not having a Morocco fisheries agreement, here is where we get into really serious discussion, because again nothing happened.
We were trying to make the point that if you want to create some monies in category 2, you need our agreement, unless you want to take it from existing Structural Funds.
Let us be clear about the money that is in category 4 for the Morocco fisheries agreement. It is in reserve.
The only things we did agree at that conciliation were two bland statements, one on agriculture, one on category 5, but Parliament made a unilateral statement concerning the fisheries.
I am going to remind you about one part, because when you spoke about looking at the letter of amendment and deciding what to do, in accordance with Annex IV of the IIA only the amounts entered in the budget for agreements, which have already been concluded by the Community, can be considered compulsory expenditure.
Consequently, amounts entered in reserve - and that whacking big sum of EUR 125 million is in reserve - for agreements which have not been concluded, are considered to be non-compulsory.
The Council might want to argue about that, but we do not see any argument.
We will have the final say on what happens and rest assured it will not be a trade-off as to whether we keep that in or take it out to create the same amount of money in category 2.
That is something that we need to be talking about.
We need to be serious about this budget, to look at expenditure, especially in category 5.
What are we going to do about administrative expenditure, especially in relation to enlargement?
The statement about getting the secretaries-general to look at how the institutions can work together is all very well but there is a much greater issue.
We actually suggested that the budgetary authority should have a value for money exercise looking at every European Union institution.
You did not even respond to that.
I just hope between now and our first reading, and indeed between now and your second reading, we can have some serious discussions and serious conciliation and at the end of it some serious agreements to get a budget that we can all be satisfied with.
The one thing we will not stand accused of - I am not saying that you said this but many of your colleagues in the Council seem to think this - is that we just want to increase expenditure to the maximum so that we can finance the projects that we see as our favourites, while you want to be extremely prudent.
We are extremely prudent.
We are sensible in the way we handle things, but we want to do it as a team.
We want to act as a budgetary authority, not going back to the old days where you voted on compulsory expenditure, we voted on non-compulsory and sometime in December we ended up with a budget.
Let us hope that this year we can improve from what I consider to be not a good start to a far better understanding between our two institutions.
If this Belgian Presidency is anything like the last Belgian Presidency when I did the 1994 budget, I will be extremely happy.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in the months between now and December, we have a great deal of work to do in order to reach the necessary agreement on the next budget.
The positions of the European institutions are currently quite far removed from one another on very important issues.
As far as the European Parliament is concerned, there are prior conditions that must be met: the first is to ensure rigour and transparency in the budget and in its implementation; secondly, to only adopt a position if and provided that the necessary information is available to us.
In this context, I must once again make my continuing objections perfectly clear.
Where agriculture is concerned, we need information on the results that have already been achieved by the last reform of the common agricultural policy; with regard to the medium-term budgetary impact of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises and also with regard to the obstacles holding up the rapid establishment of the new food safety authority and even with regard to the prospects for the short and medium-term development of these issues.
As for the structural funds, we want to be sure that the budget will have the necessary means to undertake speedy payment of the commitments it has taken on.
Under the terms of the proposals that have been tabled, just over 1% of the commitments taken on in 2002 will be paid within the same year.
In the field of internal policy - category 3 - we can see that new expenditure on new actions and bodies is increasing yet the overall sum remains the same.
The margin is, of course, decreasing.
With regard to the European Union' s external action - category 4 - new needs are clear and cannot be met by previous reductions in commitments, either through cuts in appropriations committed or through delaying payments, as is happening now.
Nevertheless, appropriations have been earmarked for the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which we all know will not be concluded, in an attempt to thereby freeze EUR 125 million in a category that is clearly experiencing difficulties.
Since this is non-mandatory expenditure, I feel sure that Parliament will also shoulder its responsibilities in this area.
In category 5, administrative expenditure, on the one hand the content and pace of the Commission reform is limited and on the other, expenditure is duplicated in the field of security and defence and there is an attempt to confront enlargement without spending additional appropriations, the opposite of what the interinstitutional agreement lays down.
With regard to pre-accession expenditure, payments are being delayed and it is hard to see how this proposal can improve the situation.
The implementation of previous budgets does not give any grounds for being sanguine about the future.
Given the well-documented difficulties in meeting certain longstanding and more recent commitments, how can we accept the fact that in 2001, Member States have been given back almost EUR 10 billion, which remain unused?
On the one hand, there are discussions about whether the euro is a good or a bad thing and on the other, 12% of the 2000 budget remains unused, which alone indicates how important it is for Parliament to take increasingly effective control of the budget' s implementation.
We will only take decisions on agricultural issues if we have a full understanding of the present situation and an idea of how things are going to change.
We cannot accept the level of payments that has been proposed, all the more so because we want to make good past delays without undermining the current situation.
We want a clear and objective definition of priorities and targets for the entire budget.
We do not agree with the earmarking of appropriations which we know from the outset will not be used.
Specifically, we need to identify current expenditure resulting from enlargement.
We are hoping to see a real reform of the Commission and a corresponding increase in efficiency.
To sum up, we want to fully shoulder the responsibilities we have as a budgetary authority which stem from our very raison d' Ãªtre, which is to represent those who elect us.
This is what we shall do, whilst stating once more our complete willingness to cooperate in finding the best solutions for outstanding issues.
Mr President, some things are quickly learnt.
It does not take an expert on budgets to work out that the Council is submitting a proposal to cut down on posts.
The Council is being self-congratulatory while ably wielding the axe.
The Dutch Finance Minister, your colleague, recently claimed in public that the European Parliament is the big spender of the two arms of the budgetary authority.
If one considers the struggles one faces in the course of the budgetary procedure, he appears to be right.
It is true that Parliament often adds a little extra to the proposals of the Council.
This is not because it is eager to fleece the taxpayer, but precisely because it wants to be a reliable authority, because it feels obliged to guarantee that the European tasks and responsibilities are actually carried out.
Fine words and promises must, however, be translated into action, and that often costs money.
I am already anticipating Minister Zalm' s criticism that another parliament building is surely a pure waste of money.
I would therefore like to say to the Council that it should not come and cry on our shoulder now that many of these money-wasting decisions are taken at European summits.
Allow me to quote the summit in Nice as an example.
During that summit, the participants burnt the midnight oil in meetings to decide whether the Council should have one vote more or less.
In order to ease the pain for the losers, Parliament chairs were being handed out lavishly.
That, of course, is also telling of how much the Council values Parliament.
It is better to have more votes behind closed doors than to have people' s representatives in parliament.
This cattle auction will yield us 32 new colleagues, whether we like it or not, and our total number could temporarily even increase to as many as 800.
Those members will need assistants and offices, and that was not, of course, taken into account when we first set out to build the current buildings.
Do these summits ever stop and consider these issues?
For we are left dealing with the implications.
I would therefore suggest that at the end of European summits, the political conclusions should be published, alongside a rough estimate of the financial implications.
And I would invite the President of the Council to act on this straight away.
My second observation concerns the costs of the Council itself.
Within category 5, administrative expenditure, the Council is the fastest growing institution, and that creates added tension within this category.
To the Council, the financial perspectives are sacred, and that is why they aim to solve the problem by transferring certain expenses, which they would have gladly included in their own budget, to category 3, such as 3.5 million for Eurojust, and nearly 1 million for Schengen.
That limits the scope of the European Parliament to determine its own priorities in this category.
But I am an optimist: this situation also has benefits.
For in this way, we gain a little more insight and we can indirectly increase democratic control.
It does, of course, show where the priority of the governments lies if we are only given this control for the purposes of salvaging the Interinstitutional Agreement and saving some money.
The reallocation of Eurojust to category 3, however, is not such a clever move.
Do not get me wrong, I do not want to include Eurojust in the Council' s budget, but I would incorporate it under the administrative expenditure heading.
This, given the nature of expenses, would also be the most logical solution, as the Council also tacitly recognised during the trilogue.
I hope that we can at least agree on the principle, namely that operational expenditure belongs in category 3 and administrative expenditure in category 5.
Or is the Council perhaps losing its nerve after all, given the increasing number of operational activities in its own budget?
As already stated, the Council often has a knee-jerk reaction when it comes to deciding to lower the proposed expenditure.
What Terry Wynn said is true: we have, after all, suggested a radical overhaul of expenditure, and consideration of what expenditure is still necessary, whether things should be done differently, whether a number of institutions are overlapping in terms of responsibilities, whether there are bureaux that duplicate the work.
That has led to a guarded reaction from the Council, which surprises me greatly, for if we want to economise, then surely these are the areas where it can be done.
We will also therefore take fresh initiatives to consider radical cutbacks nevertheless.
But the Council does like to haggle, and it does not always take the actual needs into consideration in the process.
Given the time constraints, I shall only mention one example, namely the Commission' s reform process.
That is a priority for us both.
Despite this, the Council only approved 89 of the 317 requested posts.
You are quite welcome to be critical of the reform process and you need not approve all plans blindly.
The repercussions of the schedule for advance resignation now await you.
Given the above, I wonder now whether the Council is not simply waiting for us to take responsibility, for then it would, in the final analysis, be Parliament again which is calling for extra funding.
Thrift is something to be welcomed, but one does need to enable the institutions to carry out their tasks. If not, the citizens of the Union, the taxpayers, will have something to be really disappointed about.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0594/01):
Subject: Investigation of irregularities at Europol On Tuesday 12 June the Council announced that the operation of Europol was being investigated.
One of the central questions concerns the origins of the information technology on which Europol' s Eurint and Europolis systems are based.
Europol may well be using pirated information technology.
Can the Council confirm that the patented Polygon technology from the Munich-based Polygenesys company provides the IT base for Europol' s Eurint and Europolis systems or has been incorporated into them?
If so, since when has Europol been using that technology, and how did it acquire it and/or the user rights to it?
I should like to answer the question of the honourable Member Bart Staes as follows.
Firstly, the Council acknowledges that it bears responsibility for Europol in a general sense.
The execution of contracts, however, is a matter which, in the first instance, falls under the competent services of Europol.
The question is therefore being dealt with at the moment by the director of Europol, under the supervision of the board of management.
However, the Council has information that all contracts entered into by Europol at the time are now being examined by an independent external bureau as a result of a decision by Europol' s board of management.
The inquiry into the supposed theft of software and its possible use has been forwarded for further investigation to the public prosecutor in The Hague.
A parallel judicial inquiry has opened in Germany.
We must therefore await the results of the judicial inquiry before we can provide further details.
I should like to point out to the honourable Member that the discovery of fraudulent practices was the result of the nonetheless efficient operation of the existing present monitoring structures, since this is how they were brought to light.
I should like to thank Mrs Neyts for her full answer, a very concrete answer to a very concrete question.
I should, however, also like to approach the matter from a political perspective.
Mrs Neyts may say that the present cases of fraud were discovered through internal monitoring.
Nevertheless there is a perception on the part of the public and by a large part of the political world that there is insufficient democratic control of Europol, and various avenues are being explored to intensify that control.
Among other things under consideration are a modification of the OLAF Regulation and in the Belgian parliament the idea is circulating of setting up a Committee P and a Committee I on the Belgian model for the supervision of police forces and intelligence services for Europol too.
Does the Minister see any chance of a debate on this subject being held within the Council and within European institutions, so that we can reassure citizens regarding democratic monitoring of what is, after all, an important police service, although still in an embryonic state?
. (NL) I would say in reply to the honourable Member - and he will understand this - that we want to wait and see what concrete shape may be taken by the interesting ideas that are crystallising at present.
Question No 2 by (H-0595/01):
Subject: Discrimination in the way in which the catch reduction decided upon by the Council of Ministers has been distributed amongst the fishing fleets of the various Member States On 18 June 2001 the Council of Ministers decided on the way in which the catch reduction would be distributed amongst the fishing fleets of the various Member States. The outcome was a serious case of discrimination affecting, in particular, the Spanish (and especially the Galician) fleet, which would be required to withdraw hundreds of vessels from service whilst hundreds of French and Irish vessels would be exempted.
What justifies the fact that the Spanish (including the Galician) fleet is constantly subject to measures which restrict its activity on a pretext of resource conservation which does not apply to other countries?
I can say to the honourable Member that on 18 June this year the Fisheries Council took no decision in respect of hake fishing.
However, on the basis of the critical state of the cod and hake stocks outlined in the Commission' s communication of 12 June and on the rebuilding of cod and hake stocks which was presented to the Council, and I quote: "The Commission adopted an emergency regulation on 14 June establishing measures for the recovery of the northern hake stock.
Article 2(2) of the Commission Regulation provides for a derogation for vessels of less than 12 metres overall length using a mesh size of less than 100 mm from a maximum share of 20% of hake in the retained catch, provided that the vessels - not the catch - return to port within 24 hours."
On 22 June Spain asked the Council to amend this provision.
On 20 July the Council noted that there was no majority for amending it in the way proposed by Spain.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, only the discrimination suffered by the fleets of southern Europe, from Portugal and Spain - particularly Galicia - can explain the tangible discrimination we are now discussing.
The European Union' s institutions still consider these fleets to be intruders in seas that belong to all of us. This discrimination manifests itself in the application of the principle of relative stability which, for example, grants a country from northern Europe 40% of catches taken in Community waters, whilst Spain and Galicia receive only 6%.
As a result, we must ask once again: what is the Council' s position on the necessary communitisation of fishing rights in European Union waters in accordance with the principles laid down in the Treaties?
Mr President, I can only say that I suppose that the state that tabled the amendment will come back to the subject and the Council will then debate it again.
That is all that I can say at this moment.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity, in the presence of the Presidency-in-Office, which says it is going to study this issue again, to say that the excuse of conserving a resource such as hake, without sufficient or confirmed scientific reports, is at the origin of the discrimination against the Spanish fleet, which we are discussing here.
The Commission has told us in the Committee on Fisheries that this discrimination is for social reasons in favour of Great Britain and France, and that that is the reason for the exception.
Madam President, my question is why does the Commission, and in this case the Council, by a majority and for social reasons, not defend Spain, and specifically a region such as Galicia, which is an Objective One region and is therefore more needy, and whose fishermen traditionally fished in those waters which are now common.
These fishermen, for social reasons, do not sleep at home, owing to the enormous distance they have to travel.
If the reasons are social, I would ask you please to take account of the protection of Spanish fishermen.
I can only say after the five very pleasant and most interesting years which I spent in this august assembly that I am perfectly aware of the seriousness and the sensitivity of the subject.
I take that into account.
We do not doubt that these five years you have been with us in Parliament will help you to communicate this very serious problem to the European Council.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be taken together.
Question No 3 by (H-0599/01):
Subject: The EU' s rapid reaction force in Sweden In response to the chaotic situation which arose in GÃ¶teborg during the EU summit in June, when police and demonstrators clashed, it has been suggested in various Member States that it ought to be possible for the EU' s rapid reaction force to be deployed to control riots and civil disturbances.
Anders Mellbourn, the head of the Swedish Foreign Policy Institute, for example, wrote in Dagens Nyheter on 24 June:
'This probably means that the police will have to be supplemented by some kind of riot police units which possess a combination of police and military training.
This is hardly the kind of task to entrust to conscripts: it calls for professional soldiers or else police with military training.
Operational cooperation between the police forces and the military of several EU countries is required [...]
It is not easy for the EU to bring together a standing force of 5 000 police officers for civil crisis management.
Dialogue to prevent conflict needs to be supplemented by increased intelligence activity.
All this is also needed in order to be able to contribute to effective conflict- and crisis-management in the Balkans or the Middle East. But it is also needed - albeit, one hopes, rarely - to cope with certain domestic crises in Sweden or neighbouring EU countries.'
Does the Council agree that in future it ought to be possible for the EU' s rapid reaction force to be deployed within the Union itself when situations such as that in GÃ¶teborg arise?
Question No 4 by (H-0676/01):
Subject: The G8 meeting and security at summit meetings and other conferences of equivalent importance A few days before the deplorable events which unfolded in Genoa during the G8 meeting, the 15 Foreign Ministers unanimously endorsed the decisions by the Interior Ministers on security at EU summit meetings and other conferences of equivalent importance.
Will the Council say: did the Italian authorities call for the setting-up of a team of police officers or intelligence service officials to act as liaison officers who could be seconded from the Member States from which groups of troublemakers originate (Article 1(b)) and for all the legal technical means to be deployed to achieve a more structured exchange of information concerning troublemakers on the basis of files held in the various Member States? (Article 2(d)).
If so, which governments of the 15 Member States have responded?
Question No 5 by (H-0678/01):
Subject: Violation of basic democratic freedoms and human rights in Genoa The unanimous Council decisions on taking repressive measures ahead of the Genoa Summit provided the political backing the Italian government needed for the events that took place there.
Once again, a summit has been marred by the excessive use of force and savage repression.
After the bloodshed in GÃ¶teborg, more blood has been shed in Genoa: the Italian police and army launched an even more savage attack against peaceful demonstrators protesting about globalisation and expressing their opposition to decisions taken without, and at the expense of, the peoples of the G7+1, the EU and other political and economic organisations.
The outcome of this summit is: a number of deaths, dozens of injuries, mass expulsions and arrests and the brutal violation of democratic freedoms and even of the Community principle of freedom of movement.
Since this summit was attended by the leaders of the four largest and dominant States in the EU and since the statements both by the Belgian Presidency and the other governments of the EU on the events at Genoa suggest that there will be a more violent and bloody response to demonstrations at future summit meetings, starting with Laeken, will the Council say whether it is aware of the very onerous political responsibility it bears for its decisions of 13 and 16 July to take repressive measures and whether it intends to revoke them, given that they are in flagrant breach of democratic freedoms and human rights, such as freedom of movement, of assembly and of expression, which were brutally violated in Genoa?
Question No 6 by (H-0687/01):
Subject: Future of EU Council summits following the events in GÃ¶teborg and Genoa Following the disturbances which marked the EU' s GÃ¶teborg Summit and the G8 summit in Genoa, and taking particular account of the moves to have EU summits held exclusively in Belgium in the future, what implications does the Council foresee for summit meetings of this kind?
What conclusions should be drawn regarding the organisation of, and the scale of, the agendas for such meetings?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these issues have a very close bearing on the debate we held this afternoon on the G8 summit in Genoa and all the events surrounding that meeting.
I would like to remind Members of the unanimous position taken by the Council and the representatives of Member State governments on the question of security at European Council meetings and at other events that are likely to have a similar impact.
The Council reiterated that one of the European Union' s objectives is to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice.
In such an area, citizens must enjoy the right to freely express their opinions and to assemble in a peaceful manner.
They must do so, however, in conditions where there is not a threat to their own security or to that of other citizens or properties.
On 13 July this year, the Council and the representatives of the Member State governments therefore deplored the actions of those who abuse these democratic rights by initiating, planning and carrying out acts of violence to coincide with public demonstrations.
For the purpose of ensuring that these principles can also be applied in the context of important meetings, the Council and the representatives emphasised the need to establish a dialogue with non-governmental organisations, social partners and civil society, and also that we must build on and we shall build on the possibilities offered by existing legal instruments and bodies set up within the European Union.
Like Mr Vitorino before me, let me lay particular emphasis on the provisions of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement and the joint action of 26 May 1997 on cooperation on law and order and security.
The idea is that the task force of European Union chiefs of police should make a significant contribution to the practical implementation of cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States.
Incidentally, this task force has absolutely nothing to do with what the author of one question described as a joint police unit in the context of an EU-led crisis-management action.
In reply to the two questions put, respectively, by Mr Krarup and Mr Korakas, during Question Time at Parliament' s last part session in July 2001, I had an opportunity, speaking on behalf of the Council, to detail the measures taken by the Swedish government during the Gothenburg Summit.
In the same way, by letter of 11 July 2001, the Italian government informed us, under the procedures in force, of the measures it had taken under the second sentence of Article 2(2) of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement.
At the Council meeting of 16 July 2001, the ministers declared themselves in favour of closer international cooperation to safeguard the exercise of freedom of expression on the one hand and, on the other, to ensure that public demonstrations of this kind can and do take place in a peaceful manner.
Nonetheless, we must admit that responsibility for the maintenance of law and order on the territory of the EU Member States falls within the remit of their own national authorities.
The Council is not authorised to comment on a matter that does not fall within the area of competence conferred on it by the Treaties.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for such a detailed reply.
However, my specific question perhaps got lost in the detail, because the Council does not appear to be quite as unanimous as she would have us believe.
For example, the Greek government protested to the Italian government that dozens of Greek nationals were unable to enter Italy and were sent back on the same boat prior to the meeting in Genoa.
My question, which I would like the President-in-Office to answer, is this: were the plans to set up teams of policemen or intelligence service officers to operate as links between the Fifteen and were the plans to exchange information in files on people classified as troublemakers implemented before Genoa or not?
Did the Fifteen cooperate in this regard?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I believe I said, although perhaps in rather diplomatic terms, that the Council cannot comment on the way in which a member country, a Member State, organises the maintenance of public order on its own territory, because it does not have the authority to do so.
Obviously that does not mean that a Member State cannot make known its position in regard to another Member State, which is, in effect, what has happened.
But that does not fall within the Council' s remit.
In regard to your second question, I will have to check this and obtain information before I can reply.
All I know is that in the fight against what is called 'hooliganism' at major sporting events, the police authorities have clearly begun to cooperate on exchanging information on individuals who have repeatedly been proven responsible for disturbances or worse at major sporting events.
That is something I know.
In answer to the question whether there was any cooperation of the kind to anticipate or prevent possible trouble during the meetings of European Union bodies: I do not think so, but I will have to check this and will do so.
The minister said that she needs to make inquiries before giving an answer.
Does that mean she will be giving me a written reply once she has this information?
The Council replies according to its true knowledge and understanding.
You can ask the question again if you wish.
Mr Patakis, do you wish to ask your question again?
The President-in-Office has not replied to the question which I submitted and I should like to repeat it, although I would say that, following the police raid on offices of organisations in LiÃšge and from the position taken by the Belgian Minister of the Interior in the European Parliament Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, it would appear that the Belgian Presidency does not have virtuous intentions towards the demonstrations planned in Laeken.
My question is: can the President-in-Office assure us that there will be no police violence and suppression such as we saw in Gothenburg and Genoa?
Once again, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to draw a distinction between my replies as President-in-Office of the Council, which cannot go beyond the presidency' s remit - as you must realise - and the replies I might wish to give as a member of the Belgian government.
First of all, it is traditional, and not just traditional, I believe it is the duty of any member of government not to comment on on-going judicial investigations.
Secondly, when I described the presidency' s position on the G8 meeting this afternoon and discussed means of ensuring that both these meetings and the demonstrations outside proceeded peacefully, I stated and reiterated the Belgian government' s concern and firm resolve to reconcile the right to demonstrate with the maintenance of public order, as also to prevent the kind of violence we saw both in Gothenburg and in Italy.
We are doing all we can to achieve this.
I hope everyone will want to make their personal contribution and use all available means.
Mr President, I have listened to your comments with interest, but I would like to refer back to my question, Question No 6: What conclusions should now be drawn for European Council meetings in future, not only as regards policing but also in organisational and policy terms?
In particular, I should like to know whether you are considering reducing the number of participants and the agenda, as has happened with the G8 summits.
If the European Council meetings are only to take place in Belgium in future, has the idea of its own designated location been considered?
Are there any thoughts on this issue and if so, what are they?
First of all, the Prime Minister of my government has already indicated that he is reflecting on and will make proposals for a review of the way the G8 summit is organised.
Secondly, Prime Minister Verhofstadt has sent a letter to his colleagues in the 14 other governments asking them to reduce the size of the delegations that would be sent to or would participate in the Laeken Council.
Let me remind you that in the case of the Ghent European Council he opted for a very restricted meeting.
We fully intend to proceed along the same lines precisely because we are trying to learn as much as we can from what we ourselves witnessed in Gothenburg and in Genoa, i.e. at both meetings.
We have a degree of understanding for the panic which has gripped the representatives, for want of a better expression, of big business, including the current presidency, in the face of increasing reaction on the part of the workers in our countries to anti-grass roots policies and the new imperialist order.
I should like to point out to the President-in-Office that it was not the "bloc noir" that was attacked in Genoa, it was the peaceful demonstrators.
It is clear from the attack on the offices of Social Forum, which organised the demonstrations, that the target was not the agents provocateurs talking to the forces of suppression, but those organising the people' s fight against the prevailing policy of the G8 and the European Union.
The statement made by the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the European Parliament Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs gives us cause for concern, Madam President-in-Office.
The attack on the offices in LiÃšge, which you already know about, gives us cause for concern and we fear that the reaction in Laeken will be even more savage.
We want you to promise that there will no such reaction to the workers' right of demonstration and expression in our countries.
We shall be turning out en masse.
We will be going to Laeken en masse to protest against the European Union' s policy.
Will you look after us as well as you did in Genoa?
Let me say first of all that I most emphatically reject the honourable - and I continue to say honourable - Member' s attacks on the Belgian Presidency and the Belgian government.
These attacks are totally unfounded and I would ask him to withdraw what he has just said because he is quite simply putting words into our mouth.
I have replied calmly throughout the day and we have discussed these questions at great length.
I can only repeat what I have already said.
Furthermore, I am taking careful note of your expressed resolve to demonstrate - peacefully, I hope - what you think of the workings of the Union' s institutions.
If it is peaceful, there will be no problem.
Let me also reassure everyone that there is no question of panic; we have to prepare as carefully as possible in order to avoid a repetition of what we saw but also because - need I remind you - my country has unfortunately witnessed tragedies that were sparked off or took place during major sporting events. They now date back more than 15 years and we want to ensure at all costs that they never happen again.
Let me also tell you that during the championship held last summer - Euro 2000 - we proved that we had learned the lessons of the tragedy to which I have just referred and we showed that we were certainly fully capable of organising events of the kind, which involve huge crowd movements.
There is no question of panic; it is a question of very careful preparation.
Question No 7 by (H-0601/01):
Subject: Shannon as EU headquarters for natural or environmental emergencies response At its meeting of 28-29 May 2001, the Council agreed to improve and coordinate EU civil protection intervention in the event of major natural, technological, radiological or environmental emergencies by setting up a common emergency communications system, common training and fast mobilisation of assessment/coordination teams and intervention teams.
Would the Council consider locating an operational headquarters for this civil protection plan in Shannon which, among its many relevant facilities, includes a major international airport which could be used for transporting resources and provisions for interventions in third countries and could handle the pooling of information on serums and vaccines to which the Council Decision also refers?
On 29 May 2001, the Council decided upon a common approach with regard to the draft decision to establish a Community mechanism to facilitate increased cooperation in aid intervention in the context of civil defence, subject to the treatment of the recommendation of the European Parliament of 14 June 2001 and provided that the Parliament withdraws a number of its reservations.
Since then the Council agencies have reached complete agreement on the draft, subject to the legal and linguistic amendment of the text and, as I have already said, the withdrawal of parliamentary reservations.
The text of the draft decision, doc. 10483/01, is, by the way, on the Council' s website.
That draft provides for the setting up of an observation and information centre that can collate requests for aid and centralise the aid offered and that will be linked with contact points specified by the Member States.
That centre can alert evaluation and/or coordination as well as intervention teams, which have been specified beforehand and hence assigned the necessary personnel in advance.
The draft also provides for training programmes, the pooling of information on serums and vaccines and the promotion of the use of new technologies.
Contrary to what the honourable Member believes, there are no plans for collecting the aid material in one place, since that will be delivered directly by the Member States.
The implementation of this mechanism will be entrusted to the Commission, supported by a committee.
It is therefore up to the Commission to decide where the observation and information centre and the other services necessary for the implementation of the mechanism will be located.
This question will therefore have to be put to the Committee at the appropriate time.
Question No 9 by (H-0605/01):
Subject: Handling business failure As part of the Commission' s programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship a seminar was organised by the Commission on 'Daring to risk going bust' and handling business failure.
It was also a response to the requirements of the Charter for Small Enterprises which was welcomed by the Feira European Council.
What are the Council' s views on the impact of legislation on business failure, the need for support measures for entrepreneurs facing a risk of business failure and allowing for a fresh start after business failure, which were the key topics for the parallel workshops?
. (NL) I would remind the honourable Member that at its meeting in Santa Maria da Feira on 19 and 20 June, the European Council emphasised that small businesses were unmistakably the backbone of the European economy.
They are an important source of employment and a breeding ground for new business concepts.
To support the recommendations it had made, the Council highlighted a number of points, including the idea that a well-considered initiative involves a risk, or a measure of failure, which must be seen mainly as an opportunity to learn.
In general the Council has taken a positive position with regard to the simplification of the regulatory framework for industry.
The seminar to which the honourable Member refers was organised jointly by the Minister for Economic Affairs and the European Commission on 10 and 11 May 2001.
The Council has not taken any position on the results of the seminar and I would therefore request the honourable Member to turn directly to the organisers for information.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for her answer, if you could call it that.
The specific point that I raised in my question, which I thought would be self-evident, was that because of sudden downturns in the economy in America and other parts of the world, there is increasing pressure being put on small and medium-sized enterprises in a very strict and rigorously competitive market.
Therefore, I was somewhat heartened by the daring-to-risk-going-bust attitude of the conference because that would give us experience to know the main reasons why small and medium-size enterprises fail, whilst at the same time recognising that they are the biggest engine of growth within the overall European Union economy, creating something like 82% of employment and representing 74% of all manufacturing.
Hence my question to the President-in-Office about the Council' s position: what actions can be taken to ensure the continuance of this very strong sector?
In particular how can entrepreneurs learn from mistakes and failures, and if they fail once, be encouraged to continue and learn from those mistakes?
As the honourable Member has repeated the question which was addressed to us earlier, I can only repeat the answer I gave.
I am sorry.
The thinking is developing and this is shown by the conclusions to which I refer.
The seminar is a further initiative.
I expect that eventually you or some of your colleagues might invite the Commission to take a number of measures.
I know that the Council attaches great importance to small and medium-sized enterprises and recognises that these constitute the backbone of our individual economies and of our European economy in general.
Question No 10 by (H-0607/01):
Subject: Priorities in the fisheries sector during the Belgian Presidency Will the Council under the Belgian Presidency outline its priorities for the fisheries sector, taking into account the particular and unique requirements of peripheral countries such as Ireland, which has 11% of Community waters in its jurisdiction but only 4% of Community quotas?
The Belgian Presidency will endeavour to bring the debate within the Council on the Commission' s Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy to a successful conclusion.
Other priorities are the extension of the multiannual guidance programmes and rebuilding the stocks at risk.
It was apparent even from the first questions that this is a far from easy task.
Special attention will be devoted to the issue of discards into the sea.
The specialists know what this is about; if you like and if you put the question, I will explain it to you.
As regards, and I quote, Ireland' s 'particular and unique requirements' , it is worth repeating that fishing quotas are distributed among the nations that practise fishing according to the principle of relative stability and that the size of a Member State' s fishing zone is not, in itself, a criterion for the distribution of these quotas.
However, Ireland does receive preferential treatment as regards financial support from the Community for carrying out control, inspection and monitoring measures.
I note that the President-in-Office has referred to the discussions which she hopes will come to a fruitful and successful conclusion.
I would add that I hope it will also be a fair conclusion.
In addition, I am pleased that she has referred to discards.
This has to be top priority because too many fish that are taken aboard vessels are discards - and then it is much too late.
I would ask the President-in-Office whether she would take into consideration the initiative taken by both Ireland and the UK in relation to technical conservation measures and see that some effort is made by all countries to try to ensure that the smaller fish are not taken on board.
You referred to the point that relative stability and special unique circumstances cannot be taken into consideration.
We are now 20 years on and if we continue with the same principle as we had in 1983 then small countries like Ireland will be worse off.
We have to be pragmatic about this.
The Council, the Council of Ministers, the presidency have to take into consideration that in Ireland the coastal regions have no alternative source of employment.
It is a peripheral area, an Objective 1 area.
Those regions must be taken into consideration.
I would ask the President-in-Office to keep an open mind.
Mr President, I can assure the honourable Member that - if I can say this - I will take on board the points he has made.
Mr President, as a supplementary, is the presidency concerned about the fact that there are so many power stations, particularly around the North Sea and in the north of Europe, where, when water is sucked in to cool the power station, vast numbers, literally billions, of tiny floating creatures that would turn into fish are destroyed.
Would the President-in-Office undertake to investigate this and try to conserve the stocks of fish, many of which are destroyed in their infancy?
I hope the honourable Member does not expect me to investigate this personally and physically.
Again, it is a consideration that we will take on board.
It was not exactly a direct question on fisheries policy, but I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is kind enough to take very good note and that this problem will also be addressed in Council.
Question No 12 by (H-0611/01)
Subject: Using hydrogen energy in urban/rural transport Earlier this year the Commission announced its support for the launching of a demonstration project involving the use of hydrogen energy in buses in Iceland, a non EU Member State but a country which is paving the way for sustainable urban transport.
Given the EU' s welcome commitment to stand by the Kyoto Protocol and its continued support for sustainable development, will the Council ensure that the EU' s welcome support for this project, which is the first in a series of fuel bus demonstrations taking place in Europe in the years to come, will be given top priority as hydrogen energy is a true zero emission technology, and will it ensure that this demonstration project is extended to rural transport and not just urban transport projects?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 6 June 2001 the Council gave its political agreement to a common position on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
The final version of this text has been officially adopted and will be forwarded to Parliament at the end of this month or the beginning of next month for second reading. It makes it clear that the Council will firmly support renewable energy sources.
As for the particular project to which the honourable Member referred, it is up to the Commission, in the framework of its competences, to organise pilot or demonstration projects and, if necessary, to put appropriate proposals before the Council.
I thank the President-in-Office for her positive response and for outlining the present position with regard to my question.
Alternative fuels have been a live agenda item in this Parliament for a number of years but we do not seem to be any closer to a practical outcome.
It is obvious that hydrogen energy represents an alternative to fossil fuels, but there are other possible alternatives, such as bio-energy, which is relevant to sustainable land use.
Can the President-in-Office give the House an update on research in these areas and how soon we can expect a positive breakthrough in the area of alternative fuels?
I have to confess to the honourable Member that for the life of me, I cannot answer your question.
The only thing I can do is to refer you to the Commission that has, within its remit, the obligation to follow this up very closely and monitor whatever is going on.
The Commission is much better placed to give you a full answer to your question.
At the Ecofin Council of 10 July 2001, the Belgian Presidency put forward the idea of financing the European Union directly.
To be honest, I must add that the reactions to this were not all enthusiastic.
Having said that, in the presidency' s view, and looking to the future of the Union, we must first consider and then, in the longer term, provide for the possibility of directly financing part of the Community budget without, however, increasing the pressure of taxes in general.
The financing of the Union, both the indirect financing system we all know, and the possibility of direct financing, is one of the options we are examining with regard to the future of the Union.
Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office whether she has noted that in a vote taken in July the European Parliament did not support the proposal regarding the enactment of a European tax.
The presidency has noted that, thank you.
Question No 14 by (H-0621/01):
Subject: Withdrawal of olive residue oil As a precautionary measure, all sales of olive residue oil have been stopped in Spain and it has been withdrawn from shops as a matter of urgency.
Does this oil comply with European rules on olive residue oil? Has there been accidental contamination or is the problem a consequence of the normal manufacturing process?
Was it the return of a shipment of oil exported to the Czech Republic which revealed the excessive level of benzopyrene?
What other shipments have been exported and to which countries?
Was the existence of this shipment known of in May of this year?
Will compensation be provided for the damage caused?
What will be done with the oil which has been withdrawn?
According to information given to the Commission and its competent services and also received by the Council, olive oil made from olive waste has been taken off the market in Spain after the Spanish government had activated the system for the rapid exchange of information in emergencies on 4 July 2001 on account of the fact that polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) had been found in this oil.
It is stated that the contamination arose during a normal manufacturing process, a process that also includes the refining of the oil.
During the burning process caused by the drying of the olive residue, benzopyrene is released.
At present Community legislation does not contain an upper limit for the PAC content in foodstuffs.
The Scientific Committee on Human Nutrition, which falls under the remit of the Commission, is, however, at present evaluating the impact of PACs on health, in order to determine the maximum admissible level of the intake of those substances via human food.
Since the competent services are still heavily involved in the research, the honourable Member will undoubtedly agree that the Council is not the appropriate body to deal with this question.
I would therefore request her to turn to the Commission for additional information.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I am grateful for your technically rigorous reply to this question, which I have also put to the Commission.
But does the Council realise that it has been the rashness and incompetence of the Minister that has led to the loss of more than ESP 14 000 million, with disastrous economic consequences?
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, when it is Ministers themselves who provoke the crisis through their improvisation and inefficiency, is it they who will have to meet the cost?
If the Spanish government has known about a toxic shipment since May, why did they keep it under wraps for a month and why did they only raise the alarm after a month?
Why has it been communicated to the European Union so late and so badly?
Has there been coordination with the European Union?
Does the Council realise that, having raised the alarm in the management of this food crisis, this unpopular Peoples' Party Minister has caused real chaos?
Which countries had this been exported to?
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is well aware that the presidency of the Council has to remain above the Member States and also above any political or ideological disputes.
She will therefore understand that for these reasons I cannot answer the questions she has just asked.
I would just like to make a general remark, in a personal capacity.
If the members of any government whatsoever do not react quickly enough to problems with food or other consumer products, they are taken to task.
If they act as soon as they believe there are sufficient grounds for doing something, they are accused of causing chaos and financial losses.
It is not easy to be a minister these days!
We understand that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is not now an MEP, but a Minister; it is therefore understandable that she should talk of Ministers' problems.
Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez has the floor for a supplementary question.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I can share the concern of the Member who asked the question, but having said that, I would like to clarify that olive residue oil is a by-product of the olive, which is produced after obtaining the olive oil and, furthermore, from every 100 kilos of olives, 20 litres of olive oil and 1.6 litres of olive residue oil are obtained.
We are therefore talking about 8% of production and a product which is consumed very little.
As you rightly said, Madam President, the problem has arisen as a result of the method of extracting olive residue oil, and therefore traces of benzopyrene were found in the olive residue oil and, given the lack, as you also said, of a European regulation setting the limits, the Spanish Ministry of Health proceeded, applying the precautionary principle, to withdraw this oil from circulation.
Today the extraction techniques have been modified and oil can be obtained which is free of benzopyrene.
At the moment they are having the same problem in Italy, for the same reasons.
Therefore, I would like to ask the Council whether it is in any way going to promote the filling of this loophole in the law, so that there may be permissible limits in human food, because, as the saying goes, 'the poison is the dose, not the substance in itself' and that is the basic principle of toxicology.
I have two things to say in response to the comments and questions we have just heard.
To avoid any misunderstanding, let me begin by pointing out that the spokesman for Mr Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for health, stated that there was no question of Member States taking measures against virgin olive oil from Spain, because the problem does not even arise there; that oil is not contaminated by benzopyrene because it is manufactured by an entirely different process.
Secondly, as I pointed out, the Scientific Council attached to the Commission is currently carrying out studies to determine the maximum admissible rates of what are known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
So this study is under way and the Commission will no doubt make proposals to the Council, which will then consider those proposals.
Question No 15 by (H-0623/01):
Subject: Information of Greek citizens about the euro A mere few months before the official introduction of the euro, a survey carried out by Eurobarometer in Greece in late March and early April 2001 revealed that 47.8% of Greeks felt that they knew 'very little or little' about the euro, while 25.5% said that they knew nothing about the subject.
The lowest figures were among people aged over 55, 36% of whom know nothing about the new currency, and only 16% saying they were adequately informed.
It is also notable that 42% of Greeks on low incomes appear to be completely uninformed about the euro, while 4 out of 10 Greeks are unaware that Greece is a member of the euro zone.
What is the Council' s assessment of the results of this survey?
What are the corresponding figures for the other countries in the euro zone?
What conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the information campaign on the new currency conducted by the Greek government and the other 11 governments?
What are the negative effects ensuing from such apparently inadequate preparation for the acceptance of the euro in the public' s mind, and how are cohesion and monetary stability put at risk by the lack of practical information and organisational preparation, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized businesses?
This is a very broad question and I trust that the President-in-Office of the Council will be able to summarise.
Ladies and gentlemen, the euro group meets once a month at ministerial level to take stock of preparations for the changeover to the euro.
At the meeting held on 4 June, the ministers, the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible considered the preparations being made for the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002.
They welcomed the encouraging progress made in this area, and particularly the fact that consumer awareness is increasing.
They also recalled their intention to step up information campaigns during the second half of the year to help smooth the currency changeover.
Against this background, the ministers reiterated their desire to ensure that the conversion of all prices, tariffs and charges coming under their governments' authority would not have any effect on prices or would have only a minimum impact on consumers.
The ministers called on retailers to implement their commitment to respect the good practice that they had included in the joint declaration of European consumer and business associations adopted on 2 April 2001, and to do everything in their power to guarantee the overall stability of their prices when converting to the euro and to give a clear signal of this commitment to their customers.
The ministers also noted that several Member States had stepped up their price monitoring and that the relevant agencies had been vigilant about price conversion issues.
The ministers considered that dual pricing throughout the entire dual circulation period was vital to allow consumers to check prices both in euros and in their national currency.
They also encouraged consumers to familiarise themselves more with prices labelled in euros and to continue to carefully compare competitors' prices, particularly between now and the end of the year and during the dual circulation period.
I thank the Minister for her general reply, but my question was specifically about Greece.
I wanted to say that the statistics in my question were compiled a long time before her answer and that things are changing for the better.
However, according to the latest EUROSTAT figures, there is a growing fear that a lot of people will use this opportunity to increase the prices of goods and services and that this will mainly hit the most vulnerable groups of consumers such as the elderly, the young, the poorly educated, immigrants and the mentally handicapped.
Especially as, in Greece at least, 1 euro is worth 340.75 drachmas, meaning that it is very hard to make the sort of quick calculation needed every hour of every day.
That is why I want to know if, even at the eleventh hour, the Council is giving any thought to the easiest solution all round, i.e. for each Member State to order and distribute cheap pocket calculators which convert each country' s currency into euros, so that even the most poorly informed or disabled citizen can immediately calculate what they are paying, what they are being paid and who is trying to rob them.
This is not a question, Mr Marinos.
We have listened very attentively to your statement on the problems which may arise in Greece, in your judgement; but there cannot be a reply.
Mr Marinos, if the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to reply to you in some way, I have no objection.
Naturally she shall have the floor. But I do not believe, as President, that there has been a supplementary question, but rather a statement by you.
Mr President, I asked if the Council intended to introduce this ready reckoner system.
It is a question and it does not apply to Greece, it applies to every country, not just Greece.
Consumers in every country will face the same problem.
I did not notice that question in your statement.
In any event, the President now has the floor if she believes, following that clarification, that she can reply to the question very briefly.
I do not recall having read that question in the text of Mr Marinos' s oral question.
All that I know is that those ministers that are members of Ecofin, and especially those that belong to the euro group, decided to launch a very intensive campaign which is to be stepped up with effect from now, because they decided that if they had started during the summer there was a risk of the impact being lost during that period so that it would have been necessary to start all over again.
A campaign is therefore to be launched.
I also believe that it will be a two-level campaign, that is an EU-level campaign that will be backed up by campaigns run by the Member States and the various national governments.
I am not sure if the pocket calculators are part of the campaign at euro group level.
They form part of a number of national campaigns, but perhaps you should try to do something along these lines in your own country if they have not been provided for.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you yourselves are familiar with the hundred franc note in Belgium, which is worth about 2 euro.
In Greece, there is the thousand drachma note, which is only worth 0.5 cents.
In other words, we are quite used to having a largely paper-based currency, so my question is this: do you think it is likely that we will ultimately have one or two euro notes as well, given that the five euro note is currently the smallest denomination?
In the southern countries in particular, notes are far more popular than coins.
All these issues were debated at length in the relevant committees of this Parliament, in plenary and by the Council responsible for this.
The decisions have been taken, confirmed and confirmed again, and they will be implemented as agreed and in the form which this House has had an opportunity to consider and to give its opinion on.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, usually, when I get back to Bergamo from Brussels, I arrive late in the evening and I go and have a pizza.
In conversation, the pizza man, knowing that I was an MEP, said to me, 'Now that the euro is coming in, I' ll put the price in euro and round it up so that it is higher than the current price in Italian lire.'
Would it not have been better to issue a regulation which stipulated that, when changing over, there should not be any rises in the price of goods compared with the price over the last three months, for instance, before the euro came into force?
My reply to Mr Fatuzzo is that, as far as I am aware, that is the case.
And if certain persons in certain countries or certain regions do not respect these provisions, it is up to the appropriate price inspection and control agencies to take the necessary steps.
That is the situation in my country.
I presume that is the case, and it should be the case, in all the countries changing over to the euro on 1 January 2001.
I could of course be cheeky, Mr Fatuzzo, and ask what your reply to your pizza seller was!
I told him I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council, mentioning what he had told me, and that then I would give him the answer.
Question No 16 by (H-0624/01):
Subject: Legislation on 'sects' and its impact on respect for religious freedom in Europe One of the Member States, France, has a much criticised law on religion in which the term 'sect' , as applied to smaller churches and religious groups, plays a key role.
By leaving broad scope for the courts' free interpretation and discretion, the law has proved to be a blunt instrument and created legal uncertainty.
The Catholic and Protestant Churches in France together with the European Commission of Human Rights have criticised the law as restricting very fundamental freedoms and rights such as religious freedom and freedom of association.
In the light of the Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights, what is the Council' s view of the French legislation, particularly in a situation where several applicant countries, the Czech Republic for example, are using this law as a model for drafting their own laws on religion?
Are we not at risk of diminishing respect for the public' s choice of life philosophy and religious faith, with greater intolerance as a result, if an increasing number of Member States adopt legislation which outlaws or actively oversees some forms of church and religious groups, and should not the good work and idealism which are characteristic of those organisations be held up as examples rather than banned?
I would reply to Mr SacrÃ©deus that the Council is not really qualified in any way to express an opinion on the question he has posed.
I should, though, like to remind him of Declaration No 11 in the Final Document of Amsterdam, a declaration regarding the status of churches and non-confessional organisations.
That declaration reads as follows: "The European Union respects and does not detract from the status enjoyed by churches and religious associations in accordance with the national law of the Member States.
The European Union also respects the status of philosophical and non-confessional organisations."
I wish to thank the Belgian Presidency for its answer.
The European Union is a union of common values.
It is these which bind us together, not Mammon or money but the common culture and view of human life that unites us as Europeans.
I am referring, in this case, to the French legislation and its disparaging concept, sectaire, for this is no edifying concept.
I refer to the arbitrariness and lack of clarity in the term itself and to the fact that the legislation is not specific but says that when people are forced into positions of humiliation or exposed to repeated pressure or other techniques designed to alter their powers of judgment, the punishment may be one of up to five years in prison or a fine of FRF 5 million.
I wish to repeat that the Catholic Church and many churches in France are very sceptical about this legislation.
Is this not an issue concerning human dignity and democracy?
Question No 17 by (H-0626/01):
Subject: Torture of people on grounds of sexual orientation Instances of torture and abusive treatment of people who develop relations with those of the same sex have increased sharply and matters are made worse by the widespread tolerance of such violations and the reluctance of the victims to have their identities revealed.
The recent Amnesty International report describes the suffering of thousands of people who are tortured, abused, sexually assaulted and coerced into medical or psychiatric treatment.
The report includes documented cases from some 30 countries, while in more than 70 countries, relations between people of the same sex are considered a criminal offence.
What will the Council do to put an end to such occurrences in a democratic Europe which stresses the importance of respect for human diversity and sexual identity?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union says that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The second paragraph of the same article says the Union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and, as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.
In this respect, Article 3 of that European Convention says that "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" , whilst Article 14 of the Convention stipulates that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any grounds, and in particular on the grounds of sex.
Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Union says that within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat any discrimination, particularly discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation.
With a view to ensuring more vigorous and concerted action at national, regional and international level, in April of this year the European Union adopted guidelines for its policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments or treatment, thus confirming the central role of this issue in its human rights policy.
These guidelines give the Union an instrument for intervening in cases involving torture and a means of stepping up its efforts to secure greater respect for international rules.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her most satisfactory reply.
We all know that the European Union is very sensitive about respect for human rights and that this sensitivity is expressed in the Treaties and in the European Convention on Human Rights.
However, Madam President-in-Office, anyone who reads the recent Amnesty International report on the torture suffered by thousands of people throughout the world because of their sexual orientation will feel that what we are doing in the European Union is not enough.
The UN Commission on Human Rights recently took an initiative to encourage people to file charges if they are tortured or their human rights are violated because of their sexual identity.
Are you perhaps planning to take a similar initiative at European Union level?
Question No 18 by (H-0628/01):
Subject: Access by the public to Council documents On 30 May this year the Council, having enacted the legislation to open its documents to the public, set itself a deadline of six months, until 3 December 2001, to complete its preparatory measures.
Now we have reached early September so we are halfway through the Council' s self-given six-month period.
Is the Council 'on schedule' with its preparations?
If not, would it like any help from the Parliament, which has been open to the public for so many years already?
Question No 19 by (H-0630/01):
Subject: Increased openness The legislative act governing public access to EU documents was adopted in May 2001.
The new rules are to enter into force within six months.
Can the Council state what types of previously confidential or secret documents are now going to be accessible to members of the public under the new rules on openness?
