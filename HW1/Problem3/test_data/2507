European Union policy would therefore have to be directed at the creation of overcapacity at the taxpayer's expense.
Because of this expensive overcapacity carriers of goods would from case to case have a free hand in choosing the means of transport that is the fastest or cheapest for them at the time.
This overcapacity could also lead to more intense competition.
This would mean that workers, especially those on the railways and in the ports, would be less certain of keeping their jobs and maintaining their incomes.
They would then be played off against people in other sectors who would be no more certain of a stable supply of work.
All kinds of liberalisation proposals may turn out to have a negative impact on people and their living environment.
Unfortunately, it looks as though the choices that are the most desperately needed will still not have been made to the extent necessary by 2010.
Then we shall be seeing the replacement of railways by motorways in the new Member States, a development that Mr Piecyk rightly warned of just now.
This is not the way to go and unfortunately we do not have enough of that guarantee.
Everyone knows we are facing an enormous growth in traffic and Mr Piecyk has today set out all the awful effects this will have.
To summarise briefly they are the social effects, environmental and health effects and safety effects and globalisation has a part to play in this.
In short, I think that the problem is accurately described in the White Paper.
What we are in principle seeking of course, for environmental reasons, for example, but also for a number of other reasons, is the separation of economic growth and transport and related problems.
What is missing for me, and here I concur with Mr Piecyk, who was talking about avoiding traffic, is what we in the Netherlands call transport prevention or transport limitation.
In the Netherlands this is absolutely an existing line of policy and I should like it to be taken seriously at European level.
It is a sectoral approach.
Everyone can imagine what happens if you decide to produce more regionally, for example in the agriculture sector.
Then you have no need to transport any meat or transport any animals.
A second option of course is to tackle it with new technology.
All kinds of things are possible in this regard: low emission and low energy cars, etc. Where the modal shift is concerned, I heard Mrs Peijs arguing just now that rail must not receive this stimulus from the European Union.
I cannot agree with that at all.
I think that it is indeed necessary, but I also think that there is an absolute need for the emission problems of rail compared with the other modes to be tackled seriously.
Final point: pricing.
If we look at the pricing discussions to date, then I find it disappointing that, after the four years that I have been in this Parliament, after a group has worked on this subject at high level, after we have drafted the Costa report, we have still not made any advances at that level.
I must say that I see more in the practical approaches, in Switzerland for example, than in the theoretical considerations.
Finally, moreover, I support the standpoint concerning the expansion issues and the exhortation not to slip back into the same mistakes, as previously indicated.
Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs de Palacio on the White Paper on transport before us in this debate.
This is a well-produced piece of work on the part of the Commission which allows us to look as far forward as 2010.
May I also thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, on his report.
I think all the political groups will more or less vote the same way tomorrow on a number of points which are vital to the future of transport in the European Union.
For me personally, our guiding principles for the immediate development of European transport are to complete the single market, promote competition, especially by liberalising transport wherever it has not yet been liberalised, ensure all forms of transport are safe and prioritise environmental protection.
I should like to qualify these principles by making a few comments on some of the individual issues.
First of all, the debate on trans-European networks must at some point stop being a debate and must be fleshed out, by which I mean that the trans-European networks will need to be promoted in practice and this will require political will on the part of the Member States on the one hand and both national and Community funding on the other.
We therefore need to increase funding under the Community budget specifically for trans-European networks.
Secondly, we need to open up the railway market.
The Council needs to push the second railways package through as quickly as possible on the basis of Parliament's proposals, so that the European Union has something to show for itself in the railway sector.
Thirdly, we need to strengthen short sea shipping.
This is vital, especially in certain areas of the European Union, and of course helps to protect the environment.
Fourthly, our debate must include the special role which outlying regions of the European Union and island regions need to play if there is to be a balanced development of transport networks within the Union.
Fifthly, road safety.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not united on this issue.
I personally am in favour of a road safety agency, given that 40 000 people are killed on the roads of Europe every year and I think that, while respecting subsidiarity, we need to do something at European level.
Finally, two brief comments on measures to promote safety at sea and charging for infrastructures.
We need to look at this issue but we need to be very careful because it is a rather delicate issue and, although the Commission needs to act, it needs to take careful stock before it makes any proposals.
Mr President, I should first like to thank the Commissioner very much for the White Paper that she has presented.
It is not a radical reform, but it will have far-reaching consequences for future transport policy.
I should also like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado, a Spaniard who has worked on this White Paper with a thoroughness of which one would usually attribute only to a German, and who has invested a great deal of energy in his report.
As always with such compromises, however, there are of course a number of inconsistencies that I should like to point out. paragraph 9 states that there should be some degree of shift to rail, but that under no circumstances should this negatively affect the competitiveness of road transport.
It therefore needs to be stated that what we have at present is unfair competition, which needs to be redressed, precisely because certain costs associated with road transport - and in particular environmental costs - are not taken into account.
Neither is it a question, as it says in paragraph 10, of forcing modal shift.
In any case, the shift will only affect certain sectors.
Of course we need heavy goods vehicles too.
But the point is that, precisely when roads are under excessive pressure and environmental costs are not being taken into account, unutilised capacity on rail should be used better.
Already today I can say that even in the case of the Brenner Pass - which is so controversial - there is unutilised capacity that could be used, and that this would make a contribution to improving the environment.
Finally, let me address the issue of cross-financing.
I believe that it is right to refer in paragraph 75 to the fact that what the Commission is proposing is the right way forward.
This is not about an arbitrary subsidy either, but about compensating for the existing disadvantages and about strengthening a mode of transport that has unfortunately suffered in recent decades from the fact that the priority has been to consolidate the position of road transport.
This is therefore simply about redressing the balance and this should be stated here.
Once again, I hope that this report, if it is adopted now, will be of genuine help to the Commission in implementing the proposals in the White Paper.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, for a report prepared so well and thoroughly.
The rapporteur has introduced notable improvements to the Commission proposal.
The major objectives are the relief of congestion, the creation of hubs, improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport.
These are targeted primarily at the Union's central regions.
I would like to remind everyone of the transport needs in outlying and remote districts and regions, and geographically problematic areas.
Good and viable transport links are vital for these areas, which have thin traffic flows.
These needs are virtually ignored in the Commission White Paper.
Account has to be taken of the special needs of sparsely populated island and mountain areas in any development of a common transport policy.
Good transport links will ensure that the whole of the area of the Union remains within the scope of a functional single market and that all Union resources are spent.
I would like to mention one final detail. A harsh winter has exposed a new type of safety risk in sea transportation.
Consignments of oil in the Baltic Sea from Russia's new oil port have increased in number.
At the same time the risk of oil disasters in exceptionally icy conditions in winter has grown.
The EU, like the International Maritime Organisation, has no agreement regarding how fit a ship carrying oil is to travel through ice.
This breach in safety arrangements should be swiftly put right.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 is clearly in favour, and I welcome the fact, of shifting the balance between modes of transport towards rail and waterways.
It defines priorities with a view to this shift: moving towards fair charging arrangements and acting to combat bottlenecks and environmental degradation, as well as giving a pivotal role to users.
Like all the directives issued in this field, however, it is always the pursuit of liberalisation in all transport sectors that is emphasised, as if this were the only viable solution.
Mr Izquierdo Collado's report provides a series of amendments that should be supported with a view to respecting the environment.
He also makes proposals for the harmonisation of fuel taxation and transport charges.
With regard to road safety, I think it is good that he calls for the creation of a Road Safety Agency.
Since I constantly tried to draw attention to the crucial issue of funding when the directive on rail interoperability was being drawn up, I fully agree with another of Mr Collado's proposals, that seeking to create a European Transport Fund in order to ensure that the policies proposed are financially viable and credible.
As you will have understood, however, I cannot support his backing for the liberalisation processes underway.
We are examining directives on rail, air transport, and on nautical and technical services next week, all aiming to liberalise these sectors.
We should, of course, support the call for the Commission to assess the consequences of liberalisation, as Mr Collado does.
I believe, however, that we should also strengthen public services by modernising them.
I believe that public services or services of general interest must be at the heart of the Union's transport policy and must, as such, be incorporated into future Treaties.
I think we genuinely need to shift the balance in transport towards rail, but we still need to make far more progress on the matter of distortion of competition, which remains significant, and, in particular, we should be far more resolute in demanding a reduction in driving time for lorry drivers, which is also a condition for increased safety.
My group also considers that the report should be more concerned with social issues.
A series of amendments has been tabled by my group, moreover, relating to the key issue of harmonisation of social standards from the top for all modes of transport.
Transport naturally also includes maritime transport and, at a time when the Prestige disaster is still at the forefront of our minds, I would like to draw your attention to the amendment tabled by my group inviting the Commission to present a legislative proposal forcing polluters - oil companies, classification companies, ship owners and charterers - to pay for all damage caused by disasters in which they are involved.
I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has requested a ban on flags of convenience and I would like the Commission to take swift measures in this regard.
For all these reasons, you will understand that my group will wait in order to be able to take account of any progress due to the adoption of amendments before taking up a final position on this report.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo, on his excellent work.
Secondly, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner, because this is the first time in this legislature that this Member will refer expressly to his region, Andalusia.
Andalusia - as you know - is one of the most extensive territories of the European Union, with almost 8 million inhabitants and in 2002 it received 21 million visitors who generated EUR 13 200 million.
As you know, it is one of the Union's Objective 1 regions, with one of the lowest levels of income, but it survives thanks to agriculture and tourism.
The report itself talks of the substantial impact of transport on European tourism and the need to create north-south corridors in order to facilitate the free trade area between Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the development of the outermost regions.
Well, what do you make, ladies and gentlemen, of the fact that Algeciras, which is the European Union's largest Mediterranean container port, has just one connection, by rail, with the interior, which follows a route which is more than a century old and which allows an average of no greater than 17 km/h?
Did you know that the only Mediterranean coastal area in the whole of the European Union which does not have a motorway is between the provinces of Malaga and Almeria?
Well, between them is located the province of Granada, which has the lowest income in Spain and in Europe.
If infrastructures do not get there, how are we going to develop?
These are examples of the infrastructure deficit of the peripheral regions of the Union.
While the different Community policies allow these bottlenecks, there is little or nothing we can do to create cohesive transport and intermodality from social and environmental points of view.
I am glad that this report has not forgotten users of two-wheeled vehicles, who are extremely important in terms of individual transport and its sustainability in cities, which, thanks to them, are more human places to be.
We must continue to work to increase safety standards in transport and its infrastructures, pinpointing black spots and protecting them.
Ladies and gentlemen, if only for money, let us work, let us invest more in safety.
One death costs us EUR 1 million and we have 40 000 deaths a year on the roads.
The report does not mention non-transport.
We must work on an innovative aspect, which is the pedestrianisation of the cities.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, firstly my sincere thanks go to the Vice-President for the White Paper that she has written with her colleagues.
I believe that the approach to European transport policy that is advocated in the White Paper is a good one, namely of working on the supply side to restore the balance between the transport modes by 2010.
Commissioner, I would ask you also to do all you can now to encourage the Greek Presidency to put the second railway package on the Council's agenda and to reach a common position, because railway policy is one of the core components of your White Paper and if we do not make progress here we can forget the whole idea, that you have stated in the paper, of getting more freight and passengers back onto rail.
This is a genuine fear if the large States get together and simply say: we do not want to open up the markets; we do not want to modernise the railway structures.
I hope that you will tell us how likely you think it is that we will still be able to conclude the second railway package in this legislative period.
Because if we do not manage to do so in this parliament then the question is whether we will manage to do so in 2005, 2006 or 2007; if we do not then it will undermine the entire objective of your White Paper, namely to restore the balance between transport modes by 2010.
I now turn to our excellent rapporteur to say that my friends and I will in any case have to reject two points, the first being paragraph 66 on setting up a road safety agency.
Mr Izquierdo Collado, Commissioner de Palacio has rightly stated in her White Paper that we do not want to have any legislation on road safety in the next five years.
We want to take best practice and see how we can reduce the number of deaths on the roads and achieve higher levels of road safety on this basis.
If there is no European legislation, what do we need a new road safety agency for?
I would suggest that we should ensure that the maritime agency, the air safety agency and the railway agency do their jobs properly.
But let us not have yet another agency!
I must say to the rapporteur that I cannot support paragraph 79, which advocates the setting up of another new transport fund, either.
I say to previous speakers: it is your region and your Member State that will have to improve local public transport in your cities.
We cannot spend European funds on tasks that are the responsibility of the Member States.
We need the resources that we have for the trans-European networks.
As it is we have too few resources here.
If you take a look at what we have achieved with the Essen projects, which we agreed together in 1996, you will see that not even all 14 projects have been implemented, and we do not have enough money for them.
We already have the Cohesion Fund, the regional fund and the ISPA fund.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not have yet another European transport fund!
We need to support the trans-European networks and leave the rest to the Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after almost one and a half years of debate on the White Paper and therefore on our transport policy strategy, we now have a report that is by and large capable of winning a majority.
Our thanks go to the rapporteur for his successful consensus-building, which is always an arduous task.
The White Paper itself certainly deserves the epithet strategic, because it keeps in view the idea of optimising European transport as a whole and because it underpins its objective of achieving a balanced distribution of transport needs across transport modes with around 60 specific individual measures.
The exact same number - exactly 60 - of specific legislative proposals are still gathering dust in the Council.
That is the reality of transport policy and I think it is a scandal.
Purely arithmetically speaking we are therefore practically back in 1992, at the beginning of the process of implementing the last White Paper.
I should like to stress two points today.
Firstly, we urgently need a compromise on matters concerning Galileo.
There is a danger that the deadlock will call into question one of our flagship projects in transport and industrial policy.
It is surely absurd that first no Member State wanted to pay and now they are arguing about whether more should be paid.
In terms of development, we were three years ahead of the American GPS3 system.
We frittered away one year, the Americans are catching up another year by pumping in huge investment, and if we do not get our skates on we will forfeit the success of the project that we are so eagerly awaiting.
Secondly, there is a lot of movement in the European skies and this is now reflected in our legislation.
Now that the single sky project has been kicked into the right orbit, we would encourage the Commission to complete its open skies strategy, even if this runs counter to national interests, because we need a single European sky.
One more point to finish with: we actually ought not to have debates on transport policy every ten years, but on a continuous basis, including here in the plenary and, as we are doing today, at a reasonable hour.
Mr President, Commissioner, the White Paper has been the catalyst for a stimulating debate which has produced a strategic vision allowing us to focus on the goal of creating the conditions for free movement of goods and persons, which are essential if we are to achieve the genuine integration of the enlarged Europe and pursue territorial cohesion, avoiding any land wastage and reducing undesirable effects on the environment, security or public health.
This is a hugely ambitious goal and 2010 seems a long way away but, considering the time frames for the various changes to structure and infrastructure, we can say that we are already extremely behind.
From this point of view, the delay to the progress of the strategic dossier - and other dossiers too - imposed by the Transport Council is cause for concern, while we can only welcome with great enthusiasm the impetus being given by the Commission to all these issues.
It is in this direction, with this aim that I feel it is worth continuing to explore what appear to be as yet theoretical, unrefined concepts, such as decoupling or the endeavour to reduce the impact of transport on development, which certainly nobody wants to limit, for in that way we will be exploring collateral policies in the field of land-use planning and in the area of optimising infrastructure through the use of new technologies.
It is equally important that we help to balance the choice of mode of transport by internationalising external costs and exploiting the differences in internal charges and costs for coordination of more compatible modes of transport too.
These are pressing, problematic matters and we are in danger of getting bogged down in them, but they are crucial and decisive for the issues we are addressing.
I hope that, as has been said, the Commission communication on the methodology for charging for external costs which will allow us to establish a system of apportioning transport costs which is fairer than at present, replacing the generic charges we are currently paying with appropriate, specific charges, will not be long in coming.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the matter of transport in Europe, which we are debating due to the examination of a White Paper with the evocative title 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide' and the report by Mr Collado on this White Paper, is, to me, a perfect example of the gap, not to say the canyon, that exists in Europe in this field, as in many others, between needs and reality, between the stated objectives and the means implemented to achieve them.
All because a market logic, founded in 1992 in a White Paper behind directives on competitiveness and liberalisation, has led to our neglecting safety, the environment, social aspects and land use planning.
The senseless belief that liberalisation is effective, not to say perfect, has created short-sightedness with regard to the future, devalued public action and public services, condemned those who believe in the need for long-term public investment and divided funding, excluding general interest and the positive or negative effects of decisions taken in the short term.
The rapporteur himself criticised this very firmly and I would thank him for that.
I also support him, of course, when he says that transport is a strategic sector for land use planning and for economic and social cohesion, and when he speaks of the serious consequences for the environment.
He tells us that sustainable development must comprise the basis for a European transport policy, and I agree.
He calls for global transport management, and I agree.
I also agree, of course, with his concern for safety and social requirements.
I therefore support many of his requests, but I am very afraid that at the time of voting, the necessary electric shock will not be sufficient to cause deep-seated policy changes in this area.
Our rapporteur speaks of the need for greater balance between modes of transport, which is good, but this is not sufficient, far from it.
As I requested during the debate on the sixth FRDP, we need further research in the field.
In particular, we should quickly redirect public investment by means of public borrowing, significant public borrowing.
The year 2010 is in seven years and that is very close.
If Europe does not want to limit itself to a list of good intentions, it must now, as of 2003, redirect all its investments and all its choices in this area by providing itself with new legislative instruments and financial resources equal to what is at stake.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am glad that we are actually ready, and this on my birthday, perfect timing by the Parliament to be sure.
It is however already 2003 and tomorrow we are finally approving the report of our colleague Izquierdo Collado on the transport policy White Paper.
Better late than never.
The White Paper makes plans for 2010.
The time for elaborating the whole package of measures is now compressed into seven years.
I therefore wish the Commission good luck with its implementation of all of this.
The key to very many of the objectives that the Commission is setting itself is the fair price of modes of transport and infrastructures.
It is therefore high time for the Commission finally to come forward with the Pricing Directive.
The Commission has been talking about it for a long time and there is a loud clamour for this document, not only in this Chamber, from the people who are sympathetic towards the environment and traffic safety, but also in the Member States, who are keen for the real polluter to pay.
A discussion that ties in closely with this is the demand for a kerosene tax.
The Commission must move in this area.
We cannot on the one hand have trans-European railways subsidised and on the other open the door for flights from Brussels to London for the price of a loaf of bread.
The White Paper makes it possible to make a powerful response to questions of this kind.
It is now up to the Commission to work faster on the proposals that must follow this White Paper.
I want finally to repeat what I said in my maiden speech some months ago: the most environmentally friendly kilometre is the kilometre not travelled and this White Paper offers no solution for avoiding transport.
This is a missed opportunity.
Happy birthday, Mr Dhaene, and I hope you enjoy the evening celebrating with your friends.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very authoritative work, but I would also like to add a comment of my own.
Frankly, I am not really convinced that our Parliamentary work benefits from the House being tied for over a year and a half to working on a document, even a document as authoritative as the White Paper - with over 400 amendments and who knows what other complications - not least in that the result is this, of necessity very brief, concise debate, in which it is difficult to address a subject of this kind.
It may be better to find a new methodology for dealing with the major chapters of the White Paper and to proceed section by section.
I am proposing this for the very reason that it is extremely difficult to know what to say in two minutes on such a huge subject.
I will therefore focus not on what I endorse - which is a great deal, most of the White Paper - but on what I feel is still a grey area, in other words, Commissioner, the matter of Trans-European Networks.
As Mr Jarzembowski has rightly said, if we want to concentrate the Union's efforts, including its economic resources, then let us look in that direction, in the direction of projects which are of genuine European importance.
In any case, we cannot fail to notice that they are not given enough consideration in the White Paper, that the way they are dealt with is inadequate.
We have updated a list of projects which are already in difficulties, falling behind schedule, which cannot proceed, but, instead of discovering why they are at a standstill and finding ways and means of speeding up their implementation, we have decided to add to this list and to do so, what is more, with projects which will require a great deal of hard work and commitment.
Your idea of indicating the European interest of some of these projects was brilliant, but it has not been carried through.
I will end, Commissioner, by saying that there is a general need to focus more on the basic goals, concentrating particularly on matters of European Union infrastructure, urging the Member States to work to this end but directing the work and resources of our committee towards this area too.
Mr President, we must back a transport system in Europe that makes high demands in terms of the environment and safety.
I therefore wish to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for the work that has been done on the White Paper.
We are now emphasising even more clearly what we want to achieve in terms of the environment and safety.
I appreciate our now being able to make a start on this work.
I also appreciate, and completely support, the proposals to transfer freight from roads to railways and the sea.
That is important.
We must, however, remember that roads are of very great importance in certain parts of the EU, for example in the sparsely populated and peripheral regions.
The various forms of transport must therefore complement one another.
It is a great challenge to create a transport system in the EU because Europe does not constitute a homogeneous geographical area.
We must therefore take account of different conditions, and trans-European networks are very important.
It is important to create TEN corridors.
If we invest in east-west TEN corridors, we can relieve the pressure on the central regions with their very high traffic density.
There are advantages to backing trans-European networks.
The rapporteur has very clearly succeeded in emphasising the importance of the peripheral regions and the regions characterised by long distances.
The report sees increased account being taken of these aspects.
I nonetheless have a number of points to make.
I agree that we have great investment needs and that we must use trans-European networks.
When it comes to item 79, I am able to accept the proposal that the Commission conduct a study concerning the development of new methods of funding major infrastructure projects.
With regard to the proposal for a road safety authority, I take it that such an authority would have the task of encouraging constructive schemes, have a bottom-up perspective and promote cooperation at different levels.
We must improve road safety in the EU.
We are now awaiting the Commission's third road safety programme and have been doing so for a long time.
I hope that it will be in place soon.
Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado is quite right to recall the obligation of transport policy to contribute to balanced development and to economic and social cohesion.
In fact, when thinking about and outlining a transport policy it must be realised that this is a sector of strategic importance and a service of public interest that must serve basic objectives.
No less importantly, account must be taken of people's right to mobility that is safe, affordable and of high quality.
Giving priority to modes of transport that are compatible with the environment also warrants our agreement although we must immediately highlight the contradiction between this statement of principle and the way in which the report favours roads.
Nevertheless, I also wish to state that on some fundamental aspects, we are moving far away from the Commission White Paper and also from the report by Mr Izquierdo Collado because the report does not distance itself sufficiently from the White Paper on these aspects.
In particular, we do not agree with and even reject the leap forwards represented by the constant support for liberalisation, for opening up the markets in the transport sector, as if this were a panacea that could resolve all the difficult situations that have been building up over the years and which have led to the subordination of public transport to private transport and to the degradation of that service.
To date no study has been produced and no one has been able to prove that opening up transport to competition can resolve the sector's problems.
On the contrary, where liberalisation has taken place, the results prove that exactly the opposite is true.
This is why we have these railway and aviation accidents, which are basically caused by the lack of investment in equipment and in safety, or because of redundancies and the deterioration of employees' social conditions.
Furthermore, the idea that guaranteeing the existence of various operators of these lines or routes leads to an initial situation of apparent openness systematically ends up creating real monopolies.
The current discussion with regard to the air transport sector is enlightening on this matter.
Finally, I do not think it is acceptable, in the aim of ensuring high-quality and safe transport, for States only to have infra-structures in which they have to invest heavily and that the same States still subsidise - using money from the public purse - companies that will provide services and that these ultimately collect the profits from operating these services.
This is certainly a profitable business for these companies. The same is not true, however, for public operators.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank my colleague Mrs Peijs for her very hard work in trying to reach suitable compromises on such a controversial and difficult report.
Despite that, unfortunately, our view has not changed.
The report was billed as proposals and an action programme for transport until 2010, but I believe strongly that it contains little more than ill-researched, half-baked ideas.
It should not surprise anyone that the majority of the ideas proposed could not be considered seriously, as the original Commission proposal was so backward-looking.
Not only is the paper almost totally focused on rail to the detriment of all other modes of transport, but it completely fails to alleviate the precarious situation in which the aviation industry has unfortunately found itself, particularly since 11 September.
Yet again, the age-old favourite of kerosene tax has popped up, another way of sneaking it in through the back door.
Competition also appears to have fallen by the wayside in this proposal.
Either it was ignored deliberately or it was simply forgotten in the excitement of the rail enthusiasts in the Commission.
The consumer has a right to choose his method of transport, so perhaps improving all modes, rather than just concentrating on rail, would have allowed the transport industry to compete fairly.
Obviously, some of the most contentious issues in this paper concern the aspect of subsidiarity.
It is clear that a European Road Safety Agency would be a total waste of taxpayers' money and another pointless layer of bureaucracy.
In addition, we also oppose the introduction of a European Transport Fund, as this reeks of vested interest.
One other point on taxation and infrastructure charging will be covered by my colleague Mr Bradbourn.
If I may finally say, this proposal was a complete waste of an opportunity by the Commission to come up with far-reaching, innovative ideas which many of us may have been able to support.
In a nutshell, it is a retrograde, ill-thought-out proposal, which we shall be voting against.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think there are a few areas in which the European Union should make a commitment.
Among them I would include, although these are not related to the White Paper, training, because performance depends on knowledge; research, because our growth depends in part on innovation; and transport, because the sustainability of our development depends on the quality of transport.
That is why the Union needs resources.
It needs money.
The idea of a European fund is therefore not a bad idea.
I still remember what Jacques Delors used to say: we need a great European loan in order to carry out great work.
Naturally, that is out of date today.
It sounds rather old-fashioned, but economics is not a science.
Sometimes old ideas return, and just because Mr Keynes has returned to an old way of thinking, that does not mean the idea is bad.
Beyond this financial aspect, I would like to draw your attention to three other aspects.
First of all, Europe is enlarging eastwards, and our territory is therefore becoming unbalanced.
I believe the Commission should keep an eye on all the outermost areas of Europe, whose geographic makeup is complex, composed of islands, mountains and peninsulas, and that we need to ensure that enlargement does not displace Europe too far towards the East.
I am putting the case here for the Atlantic coast in the West of Europe, although I am sure you are sensitive to its needs.
The second aspect is that Europe has many ports, many shores and many coasts.
We must therefore spare no expense with regard to maritime navigation.
We could probably do more.
That would mean, with regard to maritime safety, that we should continue in the direction you have taken, which I believe to be the right one.
Lastly, the third aspect: our regions.
We need to make progress with our regions on the transport dossier.
Regional policy might comprise tripartite contracts in future and, from that point of view, transport is a good subject associating States, regions and Europe as a whole.
I believe that this White Paper and this task provide a good opportunity for the Commission to build all these links.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, both the White Paper and Mr Izquierdo Collado's report show very clearly that there is still a very great deal that needs to be done in the transport sector.
Nevertheless, it is appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to the work done by the current Commissioner for transport.
In a short time she has got things moving.
We can confidently expect them to keep moving smoothly and quickly.
In an earlier intervention, the rapporteur said that the European Union's transport policy was still lacking in one respect: he thought that we had lost the battle for sustainability.
I should like to consider this issue by referring to one specific aspect of transport policy.
Charges and funding instruments are, quite rightly, addressed specifically in paragraph 75 and those following it in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report.
Where transport is concerned, the key question is always what the transport service costs.
That is why the true costs and the cost advantages of the individual modes of transport need to be compared properly and in detail.
This afternoon we have been debating the Austrian transit system.
I must repeat and underline now what we already heard earlier: for as long as it is cheaper to travel through the Alps and other sensitive areas by lorry, however good the alternative infrastructures on offer are, it will be to no avail.
Even a tunnel under Austria would not help if it were cheaper to travel through the country above ground.
My request to you is therefore for some serious proposals on transport in particularly sensitive areas, and as soon as possible.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me firstly to pay tribute to a person connected to the world of transport, the head of local police recently murdered by the terrorist group ETA.
Secondly, and turning more specifically to the report, I would like to make a series of comments.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and Karla Peijs, our shadow rapporteur, since she has made enormous contributions to this document.
I will move on to the issues in the report.
Firstly, there is concern amongst a series of delegations, a series of groups, because we believe the report does not reflect, or reflects very little, the situation of certain countries whose infrastructures have not yet been established, as opposed to other countries in which infrastructures, investments in infrastructures, essentially roads, are completely finished and which only need to be improved.
That is one of our group's concerns.
Secondly, I would like to express our support for the creation of a road safety agency.
The number of fatal accidents currently occurring on European Roads requires not just a message but an effective and active European policy, and we believe that the road safety agency can be a good instrument.
Finally, we also support the creation of the transport fund, with objectives and considerations other than the trans-European networks and the Structural Funds in the field of transport.
We will support these two ideas which we consider to be positive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper contains a number of points which are of great, direct interest to Italy such as the issue of Alpine passes, the financing of major infrastructure work, restoring the balance between modes of transport, sustainability and cohesion in Europe.
In my opinion, transport policy must help to improve the economic and social situation in Europe greatly, and, in particular, must take into consideration the specific nature of the outermost regions and islands, calling for measures to be taken to improve the disadvantaged situation of these regions and islands as far as is possible and to ensure territorial continuity.
During the Essen and Dublin European Councils, 14 priority projects were identified and, without waiting for these objectives to be achieved, the White Paper has added others, clearly dissipating resources.
In this connection, I feel I must stress the fact that none of these projects relates to the south of Italy, where the situation is critical, which will be in even more danger of being marginalised by Europe after enlargement.
By critical situation, I am referring to the situation of land transport, Trans-European Networks, sea transport, air transport and transport safety in general.
In other words, I would like to make it clear that these are regions which have severe structural difficulties and deficiencies caused by inappropriate decisions and policies.
I represent in this House the citizens of two major islands - Sicily and Sardinia - which have approximately 7 million inhabitants. I call for the undertakings given by European ministers in the Treaty of Amsterdam with regard to the outermost regions and islands not to be forgotten.
I hope that the increasing liberalisation of transport will be accompanied by development guarantees for the disadvantaged regions.
Mr President, I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on a number of key areas on which I take issue, both with the report and with the Commission's original proposals.
At the outset, I should like to say how much I agree with the comments my colleague, Mrs Foster, made earlier.
Firstly, I find the whole anti-road sentiment of this report baffling in the extreme.
Roads are, and always will be, the cornerstone of our transport industry, allowing us to reach every corner of our respective countries and the whole of our continent.
It is, therefore, highly unrealistic to believe that there is a future for industry as a whole while we neglect its link to its customers: the road network.
Yet this paper steadfastly ignores the road sector and is thus completely unbalanced.
Combining roads with other modes of transport is essential.
I have no doubt that better public transport has a vital part to play in this transport strategy.
However, road transport, quite rightly, remains the main choice for the majority, due to its ease and flexibility.
Penalising people for using roads is an extremely dangerous step, yet this is exactly what the report advocates.
One such example is the idea of infrastructure charging.
This is primarily an issue of subsidiarity and should not even be considered at a European level, quite apart from whether such charging is right in principle, given the vast amounts which the motorist already pays in taxation.
Only a small proportion of that tax revenue is spent on improving transport.
This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom.
British Conservatives strongly opposed infrastructure charging in our country and we oppose it just as vehemently here in Europe.
Yet this report goes deeper than just imposing direct charges on the public.
By attempting to cut the link between transport and economic growth, we are ignoring clear evidence dating back centuries.
Put simply, increased trade boosts a nation's economy, raising its GDP.
Even basic trade, however, would not be possible without an efficient transport system which is available to all.
I acknowledge that this report was always going to be difficult and sympathise with the rapporteur, who is in a lose-lose situation.
However, my Conservative colleagues and I have serious doubts as to where this paper would lead us, with its severe implications for the entire transport industry.
I therefore urge this House to reject the report in its entirety.
Mr President, there is no doubt that liberalisation of the transport market has delivered positive benefits for the mobility of goods and people, but this is in the context of a continuing predominance of road traffic, growing congestion and harmful effects on the environment and public health.
The White Paper proposes to tackle this situation by gradually breaking the link between transport growth and economic growth or an increase in GDP, while recognising that economic growth will generate greater needs for mobility.
Conversely, we cannot ignore the importance of transport in contributing to economic growth and development.
The Irish situation is an excellent case study in point.
Road traffic in Dublin has grown exponentially in the last decade, as we have experienced record growth levels in our economy.
But the resulting congestion now acts as a serious brake on further growth.
Here, we are talking about balance and the need to get it right.
We also have the environmental impact on our air quality.
Similarly, enlargement will also generate additional road transport.
Infrastructure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment.
As they grow their GDP and their per capita income - which we all hope they do - so traffic and congestion will increase pro rata.
The action proposed by the White Paper involves rebalancing the different modes of transport; developing high quality rail services; promoting short sea crossings; inland waterways and combined transport; and promoting fair competition between the sectors.
New TENs projects are needed to address existing and future bottlenecks, along with a sufficient infrastructure charging policy.
In aviation, I fully support the SKY initiative.
I do not feel that harmonisation of fuel taxes has an essential part to play.
Road transport will continue to be the dominant mode of transport for Member States for which alternative modes are not possible and not realistic.
Even where they are, what will it take to get us out of our cars?
In conclusion, while road safety is a major issue and death and injury on our roads are at frightening levels - 40 000 per annum in the EU - like many colleagues I balk at yet another European agency and feel that national authorities should be able to plan strategies suitable to their particular set of circumstances.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, amongst its main objectives, the White Paper proposes giving priority to sustainable development, relaunching maritime and rail transport, fostering intermodality, anticipating the impact of traffic flow generated by enlargement and improving accessibility in peripheral regions.
I fully support modal rebalancing, which should be achieved by means of a series of measures combining a review of the charging system with the revitalisation of alternatives to road transport and targeted investment in the trans-European network.
We must, however, at all costs not lose sight of the fact that, pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty, transport policies must be designed to serve cohesion and that, in this regard, the trans-European transport network must be an instrument of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the Union.
Extremely specific analyses must be carried out on service provision to the peripheral regions, in particular the island regions and outermost regions with, in particular, the establishment of a public service obligation relating to the need to guarantee the principle of territorial continuity and to ensure the best possible operating conditions.
There is a genuine lack of decision when the role of transport in the regional development of the peripheral and, a fortiori, the outermost regions is raised, even though the Treaties recognise in this case the need for treatment that can derogate from common transport market rules.
The particularly worrying situation of the provision of air services to the French overseas departments following the dismantling of Air Lib, an airline partly specialising in these flights, is a perfect example of the current gaps that I have just mentioned.
It also illustrates the urgency of a joint vision of the future of development in the outermost regions, within which the transport regulation policy would meet the regional development policy.
I am not sure that the White Paper, which, in particular, addresses this matter from the point of view of introducing more flexibility into the Community framework on aid for regional purposes in the field of transport services, in particular where links with the peripheral regions and the small islands are concerned, has fully appreciated the importance of this crucial matter for the European peoples concerned.
Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, it is gratifying that the Commission is addressing Europe's transport problems seriously. Reducing deaths on the road by 50% is in particular an aim that deserves all our support.
There is no good reason why anyone at all should die on the roads.
Congestion in Central Europe is also a big problem, while in the peripheral regions the worry is safeguarding links with the European markets.
As well as the many good proposals, the White Paper unfortunately contains seriously mistaken evaluations.
The Commission wants to break the link between economic growth and transport growth.
That will not be possible, although we can certainly bring economic growth to a halt.
By easing transport problems we can, without anxiety, allow traffic to increase.
New vehicles will produce up to 90% fewer emissions than those manufactured before 1970.
This is not realised if you only take a blinkered view of the matter.
By abolishing all car registration taxes in Europe and lowering car tax for clean cars we will be able to improve the state of the environment radically.
Another odd proposal is that of freezing the share of the market enjoyed by the different transport modes at 1998 levels.
This is something we might expect from the old Soviet Union's Politburo, but it weakens the Commission's authority very much indeed.
It would be nonsensical to set out to forcibly steer the market share balance in the direction of targets that have been decided in an ivory tower.
We should instead create an equitable situation for competition for all modes of transport.
Let the market itself then decide the natural balance for transport modes.
The third error relates to the harmonisation of labour and social legislation.
Only when it is a question of transport safety is the harmonisation of maximum transportation times appropriate, and then it will be on the condition that the costs and benefits have been closely looked at.
If we make these three mistakes we will be further than ever away from a dynamic Europe.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of its own impossible situation, but our splendid European project deserves better.
Our rigid economy is in need of care, and our self-inflicted sickness is actually not just an imaginary one.
Unfortunately, the Commissioner's medicine seems as if, dare I say so, it had been bought in a bazaar.
Would it not be about time we stopped talking about the European model and sought recipes for success among those who are getting along best?
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for attending this debate.
Behind each of the speeches there is what I believe to be a fundamental concept.
This fundamental concept is the single European transport area, a European area of transport which is not only compatible with European asymmetry but which must actually incorporate it.
Europe is not equal - as Mr Sudre has just said - Europe has certain areas of infrastructure, certain peripheral regions, certain areas of cohesion, certain nuclei - more now, with enlargement - which require extremely considerable promotion, but this is not incompatible with the single European transport area.
A few months ago, Commissioner, this House and the Council approved the sixth framework research programme.
This programme established the single European area of research.
The Commissioner said to European researchers: we have passed the stage of you meeting to tell each other what you are doing and even to cooperate on friendly terms.
It is necessary to create a single European area of research so that all research capacity and effort is focussed on the same projects, has the same objectives and the same territory so that we are not therefore inventing the wheel fifteen times.
Therefore, the European research area is the key to understanding all the speeches which this afternoon may have sounded like a rainbow of views which would be difficult to unite.
But I can assure you that the vote tomorrow will not produce a blurred picture, as may be assumed on the basis of tonight's debate, but a clearly defined one.
You are fortunate, Commissioner, since this Parliament is saying: go ahead, you have the support of Parliament to formulate into directives the issues you have presented to us in the report on the White Paper, and you have certain additional contributions from the European Parliament which may be useful.
Many doors are therefore being opened, and the Council cannot turn a deaf ear to the fundamental demands and the appeal represented by the Transport White Paper that the time has come to take decisions, to create a genuinely European policy, because, in view of this European policy, the effect will be a synergy which will respond to the reticence of those who say that the European Safety Agency will cost money, that the European Transport Fund will not be well used, of those who do not believe that intermodality in one port will benefit the whole of Europe, that investments and corridors, in any area, will benefit around 400 million Europeans once the Union has been enlarged.
Therefore, Commissioner, although there is apparently a rainbow of diversity in this House, I can guarantee that we are very close together.
I will end by thanking all the Members who have participated in this report, because they have offered me many ideas and entirely constructive cooperation.
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo, for the work he has done, all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the quality of the report as a whole, and the various speakers who have spoken on behalf of the different committees during this debate.
I would also like to thank all the Members who have spoken, including those who were highly critical, because I believe they provide colour and variety and above all they communicate feelings and opinions which must be taken into account when we talk about offering solutions in an area which, as Mr Izquierdo said, is so large and diverse and at times so asymmetric as the European area.
I would like to point out that I agree with the honourable Members, and this is clearly spelt out in Mr Izquierdo's report - which I consider to be very balanced - that we are talking about sustainable transport and this requires, to begin with, a competitive transport system.
If we do not create a competitive transport system in Europe, the whole of our industrial fabric, the whole of our productive sector, will suffer.
We must therefore create competitive transport, but at the same time we must take account of society's demands, which are linked to quality of life and respect for the environment.
And this is the not always an easy task we must respond to through our proposals.
I have taken good note of the clear support offered by Mr Izquierdo and Parliament's proposed report.
You have taken your time, but, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not moving any more quickly - let me make this very clear - in expressing its support for modal change, for the opening up of the railways, for the creation of the single sky, for the launch of the Galileo programme, on which it is really urgent that decisions and actions are taken.
Like us, your priorities include safety and the need to respond to the investment needs of the trans-European networks, in particular through charging, where necessary, for the use of infrastructures.
I am also glad that the report insists on the aspects relating to connection with outermost regions, on the economic importance of roads, on the need to reduce traffic - when I talk about the outermost regions I am talking about islands situated several thousand kilometres from continental Europe.
I believe that all these points are very interesting and worthy of our attention and they deserve to be highlighted in this report.
However, I would like to make a few comments with regard to the important points which have been raised here and in the report.
Firstly, the road safety agency.
I fully understand this idea, because it stems from the need to create means of promoting responsibility at all levels to react against the lack of safety on the roads while respecting the principle of subsidiarity and the Commission's right of initiative.
I believe we should consider the steps to be taken in order to achieve this objective.
I hope to be able to provide more detail in the communication on road safety which I will present to you in the near future, but there is little difference between an observatory and an agency.
At the end of the day, they are the same idea.
I would like - in relation the text we are discussing - to make a few comments on competitiveness, respect for the environment and the incorporation of quality of services, safety and quality of life.
Paragraph 9 states that the transfer of goods transport by road to other modes of transport should be promoted by improving the quality of service of these other modes of transport which are more respectful and under no circumstances having a negative impact on the competitiveness of road transport.
I believe that this sentence is fundamental.
Europe cannot afford to make road transport less competitive, since it forms the basis of its economic development, its growth and its international competitiveness.
It is a question of making, for example, the railways as competitive as road transport.
To those who entirely reject the liberalisation of the railways - who are a minority in this Parliament - or the introduction of competition - we are talking more of introducing competition than liberalisation, since this is a highly regulated form of liberalisation - I would say that we know what maintaining the current situation would lead to: to our having railways in museums but not in reality.
I believe we should try to take other routes which have provided good results in other sectors of transport, but I would like to stress this phrase: it is not a question of penalising but of improving the quality of other systems.
The honourable Members also propose the creation of great axes (east-west, north-south) of roads and railways, as laid out in paragraph 36 and others.
I would like to point out that it is a question of incorporating enlargement in terms of the trans-European networks and of exchanges and of this European area in which it is transport that guarantees the reality of a market and the capacity for goods and people to move around throughout this European area.
We must insist on strengthening the railways.
This is a fundamental point and we cannot ignore it.
Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect.
I am aware that it also involves promoting inland waterways, the maritime sector, but in some cases we cannot avoid building new roads because there are areas which still lack road infrastructures.
We must therefore not be dogmatic, but we must have a practical appreciation of the reality of European transport needs.
With regard to the great Fund for financing transport, of course I fully agree with Mr Izquierdo Collado that we need greater European funds in order to provide the support and promotion for the creation of infrastructures, in particular rail infrastructures, and for curing bottle necks in order to improve the use of European infrastructures.
Can it be approached in the way Mr Izquierdo Collado proposes?
I believe, rather, that what we have to do is, within the context of the new financial perspectives whose principle elements will be discussed shortly, raise the need to channel more funds to the trans-European networks.
I believe it is there that we must seek these greater funds, these greater resources, because what is clear is that we need to speed up the process of creating infrastructures.
The funds currently allocated to the trans-European networks are insufficient and we must make progress in this field, because these networks are of benefit and interest to Europe as a whole, regardless of the specific countries they link or cross.
They are of interest at European level because they promote - I would insist - the creation of the internal markets and the integration of the European area itself.
This issue of the EIB: other formulae to bring us closer, of course, and we must also promote public-private participation in funding.
I will shortly present all these issues in that infrastructures package, including charging.
Mr Costa has mentioned this, but I would like to say that charging is discussed in paragraphs 75 and 76 which speak of the simultaneous introduction of a system for setting prices in all modes of transport, both for infrastructures and for the related external costs, and which say that under no circumstances must anybody be penalised but that we must promote a balance and allow cross funding.
Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this approach, with one exception, and that is that cross funding must be restricted to exceptional cases in alternative routes and under no circumstances must cross funding or tolls or charging become a form of generating income from the geographical situation of a country within the European area.
Otherwise we would be returning to medieval times, when, for example, controlling a bridge over a river provided sufficient income to live in luxury and become a member of the gentry.
That is what we must do, establish charging which covers costs, which is destined for infrastructures, the improvement of infrastructures, improvements in road safety, the improvement of the locations where they are collected, and that in certain cases cross funding may be allowed, since it is clearly a good instrument and has led to good results, as for example in the case of the Swiss system.
Before 2004, the Commission will draw up a communication on the transport situation in the candidate countries.
We do not believe that a specific communication is necessary in 2003 because we are going to produce two reports.
Firstly, a complete follow-up report, six months prior to the date of accession, that is, more or less in November 2003, which will examine the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries in all sectors, including transport, and a communication in 2003 on cooperation with the candidate countries and neighbouring countries in the field of trans-European transport networks.
All of this in addition to the report by the van Miert group, which draws up the networks within the context of twenty-seven countries: the pan-European network.
Ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term assessment report in 2005, laid down in the White Paper, will be the perfect opportunity to deal with these concerns and integrate all this information.
Mr President, I will end this long and extremely important debate by once again thanking Mr Izquierdo Collado for this work, which has been serious, balanced and difficult, since it is not easy to unite positions.
In the end, I hope that tomorrow, following what I have heard throughout today's debates, it is clearly established that the key guidelines for transport policy in the European Union for the next ten years is fully reflected in the vote in Parliament.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is actually rather a sad moment.
It will perhaps be after midnight, and one of the most important subjects, affecting hundreds of millions of jobs, is therefore being moved into the night by the Presidency of this Parliament.
I hope that this is not symbolic, Mr President, for the future of the spring European Council that is to take place shortly.
I must, however, say something about the re-use and the commercial exploitation of public information and, in the first place, it is worth stressing once again that the sole purpose of this directive is to bring about minimum harmonisation.
Minimum harmonisation because otherwise nothing will come of any pan-European content services in the public information field.
We know from research, in the United States for example, that there is great potential in, as it were, marketing existing public information.
This is especially true for the very small businesses, the SMEs, which as a result can create a significant number of jobs, and that is precisely what we want.
In the United States we have already seen that this can be done exceptionally well by stimulating re-use, by making this information available at marginal cost.
And the first political question of course is why are we not doing the same in Europe?
We all know that the so-called 3G sector, third generation mobile communication, is in serious difficulty and that we have seldom been in a position to transfer so much money from the private sector to the public sector.
You must therefore at this point in particular try to give this 3G sector every possible chance.
So I think it is extraordinarily wasteful if we make this information available again at a high price because it will mean that these content services will be unable to get off the ground.
I strongly appeal to all our fellow MEPs not only to devote fine words to Lisbon but also actually to take action where they can, and this is a good example.
There was a lot of discussion as to whether or not cultural institutions, universities, research institutions, etc, should be excluded under this directive.
Originally I wanted them included, but in the end we found a compromise to remove them from it and therefore I do not understand why Amendment No 33 is still necessary.
I make an urgent appeal to our socialist friends to withdraw Amendment No 33 because it was originally a compromise amendment but is no longer necessary because I have made the concession.
Mr President, there are still Member States that are trying to build in an extra filter to ensure that everyone has to apply for licences again, etc. This puts an extra barrier in your way, an extra step that you have to take and, for the very small businesses in particular, that is extraordinarily wasteful, so I would say that this must not happen either.
In the report we make a distinction between other information and basic information.
This basic information is information that every citizen needs to be able to function in a normal constitutional state.
You really must be able to make this information available to the citizen free of charge so that this citizen can exercise his normal rights as a citizen.
This additional information must, moreover, be made available at marginal cost. Only then will we be acting progressively.
Why should not this Parliament occasionally be the driving force behind a new development in the field of the information society?
I therefore also make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs to follow me in this direction.
I am now going to take off my rapporteur's hat and make some remarks as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats about Mrs Auroi's and Mr Paasilinna's report.
First of all I want to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work, their sharing of responsibility and above all their effort in producing such an excellent report.
We all know that the 3G sector is in great difficulty - I made reference to it just now - and what is at issue now of course is ensuring that we in Parliament give a signal to the forthcoming European Council so that measures are taken there that take us a step further forward.
We are thinking of measures that are aimed at restoring the confidence of the citizens, but also of the investors so that people know what is going to happen in that field.
I think for example that it would be useful to work towards a situation in which the Member States not only, as at the moment, permit network sharing and thanks to the Commissioner for dedicating himself so much to this but in which it is also realised that 3G is quite a different product from 2G.
It is highly complex. This innovative chain that has to be developed requires a very great deal of investment that the operators cannot provide alone.
So you have to promote collaboration between the operators because otherwise in the end it is the customers - you, Mr President, and I - who will be the ones to suffer.
I therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner to use guidelines to make collaboration between the operators and competition between the services that the operators are going to provide possible.
Because if those devices, those lovely mobile handsets, cannot communicate with one another because there is no interoperability, then we will not make any progress and that is, I think, a crucial point.
I also think it is important to bring the regions where 3G is already in development close together because people learn from one another. This is also a way of preventing people encountering the same pitfalls.
It is very important, Mr President, that we stimulate research so that the present research in relation to 3G does not become concentrated in Japan in particular.
We must not look to the US, we must look at our great setbacks in the field of competition with Japan.
Finally, Mr President, Mr Paasilinna has of course rightly laid stress on the fact that we must have a very robust eEuropean plan that is good for the forthcoming European Council.
I am in favour of prompt and harmonised implementation of the new regulatory framework and I am very pleased that the European Commission has today finally launched the Cyber Security Task Unit.
Not before time, because we all know that security is a major concern.
Bravo to the Commission that it has actually arrived.
I think that we have a package that we can take back to the citizen, that we are moving the 3G sector a long way forward again and that we have a good answer as far as the knowledge economy is concerned because, in this way, we can move Lisbon another step forward.
Mr President March 2002, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is effectively eEurope that is in the hot seat this evening, if I may say so, and I shall in particular address the full roll-out of third-generation mobile communications.
The debate has been very poorly organised, Commissioner, for we began with the Van Velzen report, which is mainly complementary insofar as it concerns information that will be added to third-generation GSMs, such as meteorological information or information on roads provided by the public sector.
All things considered, it does not matter very much since, furthermore, the aim of third-generation GSMs is also to avoid the digital divide, which Mr Paasilinna will strongly criticise.
All in all, therefore, it is perfectly normal for us to have this kind of joint debate.
It should perhaps be pointed out that the March 2002 Barcelona Council stated: 'Technological convergence affords all business and citizens new opportunities for access to the Information Society.
Digital television and third-generation mobile communications (3G) will play a key role in providing widespread access to interactive services'.
This sector of the third generation, however, seems to be in difficulties.
Perhaps, in order to avoid the digital divide and to avoid breaking the continuity of eEurope, it should be said that 3G services must be established within a global framework, but we must also add the important issues of consumer health and environmental quality.
We must also learn from the experience of the current GSM market in order to avoid reproducing the mistakes that might have been made in the past.
One key aspect of mobile telephony development is the interoperability of terminals.
In this area, the Commission would point out that progress was made in the development of 3G terminals in 2002.
The first models are ready.
They are also ready in China, and I am pointing this out to you because we received this information last week.
Furthermore, the existing 2G networks have been modernised to make them 2.5G.
Some technical problems may persist, but we can say that everything is working.
With regard to the market situation, the current availability of 3G services in Europe is not clear.
They are available in Japan, but the operators are confident, and, after all, since around 50 operators are capable of offering these services, the problem of competition is solved. It can exist.
With regard to regulatory issues, the Commission would point out that the procedure for granting 3G licences has begun in all the countries of the European Union.
This number of licences is sufficient.
There is therefore no problem as far as the competitive environment is concerned.
Following discussions with the parties concerned with the introduction of 3G mobile communications, a consensus was reached on three points.
First of all, the introduction phase for 3G services does not require legislative intervention. Market forces must be allowed to take effect.
Secondly, 3G communications will, in the long term, have to become one of the platforms for services provided by a global Information Society.
Lastly, the public authorities must provide constant support in the introduction process.
Three factors have therefore been identified: a stable, harmonised, transparent regulatory environment, taking account of consumer interests; the proactive supporting role that the Union can play and, thirdly, long-term initiatives, taking account of what has happened in the 3G communications sector, in particular with a view to enlargement.
We therefore need to increase coordination of all these decisions.
The Commission believes that no changes will be required in the granting of licences and that the period of validity of licences will not be altered in the short term.
The legislation does, however, require clarification in terms of network infrastructure sharing.
As rapporteur, I therefore feel that the Commission has judged the matter correctly in terms of the economy, but that a number of points should have been added.
This technology is expensive and could be rivalled, for example, by WiFi, which means that today, it is not clear whether 3G communications will take over part of what information technology is currently doing or if, on the contrary, information technology will gradually replace what GSMs are doing.
Ultimately, it is the market that will decide, but it is good to raise the question and be prepared.
Generally speaking, access to 3G services must be clear to all and users with difficulties must be protected; for example, children and people with disabilities might need specific packages.
Lastly, secure payment must be protected, or the consumer will have no confidence in this system.
I shall now discuss the precautionary principle, which Members from the right, furthermore, wanted to dispose of.
I want to discuss the health problems that can arise, for they are now raised by numerous scientists.
A consensual request was made that the requirements of the World Health Organisation should at least be respected at European level.
We are told that this is now the case, but it still remains to be verified.
Lastly, the construction of 3G aerial repeaters should take place with due respect for the environment and land use planning.
The Member States will ensure that authorisations from the land use planning departments are subject to a clear procedure and a public enquiry.
Four to sixteen times more aerials are needed for third-generation communications than for 2G.
Colocation or aerial sharing, as recommended by the Commission, is therefore extremely important.
In conclusion, regulatory stability will enable this technology to develop smoothly if the European Union gives the same importance to social and environmental parameters as to economic parameters.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would in fact like to thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent levels of cooperation.
We are now giving the Council a clear message, and, hopefully, an impetus no longer to dally in this area.
I would like to speak more about the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Van Velzen.
It is a very important start and represents a crucial change in the development of the information society.
It is perhaps a good idea to have confidence in the words he spoke, which were truly appropriate.
The information society sector is a major employer and a factor which unites us all in Europe as a whole in a completely new way.
Its development will bring with it significant economic, political and cultural opportunities.
Confidence in the sector, however, has plummeted and we know the reason why, as we have spoken about it so many times.
It is the result of auctions and general uncertainty.
Although digitalisation and networking offer a wide variety of opportunities for development, they have also led to a worldwide gulf between the people of prosperous countries and developing countries.
Furthermore, the gender divide, for example with regard to students, is huge and is particularly pronounced in the rural areas of the Union and in the developing countries.
In addition the introduction of information technology has led to the restructuring of job descriptions: many jobs have gone and some middle-aged people have had to give up work.
Furthermore, those groups which are in a weaker position are at risk of becoming doubly discriminated against.
They are being left outside the information society. I do not see any easy alternatives here: it is our biggest challenge.
The network has also become a political implement.
It increases opportunities for civil action and hopefully also opportunities for influence.
I am pleased with the Commission's eEurope 2005 Action Plan, as with it we will increase investment, aim to create jobs, and give everyone the opportunity to participate in the information society.
I also urge the Commission to speed up the introduction of third generation mobile communications and eliminate the technical and administrative barriers there are in the sector.
The Member States themselves should adhere to a flexible approach to the purchase of frequencies and the costs incurred in creating the necessary infrastructure, and do so speedily in a new way.
The Member States should offer their citizens sufficient Internet time, which is to say participation in the information society.
The Commission should research the possibilities of developing voice-controlled services.
These will shortly be available and will make it easier for all of us to use the Internet.
I would also ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities of adult education in the sector and whether a general diploma might also be required to move on to the next stages of the technology.
Likewise, Member States should support SMEs and help them get online, as they represent major potential for increased employment.
Perhaps there would be a need too for funds to be established in the Member States to help socially excluded groups to become integrated into the networked society.
In my opinion it is good that the Commission has now established a cybersecurity task force.
It is now three years since the Lisbon strategy was created and it has met with political and economic uncertainty.
We are seeing developments, but they are not fast enough or adequately coordinated.
In the last six years we have seen around a million new jobs created a year, although last year the figure was only around half a million.
What sort of economic know-how can be achieved when training, education and research are neglected as much as they are today and many Member States do not observe agreed rules or implement agreed projects?
Commissioner, what could you do so that certain Member States do not slow down development in this sector?
It might turn out that a number of Member States will establish their own sort of 'Information Society Europe' among themselves unless we involve all Member States in this development.
Finally I would say that the transference of social information and knowledge to the network in digitised form, which Mr Van Velzen's report highlighted, will create a completely new stage in the development of the information society.
It will create work and opportunities, but problems too.
The protection of privacy is not the least of these, but when society's functions are online we will be in a situation where we can say that the information society has come about insofar as we are all in it together.
. Mr President, first of all thank you to Commissioner Liikanen, it is a pleasure to see you here.
I always think of him as the Commissioner for innovation who is friendly to SMEs, and I have certainly found him to be both of those, so we are very lucky to have him.
The Lisbon European Council dream for the EU to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 cannot be realised unless we stimulate and I mean stimulate SMEs.
SMEs drive economic growth; they train people with poor skills; they identify local needs and respond by producing or processing the products required.
They create employment, wealth and security for the local community.
What are the hindrances, difficulties and bottlenecks facing SMEs in the EU?
Why are they not growing as fast as those in the USA?
Excessive red tape, high direct and indirect taxation, expensive and inadequate access to loans and grants, insufficient allowance for 'upskilling' workers and a lack of sponsored apprenticeships.
Papas and Mamas in Europe in their fifties and sixties own and manage their businesses traditionally.
They are reluctant to invest in new technology because, firstly, they suspect that the investment will not offer sufficient advantage.
Secondly, they do not understand the scope and function of new technology in increasing productivity and expanding sales.
Thirdly, they are concerned about security of supply, quality, payment and legal liability.
My report has analysed the problems facing SMEs and offers a programme of action to stimulate them, so that they can compete globally.
I would like Commissioner Liikanen to take very careful note of this summary, which is what I think the EU needs to do and do now.
Review existing regulation of the e-economy and cut drastically whatever burdens small businesses.
Reduce the administrative burdens on businesses by simplifying data collection, especially tax collection.
Cut red tape, especially for self-employed people.
Tackle on-line security issues by reinforcing the dependability and reliability of networks used by enterprises.
Establish easy and affordable access to legal advice.
Encourage cross-border trade to ensure a European e-economy.
That is very important.
Use benchmarking to promote and establish best practice, to integrate SMEs in the e-economy.
Allow Member States to offer low interest loans and tax incentives to support SMEs.
I know Commissioner Monti might have a problem with that but I think it is essential.
Establish close cooperation between business, the educational sector and government agencies in order to close the IT skills gap.
One of the most important aspects is to offer financial incentives to the unemployed and the elderly, those who are retired.
I am not asking Member States to change their rules on retirement, but I am asking for the EU to consider that people who are already retired should have financial incentives to train and acquire skills.
When they work using those skills they should not be taxed at all, that is my preference.
You might wish to impose a nominal tax, but preferably no tax at all.
This actually reduces the import of labour, and also immediately pumps in money to people who are likely to spend their money in rural areas and therefore boost rural economies.
To offer financial incentives to technical support companies to allow SMEs affordable access.
This is one of the weakest things that we have in the EU: people are quite happy to buy equipment and technology, but where is the technical support if anything goes wrong?
It is very expensive and very unreliable and we need to offer financial incentives in that respect.
I hope we will soon have every EU citizen wearing what I would like to call the 'Hand C' not a 'PC', a wristwatch that is a combination of a PC, mobile phone and an LCD screen that will enable us to communicate audiovisually, process data, buy, sell and pay by voicemail, watch any sport and listen to our favourite music.
Technology can offer us this today, Commissioner Liikanen, let us produce more with ease, let us have less stress and more fun.
. Mr President, I am happy to see everyone with an interest in this field here tonight.
I dream of a day when we can discuss this issue in the daytime - it may come.
Information and communication technologies are a powerful source of growth and productivity gains, which contribute to improving our living standards.
That is why the recovery of the sector is so important at this point in time.
The five reports which the House will deal with today and tomorrow give us the opportunity to keep the political momentum towards the achievement of the Lisbon agenda, as many honourable Members have said today.
These reports also contribute to the process of building confidence in the ICT sector.
Allow me first of all to thank all the rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen, Mrs Auroi, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Khanbhai and Mrs Read, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and political groups for their thorough work on these Commission communications and proposals.
I am also pleased to have the opportunity to inform you that the Commission adopted four important documents today. These are: a communication on the situation in the telecoms sector; a draft regulation establishing a European Network and Information Security Agency, as has been mentioned here; the final report on eEurope 2002 and the Recommendation on Relevant Markets.
I hope you find them in your computers when you return to your offices.
Let me reiterate our common commitment to an efficient and timely implementation of the new regulatory framework.
The framework will stimulate investment and thus promote facility-based competition, which is, in the medium to long-term, the best guarantee for sustained consumer benefits, innovation, and investment.
With the recommendation on relevant markets we aim to give legal certainty and to help restore confidence to the sector.
Let me come back to the themes of tonight and say a few words first on the report on 3G.
Mrs Auroi's report, as adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, sends an important signal at a time when the first 3G services are about to be launched.
At this juncture, 3G deployment is clearly a priority.
We need to encourage solutions which favour a quick deployment of networks while also accommodating environmental needs.
In today's communication on the situation in the telecoms sector, the Commission calls for a series of actions to overcome barriers to 3G deployment.
Amongst these is the clarification of network infrastructure sharing, the importance of which was also emphasised in the report.
Information to the citizens on the health aspects related to mobile communications and continued research are important.
Scientific findings need to be made broadly available. The Commission will promote the diffusion of information, for example through a specific web site.
The World Health Organisation is the leading authority in this area, and we are working closely with it.
Finally, I would like to stress the importance of 3G in the context of access to open and interoperable platforms.
This is to increase consumers' choice and thus to contribute to the establishment of an information society for all.
Inclusiveness is an overriding principle in eEurope 2005.
The Commission is committed to pursuing action toward openness and interoperability of platforms, as so clearly requested by Parliament.
Let me briefly reiterate the main objectives of the eEurope 2005 action plan. eEurope sets out to stimulate the demand-supply cycle by, on the demand side, promoting content, services and applications, where there is a crucial role for online public services - eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning - as well as for eBusiness.
This will stimulate and is stimulated by the supply side, by enabling the widespread availability and use of multi-platform and secure broadband.
It is vital to ensure an inclusive information society. Therefore we are promoting multi-platform access which includes digital television, 3G mobile, PCs, kiosks and whatever terminals are available.
I am pleased to see that Mr Paasilinna's report gives such strong support to the main ideas of the eEurope Action Plan.
We fully share the view that guaranteeing broadband connections at an affordable price, which is essential for a competitive and dynamic economy, requires decisive actions from Member State governments.
Mr Paasilinna asked how we could accelerate access for the Member States.
We continue to carry out rigorous reporting and benchmarking of the activities.
At the same time, we have launched two presentations of European best practice in eGovernment and eHealth.
We will nominate these best practices and ensure they are widely diffused among the public authorities in all Member States.
In our recently adopted communication on the situation in the telecoms sector we call upon Member States to commit to putting their national broadband strategy in place by the end of this year.
As Mr Khanbhai's report on the impact of eEconomy notes, SMEs are key drivers of economic growth and should be encouraged actively to engage in the eEconomy.
I broadly share the views presented in Mr Khanbhai's report, for example, the need for SMEs to have easy access to legal advice on applicable law and on ICT and eBusiness skills.
We agree that European businesses, and especially SMEs, need support in 'going digital'.
The Commission is currently working together with the Member States to set a new policy framework for eBusiness policies for SMEs, including potential quantitative targets.
Network security has become a major policy concern and therefore a central issue in the eEurope 2005 action plan.
Parliament's position on this matter of October last year was very much appreciated.
As I mentioned earlier, the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on the Agency.
The Commission is also committed, through eEurope 2005, to promote a wider access to and greater participation in the benefits of the information society, particularly for disadvantaged groups.
In addition to the specific measures foreseen by the MODINIS programme itself, the Commission intends to promote and sustain several initiatives which will be organised in the context of the European Year for Disabled and which will follow from its earlier communication on website accessibility.
eEurope 2005 will be implemented in part through MODINIS and, though it is not part of our debate today, I would like also to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission proposal, in particular as far as the budget is concerned.
Let me now turn to the piece of legislation which we now have on the table: the directive on the re-use of public sector information.
As Mr Van Velzen said today and as he underlines in his report, the content is essential for further development of the information society.
The message here is clear and it comes at a time when the financial constraints in the sector bring attention to the fact that public sector information is a key content resource throughout information society services.
The key elements are transparency of procedures and of conditions for re-use, non-discrimination and fair competition.
The directive will stimulate the creation of information services based upon, or incorporating, public sector information.
It is important for the content industries and also for the telecoms sector, which needs to find ways to generate content for 3G services.
I fully share the opinion of Mr Van Velzen that the operators should work together to create a marketplace.
We need cooperation and interoperability to create a market which can convince the consumers.
Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members for this important debate and for their contribution to the whole process since we started work on the telecoms framework.
Thank you Commissioner.
I too hope that the debate will take place during the day next time.
It will be better for the Chairman too.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight that the amendments presented by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms have been accepted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and, in particular, the demand in Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for good administration and access to the texts of the institutions (this corresponds to Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms).
The promotion of free computer programs is an option increasingly used by public administrations and which democratises access to and the use of public documents and data.
In fact, if we make the documents available in a format not linked to the use of specific computer programs involving payment, we reduce the discrimination relating to the wealth of the users.
It is important to promote the use of the information by people with diminished sensory capacity, for example through a textual description of the graphs and pictures contained in the documents.
Furthermore, the advertising of all generally accessible documents, including those relating to judicial and administrative procedures, must reach the public sector.
This is a fundamental instrument for the development of the right of citizens to knowledge and a fundamental principle of democracy.
This objective is applicable to institutions at all levels, local, national and international, and furthermore it is necessary for the public administrations, whatever their institutional level, to promote and support the reuse of the information provided.
I would end by stressing that we naturally believe that all these principles should also apply to the European institutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to make a few remarks on the Auroi report.
Before I do anything else, of course, I should like to thank the rapporteur very much for her draft report and also for her willingness to incorporate into it amendments proposed by other Members.
The mobile communications industry is in a bad way.
In comparison with Japan, 3G technology is coming on stream only very slowly.
We must also do all we can at European level to support this sector.
This is about having reliable framework conditions, which means consistent implementation and application of the telecommunications package, exercising restraint where regulation is concerned and of course also using common resources.
All of this is, as you know, also provided for in the Commission's paper.
This being the case, I do find it rather regrettable that prices for international roaming and call termination should be regulated, as is already the case in the United Kingdom, for example.
In this regard, I am also curious, Commissioner, about the recommendation on the relevant markets, which you also mentioned briefly and which is - if I am not mistaken - to be presented tomorrow.
Although consumers benefit from the reasonable charges that regulation brings, they only do so in the short term.
In the long term it is to the detriment of everyone if we do not make every effort to strengthen the sector, to promote 3G services and thus also to create jobs in the medium term.
Against this background, a broad majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supported this report and the promotion of 3G.
This report is a clear vote in favour of the introduction of third generation mobile communications in the European Union.
I should now like to offer a few thoughts on the Van Velzen report on the re-use and exploitation of public-sector documents.
Of course I must first express my very special thanks to Mr Van Velzen for the work that he has done as rapporteur.
He has displayed a great deal of commitment to his report and once again this has borne fruit in the form of a good report.
Like the majority of the Committee on Industry I too share the view that in principle public information should be made available for the benefit of all parties.
The authorities in the Member States have huge quantities of information that has been collected over long periods of time.
Members of the public and businesses should also benefit from this treasure trove of information, whose commercial value is difficult to put a figure on.
I am confident that general access to public information will give a significant boost to growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union.
But despite all of the agreement expressed in the debate so far, I am still missing an essential point.
It will come as no surprise if I repeat what I have already said on many occasions in the committee: must Europe really take action here?
Is not the issue of determining the conditions under which and the extent to which public information is made available a matter for the Member States?
For my part, I do not see that there is any legal basis for harmonisation in this field.
The old saying is true here that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe.
This is also why several of the German members of my group will be voting against the report.
I might also remind you that the issue of delimiting competences is also proving to be significant in the debate that is currently ongoing in the Convention.
If we are always going to have such little regard for the competences issue here in the committees and in our day-to-day parliamentary work then I do not think that this bodes well.
I would crave your indulgence when I say that although I agree with the content of this report, I, along with my fellow German members of my group will not be supporting it in the final vote.
Mr President, I congratulate all four rapporteurs, who have worked long and hard on their dossiers.
I also welcome my fellow veterans of information technology debates.
We might have to award ourselves a Lisbon medal for stamina at some stage.
I take your point about the timing of this debate.
We in this Parliament should be ashamed that the signal sent out to those few who are listening at this time of night is one of a lack of seriousness on our part.
We need to join together and make serious protests in the future.
I should like, first of all, to comment on Mr Van Velzen's report on reuse of public information.
I commend him on the amount of work he has put into this.
What is important about this proposal?
First of all, it is important that progress be made.
What has become very clear to me as I have shadowed this report is what an important economic engine reuse of public information is going to be. We need to make sure that progress is made on that.
Secondly, it is important to support the exemptions included in the Commission proposal for universities, libraries and museums across the European Union.
We want that exemption to continue.
The third thing of importance is to ensure a reasonable return on investment.
I have listened carefully to what the rapporteur had to say.
I want the amendment in the name of my group - Amendment No 33 - to stand.
It clarifies Parliament's position.
I hope this will be supported.
A reasonable return on investment is important and should be taken into consideration.
I understand there is likely to be a major second reading and quite a lot of work to be done at Council level.
No doubt we will be able to return to this at a later stage.
I would now like to turn to the report by Mr Paasilinna who, with his customary thoroughness and ability to make practical proposals, has come up with some well-thought-out ideas on education, health, disabled citizens and the elderly, and the importance of ensuring access for rural areas and small businesses.
All of that is to be commended.
Mr Khanbhai, who does not seem to be here, ended his speech by saying that he wanted to have fun.
I am not sure how much fun he thinks is associated with debates held at this time of night on this subject.
He is right in one respect: as important as this for business, it is also important in terms of the quality of people's lives and what they do with their leisure time.
Mrs Auroi had a very difficult task. I congratulate her.
In terms of her work, I should like to stress the importance of 3G companies and technologies being soundly managed and well run.
That has not always been the case on a global scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I congratulate all the rapporteurs on reports that in my view are relevant for the development of eEurope and an information society for all.
With regard to the Van Velzen report there are two things I would like to stress.
Re-use and commercial exploitation of public information, as proposed by the rapporteur, will lead to a real information society for all.
Where basic information such as the wording of acts and jurisprudence is concerned, this must be made available to the European citizen free of charge.
After all, as a taxpayer he or she has already paid for this information. We do not allow our citizens to pay for the same thing twice.
Furthermore, good information is necessary for the functioning of a democratic constitutional state.
In my opinion we as a Parliament must fight hard for the rights of the citizens.
Public information must therefore be made available to the citizens free of charge or at marginal cost for reproduction and distribution.
As a group we fully support the line of rapporteur Van Velzen.
This brings me to my second point.
Some Members are in favour of allowing certain government institutions to charge a reasonable return on investment because their income comes in part from the publication of their data, such as weather forecasts or maps.
Of course this is possible where added value is a factor.
There is provision for this in the exceptions.
The unthinking inclusion in the directive of allowing a reasonable return on investment to be made seems highly dangerous to me.
Because the question is, what is reasonable?
Is it 10, 20 or 30% profit and do our citizens have to pay that?
It is also important that the same conditions prevail in all the Member States.
Subsidiarity in this case is fundamentally wrong.
This is because we need a level playing field, only then can the internal market for public information be achieved.
To go through that last point: this directive must promote the reuse and the exploitation of public information.
The government must therefore act as a booster, that is as a launching customer, to make this information available at low cost to give small and medium-sized businesses the opportunity to exploit this information so that a good market develops for it, as in the United States.
Because a market that is controlled by monopolists as now does not lead to more jobs and greater prosperity.
Turning now to 3G.
It has already been said that the transfer of billions from the private sector to the public sector has been disastrous for the mobile telecoms sector.
This means that we do not need to impose any unnecessary regulation now.
Intervention may however be necessary to guarantee competition.
Even then though we must ensure a level playing field.
No unilateral measures by Member States to lighten the load of the mobile operators.
We cannot have a situation in which France gives discounts on licences and other Member States renew licences.
I think that the Commission must bring forward clear measures to guarantee that level playing field.
Finally, a word about the Khanbhai and Paasilinna reports, because they make a contribution to the eEurope that we here in the Parliament favour, to ensure that citizens and businesses can profit fully from the information society.
This has happened too little to date.
It is true that in Lisbon in 2000 we agreed that we must be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in 2010, but these appear to be nothing more than fine words that require urgent conversion into deeds.
In practice it seems that over and over again the Member States are falling back on their own national hobby horses, be it a question of the European patent or of access to public information.
That is why it is good that the Commission is keeping its finger on the pulse and keeping the minds of the leaders of the Member States on the matter.
The basic principles are excellent, but when it comes to the implementation of the applications, such as e-health, e-government and e-learning, then it is shameful to see what is actually happening.
I wish us all, Parliament and Commission, success in the realisation of a better eEurope.
Mr President, Commissioner, first I shall look for and I intend to find those responsible for the third generation mobile communications recession.
The guilty parties are the governments of those countries that organised radio spectrum auctions and transferred the money companies in the sector had invested to themselves.
The action taken by the public authorities to alleviate this slump in investment has not been sufficiently effective.
Authorisation has been granted for installations of equipment to coexist side by side for common use, but that is all.
Consequently, the slump in investment in third generation mobile communications continues, and the pious hopes for the ambitious targets set in Feira, Lisbon, Barcelona and Seville are not realised.
More realistic targets should be set.
Now I have made my protests I would like to say thank you.
Mr Paasilinna's report has focused attention on an information society for all, and on the important reason for the Action Plan: the information society must be brought within the reach of everyone, and I mean everyone.
That is democracy.
This democracy must be promoted through public investment.
In addition to the technical tools and fast connections we have to give attention to user instructions and guidance, because equipment is no use if the information society actors cannot use it.
I would like to remind Mr Van Velzen of something in the explanatory statement of his report, which mentions that for the work of public institutions to continue it is essential that they can also calculate a charge for information provided, to offset the investment needed to produce certain databases.
Basic information services must be free of charge or at least inexpensive, but historical investment must also be taken into account in the production costs involved in the re-use of, for example, land register, museum, university and research institute databases.
Our group supports the amendment tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which takes this matter into consideration, and we hope than Mr Van Velzen can show his support for preserving general use services with user charges without them having to be financed out of taxes.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I have already observed on other occasions, issues involving the information society must be at the forefront of the concerns and the actions of the European Union and the Community bodies.
This is one of the great issues of the future and one that offers the greatest opportunities, multiplied by our common efforts.
It is not by chance that following the action plan eEurope 2002, we are already looking towards eEurope 2005, specifically in order to fulfil the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, held under the presidency of my country and later on, those of Barcelona and Seville.
What we want, it should be remembered, is to make the European Union the most competitive society in the world and it is also for this reason that the action plan eEurope 2005 was drawn up, with the purpose of providing an environment that favours private investment and job creation, of boosting productivity, modernising public services and giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society.
In this joint debate, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Paasilinna on his magnificent work, which is clearly reflected in the consensus with which this report has been received here in plenary.
In particular I appreciated his approach to providing the technical means necessary to implement these aims, for example extending bandwidth and multichannel distribution, and on the delicate problem of security of information.
Moving onto the issue of the re-use and commercial exploitation of public sector documents, I understand and share the vision proposed by Mr Van Velzen, who recommends a broadly streamlining approach.
I also think that everything concerned with basic information, related to the democratic rule of law, must be available free of charge and the remaining information should be available at a marginal cost that would not exceed the aggregate costs of their reproduction and dissemination, without prejudice to the specific system to be defined by the public cultural sector for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright.
To conclude, I should like to refer briefly to the report by Mr Khanbhai, in order to congratulate him too on his work and to express the wish that the Commission enjoys full success in the actions it is recommending to ensure that EU businesses can harness the potential benefits of the eEconomy.
Speeding up the construction of a clear and predictable framework for ecommerce, promoting the full participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the economy, improving the availability of venture capital and market finance, etc., are several actions intended to make the aim of an information society for all a reality and to ensure that in this crucial field too, the ambitious aims of the Lisbon strategy are pursued and achieved.
Mr President, despite the late hour it has been a refreshing debate.
It is important and good that we have gathered together so many excellent rapporteurs.
I thank them all for tackling different aspects of the subject.
I reflect on the Commissioner's news that he has now given us another four reports to work on. We need to think about the most efficient way of making an input into the process.
I congratulate Mr Van Velzen and Mr Paasilinna, who are both here tonight, on the initiative of the hearing we had the other week in which the Commissioner participated.
We have a shared interest in moving the knowledge economy forward.
What we are talking about today is the tools, the means and the framework in which we do that.
I have detected a bit of gloom among a number of colleagues.
However, it is worth reflecting on the fact that within weeks we will have the first commercial third generation services in a major country.
They will be provided by a new investor in the market, not in any way connected with any of the incumbent companies.
A new investor has made a commercial investment in the marketplace.
Let us remind ourselves that the knowledge economy will be driven by private investment.
That is where the bulk of the money is going to come from.
The innovation and the technology are going to come from there as well.
None of us know how and in what ways that technology is going to develop.
But I think we can make one certain prediction: in a few years' time - about the most accurate forecast - we can expect that more people across Europe and the world will be connected to the Internet through a wireless device than through any other mechanism.
That is the importance of third generation.
Let us not underestimate it.
The move to the third generation is going to open up new markets for small and large businesses.
It will also take cost out of businesses and will help businesses do things differently.
In Japan I have been to the research laboratories of DoCoMo, the Japanese telecoms company, where they have people inventing third generation commercial applications.
Let us remember, above all, that what we must do as politicians is to let the market work.
We have the right legal framework, but we have to make sure that the regulators do not intervene too soon or too harshly, and that they allow the creativity of the market to work.
That is what has been successful in mobiles so far.
That is what will be successful in third generation.
That is what will power the knowledge economy.
That is the most crucial message that we must all remember.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can but welcome the convergence of these reports, which seek to further Europe's progress towards a new phase of technological development, in a highly specific manner.
Perhaps, however, it is not just the market that will benefit, as has just been maintained.
I believe that the benefit will lie in the development of this Information Society into a society that is equally focused on the human dimension.
The Information Society towards which we are moving is, without a doubt, a society that makes intensive use of information technology networks and produces a large amount of innovative communication services and information.
It is also, however, a society in which the risks of exclusion are many.
Ignoring these new developments at an individual level means taking the risk of suffering the consequences.
Collectively, it means running the risk of whole segments of the population falling by the wayside.
This progress does also provide opportunities for development.
Information and knowledge are the raw material in this society and the source of new wealth.
Creating a link between them to make them accessible means increasing the existing potential for innovation.
It is essential, however, for the European Union's public policy to keep pace with the development of these markets and harness the benefits of this development.
First and foremost, therefore, we must ensure that no citizen is excluded from the Information Society, since, to some extent, taking action with regard to public services and the public interest, in a way, involves using information technology in community and spatial development.
By making available to all the means for active participation and considering access to it as a citizens' right and an obligation of general interest for the Member States, we can ensure that this Information Society is actually created for the citizens and around the citizens.
A fair Information Society is therefore created methodically and patiently with decisive strategies. These are essential elements if we are to ensure that 2010 is not merely a technological mirage.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, scientific progress has been nothing short of miraculous over the past decade, especially in information technology.
Under different circumstances, this progress might translate into prosperity for society as a whole.
Under the capitalist system, however, scientific progress serves the market, not society.
Science develops within a framework that requires what were once public-sector services - welfare, health, even culture and education - to be privatised and commercialised, throttled by the most competitive knowledge-based society decided on by the European Union in Lisbon.
In short, it becomes a source of profit for the few, rather than a source of prosperity for the many.
Under these circumstances, the positive points in the Paasilinna report are of little practical value to disadvantaged social groups in danger of remaining excluded from the information society.
If remote regions, disabled people and so on run these risks, what can we say about the mass unemployed, the mass underemployed, the even bigger mass of the poorly paid?
What value, for example, are telematics health services or the famous European health card to these people?
Who will be able to offer these services?
The family doctor or the multinational companies that keep plundering the health sector?
Will developing third generation services or European operational systems resolve the problem?
Finally, I must comment on the proposal to create a market in public records.
In the European Union, where everything is bought and sold, where a radio frequency market and even a market in atmospheric pollutants and polluting rights have been created, we now have a public records market.
I admire the Commission's entrepreneurial inventiveness and wonder what the next victim of the market will be?
Perhaps the very air we breathe?
Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the four rapporteurs for their work on these reports.
This comes at a very important time.
Many colleagues have already spoken with regard to the detail of what is contained in these reports and our aspirations for the future.
Nowadays we often hear the claim that the world is at your fingertips: one click and you have access to the whole world.
For a lot of people, that one click is like trying to climb Everest because they have not been brought up in the information technology age and they have no access to education or training to ensure that they can make use of this wonderful new tool.
Also, a lot of the services that should be provided for people on the Internet are not provided.
I speak in particular of people with disabilities, those who have hearing difficulties who could have text messages brought to them, or those who are blind who should have access to voice-activated messages.
A lot of these new technologies are too expensive for ordinary users to get access to.
When we look at the overall context of this new vista of the knowledge economy and at the opportunities it presents, there are opportunities, but the risk that we run is, because of the huge amounts of money required in investment and infrastructure, unless governments and other agencies are involved, along with private financing, then peripheral and rural areas will lose out on access to these opportunities.
One of the school initiatives was that there should be one computer for every 15 pupils.
Fortunately in Ireland we have succeeded in this respect: we are now above that average.
We have one computer for every 12 pupils and every pupil has email access, Internet access and knowledge-based education in their school curriculum every day.
On the healthcare side, one important development that can take place is the delivery of health services to rural and peripheral areas.
This particularly applies to islands, where it is not simple or easy to get the kind of technology or the kind of expertise that linking up with the nearest major hospital - with a consultant at one end and the local doctor or nurse at the other end - can provide.
This way they can give assistance rather than having to transport people over long distances.
The last point that I would like to make is with regard to 3G.
I am very aware of the comments that Malcolm Harbour made in his speech and I agree with him, there is huge potential with regard to 3G.
We have already seen the huge explosion in the use of mobile technology.
However, the costs involved and the amount of money that is being lost by companies bidding for 3G licences will eventually pass on to the consumer, unless we take control and take charge of ensuring that there is proper regulation of the charges for those services.
Mr President, I think this is an exciting debate, and I think our rapporteurs have done a quite outstanding piece of work that has also been duly recognised.
I have a couple of remarks relating to the use and re-use of public information.
Some countries have made much more progress than others in this respect, and this clearly reflects a difference that also finds expression in, for example, the transparency with which countries operate.
One example that might be mentioned is the significant interest shown in Denmark in a certain mayor's restaurant and travel bills. Since everyone in Denmark has access to such documents, simply by asking to see them, there were too many people who asked to see them.
The documents were therefore posted on the Internet so that any citizen could see each and every original document there.
In the case of the commissioners or their colleagues, I do not believe we have access to the particulars of their work and travel or of the items they use. In Denmark, however, we do have access to this kind of information relating to such people and, in this connection, the Internet is used, and it is made available free of charge.
A long list of 'services' use the same data again and again, and this is made available to people, who can in that way update it themselves and, for example, automatically change their tax payments and such like.
Why is this kind of data made available free of charge, and why is such use of the Internet encouraged?
For two reasons.
Firstly, the more that people do for themselves, the faster the responses they receive and the fewer civil servants we have to employ.
Secondly, society has a huge interest in this data's being used and re-used, for we cannot count upon having a sufficient number of civil servants in the future to carry out these tasks.
Data can be made available free of charge, moreover, because the public savings are as substantial as they are.
I too have been a mayor and I am therefore curious to know whether this was a specific case or whether all the mayors were in this situation.
I am not, however, asking you to respond now.
You can tell me individually another time.
Mr President, I congratulate all the rapporteurs for their work on these reports.
They have become one of the EU's top priorities.
Their aim to adopt existing policies and legislation and turn them into global strategies is commendable.
However, for this to take place, all Member States need to come together to ensure universally interactive public services, hopefully thereby facilitating the information society and guaranteeing equal public access to information.
Mr Paasilinna's action plan has very laudable aims in incorporating eGovernment, eLearning, eHealth and eBusiness.
The objective of creating a competitive economy based on information will have a significant impact on growth, productivity, employment and social cohesion in Europe.
It is one that I support wholeheartedly and has been much heralded as a main EU priority.
However, we need to recognise that progress in this area has been far too slow.
We need to make a much bigger impact than we have to date.
We need to explore how we can have greater participation and ensure that we do not have a two-speed Europe nor an information underclass.
I very much support what Mr Paasilinna said.
Concerning Mr Van Velzen's report on the re-use of public information, this can be a critical and very important economic driver, creating added value products and services and new prosperity for businesses, especially SMEs.
In my area, the West Midlands, many SMEs are looking for this kind of information.
However, as Mr Van Velzen said, we need to eliminate the obstacles and create a level playing field across the Union.
I have worked in the public sector for a considerable length of time. I am concerned about placing an unreasonable burden on public bodies.
Therefore I would urge that there be a provision for a reasonable return on investment.
We face a dilemma as, on the one hand, we need to encourage businesses and on the other hand, businesses want information at little or no cost.
We have to ensure that these costs do not fall at the door of the public bodies who have an obligation to produce, but have limited scope for manoeuvrability.
I also very much support what Mrs Read said on this and would go along with her.
Mr President, Commissioner, when speaking of the information society we should remember that a large-scale reform of communications market law has just been undertaken with new legislative norms being created for the telecommunications and other network business.
The Member States are just now putting the package into effect.
This debate cannot be allowed to distort the picture of telecommunications legislation, which would only cause uncertainty for investment in third generation mobile communications.
We must help the troubled third generation mobile communications business, not restrain it.
The GSM communications business, which has grown considerably in five years, is the cornerstone of our competitiveness and virtually the only thing driving the Lisbon strategy along.
Following the disaster over the financial exploitation of third generation mobile communications we have to show we are jointly responsible.
The mobile phone industry is a major employer representing the cutting edge of innovation.
There has to be a new upswing in the sector; otherwise, the Japanese will leave us behind once and for all.
I made a point of investigating the claim regarding an increase in brain cancers in Finland since the 1990s.
Whilst the base station network has grown phenomenally, the figures for cancer in Finland have fallen radically.
It is hard to sell dull facts to the public.
In the EU we have prescribed exact limits for radiation which are lower than WHO standards.
There is more radiation from microwave ovens than there is from base stations.
The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-hundredth of the safe limit values.
However, it is easier to claim that mobile phones melt our brains.
Public documents must be made available in electronic form.
Basic information must be free of charge.
An authority may make a charge to cover its costs, but it is unnecessary to ask for additional payment.
The Member States must be responsible for seeing to it that the public institutions have sufficient resources available to them.
Finally, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the rapporteurs.
Mr President, it is my pleasure to address the 13 Members who seem unable to drag themselves away from this place and particularly the one lady who still remains to listen to us.
Five minutes before the witching hour we have a topic that is obviously pulling the crowds in, or I might put it this way: we know that we want Europe and need it, so please allow me to use the 90 seconds that I have left to talk about how we can achieve it.
Have a go, ladies and gentlemen, at using what we are debating here.
Go on, click on a website - the Council's, say - go straight to where it says 'Access to documents' and click.
What happens?
Nothing.
Click again.
What happens?
Nothing.
We say to our dear friends in the Council and our dear friends in the Commission - whose web site looks like something out of 'The White Horse', which was a cult operetta in Fifties' Austria - use the money that we could save by for example not holding meetings like this in this form and spend EUR 50 000, 60 000 or 100 000 on producing an up-to-date website that is more use than what is there at the moment.
You would actually be doing voters a service.
They could also get the search functions to work.
If these very banal things are done then we can - I think - consider what we might use this new eEurope for, incorporating, for example, tools to survey public opinion.
In the meantime it is also possible to envisage holding Europe-wide referendums with minimal effort and at negligible expense.
All of this must always be seen on the basis of my ceterum censeo - there can be no democracy without transparency and a well-used Internet is a very, very good way of achieving this.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hans-Peter Martin is right.
There are not very many of us in the Chamber.
We do not know how many people are watching this in their offices and we do not know how many people would watch if we could broadcast this sitting on the Internet.
If it were even possible to use video streaming to play this sitting at an agreeable time of day, then I think the hits on our web page would rocket, and it would be possible for people to analyse and monitor what goes on here more transparently and also much more effectively.
What do we need?
It has to be quicker; it has to be more efficient.
We need search engines that direct people to the right place as quickly as possible on the basis of key words.
Entering 'Hans-Peter Martin', 'Paul RÃŒbig', 'e-commerce' and 'participants present' ought to take you straight to this sitting.
I think that our world has changed, that the networked society is actually already a reality.
It has been possible to complete bureaucratic formalities, conduct business and so on electronically for a long time, but some of the necessary prerequisites are lacking.
When the WTO negotiations take place in Cancun in the autumn we need to ask ourselves: to what extent has world trade been liberalised?
If Hans-Peter Martin clicks on a home page now and wants to order a book from America or a certain piece of software, what barriers and what bureaucracy will he have to contend with?
What duties will have to be paid and above all, what is the postal service going to do about shipping and delivery costs, which are currently completely unreasonable for small parcels?
We need more competition in the postal services sector.
We need secure payment systems, we need a system of damages that protects customers from fraud, and we need e-money that enables us to pay as if paying with cash.
Applying the banknotes system to e-money is something that we are definitely going to need to do in the future. Finally, we also need a Europe-wide investigation into the obstacles to using these new technologies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I wanted to make a little joke, I would say that the debate on this important dossier has been held over two days, since it is now 12 February.
That said, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the public data concern a particularly sensitive area since they concern public information, managed either directly or indirectly by the public authorities.
Community legislation on transparency and accessibility of public information already provides a highly comprehensive framework, but in some sectors, a few clarifications should be made in order to prevent any distortion of competition caused by a possible legislative void.
I would congratulate the European Commission on this proposal concerning the reuse and handling of public sector documents.
I nevertheless lament the lack of precision in certain points in the text.
I am thinking, for example, of the documents referred to which, in my opinion, are not the subject of a clear, specific definition.
As I proposed to the competent committee for content, the concept of a public document needs to be further delineated.
I am not referring to harmonisation, but simply to an appropriate definition to allow all citizens to know exactly which public documents are considered to fall within the scope of the directive.
It would also have been desirable to introduce a reference to periods of accessibility of public documents.
On the other hand, I am pleased that the proposals on the unilateral order on information production and the proposals on the conditions governing the implementation of this order have been adopted, in particular the reasonable period of notice.
An order that is harshly enforced poses a risk to the operators concerned.
I am thinking in particular of the SMEs and SMIs, which would not have the technical or financial means to deal with such situations if they were not given enough notice.
That is why I would encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote for Mr Van Velzen's report. The rapporteur has successfully supplemented the Commission's basic proposal with a comprehensive report, which has been intelligently negotiated between the various political groups to which we belong.
Mr President, there is no need to insist on the importance today of the information society for everybody, both for the public sector and for companies and citizens.
I will focus on just two of the reports under discussion today.
With regard to the Commission's initiative on the reuse of public sector documents, there are more and more companies in Europe who make use of information from the public sector and who reuse it.
We must guarantee that the conditions for access to this information are the same throughout Europe.
The price for this information must be proportional - without question - to the cost of production, but on the other hand we cannot oblige the administration - as the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has said - to produce all that information if it is not relevant or necessary.
With regard to the Council's proposed decision on the monitoring of eEurope and the dissemination of good practices and security on the networks, I would like to highlight two aspects.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which produced the opinion for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which produced the main report, has also stated that it is necessary not just to promote all exchanges of good practices between public and private professionals, but that the Commission should also fund information and awareness campaigns on the issue of the security of networks.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative today to present a single system for security of the networks.
It is clear that our work and our economies are increasingly based on the information society and it is therefore important to reduce the risk of insecurity on networks.
We must guarantee both safe access and the protection of the privacy of the data of those who access the public sector and the networks in general.
In order to promote an electronic economy in the field of enterprises, it is also essential to promote a culture based on the entrepreneurial spirit and to stimulate greater participation by companies in the information society.
While in Lisbon, as other Members have said, the strategic objective was set on turning the knowledge-based economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, the objective of the information society is undoubtedly an important and essential driving force.
Mr President, it has been a broad and very interesting debate.
I would like to thank Mr Van Velzen for his work on public sector information.
We all very much agree that quality is one of the essential factors for the development of the new information society services and particularly 3G services.
I would prefer to submit the Commission position on the amendments in writing because the safety at work directive starts with the limits on our working hours!
That is a very wise decision.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
Preparation for the 2003 Spring summit (Brussels, 21-22 March 2003)
The first item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the 2003 Spring Summit (Brussels, 21-22 March 2003).
Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate on the Spring Summit is an extremely important debate.
In the current political climate, the European Union needs to ensure that it makes good progress on a number of crucial issues at this summit.
This will prove that we know how to bolster confidence, security and optimism in Europe.
Competitiveness, employment, social cohesion and sustainable development are the tools we shall use to achieve these objectives.
We want the March Council to send out a clear signal that, even in these difficult times, Europe is taking decisions which generate momentum and prospects.
Having said which, I should like to explain the Greek Presidency's thoughts and plans and hear President Prodi's and the European Parliament's views.
A strategy this broad will be sure of success if it draws on creativity and support from all sides, the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and, of course, the social forces.
Ladies and gentlemen, a great deal of progress has been made since 2000 on numerous issues which come under the Lisbon strategy.
Just recently, we came to a good agreement on the liberalisation of the energy market, the single European sky, the competition rules in need of reform, the tax package and financial services.
However, there are still delays in the application and implementation of a whole series of issues.
It is true that we are in the middle of a serious recession.
The Spring Summit in 2003 will be held in a new political and economic climate, beset by serious problems but offering more opportunities than in the past.
The recession in numerous OECD countries, increasing international tension and the resultant general feeling of insecurity are all taking their toll on the Lisbon strategy and there has been a delay in achieving our mid-term objectives.
The outcome of the Spring Summit will have a serious impact on what we do next to achieve the Lisbon objectives and we need to make sure Europe can withstand medium-term uncertainties.
The Greek Presidency understands perfectly that it is more important than ever before to keep the Lisbon strategy on the front burner.
I can assure you that the Greek Presidency's individual objectives are geared towards maintaining what is admittedly a difficult balance and highlighting the integrated, mutually supportive, coordinated nature of the reforms encompassed by the Lisbon process.
The European Union post Lisbon is not just a union with economic policies; it is a union endeavouring to promote policies on employment, social issues and the quality of the development process itself.
This balance will not come about automatically of its own volition.
The Greek Presidency wants to broaden the economy by adding the social factor and sustainable development.
Ladies and gentlemen, with poor economic growth over recent years, intense concern about economic prospects, fears of a new rise in unemployment, new environmental challenges and widespread pessimism on the international markets, fed by concerns generated by business problems and diminishing business expectations, we urgently need to push these issues forward.
Within these limits, the presidency has defined a series of crucial issues of primary importance which relate to our three basic objectives: economic reform and competitiveness, employment and social cohesion and sustainable development.
As far as economic reform and competitiveness are concerned, there are six points I wish to comment on: managing macroeconomic policy, opening up financial services, energy and transport markets, encouraging entrepreneurship, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, the importance of research, technology and information society policy, the importance of education as a key factor in investment in knowledge and human resources and, finally, linking various networks.
I should like to comment briefly on each of these points:
Safeguarding macroeconomic stability and adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact are important means to our end.
With regard to taxation of savings, as I am sure you already know, the recent Economic and Financial Affairs Council reached an important agreement on automatic exchanges of information after fourteen years of discussion.
Again in the tax sector, we are still trying to reach political agreement on an energy tax.
Macroeconomic management is one of our main concerns in the present climate and ECOFIN is keeping a very close watch on developments, with the Commission's help, so that it can take the necessary decisions.
The presidency also believes we need to unify the financial markets if we are to improve the Union's single market.
This will boost investors' confidence in the markets and foster economic development, employment and prosperity, which is why we are keen to ensure the two relevant action plans, the financial services action plan and the risk capital action plan, progress satisfactorily.
I am delighted to be able to confirm that the two action plans are progressing satisfactorily and we are expecting a progress report at the 2003 Spring Summit.
The pension funds directive, the investment services directive and the bank/investment firm capital directive are important issues for the presidency and we shall also be discussing the Commission proposal on corporate governance.
The Greek Presidency endorses the conclusions of the Winter report and agrees that company law needs to be updated, especially on corporate governance.
As far as takeover bids are concerned, we hope to make substantial progress on the proposal submitted by the European Commission.
Still on the subject of boosting competitiveness, our efforts will be geared towards interlinking networks and full operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets.
On the subject of energy, the presidency will make every effort to reach an agreement on the full operational liberalisation of the market, taking account of public interest undertakings, security of supply and protection for sensitive areas and groups.
In the transport sector, our priorities are to extend the trans-European networks to the new Member States, adopt the second package of legislative proposals on the railways and road safety.
As far as services of general economic interest are concerned, we think this is a very interesting proposal, especially now that sectors of general importance to society as a whole are being privatised and are competing, and we look forward to receiving the Commission's proposals here.
