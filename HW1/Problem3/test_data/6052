That is totally ridiculous because, if Parliament adopts amendments to the budget, it is elementary that there should be a mechanism to follow up on those amendments to know exactly what has happened.
The fault lies in part with Parliament, because we do not scrutinise and follow up the budget as we should.
I do not blame the Committee on Budgetary Control but the individual committees which do not often take that responsibility.
The fault also lies with the Commission because we need greater clarity of information in order to analyse budget implementation.
There should be much better dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to identify very clearly what action has been taken on European Parliament priorities.
I suspect the Commission far too often simply ignores what Parliament amends in the budget.
We need to be able to indicate that.
On the common foreign and security policy, we need greater clarity: we are not clear on who does what.
That is why I support the idea of an interinstitutional agreement setting out exactly the Commission's role in the CFSP.
On implementation, there was for the 2000 budget again a very high concentration of commitments at the end of the year for Latin America, Asia and so on. The imbalance between commitments and payments continues to give cause for concern, as indeed do the remarks of the Court of the Auditors in relation to the TACIS programme.
I recognise the improvements the Commission has made - in particular the use of the website to provide information - but we have to focus on transparency and implementation.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I presented to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and which it unanimously adopted, begins by calling on the Court of Auditors to make specific mention of Title B5-8 on the area of freedom, security and justice in its annual report and to devote to this area a minimum of attention, which it has so far failed to do.
As far as the implementation of the 2000 Budget is concerned, we note that although the implementation rate is incredibly low - 50% for commitment appropriations and 70% for payment appropriations - this cannot be attributed to poor management or a lack of will on the part of the Commission. It is essentially due to the fact that the Council of Ministers adopted the legal bases too late, which means that a number of items given budgetary appropriations had to be postponed.
We noted with satisfaction that, during 2000, the Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General increased the number of audits completed on its services.
Sixty-four were performed in 2000 compared to 44 in 1999.
We also noted that the amounts recoverable or reduced payments as a result of the audits has increased more than 10% of the total value of contracts.
Which means that we believe that the Commission should step up its efforts, if necessary using contractual penalties to combat the improper use of subsidies or the overstatement of actual costs.
Lastly, we noted with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors stated in the report that the management of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has improved.
There are, however, some anomalies, particularly as regards, for example, the appropriations granted for staff recruitment.
The average cost of recruiting a member of staff at the Lisbon monitoring centre is EUR 2 780 compared with EUR 6 610 for the Vienna monitoring centre.
Having said this and all things considered, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has no objection to granting discharge in the sector for which it is responsible.
Madam President, our committee covers 120 budget lines, some very large indeed, including the research programmes Tacis, Phare and Meda.
The implementation of those lines has been heavily criticised in the past.
My first point is about the expenditure in 2000 of the Synergy programme, which is a programme to further international cooperation in the energy sector, and one strongly supported by the European Parliament.
I am sure you can imagine, Commissioner, our astonishment and dismay when the Commission abandoned this programme in the year 2000, cancelled a call for tenders already published, causing huge inconvenience, and proceeded to spend no money at all throughout the year 2000.
I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this is unacceptable behaviour and that the relevant Commissioner is well aware of our views.
I am pleased to say that remedial action has been taken and we look forward to an enhanced programme in this very important sector.
I turn now to the Tacis programme on nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union.
This has regularly been severely - and rightly - criticised in the past.
It is work which is carried out in difficult conditions, in an area where slackness and inefficiency in the implementation of budgets was traditional.
We note with pleasure a marked improvement and look forward to reassurance about the safety of nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union.
I would like to thank colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their cooperation in helping us to undertake the very important work of scrutiny on which our committee, could spend all its time on if we wished to.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to focus my attention on the agencies.
It is there that we urgently need more efficient and transparent monitoring and controls.
I say that not only because the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has responsibility for four of the agencies, but also in view of the fact that the number of agencies is constantly increasing.
Today there are eleven agencies, but there will soon be 14 of them, for, as you will be aware, we will also have agencies for the safety of food, and for safety in travel by air and sea, once the issue is resolved of where they are to be based.
As already mentioned, our committee is responsible for four agencies, in Dublin, Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Turin, and we have, in principle, no problems with them, but this does not alter the fact that there is a fundamental problem with Parliament having only one discharge procedure for four agencies.
Yes, the agencies do now have their own rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets, and Mr Kuckelkorn has already achieved a great deal.
Nonetheless, though, we do need all the agencies to be treated on an equal basis, and so, today, I call on the Commission to draw up proposals to put all the agencies on an equal footing in the discharge procedure.
To do this we must, above all, make appropriate changes to their legal basis, without which the future will find us still incapable of auditing the agencies satisfactorily when the Budget comes round, and that cannot be in anybody's interest.
Cooperation between the committees of this House also needs to be improved.
The guidelines for the agencies drawn up in 1998 should therefore be examined from four angles: with a view to ensuring appropriate control machinery in the specialised committees and transparency in the Budget procedure, reinforcing the requirement for mutual information and clear demarcation of competences between the committees involved.
Our committee will be drawing up proposals in relation to this.
Let me, in conclusion, again warmly thank Mr McCartin and Mr Staes for their support so far in this regard.
Madam President, first of all could I put on record my thanks to Mr Bowe who was the budget rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment for the first half of the mandate.
The general approach to the discharge procedure is to look at the percentage of the budget line that is spent.
If 95% or more is spent then a tick is put beside that item.
If less than 80% is spent there is a black mark.
But if we have the information at our disposal we should look more carefully at the achievement of goals with this money, rather than purely the fact that the money has been spent.
For example, on the fifth environment action plan only 70% of the budget was spent.
The reason for this is that there were not sufficient good projects; in fact some calls had no response at all.
We should not give money to bad projects.
However, there is one slight caveat to that: I hope our bidding systems are not becoming so bureaucratic that some potential bidders with good projects are put off from bidding at all.
I will mention public health budget line B3-4301 on combating cancer.
In 1999 there was a substantial under-spend on that and I am pleased to see that in 2000 it was almost fully committed including the overhang from 1999.
It would be verging on the criminal not to deploy resources allocated for combating diseases such as cancer.
It is true that the environment budget of EUR 200 million - that is GBP 125 million - was only half spent in the year 2000.
The reason for this was the Life projects, which make up half this budget, and which could not be spent in 2000 because the legal basis was not determined in conciliation until July 2000.
I am pleased to see that the five-year project has been telescoped into a four-year project instead.
Despite the substantial under spending in the budget that is largely due to the Life III lines, and bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors have not voiced concerns, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy recommends that discharge be granted in respect of the 2000 budget for the budget lines within its competence.
Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I thank the rapporteur, Mr McCartin for his report and efforts and, in particular, for the way in which he highlighted the major concern of my committee, namely the slow rate of implementation of the Community's structural funds.
As he so rightly highlighted, that is the bulk of the problem in terms of the surplus that this Parliament is addressing.
The question to which my committee failed to receive a satisfactory answer from the Commission, was why do we allow such a situation to develop in the first place?
It was predictable that in the first year of the structural fund programmes rates of implementation would be very low.
Yet we were faced with wholly unrealistic budget forecast expectations and scenarios which, by definition, could not be fulfilled.
So we are dealing with a situation where, in many areas, there has been almost no expenditure whatsoever under certain budget lines for the Community's structural funds.
We believe this makes it much more difficult for this Parliament and my committee to scrutinise the budget adequately and rigorously.
As a regular item on our committee agenda, we have now decided to focus on budget scrutiny and, at each discussion, we invite the Commission and the Council to participate with us in a thorough review of expenditure within the structural fund area.
But that job is made very difficult by these wholly unrealistic budgets.
The Commissioner must explain how we are expected properly to evaluate a budget which is in itself extremely questionable.
Our second concern really relates to the second point the rapporteur made in his opening remarks - the way in which the structural funds are currently managed.
We share his concern that the regulations are overly complex and make our job, as a Parliament, of scrutinising the budget very difficult.
So we have a double problem there.
Many organisations, individuals, groups, associations and communities that are eligible for structural funds fail to receive their fair share because of the over-complexity of the application process.
We, as a Parliament - and the other authorities charged with monitoring budgetary expenditure - have a problem in that we cannot adequately monitor expenditure to ensure value for money.
My final point concerns the trans-European networks.
We reiterate our view that the Commission is right to focus on fewer projects but we oppose the fact that the Commission is now planning to make a EUR 60 billion addition to the trans-European network transport budget line.
We invite the Commission to comment on how they can ensure value for money when they are planning such a massive increase in expenditure.
Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Blak on having finally taken the decision to propose, in his report, the discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 2000 financial year.
The Commission, and particularly Commissioner Nielson, have made a great effort to keep Parliament informed on expenditure from these funds. Developing countries that are beneficiaries of these funds deserve the adoption by Parliament of the discharge already approved by the Court of Auditors.
For this reason, the Socialist Group and the Committee on Development, for which I am rapporteur, support this discharge.
However, we would ask the Commission that in future more funds be earmarked for social development and that these be more clearly reflected, as proposed by the Committee on Development, in both the budget and the EDF.
We hope that next year we will be able to analyse the figures for EU aid in accordance with the OECD's Development Aid Committee system, which will allow us to measure the impact of Community funds on the promotion of social development more accurately.
With regard to the amendments tabled by Mr Blak himself, we have to reject those which refer to access to documents and the revision of the interinstitutional framework agreement, not because of substantive issues, for the agreement is not actually proving to be very effective, but because we cannot question, in each report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, the validity of an agreement that has been negotiated, signed and voted on by this Parliament with the participation, let us not forget, of members from that very committee.
The Courts have also stated their opinion in this regard.
We therefore understand that that matter of access to documents should not be raised in a report.
On the other hand, we support the other amendments regarding audits and the management of the business development centre.
This exercise in the discharge of the EDF, which we ritually tackle each year, should serve as an illustration, once again, of the ridiculous situation where Parliament inspects the discharge of funds that do not figure in the Community budget, the amounts of which we are not consulted on and on whose expenditure we are only informed of a posteriori.
The EDF, implemented by the Commission and theoretically controlled by Parliament, should be included within the Community budget as a fundamental quantitative and qualitative element of development policy.
We believe that at this time of reform of the European Union, we have the perfect opportunity to remind ourselves of this fact and I would encourage all political groups to communicate this proposal, which Parliament has supported for many years, to the Convention.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of Parliament's prime functions to scrutinise and control the EU's Budget, and, in doing this, greater attention urgently needs to be given to how the equal opportunities policy is to be financed in the European Social Fund's 2000-2006 programming period.
The Spanish President of the Council, in his presentation to the committee, expressed the intention of giving equal opportunities policy a fixed place as a mainstream function in the complex of employment and social affairs.
That has also become a necessity, as the figures show that only 6% of the resources in the European Social Fund are allocated to special measures relating to equal opportunities, whereas Parliament had asked for 15%.
The underutilisation of resources and the great extent to which resources have been transferred is a consequence of the problems accompanying the Structural Funds' initial operations in the programming period 2000-2006.
Procedures for structural measures had to be rationalised and simplified, as they are too complex at both Community and national level, and we must now work on preventing the recurrence of such difficulties when the new programmes are to be set up in the future.
The evaluation report on the Daphne programme became available only yesterday.
What particularly interests me in it is the reasons for the low take-up of the payment authorisations in the Budget year 2000.
What is most important is that women play an important role in sustainable development, and gender issues should therefore be taken into account at every stage of planning, implementing and evaluating development cooperation.
I therefore request clarification as to how it is that payments for this accounted for only 59% of resources.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities focuses on just a few Budget items, but they are all the more important for enabling the objectives of equal opportunities policy to continue to be pursued in the EU.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Blak has presented on discharge for the European Development Funds clearly shows the particular problems faced by European development policy.
There are manifest problems originating in the Commission's system and in the way it works.
Hence it cannot be acceptable that there should be, at the end of 2000, a sum of EUR 6 billion available and yet unused.
It cannot be the case, in view of the increasing destitution in many ACP countries, that the Commission is unable to manage to get the funds made available to those who are in need of them.
The Commission has made a start on changing the system in these areas.
It has, since the Cotonou agreement, been going further down the road of giving aid in the form of sectoral budget support programmes.
Put in simple terms, that means that the Commission has more faith in the recipient countries' responsibility.
That is, in itself, a way of going about things that should be welcomed.
The only thing is that this trust must, of necessity, be counterbalanced, in the event of misuse, by a consistent demand for the money to be returned.
It is such consistency that is evidently lacking, as the Court of Auditors noted that, whilst the Commission carries out audits, and also spots abuses, not one cent of the EUR 14 million referred to by the Court of Auditors had been reclaimed or retrieved.
Here, the Commission must summon up the courage to state the reasons for this.
Either this is the fault of its own incompetent administration, or there are general political reasons for refraining from demanding the money back.
I take the view that this will prove to be the scratch test for the new system of finance.
If greater trust is placed in the recipient states, that presupposes that the recipients are fully answerable for any misuses.
Everything else strikes me as inconsequential and as not in the long-term interests of the recipients.
Here, the Commission must come to a definite decision and must not go down the road of least resistance, more comfortable though that would no doubt be.
We are left with criticism of a few of this EDF process's anachronisms, with which we have long been acquainted and which ought to be done away with as quickly as possible.
If Parliament is to give discharge, then it is Parliament to which budgetary and legislative power over the EDF's resources should be conceded.
The Statement of Assurance, too, which is given by the Court of Auditors in its report on the EDF, must, like the Statement of Assurance on the General Budget, involve a complete audit and must not stop at the point where the funds leave the Commission level.
Here, too, is the explanation of why there is a favourable Statement of Assurance relating to the EDF.
The existence of two different Statements of Assurance is not only confusing, but also deceptive.
I turn now to the discharge for Parliament's budget, where Parliament must be especially careful to avoid the least whiff of the suggestion that it might treat its own funds with less rigour than it treats those of others.
I wish to expressly emphasise the demand in the chapter on personnel policy in Mr Virrankoski's report that the meagre representation of women in positions of leadership should at last be ended and that there be a serious attempt at an equal opportunities policy.
Parliament's Secretary-General bears personal responsibility for this.
Parliament must set an example if it does not want to lose its credibility.
It is something more than sad that the Secretary-General has not seized these opportunities throughout the long years he has been in office.
I also think that Parliament must play an exemplary role in creating an independent internal audit department, meaning that the auditors would not be subject to directions of any kind from the Directors-General and the Secretary-General.
We also welcome the right to make reports directly to the President of Parliament.
The report on the discharge of the Parliamentary Budget must neither cover up omissions and deficiencies, nor should it be misused in order to have internal problems dealt with elsewhere, which is what seems to be the objective of several amendments that have been reintroduced in the meantime.
In particular, the Financial Regulation is not suited to solving problems within Parliament.
These we have to sort out ourselves.
Transparency, regularity and responsibility for one's colleagues are principles which, as Mr Blak said, are self-evident in the Parliamentary context.
They are not suited to the settlement of party-political disputes, and there should not, therefore, be constant and self-tormenting calls for them.
I will conclude by asking you to support my Amendment No 8 to Mr McCartin's report. It instructs the President of Parliament even now to defend Parliament's rights under Article 276 of the Treaty establishing the European Community before the European Court of Justice in the event of the Council again proceeding to restrict them.
Mr President, my predecessors on the floor having almost all exceeded their speaking time by at least a minute, I crave your indulgence if I have to do the same.
When this discharge procedure began last December with the Court of Auditors' report, I pointed out that we were now entering a stage in which we are talking about the systematic problem of the European Union's Budget policy and are less concerned with chasing after every potential or actual scandal.
Two aspects indicate this, namely the comparatively small number of amendments before us to all the reports and the broad majorities by which they have been adopted, likewise the way that the prospect of this debate on the discharge has made comparatively few waves in the press.
I would, though, like to say something very definite on the subject of Parliament.
I want to pick up a point mentioned by Mrs Stauner, who spoke immediately before me.
It is indeed true that it would be desirable for Parliament to be able to settle legally and entirely autonomously all the matters concerning the way it manages its budget.
It would be marvellous, and I would support it, but the one problem with it is that no separation of Parliament's financial policies and the groups represented in Parliament is provided for in the European Union's Financial Regulation.
It is, though, such a separation that we need.
I would remind you that, two years ago, on the occasion of the Court of Auditors' report on the groups' financial policies, we had a great debate in this House, in which certain dubious financial practices on the part of individual groups reflected on the institution of Parliament as a whole and all Members of this House were seen by those in the galleries and by the press as having to answer for things which were in fact the responsibility only of individual groups.
I would not wish to be made answerable for certain questionable financial practices that might well go on in other groups, and I likewise assume that, if something goes wrong in my group, Members belonging to other groups are not made answerable for them either.
Mr Virrankoski's report now gives us the opportunity to take a significant step towards separating the responsibilities of Parliament's authorities and of the groups.
It is a step that we must take.
I warn against standing up and saying: How did we come to this pass, where we let the Commission, in a legislative proposal on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation, prescribe what we should and should not do?
We would then be creating a tremendous sham conflict with the Commission, in which we would show off our wondrous strength, and one side-effect would be that the separation of the responsibilities of the House authorities and the groups would be deferred for ever and a day; another side-effect - perhaps an agreeable one - would be that certain things that were done in the past, could be carried on with.
For example, if a group dismisses a member of its staff, he or she protests his or her innocence to the House authorities and takes Parliament to an industrial tribunal.
Or when accumulated and transferred leave entitlements of group staff amounting to astronomical sums have to be paid out of Parliament's budget, whilst it is actually the groups who should accept responsibility for it.
So I warn against using sham conflicts to bring about such a situation in this House.
If this situation is to be avoided, we can provide a draft solution by tomorrow.
If, though, the situation really does arise at the end of the day in which the present state of affairs perpetuates itself, then we will call those who are responsible by the names they deserve.
Mr President, for the first time in many years, it looks as if this Parliament will once again be granting discharge to the Commission by 30 April, as prescribed.
This is to be welcomed, in my view, and this is why I should like to congratulate Mr McCartin - and the other rapporteurs too, in fact.
As far as the Commission's attitude is concerned, I have the impression that the Commission has made every effort to accommodate the many questions asked by Parliament within a very short space of time.
What is most striking about this budget is that once again there is no positive statement of assurance.
And this is the first budget for which the new Commission is responsible.
We, the Liberal Group, as well as others, have said time and again that we need indicators to establish whether the situation has improved or not.
If we keep hearing every year that there is no positive statement of assurance, how should we explain this to the public if we subsequently keep on granting discharge?
I should once again like to draw the Commission's attention to this problem, and ask the Commission, if the Court of Auditors refuses to develop an indicator, which is what now seems to be the case, to come up with an indicator of its own which, for example, highlights the fact that a margin of error prevails in a Directorate-General, the extent of this margin, and the extent of this in other sectors.
The Court of Auditors can then verify subsequently whether the technique is sound.
This will give Parliament a tool to assess whether or not a situation is improving.
This seems to me to be a priority for the year to come.
Another point already mentioned by Mrs JÃ¶ns is that we have noticed a steady increase in the number of agencies.
Virtually every agency has its own financial rules accompanied by a complex discharge procedure.
This is difficult for the many agencies.
Would it not be possible for the Commission to develop a uniform model for all the agencies?
This too would simplify inspection by Parliament.
Another point concerns the clearance of accounts.
We, as the Liberal Group, have tabled an amendment which extends the period which lapses before it becomes final from 24 to 36 months.
This allows us as Parliament to challenge the decisions by the Commission for a slightly longer period.
And in our view, it is perhaps necessary to increase the financial corrections once again.
The maximum is 100%, but what is stopping us from applying more gradations, which would provide us with another way of measuring upward or downward trends?
In addition, we take the view that the computerisation of customs offices in Europe should be prioritised, especially in the new countries.
What specific action is the Commission taking to reinforce Europe's future external borders, and what can we as Parliament do to improve the situation on this score?
Finally, I should like to bring up a topic which has already been mentioned by various speakers, namely the European Union's new foreign and security policy.
Indeed, it looks as if an entirely new policy is being developed which could well escape Parliament's attention.
This is unjustified in the opinion of the Liberal Group.
We think that an agreement must be concluded between the Commission, Parliament and the Council about a new interinstitutional accord, thus allowing the expenses made by the Council in this respect to be better monitored.
Mr President, I too would like, on behalf of my group, to thank all the rapporteurs for their good work on the discharge of the General Budget this year, and make just a few comments.
We greatly welcome, for example, the way that Mr McCartin's report addressed the issue of export subsidies.
We will be giving that more of a cutting edge by means of an amendment, as it is our opinion that the subsidy of live animal transports still leaves too many openings for fraud involving subsidies that make no sense whatever to the EU's taxpayers.
We consider this issue to be extremely important, and one where things need to be further tightened up.
We will be supporting Mrs Morgan in giving the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs discharge for the last few years but still not for 1996 and 1997.
We consider it extremely important that our committee should strongly reiterate that these years saw mismanagement of travel expenses and, even more important, that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs dragged its feet in clearing up this fraud, and that not enough was done to prepare the case for OLAF.
This must continue to receive critical attention, and we must strongly reiterate that rather than cloaking the issue in silence.
I would also like to express support for Mrs Morgan's demand that the Council be given discharge in the area of foreign and security policy, and also in internal affairs policy, all of which increasingly result in operational expenditure.
I am, though, far from satisfied with the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters in the past, and I fear that it will still not give us a satisfactory answer.
We must, then, again press home our view that this discharge must be for real.
The 'gentlemen's agreement' no longer applies.
On this point, a definite decision has to be taken.
In conclusion, I wish to express my agreement with Mr Kuhne, who spoke before me.
If we are to criticise the Council in the course of the discharge procedure, we in this House must handle our own discharge very carefully.
The administrative and group budgets should have been separated a long time ago.
I wish, though, to urge the Council to at last come to some decisions on the parties, where we in Parliament are not competent to act.
We need the Council to at last decide on a party statute, which would be a practical response to public criticism on this point.
Mr President, I should like to begin by commending my colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, together with the committee's chairman, and also thanking those who participated in the committee and in the groups and who have carried out a very notable and thorough piece of work.
This splendid work has led the majority to recommend giving discharge.
Because of the little time available, I am unable to go into details concerning these many matters, just as others cannot either, but I would refer you to the excellent observations made by my colleagues, Mr Virrankoski, Mr Blak and Mrs Morgan.
I shall concentrate on Mr McCartin's report on discharge to the Commission.
I should like to quote from two recitals.
Recital L reads: 'whereas 2000 was marked by a significant increase in the volume of fraud and irregularities identified by Member States and OLAF?.
Recital P reads: 'whereas, in considering budget implementation in 2000, the fundamental question is to establish, firstly, the Community management features which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, secondly, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity?.
There then follows a long list of incisive observations which, on being read, give the impression of our being concerned here with a South American banana republic.
The EU was not established just a couple of years ago.
This system has been in place since 1957, and it is wholly unsatisfactory that, year after year, we should write these reports, clearly and emphatically pointing out the errors, but that nothing improves.
Next year, we shall write something which, for a change, resembles what we are writing this year, and then still give discharge.
It should be noted that the criticism in Mr McCartin's report is just as severe as that in the report on the 1996 accounts, which brought the previous Commission down.
Financial management and the legislation itself are unacceptably bad.
In my country, a government characterised by management of this kind would be overturned, and the officials responsible fired.
It is not good enough for so much of European taxpayers' money to disappear due to fraud and irregularities.
People will simply not put up with it. This cannot be the price of cooperation in Europe.
The only logical conclusion is, of course, to vote against giving discharge to the Commission.
Mr President, the enormous budget surplus in 2000 to the tune of EUR 11.6 billion illustrates that budgetary management still leaves something to be desired.
In the Structural Funds, under spending is even starting to have structural implications.
In our view, unspent amounts should be returned to the Member States, at least after two years.
This could help these Member States reduce their national debt, for example.
We therefore support Amendment No 9 tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris.
The management of the Structural Funds requires substantial improvement.
The complex Community regulations must be simplified.
Coordination between the Commission and the Member States is well below par.
Financial inspection is riddled with loopholes, both ex-ante and ex-post.
The current financial correction system must also be changed as a matter of urgency, because it encourages Member States to cover up irregularities and fraud instead of reporting dirty tricks.
We have known this for years, but the Commission and the Member States are still doing much too little to improve the situation.
We are disappointed that the pre-accession aid programmes are not achieving their objectives by a long chalk.
The findings in the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors are disturbing.
The fact that it is unlikely that the candidate countries will be able to implement the various aid programmes during this calendar year is unacceptable to us.
I would ask the Commission to inform us of the present state of affairs.
The reform of the European Commission which was initiated in 1999 is still not evident in terms of specific results in 2000.
I trust that the Commissioner will now have some insight into the results achieved over the course of 2001.
We would be interested to find out whether she would be prepared to share some of the information.
There is also considerable under spending in aid programmes for development cooperation.
Duplication with Member States' policies may be partly to blame for this.
Would the Commission map this out for us soon?
In our view, the subsidiarity principle should be taken seriously in EU development policy.
Finally, I have made the shocking discovery that each part-session in Strasbourg costs approximately EUR 11.5 million extra per week, quite apart from the environmental pollution they cause.
This Parliament is forced into this situation solely in order to honour the wish of one Member State.
It would therefore be fair if this Member State were to reimburse this House to the amount of the total estimated annual additional costs of EUR 138 million.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is customary for a speaker to congratulate the rapporteurs and this is something that I am very happy to do.
I would like to congratulate them all, with one exception.
I shall not name the person, since we are all friends and acquaintances here, but I cannot congratulate one rapporteur who has had his report adopted unanimously and who is tabling four amendments on behalf of his group.
I do not think that this is acceptable behaviour - and I shall say no more - because, when they see the name of the rapporteur, Members will think that he has made technical amendments to a text that received a unanimous vote.
I believe that a rapporteur should be honest with his fellow Members and with himself.
He drafts a report, which is unanimously adopted by the members of his committee - of which I am one - and then I notice that he has tabled, on behalf of his colleagues, some amendments that have a different aim.
I think that this behaviour is totally unacceptable and I now urge my fellow Members and the political groups to reject these amendments.
A Member cannot be both rapporteur and the author of amendments - he is either one or the other.
I agree with tabling amendments to other reports, but not to one's own report.
That is why I regret that I am not able to congratulate this Member on his work.
With regard to the other reports, I would like to raise two further points.
The first point is to Mrs Eluned Morgan, a dear friend.
This is 2002, the third millennium: the world is making progress, facts of law are often set in stone, so why persist in refusing the 1996-97 discharge to the smallest institution in the European Union?
What will our citizens think when they find out that we have granted discharge to all the institutions, but we are delaying discharge from seven or eight years ago to the Economic and Social Committee?
We have blamed and accused ECOSOC for the facts that came to light and enough is enough.
For goodness' sake, spare us the embarrassment of being haunted by this scandal, because if we must be haunted by a scandal - I assure you, Eluned - we can all drag up past scandals all over again.
This is not the right approach.
Lastly, regarding the report by Mr McCartin - whom I would like to congratulate in particular - I want to stress that we can, of course, go over all the cases in all the Member States and highlight them, but we must not get hung up on specific cases.
I therefore call for paragraph 60 to be deleted immediately and I strongly urge the Members to amend the words in paragraph 60 which relate to a Member State that I hold in great esteem.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, especially Mr McCartin, who has taken a reasonable amount of flak from me.
I should also like to congratulate Mrs Morgan on her discharge report.
I was not in the Chamber when she made her comments about ECOSOC, but I am sure she is now with me in calling for this organisation not only not to get discharge but actually to be disbanded because it is a waste of money.
My primary job here on behalf of my group is to talk about the Staes and SeppÃ€nen discharges.
This is very easy because they are two very good reports written by two very good parliamentarians.
Regarding the McCartin report, I want to put on record, especially for people in the public gallery, some of the simple facts which we should be talking about.
There is still no positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors.
This is the seventh year running.
There probably never will be one because they have got themselves into a very tight corner now.
How can they give discharge to an organisation where 5% or more of the budget is lost through fraud, mismanagement or waste and 14% of the budget, at least, is running as a surplus?
Nearly 20% of the budget is not spent correctly, as we would like it to be.
This is not a record to be proud of.
The discharge report by Mr McCartin contains a number of quite scathing points and highlights ongoing problems within the Commission.
And yet Mr McCartin comes to the conclusion that he should recommend discharge.
Quite correctly, he notes that the majority of the EU's budget is administered in the Member States.
However this does not absolve the Commission of final responsibility and accountability.
The buck stops with the Commission.
It is its responsibility, as stated in Article 274, to implement and oversee the Community's budget.
Once again this is a year in which it has failed to manage and control the Community's budget properly.
My party's representatives in this House were elected on a whole host of pledges, the main one being to sort out the accounts of the European Commission and other European institutions and make sure that the reform process that most people in this House are pleased to see going forward is actually driven through and achieves results.
As much money is now being lost through fraud and mismanagement of funds in the 2000 budget as when we made the pledge in 1999 to try and sort this out.
John Wiggins, a former member of the European Court of Auditors, is quoted in a British newspaper saying that the situation in the Commission is unchanged.
Things have got to change.
The European Parliament's legal services wrote a note to the Budgetary Control Committee on 5 November 2001 giving an opinion on whether not granting discharge should lead to the fall of the Commission.
It states that undoubtedly refusal to grant discharge is the expression of serious political sanctioning of the Commission.
Its legal effect, however, is not such as to compel the Commission to resign.
That is covered by a special procedure laid down in Article 141 of the EC Treaty.
In voting not to give discharge to the Commission, we are actually making sure that the Commission knows firstly, that we do not want it to resign and, secondly, that we want it to sort the problems out.
If nothing has changed by this time next year, if there is still no positive statement of assurance, if there is still 5% and more waste, mismanagement, fraud and disappearing money, and if there is still a huge budget surplus, then we will be getting to the stage where we will have to say to the people in the public gallery and the people who put us here that nothing has changed in the European Commission, the reform process is still ongoing - and is the slowest process ever - and we have failed in one of our core tasks which was to sort these problems out in the first place.
That is not a record to be proud of and not something I am prepared to stand before my constituents and say.
Mr President, I am sure it is no reflection on the quality of Mr Heaton-Harris' speech that the public gallery emptied while he was speaking.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs involved for their work on this vast subject.
In my opinion, the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution: the power by virtue of which we verify, year after year, that the good intentions and resolves, and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost, are fulfilled.
This subject is both extremely technical and extremely political, and the consequences for both sectors of decisions taken in haste or under emotional stress can be - and, unfortunately, do often turn out to be - disastrous.
That is why I feel that we should ask ourselves before the vote, each year, not so much whether everything has been done perfectly but rather whether we are going in the right direction, whether we are setting ourselves the right priorities, whether, in the executive action of the Commission and - to a much lesser extent - all the other institutions, there is evidence of the intention to implement the will of the two arms of the budgetary authority as well as possible.
Concentrating especially on Mr McCartin's report and, therefore, on the Commission's budget, I feel that three points warrant particular emphasis; indeed, the rapporteur himself has already stressed them.
Firstly, the financial year 2000 has been characterised by an exceptional level of overspending with regard to the budget, which shows that the budgetary forecasts were severely short of the mark.
Secondly, although 2000 marked the start of a new programming period for the Structural Funds and preacession aid which stretches until 2006, this cannot have been very successful given that so many difficulties were encountered in implementation.
Lastly - and this point may well be more important than the previous two - the rapporteur was right to point out the need to establish, on the one hand, the features of Community management which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, on the other, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity
These are, in my opinion, the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper, sound implementation of the budget in the coming years.
Mr President, the EU's institutions continue to provide opportunities for major irregularities in the conduct of financial affairs.
The reason for these is still the weak points in the legislation, cooperation between national authorities that is poor or utterly lacking in coordination, and excessive laxity in monitoring and in imposing penalties.
This is again confirmed in the reports before us on the discharge procedure for 2000.
The Court, for example, did not name Member States that were negligent.
These Member States, whose lax monitoring undermines the combating of fraud, should not only be shown up, but should also make good the damage their laxity causes to the EU.
OLAF's work in connection with the travel expenses affair was equally inadequate.
In order to stem fraud, though, we also need radical reform of Europe's VAT system, for example, by abolishing the deduction of tax within the enterprise chain at national level as well, as it at present strongly favours VAT fraud.
Mr President, I would like to start my speech by thanking and congratulating the rapporteurs for the work they have carried out, with a particular mention to Mr McCartin, who has done some magnificent work in a very short time, the result of which is a good definition of the form the discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000 should take.
There are still some problems, however.
Generally speaking, there is a unanimous call for the modernisation of public authorities and for the process to be further simplified, which would give rise to greater transparency and better public understanding as a whole, whilst bringing this important process closer to the EU citizens.
Whilst we gave our support to the rest of the reports, I would like to make a particular reference to a report on which our group, the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, abstained - the Morgan report.
With regard to this report, we do not agree with the rapporteur or with the committee outcome in several regards.
We understand all that has been said in this House with regard to the irregularities of the Economic and Social Committee in 1996 and 1997.
This period, when there were some administrators who did not do their job properly, when many investigations were carried out, when documentary proof was requested and that which was available was surrendered seems like a long time ago.
It is true to say that today there are new administrators and new procedures; there is now no problem, as demonstrated by the 1998, 1999 and 2000 discharge.
We do not believe that we can accept this slur on an organisation which cooperates with the other institutions, such as the European Parliament, particularly when the current administrators have done all they can to clear up all of these irregularities.
We believe, however, that the best thing that we can do is to draw a line under this whole affair, put this case of poor administration behind us and to give the Economic and Social Committee a new opportunity to maintain a good relationship with Parliament in the future, a good relationship with Parliament and to properly represent all social administration - as it has up until now - and for it to be one of the most effective bodies in the European Union - one of the oldest, if not the oldest - of all those we are analysing today in this report.
This is a discrepancy that we therefore hope will be cleared up when we vote in plenary.
We also disagree with the rapporteur's proposals with regard to the Council.
We believe that the Council discharge should be approved.
Foreign and defence policy are recent issues.
We have to look at things from a different perspective.
I believe that the rapporteur could take steps to facilitate a more appropriate solution by taking the opinions of the Group of the Europe People's Party into account.
If this is not the case, we will have to vote against the report.
We hope that this matter is cleared up and that, if this is not the case, this part of the report can be sent back to the committee, in order to facilitate the development of the aforementioned foreign and defence policy for, as I say, we should not continue with the current approach, given that we have to achieve a better understanding and a better clarification of procedures carried out to date.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate all our rapporteurs on their excellent work and to offer my sincere thanks to the Commission for its cooperation.
I should like to emphasise the constructive and genuinely European attitude demonstrated by our fellow Member, Mr McCartin, and the support given by the staff of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture.
The McCartin report is an important part of the process of reforming the common policy.
I hope that the remaining European institutions take due account of this, preparing the necessary measures for the phasing out of refunds for farm exports and ensuring that these refunds are used instead for the purpose laid down by the Treaty, which is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the rural population.
I should like to say, however, that where fraud in the food industry is concerned, we need to go considerably further.
Speaking of dairy products - a sector that is quite crucial to the Azores - I cannot accept a situation in which farmers live in a state of constant fear of being fined for overproduction while European criminal organisations are falsifying tens of thousands of tons of butter with the complicity of the major European dairy product groups and while the dairy industry is receiving subsidies for powdered milk, which is basically whey, while major dairy produce companies are selling the equivalent of hundreds of millions of litres of what purport to be dairy products, but are, in fact, counterfeit products that are not made from milk.
Nor can I accept that the Commission has had very little or nothing to say on this issue!
In addition, if we look at other fields, such as oil, wine, or even meat, the picture is not very different.
Fraud in the food industry, which is often perpetrated in order to obtain export or disposal refunds, is now one of the greatest problems facing the budgetary control of agriculture.
We therefore urge the Commission to rapidly establish an initiative in this field that will enable this state of affairs to be brought to an end.
Mr President, at the outset I feel I should refer to the news of further decommissioning of arms in Ireland.
I welcome this news, particularly in the present climate of political hostilities in various parts of the world.
It is a clear demonstration that the political process and the peace process are well under way.
Why do I link that with the budget debate?
Well, in discussing the budget, it is important to note the important role that the European Union and the European Parliament have played in this peace process through the International Fund for Ireland, the establishment of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, INTERREG and the removal, through the Single Act, of the economic border which affected the border region for many years.
So it is relevant to refer to this.
I would like in particular to commend my colleague, Mr McCartin, for his thorough and comprehensive work on the very important matter before us.
The power that we have in Parliament, which we share as the Union's budgetary authority, is perhaps the greatest responsibility that we have.
We are talking of EUR 100 billion of public money.
We have a duty to subject this expenditure to the highest standards of scrutiny.
Parliament may have the final say in signing off the accounts, but it is important to recall that 84% of the Community budget is managed within the Member States.
It is also important that a strong culture of openness and cooperation exists between the Commission, the national, regional and local authorities.
Of course, the largest part of the budget goes to the common agricultural policy, one of only a few truly common policies in the Union.
It has served us well and must be maintained and defended.
I am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and I reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud.
I remain convinced that refunds constitute a fundamental element of the policy; they play an important role in the management of agricultural markets and must be defended at WTO level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start with the observation that we have six reports, all of which recommend discharge - with the exception of one part in Mrs Morgan's report, which we have already discussed. I think that is something we have not seen for a long time.
I want to congratulate the rapporteurs most warmly, but would also like to mention that the highest levels of the Commission were represented in many of our meetings, and this made management easier - something mentioned by you, Mrs Schreyer.
To give or withhold discharge is actually the greatest power Parliament possesses, in which Parliament is superior to the Council, and that is why it is a highly political instrument.
Let me emphasise that again.
This time, the judgment on the way that the Budget was managed in 2000 was indeed lenient, especially, too, in the report on the Commission.
So I would just like to mention three points, and briefly.
One is the issue of the large surplus that remains.
I am less concerned about whether this money reverts to the Member States or is set off, than that it should not be used to achieve political objectives, especially in the areas of structural policy and enlargement, and that makes me very vigilant.
There is room for improvement here, and another surplus of this sort for 2001 will not be acceptable.
The second point is the Statement of Assurance that the Court of Auditors did not grant.
This instrument is evidently not that fully applicable.
It is very difficult for us, in the absence of percentages of errors, to judge whether errors have been committed, and how many.
The third issue I wish to address is that of monitoring, in which field the Commission, being responsible for the Member States and also, already now, for the candidate countries - one can take Chapter 28 as an example - must take great care that the European Union's financial interests are effectively safeguarded.
I therefore see the Green Paper on the creation of a European public prosecutor as showing the way ahead.
Mr President, considering this first discharge procedure for the new Commission somewhat dispassionately, we observe two explosive things: firstly, a gigantic Budget surplus, a massive underutilisation that actually shakes budgetary truth to its very foundations.
One cannot but wonder for a moment why we spend months here on the Budget process if 14% of a Budget is not utilised.
I know, as we all do, that the underutilisation in 2001 was even greater than it was in 2000.
If, against that, we set the fact that the same year, 2000, also saw a doubling of the irregularities and frauds that were recorded in this Budget, then, in Budget matters, the first year of Mr Prodi's Commission seems not to have been much of a success.
But, Mr McCartin, this does not mean assigning the debt to the Member States!
Commissioner Schreyer has already referred to the desire to make use of the time for enlargement, in order to prepare these countries for it.
So I ask the same Commission what is happening about the implementation of pre-accession aid in the context of agricultural policy, which was demonstrably not implemented at all in 2000 and 2001.
The same Commission proposes to the European Union that enlargement should take place in 2004.
How, then, is that to be done?
Either the countries desirous of joining are - to put it in plain language - too stupid to collect money they have been given, or the Commission is not in a position to devise pre-accession programmes that are, at the end of the day, capable of being implemented!
Today already, Commissioner, we can take it for granted, for example, that a programme such as IACS, that is, all the agricultural monitoring systems about which we have had so much to say, cannot be implemented for years on end if these countries are onboard, one of many reasons being that the Commission has overslept and missed the pre-accession programmes.
I think it highly important, Commissioner, that we should, in the years to come, not spend all our time speculating about who should hand over which documents to whom - if any at all - and estimates differ as to how great this agreement between Parliament and the Commission is.
What this is about is that you at last grasp that you are accountable to the European public for all of what you have utilised - or, in this instance, not utilised - right down to the last cent.
Then, it is to be hoped, we will enter the new culture of political management in Brussels that Mr Prodi has, admittedly, promised us, but which has not, to date, been discernible.
Mr President, I would like in the first instance to commend the rapporteur for his work.
His years of experience and expertise in this field make him eminently qualified to deal with such an important matter.
The largest part of the budget, of course, goes to fund the common agricultural policy, and this is an important community measure which must not be undermined.
This summer the Commission is due to publish its proposals for the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
This was agreed in Berlin.
It is very important that this review is not used in any way as a means of reforming the policy at this particular time.
This must be deferred until agreement is reached on agriculture at the world trade talks.
Suggestions, for example, that export refunds should be ended, would have disastrous consequences, particularly for Ireland where we export up to 90 percent of our entire agricultural production.
Mr President, the report on the implementation of Parliament's budget is highly controversial.
Although I cannot deal with all its contradictions, I cannot but denounce the truly futile calculations it contains with reference to personnel and other costs at our various places of work.
All of these are intended to run Luxembourg and Strasbourg down as places of work, to glorify an unhealthy emphasis on the centrality of Brussels and to undermine the decisions under the Treaty which laid down Strasbourg and Luxembourg as places of work.
These were enshrined in the Treaty and cannot therefore be altered by Parliament, thank God!
Nor should they, of course, be eroded without further ado, be it by the administration, by the bureau, or by a small majority in Parliament using devious means and our calendar of part-sessions.
It strikes me as positively perverse for this report to welcome a reduction in the number of journeys on official business that our officials take from Luxembourg to Brussels and back, and for it to be boasted that, in 2000, EUR 2.8 million was saved in this way, ignoring the fact that these figures conceal enforced transfers of lower and middle-stream officials from Luxembourg to Brussels, which their families find traumatic and socially and financially intolerable.
Someone has also forgotten to state what additional costs are incurred through sending hundreds of officials to Strasbourg from Brussels every month, instead of from Luxembourg, thus, of course, resulting in greater expense.
The intention which comes to light is a disconcerting one.
In the report, Strasbourg gets more of the same treatment when it is mentioned that the variable costs of the five-day part-sessions in Strasbourg are 33% higher than for those in Brussels.
I would like to propose that creative accountant for the Guinness Book of Records!
What is certain is that Parliament's nonsensical decision to cut the Strasbourg part-sessions down to four days led to the costs per day of the part-sessions now being substantially higher, quite apart from this plenary not having the time to deal properly with business, especially with legislative texts!
What is praised for being good value turns out, in the final analysis, to be substantially more expensive.
The ratio of price to quality is quite simply wrong, and that is what I wanted to take this opportunity to say loudly and clearly!
Mr President, first of all, I would like to echo my fellow Members' comments and thank and congratulate Mr McCartin on his report.
Mr McCartin took on this report at short notice, as I myself was due to draft it, and he has worked on this task in a very able and rigorous manner. His report is a balanced, reasonable and positive piece of work.
I would personally like to praise him and I sincerely hope that the report is adopted.
Mr McCartin is right to recommend the discharge.
The problems raised are not so much problems regarding the timing in the implementation as problems related to an increasing lack of realism, as has been said, between, on the one hand, the financial perspectives that were set in Berlin and the budgetary forecasts that the Commission sets on an annual basis, and, on the other hand, the genuine needs arising from the implementation of the budgets.
We must take steps to correct this imbalance.
As regards the Morgan report, I support Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea's comments on the fact that we cannot support the refusal to discharge the Economic and Social Affairs Committee's budget for the two consecutive financial years since this body made a considerable effort to improve the situation and because it is never a good idea to respond to the positive reform which has got underway by maintaining sanctions.
I therefore believe that the committee's positive efforts call for a positive response on our behalf.
As regards the Virrankoski report, I support the comments Mrs Lulling made earlier on the problems raised by paragraphs 25 and 33 of the resolution.
We may well agree to have a single place of work for Parliament in Brussels, but, until the Treaty specifies otherwise, if the Treaty provides for several places of work, it is our duty to ensure that this work can be carried out in the appropriate conditions.
Paragraphs 25 and 33, however, seem to insidiously call into question the provisions of the Treaty.
Mr Van Hulten told us that the Treaty was desired by one single Member State, so I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this.
The Treaty is the expression of a collective will, the expression of political balance and we must all respect this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you very briefly for your many contributions, observations and suggestions during this discussion.
I would like to suggest that the specific questions raised by the rapporteurs of the individual committees should also be discussed in those committees with my colleagues.
We have agreed a new procedure for working together on setting priorities for next year, in which context, during April and May, there are to be many bilateral discussions between the relevant committees and the Commissioners.
When talking about the priorities for the forthcoming year, one must also, of course, draw on the experience of past years.
The Commission will of course, in the coming months, be working on the other issues and demands raised in the reports and will give an account of this work in the follow-up report.
We have indeed seen that these discussions have, much more than in the past, focused on structural issues in budget management and implementation, and also on reliability testing.
These issues will no doubt leave their mark on joint discussions in the coming months.
As regards the methods used by the Court of Auditors to produce a Statement of Assurance, it goes without saying that we are prepared to look deeper into this concept and the idea of a single audit, in order to enhance and improve the coordination between the Court of Auditors and the checks carried out on the spot by the Internal Audit Service on behalf of the Commission.
Turning to enlargement, the admittedly great delay in the agricultural programme has shown that it is sometimes necessary to give priority to the requirements of monitoring.
This has necessitated great restructuring on the part of the candidate countries in which the individual paying agencies are now gradually being accredited.
We hope that this year will then see the start of disbursements to the farmers.
Let me again thank the rapporteur, Mr McCartin, the other rapporteurs, and the whole Committee on Budgetary Control for their work and for their recommendation that discharge be given.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (?5-0093/2002) by Mr Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency [13382/1/2001 - C5-0696/2001 - 2000/0246(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves today at the second reading stage of a draft Regulation that I regard as being of great significance and which in particular makes one thing clear, namely that, particularly through the committed involvement of the responsible Commissioner, the lack of what should long ago have been a matter of fact in the field of air travel has, in recent months, at length been successfully made good.
I refer to the fact that air travel should know no frontiers and regulations and safety measures affecting air travel should naturally, therefore, also be without borders, meaning, in this instance, that they should be organised, as is appropriate, on a uniform basis across Europe or at least throughout the Member States.
The regulation we are reading for the second time establishes an agency for aviation safety and ensures that assessments will in future be made uniformly as to which aircraft are to be built in accordance with which criteria before being licensed to enter service.
It is obvious that the uniform assessment of designs makes this step significant in terms of air safety, but it is in my view also self-evidently essential to the aircraft industry, which has hitherto had to apply for authorisation in each individual Member State, but will in future be in a position to sort these problems out with one authority and with one agency, and get the relevant certification from them.
The task of the Aviation Safety Agency will be to approve aircraft, certify them and oversee their operation.
At the same time, supervision of the flight crew, as also maintenance and other measures, all of which are factors in aviation safety, are in future to be regulated by law, something for which we clearly expressed a desire during discussions in committee and during preparations for second reading.
Let me repeat the clear message that this regulation's principal objective is the creation of a uniformly high standard for aviation safety in Europe.
There are of course further objectives or knock-on effects associated with this, which can be described quite briefly.
These are, on the one hand, greater cost-effectiveness for the aircraft industry, and on the other, which I consider equally important, the fact that it will be guaranteed that relevant standards will be interpreted in a uniform way, thus promoting and enhancing the Community's position in the world, that is, with especial reference to the American situation.
The committee's concern was that the Aviation Safety Agency's general political independence, for the issues involved are exclusively of a technical nature, in which decisions are to be taken by authoritative experts and specialists rather than by politicians in Parliament or the Council.
It was also important to guarantee the Agency's autonomy, meaning that the Executive Director really is the head of the authority and, at the same time, that the Management Board is in a position to lay down appropriate guidelines for the Agency and influence the way in which it works.
I know that this puts us into a conflict situation with the Council and the Commission, but I believe that our numerous discussions have brought solutions which of course ensure that the Commission's responsibility is made clear, that it will continue, so to speak, to supervise the Aviation Safety Agency, but that it is clear at the same time that the Aviation Safety Agency must also take responsibility for itself in its area of expertise.
I am confident that a conciliation procedure will be avoided, that we will be able to activate this regulation with the Council's agreement, and that the Agency will indeed be able to start work twelve months after that.
We have, in my judgment, taken a great step forward in the area of aviation safety.
I will take this opportunity to thank all of those who set this legislative project in motion and supported it, especially my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism.
I also thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to seek compromises, and now hope that today's vote will enable us to complete this report, and that we will then begin a new chapter in the history of aviation safety in Europe.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his report which now brings a sensible compromise to the original Commission proposal.
It is fair to say that all of us in this House would have fully supported the creation of a pan-European body dealing specifically with the certification of aeronautical products, which is eminently sensible and which I fully support.
However, my own view was that the scope of the original Commission proposal was too broad and there were a considerable number of concerns regarding the issues of sovereignty, the regulatory framework and in particular the autonomy of the proposed agency.
It must be emphasised that, as with national civil aviation authorities which quite clearly deal solely with safety matters, this agency should not be drawn into dealing with other aspects, such as environmental and competition issues.
In addition, I would expect it to work along similar lines to those of national civil aviation authorities whose responsibilities are as independent regulators.
Although I received a comprehensive response from the Commission regarding the future of the national CAAs, their role still needs to be further clarified in terms of their future scope and remit.
It should also be emphasised that efforts should continue to be concentrated on achieving uniform applicability of ICAO, JAA and Eurocontrol standards that are already in existence.
The safety agency should not seek to parallel and create unwilling distortions of the current ICAO-based safety framework.
Finally, as we would expect independent experts to run this agency, it would not be in anyone's interests should there be undue political or Commission interference, thereby potentially rendering the issue of safety a secondary factor.
My group believes that guaranteeing a high and uniform level of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation is the key objective in setting up the European Aviation Safety Agency and drafting attendant legislation.
This is a major and logical step on the way to a comprehensive European aviation policy.
Common rules create clarity and predictability, but can, at the same time, prevent duplication and thus save money.
Uniform European rules are in the interest of industry, but they must also enhance consumer safety, of course.
As far as we are concerned, the scope of the Agency may be broad, starting with certifying aircraft types, then extending the scope to include other elements, such as training.
Needless to say, we must make effective use of existing national capacities and build in a transitional period to move towards a fully-fledged Agency, although this period should remain limited.
We are not keen on a dual-track policy involving competing bodies.
So-called third countries must be persuaded to participate in improving safety agreements.
For this purpose, the European Union must develop a pro-active policy.
It should be reasonable, yet unyielding.
We must avoid leaks in the safety system due to a lack of sound agreements with countries that fall outside the scope of the proposed legislation and of the Agency.
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we adopted the rapporteur's compromise amendments.
We too would like to see this matter brought to a prompt conclusion. So we are calling on the Council and the Commission to respond in the same cooperative spirit.
The PSE Group praises the rapporteur's determination where the Agency's independence is concerned.
This is a key point for us too.
Safety, not the request for competences, must be top of the list.
Independence does not mean that the Agency is not accountable for its actions, and the European Parliament wants to take an explicit part in this.
We will assume our responsibility, even today, in setting up the Agency, but we should also be allowed to carry out our task as the European Parliament in a well-informed manner.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Schmitt for the excellent work he has done in preparing this report.
The formulation of common rules for civil aviation traffic and the establishment of an Aviation Safety Agency are important steps forward in the area of improved air safety.
Other important goals are improved levels of environmental protection, and the promotion of fair competition and proper certification processes.
To achieve these goals the Aviation Safety Agency must function as independently as possible.
The necessary acts must be applied uniformly at both national and Agency level.
Commonly applied rules will lead to greater cost-effectiveness and a reduction in superfluous administration.
The longer transitional period contained in the common position is necessary to allow time for the Member States to replace the current complicated regulatory and certification procedures with certificates.
Most air traffic accidents are due to human factors.
As aviation becomes ever more technically complex the compilation of data and information exchange are of paramount importance in the improvement of civil aviation safety.
Although air traffic has always been a relatively safe form of transport, its growth, as well as airport and airspace congestion have increased the risk of accident.
Close cooperation between Member States for the purpose of raising levels of civil aviation safety will be an important precaution as air traffic grows.
The safety of European airspace is in the interests of everybody.
In my opinion we should move towards a compromise as quickly as possible and avoid conciliation.
Mr President, Commissioner, with the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, the European Union is proposing to achieve and maintain a high level of safety and environmental protection, which are of genuine importance to European society and also to European integration.
We do, of course, support this idea.
I should like, in any event, to say that safety and the protection of the environment are closely connected to the distribution of airports, which is suffering, in practical and serious ways, as a result of the trend to centralise airports that is prevailing in most European States and which is being promoted by central governments, which, for political reasons and reasons of power, are concentrating investment in capital cities, and by the so-called flagship companies, which, for the same reasons are centralising their flights and sending them into the same airports.
Consequently, most of Europe, just like my own country, Galicia, is suffering considerable hardship through being deprived of decent lines of air communication, traffic is becoming concentrated to an extraordinary degree in the air corridors that link the capitals, and the communities that live near to these central airports suffer the consequences of the noise and the bottlenecks.
All of this militates against the sustainable development that we must try to achieve from the points of view of both safety and economics and from the social and environmental angles.
I would say that we are, therefore, facing a serious problem, which we must start to resolve.
Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, transport safety is an area in which combined efforts on the part of the EU countries can save thousands of lives.
We in Europe enjoy high levels of air safety but the growth in traffic continually obliges us to take more effective action.
I would however say, regarding this, that it is incomprehensible and even disgraceful that this proposal has not been made until now and was not put forward ten years ago.
In fact nations have been going their own way and politicising at the expense of human life.
National pride must make way for rational cooperation.
An Aviation Safety Agency could also be an example of EU integration at its best, provided that the pitfalls of bureaucracy are avoided.
In this we should learn from the United States of America, where they trust in people.
The concentration of information and harmonisation of standards are essential for the prevention of accidents, but regulations should not normally be tightened up only after accidents have occurred; instead, there should be a systematic analysis of present and future risks.
That, again, will not succeed unless all the Member States have the same tools at their disposal.
Our world is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, although this Chamber might not always be willing to admit it.
The Aviation Safety Agency should make decisions that apply to the world as a whole, whenever that is possible.
We should also support Article 2E proposed by the Council, as nothing good ever comes from enforced decisions.
Incidentally, I think that Parma would be a suitable location for the Aviation Safety Agency.
Parma's excellent food, such as its ham, would guarantee the contentment of the authorities working there and, hopefully, some equally mature decisions for air safety and the private individual in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's resolution on the Aviation Safety Agency is one of the first of many decisions that we have to take in the area of air transport.
A lot is moving in the skies above Europe.
The crisis in air transport following 11 September appears in the meantime to have been almost overcome.
Movements of aircraft are expected to double again by 2015.
The restructuring of air transport is in full swing.
The political response to these challenges is represented primarily by the Single European Sky and the optimisation of capacities at airports.
The present time demands continuity in the midst of change.
Safety in the air must be the highest priority in air transport.
Previous strategies to harmonise technical regulations have not been able to keep up with the breakneck pace of developments in the air transport sector.
This is another reason why we need the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is to be the heart of a future unitary safety framework.
I am glad that we have found a European response in this sensitive area.
We can chalk it up as a success in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission that it will be only a year after the Regulation enters into force that requirements for the operation of aircraft and for the approval of aircrew are timetabled to be drawn up, and that these measures are also to be applied to aircraft from third countries.
Safety aspects of airports are also to be included.
Turning to the agency's accountability, Parliament has succeeded in giving it greater independence, including from the Commission.
It has also been laid down that Member States are to make an appropriate contribution when external delegations of the Agency are set up on their territory - a contribution which I think Parliament will take to be financial in nature.
As a whole, discussion of the EASA shows that what we actually needed from the Commission is a framework directive on European agencies that would respond to the horizontal issues concerning a unitary structure for agencies.
It is still unsatisfactory that the problem of budgeting for agencies' income could not be resolved as the Committee on Budgetary Control would wish.
The Aviation Safety Agency will be followed by others, dealing for example with the safety of railways and ships.
I consider this overall strategy to be suited to advance the integration of European transport markets.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schmitt's excellent draft report puts us on the right track, but we are still not quite at our destination.
There must be safer air travel, at least within the EU, and its safety must know no frontiers.
That is our objective.
One of the key elements in achieving this objective is an Aviation Safety Agency that is capable of guaranteeing a uniform and high level of safety in the air on its own responsibility and with good organisation.
Well-organised, sole responsibility is the key word.
Parliament must continue to insist, whatever the Commission's supervisory responsibilities might be, that they remain of a supervisory nature and that the Commission and others do not make themselves out to be co-designers of all the details.
It is not only in the well-known proverb, but also in this present instance, that too many cooks spoil the broth.
We MEPs must therefore continue to insist, and do so over and over again, on the agencies being as independent as possible, and, for example, on the Agency's Executive Director having an important role internally and not just externally.
So we want other directors of the Agency to be appointed on the proposal of the Executive Director and hence on his responsibility.
There is something else that we want and need - legislation in force as soon as possible, so that the agency can take up its role in the service of greater safety in the skies of Europe with the minimum of delay.
We therefore hope that we will quickly agree on a common document with the Commission, but above all with the Council as well.
In its amendments, then, Parliament has been quite deliberately restrained where we believed that this common ground might be endangered, and we hope that the others will now join in too in search of this unity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I shall, like most of my fellow Members, praise the efficient work of the rapporteur, Mr Ingo Schmitt, who has worked in a constructive manner with the Council and the Commission.
As a result, we have a balanced compromise text and one which gives us every opportunity to avoid conciliation.
I would like to stress the quality of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the need to make up for lost time.
We have already waited too long.
In the area of transport, as in many other areas as well, it is our duty to ensure that a similar, high level of security is provided in the Member States.
It is also high time that the aeronautics industry benefited from a single certification for placing its products onto the market.
I hope that the European Aviation Safety Agency will be able to start work in the very near future and it must be able to provide a single certification for the Airbus A 380.
This will represent the completion of many years of work by engineers, staff and employees and it is evidence of what Europeans can do, what they can achieve when they work together.
It is a powerful symbol.
The first test flight of the A 380 is planned for 2004, the first commercial flight for 2006 - just around the corner, in other words.
In order to fulfil its tasks, the European Aviation Safety Agency must be independent and rely on skills and qualifications that can be found in the Member States.
As we know, the European Agency must not be used to coordinate the work of the existing national agencies.
We must firstly strive to be efficient, and, in this respect, it is easy to understand that for certification work, the European Agency must work in conjunction with the major European design and manufacturing companies.
I think that the regional agencies would be a good way to enable this to happen.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must offer practical advantages to its citizens.
To do this, we must provide the same level of security, for a single sky, and a single certification in a single market.
The text before us today is an important step in this direction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his work in full cooperation with the Commission and the Council.
This cooperation will allow us - we hope - to approve this text for the establishment of the Agency, foregoing the need to go to conciliation.
The main objective of the common rules in the field of civil aviation and the establishment of a European Aviation Safety Agency is to maintain a uniformly high level of safety throughout the European Union, and to better protect the environment, as mentioned by the last speaker a few moments ago.
Using this system, we will also be able to simplify the current procedures for aircraft certification, which will stimulate the internal market and the competitiveness of European products, as several speakers have pointed out.
The main instrument of the new system will be a common European certificate that will provide access to the whole European market and serve as a basis for recognition agreements.
As you are well aware, as this point has been highlighted throughout this debate, European industry is hoping that this Agency will be able to issue a certificate for its next star product: the Airbus 380.
The proposal therefore constitutes a considerable step forward, given the objectives it pursues.
Furthermore, this is also a true innovation in the field of Community integration, if we take into account the fact that up until now the civil aviation sector has been principally characterised by State sovereignty and intergovernmental cooperation.
Ladies and gentlemen, you approved the Commission proposal at first reading with several amendments. Many of these amendments have been accepted by the Commission and integrated into the Council's common position.
At this second reading, the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, wanted to insist on certain issues that had not been included in the common position.
The contacts established between the three institutions, which all want the European Aviation Safety Agency to be successfully established as soon as possible, mean that we have now reached a solution which is acceptable to all.
Therefore, I hope that today Parliament as a whole will be able to confirm its support for this text so that the approval of the Regulation can take place next June, with the establishment of the Agency from Summer 2003.
With regard to the amendments, I would like to point out that the new amendment, Amendment No 29, could compromise the fragile balance we have been able to achieve, as well as the expected timetable.
Consequently, the Commission cannot accept this amendment.
I would like to point out that Amendments Nos 1 and 4 have caused us many problems.
These amendments are proof of the European Parliament's will to rapidly extend the Agency's areas of responsibility to all sectors relating to safety, particularly with regard to licences for personnel and air operations.
With regard to the fundamental issue at hand, the Commission is of the same opinion as Parliament, but, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, I would like to say for the record that the Commission has several reservations with regard to any wording that could interfere with its right of initiative, as set out in the Treaty.
Therefore, the acceptance of Amendment Nos 1 and 4 can in no event be taken to imply any restriction of this right of initiative, inasmuch as these measures were already set out in our own work programme.
In the specific context of this issue, the Commission therefore accepts the amendments and confirms its will to put forward these proposals, whilst underlining the fact that this was already set out in our own timetable and pointing out that in no way can this be considered as any kind of restriction of our right of initiative, as set out in the Treaties.
The Commission can fully support the other amendments.
Many of these improve the text of the common position or clarify its content.
The Commission can also unreservedly support those amendments which increase the powers of the executive director and the provisions that aim to facilitate his or her appointment.
We can accept the amendments that aim to strengthen the Agency's autonomy, specifically Amendments Nos 9 and 11, and it seems completely reasonable that the Commission, not having the necessary technical knowledge, should not change the content of technical standards without the prior cooperation of the Agency.
These amendments have been written in such a way that Commission's right of initiative is preserved, for which I would like to thank Parliament.
Parliament, exercising its role as the budgetary authority, wanted to introduce an amendment, No 2, in which it calls for the establishment of common rules with regard to financial or other contributions that States often contribute in order that agencies may be set up in their own territories.
The Commission does not object to this.
Finally, Parliament also wanted to send a clear political signal by means of Amendment No 16, whose objective is to limit the period during which both Community and National certification systems can function.
The Commission considers that Parliament's arguments are justified, and for this reason, we can accept this amendment.
Lastly, with regard to Amendment No 15, Recital D, the Commission, like the Council and the rapporteur, understands - and I would like to stress this issue - that access to these locations must be strictly necessary and not indiscriminate.
I believe that with this in mind this issue can be settled.
Developments on this issue mean that we can expect the Regulation to be quickly approved and I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and Parliament as a whole for its approval, like the Council, foregoing the need to resort to conciliation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few minutes, at 12 noon.
The sitting is adjourned until Question Time.
This morning in London the funeral takes place of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, a woman whose century of service to Britain during Europe's most turbulent century has won for her a very special affection in the hearts of the British people.
I ask you, colleagues, as a mark of respect for the deceased Queen Mother, to observe one minute's silence.
(Members rose and observed one minute's silence)
Would the linguistic services please correct the text as requested by the rapporteur.
I now call upon the Commission to inform us of its position on the amendments.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his clarification, which I had also indicated in my speech.
In other words, we accept all of the amendments except for No 29.
In this way we hope to maintain the interinstitutional agreement, which will therefore allow us to approve the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Mr President, before we vote on this particular report, I think that it is important that Members are aware of the legal advice given by our own legal services, which was not available when we voted in committee.
This makes it quite clear that certain aspects of this report fall outside the scope of the Community's responsibilities referred to in Article 175.
The good news is that voting for Amendment 28 will solve all those problems.
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the following.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the amendments adopted today - with thanks to the plenary - have been adopted by the European Commission.
Yesterday, at the end of the debate, the European Commission said that it refused to be responsible for five or six amendments.
The way in which this was done at the end of yesterday's debate is objectionable in my view.
Why?
Because only the rapporteur is informed about the reasons why legally correct amendments are not adopted after all.
I therefore take the view that the Commission should justify its behaviour.
We cannot tolerate things being done one way one day and a different way the next for no apparent reason.
Additionally, the Commission should, in my view, reconsider the amendments that have now been adopted in a letter, and all my fellow MEPs should receive a copy of what should actually have been said in the debate.
Thank you very much.
A representative of the Commission is here and has heard your speech, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I hope she will be able to respond to your comments.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Schmitt report (A5-0093/2002)
Ebner (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Schmitt report because I consider it to be an extremely important report.
Indeed, both security and environmental protection are issues which should be taken even more seriously and supported for they are of paramount importance.
I have, on many occasions in the past, asked questions and spoken about both imposing a tax on kerosene and a single air space control system.
I hope that these initiatives, supported by other Members too, will have more impact on the Commission's work and the contribution made by the Members of Parliament and the responsible committees.
I hope that this road we have taken will be pursued with all speed.
Mr President, last night I was in Strasbourg, as many of us were.
I was with a Member of Parliament, whom I will not mention by name - it starts with an S - and two beautiful European Parliament officials, whom I will not name either - V and T - one blond and the other brunette, and we gazed at the starry sky of Strasbourg and tried to pick out the constellations.
You will not believe this, Mr President, but at one point, the Member who was with me said: 'What a beautiful starry sky!
How can we bear not to protect the environment through criminal law too and preserve the beauty of nature for ever?
Tomorrow, therefore, we must vote for this document.'
President.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for your indirect quotation of the great Kant.
Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, although Austria was originally opposed to a directive.
I really would like to thank the rapporteur.
I welcome her work, by means of which a most effective option has been put in our hands, partly through Article 2's listing of all offences.
Another reason for me to vote in favour of it was that the Commission had declared in its document, albeit without binding itself, that it would consider preparing legislation that provided for sanctions under criminal law on illicit activities in connection with nuclear materials.
If there is any real threat not only to the environment but also to human beings, it is that posed by atomic waste.
I think it simply ridiculous that we have a whole list of offences without a single sanction being provided under criminal law for deliberate or even negligent acts and damage in the nuclear domain.
I strongly urge the Commission, which is now no longer present, to submit a directive on this as soon as possible, and I will be repeating this call in a question.
Mr President, dear friends, I believe that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's thoughts about the directive are correct, but I must vote against certain points in the report because they deal far too carelessly with the principle of subsidiarity.
The most serious objection is to Amendments Nos 19 and 27, which the Commission too is unable to accept.
I believe that all actions which are to be criminalised should be mentioned specifically.
To approve the directive without stating explicitly which actions are to be punishable is incompatible with the principle of legality to which my political group and myself subscribe.
We must be more careful with the principle of legality where this matter is concerned.
Not even the environment can justify carelessness in deciding what is or is not criminal behaviour.
Otherwise, the report is excellent.
We Swedish Social Democrats abstained in the vote on the modified proposal and the legislative resolution.
We believe there is a need to create a common penal platform when it comes to the fight against environmental crime, and we are sympathetic to framework decisions in this area.
However, we have doubts about issuing a directive in this area, for there is no legal basis for imposing upon the Member States an obligation, within the framework of the first pillar, to introduce penal sanctions for breaches of environmental legislation.
As matters stand, there are no provisions in the Treaty establishing the European Community which confer such powers upon the Community.
I voted against the Oomen-Ruijten report which supports the Commission's ambition to include, in the list of Community responsibilities in the area of environmental protection, the definition of the principle of criminal sanctions against offenders.
As I said in yesterday's debate, we must instead support the Danish Presidency's wise initiative which urges Member States to impose stiffer penalties in this area. The initiative allows us to remain within an intergovernmental framework and this aspect of criminal law will remain one of the national responsibilities.
In fact, the Oomen-Ruitjen report and the Commission's proposal that it supports demonstrate how, through a short-sighted approach, where each stage seems to be the natural consequence of the previous one, but where the whole picture is not taken into account, Europe is gradually sliding towards a model that seeks to make everything increasingly uniform.
In reality, no one desires the ultimate consequences of this model, in which the nations would cease to exist.
In each specific matter and in each small step that we must take, however, the solution advocating uniformity is always put forward as the most rational.
This is how practical Europe is gradually diverging from the Europe of intentions, making people more uneasy.
- (DA) It is a sad fact that, to the detriment of the environment, environmental legislation is not satisfactorily complied with in the Member States.
The sanctions applied at present are inadequate and should therefore be extended.
If we have nonetheless voted today against the two reports on protection of the environment through criminal law, it is because we want this extension of sanctions and environmental protection to take place through an approximation of the penal regulations under the third pillar.
We wish to support the Danish initiative in the Council and to reject the Commission's proposal for a directive, together with the 'unionisation' of criminal law under the first pillar.
. I fully support the move to deal more effectively with the outstanding problem of pollution.
Indeed, calls to allow Member States to equate breaches of EU environmental law with a criminal offence will give a strong and positive signal that the EU is a serious player in the environmental domain.
By listing environmental crimes and a corresponding list of sanctions, the Commission draft directive provides a concrete means by which Member States will be able to enforce environmental law in symmetry, since at present, EU environmental policy is implemented in an ad hoc and asymmetric fashion.
Lastly, by adopting this directive, the EU will reinforce and bolster the explicit signal that it gave when signing up to the Kyoto protocol: that it is a responsible and key world player in the environmental domain.
Security in connection with football matches with an international dimension: my support for this report is so great - and how could it be otherwise - that, to promote it, I am organising a football match between unmarried Members of the European Parliament and married Members; the referee will, of course, be Mr GÃ©rard Deprez.
Moreover, in the interests of male-female equality, I am also going to organise a football match between female married and single Members of the European Parliament.
I propose that Mrs Lulling should be the referee and that you, Mr President, should kick off.
All those who wish to participate, please contact me at this email address: CFatuzzo@europarl.eu.int.
If you give me the ball to kick off, I am sure I will not stop until I score a goal!
Mr President, I proposed two amendments to this report.
One - Amendment No 20 - unfortunately failed to get through.
I am pleased that Amendment No 21 did.
The first amendment was to make sure that national information centres or relevant authorities or police forces, if offered information, would agree to their use in legal proceedings in the Member State where the football fan was arrested.
I tabled this because Mark Forrester, my constituent, was convicted in Belgium after the Euro 2000 match, even though the British Intelligence Service offered video evidence to the Belgian authorities showing him walking away from the problems and the violence.
That is why I tabled this amendment and indeed voted for it.
Unfortunately the Belgian authorities refused to use that.
I was hoping that this report would lay down a marker to say that the authorities ought to be able to use information given by national information centres to other Member States.
That would allow us to clamp down on real football hooligans; football fans who are innocent would not be caught in a trap.
. Due to the incompetence of Air France, I did not arrive in Strasbourg in time to speak as scheduled in the debate on international football issues last night and am grateful to my colleague Neil MacCormick for stepping in at short notice.
The scourge of violence - often organised violence - has plagued international football for years.
Initiatives aimed at increasing cooperation between authorities in different Member States are to be welcomed as a vital tool in the battle against hooliganism.
I voted for amendments initiated by the European Free Alliance Members, drawing attention to the fact that in at least one Member State there exists more than one national football team.
My own country, for example, is represented by an international team despite the fact that Scotland is not yet an independent Member State, and Scotland's supporters have for years had an unparalleled reputation for their good behaviour and good humour.
My Group's amendments give recognition to the distinctive footballing histories of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England, and simply recognise the reality that the UK has no single 'national' team.
The Deprez report is supposedly intended to deal with the problem of violence at international football matches.
And we say supposedly because the only proposal which either the report or the European Union Council has to make is that the Member States should be required to set up national football information points, that is, 'information points of a police nature', responsible for collecting, storing, processing, analysing and exchanging information on types of fans, both dangerous fans and fans in general.
This attempt to deal with the problem by using the police to suppress violence at football matches is merely an excuse for trampling the personal and democratic rights and freedoms of the citizens of the ?U underfoot.
The increase in violent clashes at national and international sporting events is not due to a lack of information networks or adequate suppression mechanisms; it is due to the commercialisation of sport, the huge financial interests tied up in it, the misleading fanatical 'sports' culture being fostered (hooliganism) and the increase in violent behaviour, especially among the young.
In other words, it is caused by situations which derive from the very nature of the capitalist system and neither the Council nor the European Parliament texts under debate makes any reference whatsoever to these serious issues.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
. I fully support the move to create a European network of permanent national football information points.
Such a common-sense and workable solution to the problems of football crime and disorder is long overdue.
Until recently, Member States have had to contend with and fight against such problems in virtual isolation.
Co-operation in this domain is a positive way to limit the negative effects that a few hooligans have on the game.
In order that co-operation is as close as possible, there must be an exchange of personal data of those few who pose a threat to security.
This does not pose a threat to individual privacy, but it does represent a boost to enhanced security at football matches.
We are discussing the report on the European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
On Friday afternoon and Saturday morning last, I was invited to take part, and duly did so, in the Congress of the Transnational Radical Party in Geneva. Moreover, I have also applied to join this party and been accepted as a member.
Since the principal, most important aim of this inter-party organisation is to combat all forms of violence in the style of Ghandi, in a non-violent manner, I thought it advisable to ask Mr Cappato, Mr Dupuis and Mr Dell'Alba, who were also at the Congress as leaders of this Transnational Radical Party, for advice on how to vote regarding this directive combating violence.
They assured me that I should vote for the motion, and I have therefore done so with pleasure.
Mr President, this speech is very revealing: it indicates, first and foremost, the Transnational Radical Party's capacity for expansion, its strength in being able to make its voice heard in plenary too at a time when, as you know, we are fighting for the rights of the Unattached Members.
Well then, it is good to hear a voice raised in the explanations of vote on behalf of the Radical Party too.
Secondly, to mark the entrance of Mr Fatuzzo into the party, he and I agreed during a meeting in which various different subjects were covered, although no recommendations were made regarding votes - for each person has the right to vote as he thinks best, of course - to vote for this resolution. This was done in a totally democratic way and no attempt was made to bind Mr Fatuzzo to voting recommendations made by the party.
Of our own free will, therefore, we all voted for this major text which represents a step forward towards the impending creation of the International Criminal Court, to be announced in two days' time by the UN Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, in Rome itself.
.
Within the 15 Member States of the EU a new framework has been put in place to fight organised crime following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This provides a mechanism for developing closer co-operation in the fields of police and judicial activities in the areas of criminal law.
Equally, it remains the preserve of the 15 Member States of the EU to maintain law and order within their own countries while safeguarding their internal security.
Parallel to the endorsement of the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Council has also launched two individual programmes to combat organised crime aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and establishing more efficient judicial co-operation.
The conclusions of the Tampere European Council certainly present strong political support for reaffirming the Union's wish to overcome difficulties with regard to prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime.
I fully support the prosecution of such crime while ensuring that the freedoms and legal rights of individuals are protected.
Certainly one of the key results of this new broader EU policy has been the broadening of powers to Europol.
Europol has become fully operational since July 1999, and since 1 January 2002 Europol can deal now with combating broad-ranging types of serious international crime.
This includes areas such as drug-trafficking, crimes involving illegal immigration networks, illicit vehicle trafficking, the traffic in human beings, forgery of monies, the illicit trafficking in radioactive nuclear substances, anti-terrorism measures and illegal money laundering activities.
(Abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
I congratulate Mr Di Lello Finuoli on his report, which he has infused with his expertise as a leading lawyer to provide useful recommendations regarding the Council framework decision, which, once again, is on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
Although I voted for the motion, I do personally feel that more tangible results might be achieved in the fight against environmental crime and against the harm done to the environment by fining those huge industrial companies which do so much damage to our environment in many parts of the European Union thousands or many millions of euro rather than imposing short jail sentences - which might even be quite happy, pleasant experiences.
The conflict between the Commission's directive and the Council's framework decision over 'penalising' Article 174 of the Treaty gives rise to the question: who does what in Europe?
While the Convention is examining the division of competences between the EU and the Member States, this draft text requires Community law to be extended beyond the letter of the Treaties.
Until 2004, we should apply a precautionary principle in institutional matters.
Do we need to make environmental crime part of the Community acquis, declaring that we have a better chance of achieving this objective at Union level?
Within the framework of the Treaty of Amsterdam, this issue falls under the third pillar (judicial cooperation in criminal matters).
To aim to punish all violations of environmental legislation is an unrealistic objective intended to meet the demands expressed by a few ecological lobbies which are powerful but are not representative.
Furthermore, I do not support the option advocated in the report by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, when he urges the Council to refrain from taking any action on environmental criminal law before the draft Directive on the protection of the environment is adopted.
Each Member State must be able, under its domestic legislation, to define those violations that are set out in the framework decision as criminal violations.
It is appropriate to punish some violations, provided that only the most serious are punished and that they are cross-border in nature.
This battle must, in the main, be fought at international level.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (DA) It is a sad fact that, to the detriment of the environment, environmental legislation is not satisfactorily complied with in the Member States.
The sanctions at present applied are inadequate and should therefore be extended.
If we have nonetheless voted today against the two reports on protection of the environment through criminal law, it is because we want this extension of sanctions and environmental protection to take place through an approximation of the penal regulations under the third pillar.
We wish to support the Danish initiative in the Council and to reject the Commission's proposal for a directive, together with the 'unionisation' of criminal law under the first pillar.
The ARGO programme is a good programme, which is designed to promote cooperation between the national administrations in the implementation of common regulations in monitoring external borders, visas, asylum and immigration.
It does not focus on the definition of this policy - a subject on which we could voice a great deal of criticism - but instead focuses solely on training the national administrations to carry out efficient, objective and, of course, entirely desirable work.
We have two reservations, however, which led us to vote against the Oostlander report.
The ARGO programme is organised by means of a partnership between the Commission and the Member States, but this partnership does not seem to be balanced.
For example, although the actions to be taken are proposed by the national administrations, the Commission alone has the right to choose which actions are retained, after having simply consulted a committee made up of national representatives.
The European Parliament's amendments have further strengthened the prerogatives of the Commission, more than the Commission itself wanted.
An amendment was adopted which calls for refugee status to be granted to people who have been subject to 'both state and non-state persecution'.
This extremely vague wording would open the asylum door to a whole crowd of new immigrants.
We must, of course, reject this type of irresponsible measure, which, moreover, bears no relation to the original subject of the report.
- (DA) I have today in the European Parliament voted in favour of the European Parliament's report on an action programme for administrative cooperation in the fields of external borders, visas, asylum and immigration.
I am nonetheless aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's position.
Mr Marinho has drawn up a report on a regulation on the examination of asylum applications lodged in a Member State by a citizen of a third country.
This report is extremely important - and I support it, for this is Europe - but I would like these documents to be examined more carefully and the reasons why so many third-country citizens want to enter the European Union to be ascertained too, for it can happen that some of them are not, so to speak, quite appropriate.
For example, I seem to remember that, in African countries, in developing countries of the Far East and also in countries near to us, preparations are being made to send elderly people to apply to enter Italy because there they will receive a million lire per month, providing they are over 65 years old, once their asylum application has been accepted.
I am certainly in favour of helping all citizens throughout the world, but I do feel that we need to examine the reasons motivating people to come to our States, in other words to ascertain whether they come to exploit laws which are particularly favourable to them or to seek work, thereby increasing our States' production.
When it came to Mr Marinho's report on rules for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, we Swedish Social Democrats voted against Amendment No 13 and abstained from voting where Amendments Nos 14, 15 and 24 were concerned.
Amendment No 13 from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes that asylum seekers should have their applications examined in those countries in which their family members have already sought asylum or been granted residence permits.
We wish to state that we advocate family reunification and believe that asylum seekers from the same family should be allowed to come to the same Member State.
However, to extend this principle - as in Amendment No 13, as we understand it - to include family members who are already in the country for other reasons could have far-reaching consequences, for it could cover all kinds of lawful reasons for having been granted a residence permit, for example in connection with studying.
Such a system would also militate against harmonisation of the ways in which refugees are received.
Contrary to the proposals by the Commission and by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Amendments Nos 14, 15 and 24 propose that appeals against decisions concerning which country should examine an asylum application should have a suspensive effect on the transfer of refugees from one Member State to another.
We believe that a suspensive effect is only acceptable in special cases.
We therefore abstained from voting where these amendments were concerned.
We are today examining a proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.
The regulation takes over the existing provisions of the Dublin Convention and improves upon them.
This receives our approval, because it is the result of a rigorous approach, where the Commission worked in close collaboration with national experts.
The fundamental principle has been maintained, whereby the Member State of first entry is responsible for processing the asylum application, but an additional principle has been added: each Member State is answerable to all the others for its actions concerning the entry and residence of third-country nationals and should, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility, assume the consequences thereof.
For example, when illegal immigrants apply for asylum in a Member State although they have previously stayed illegally in another, the latter must process the asylum application and it cannot shirk from this responsibility.
These provisions will obviously be applied in the case of France, which is allowing illegal immigrants to gather in Sangatte and the surrounding area, immigrants who then attempt to apply for asylum in Great Britain.
Several amendments to this proposal for a regulation were tabled by the highly active group of pro-immigration MEPs of the extreme Left.
The majority was fortunately rejected.
Some questionable amendments were adopted however, which explains why we had reservations with regard to the Marinho report.
.
My Labour colleagues and I have voted for Amendments Nos 13 and 24 to Article 20 and Amendment No 15 to Article 21 of the Marinho report.
These amendments ensure that decisions on transfers of asylum seekers will have suspensive effect.
Without this right, asylum seekers could be shuffled between Member States whilst the outcome of their appeal is pending.
.
Earlier today I voted against Mr Marinho's report on the proposal for a Council regulation to determine which Member State will be responsible for processing asylum applications lodged by third-country nationals.
I believe strongly that the UK, as an island, occupies a unique position within the EU.
We have always been responsible for our own policy decision-making on asylum applications and illegal immigrants and we should continue to do so.
Flaunting of the Geneva Convention, as we see on a daily basis at present, is shameful.
As and when this Council regulation is imposed, will it improve the situation or will France continue to play wing three-quarters with its illegal immigrants?
- (DA) I have today in the European Parliament voted in favour of the European Parliament's report on examining an asylum application.
I am nonetheless aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's position.
We have abstained from voting on Amendment No 16 in order to support Amendment No 12 from our own group instead.
We support the idea that registered partners should also be counted as family members but believe that this is provided for within the concept of 'unmarried partners'.
We should also like to see more Member States change their legislation so that it recognises registered partnerships for homosexuals and the circumstances in which they cohabit.
In applying the definition of family members, it is important however that the principle of subsidiarity should prevail.
It is not appropriate for the European Parliament and the Council to change the Member States' family legislation by means of a directive concerning asylum policy.
In Amendment No 12, we have therefore proposed that partners of the same sex should be recognised as family members if legislation or practice in the Member State that receives them entails unmarried couples, same-sex couples and married couples being treated in the same way.
The proposal for a regulation will suffer from the same weaknesses as the Dublin Convention since the basic principles are, fundamentally, identical.
The greatest burden is now placed upon the countries of the east and south, which must receive the highest numbers of people applying for asylum.
The report makes some progress, however, and puts forward some positive points that must not be dismissed and that is why we voted in its favour.
A single Member State is responsible for the asylum application, the concern for family unity is given greater importance, and the personal details of asylum applicants and the members of their families are still relatively protected.
Replacing the Convention with a regulation is therefore subject to interpretation by the Court of Justice and monitoring by the Court and by the Commission, is a further step towards achieving an area of freedom, security and justice.
Mr President, with the phasing-out of controls at common borders, this report includes provisions which will make it easier for citizens to be followed by the police when they cross the Union's internal borders.
I therefore intended to vote for the motion but I was assailed by a doubt.
Still last night, I dreamt that I was in Paris at the Lido, having dinner with a beautiful women, the woman of my dreams, and while I was watching the Bluebells dance, I saw two strangely hairy legs waving about: they were so hairy - they belonged to Mr von Boetticher - that I had quite a shock and I realised that he was a policeman following me, hired by my wife to find out whether I was here at the European Parliament or in Paris at the Lido watching the Folies BergÃšres or the Bluebells dance.
Well then, in the end, Mr President, I decided to abstain in the vote, to avoid such situations, which are probably beyond the objectives of the report.
We abstained from voting on the von Boetticher report on the changes to the cross-border surveillance procedure (Article 40 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985) as it has a tendency, as I said in yesterday's debate, to transform the right of pursuit in the area of surveillance into a more extensive right to intervene, which may mean that responsibilities become more confused in a Europe that has no internal borders.
Furthermore, the text also has a tendency to transform cross-border surveillance into a sort of isolated stopgap measure to compensate for the shortcomings of the police in some Member States, on whose territory their neighbours could intervene more easily.
The European Parliament's explanatory statement contains some surprising comments published by the German Ministry of the Interior and I quote, word for word: 'One neighbouring Member State continues frequently to insist on the handover of surveillance at the border.
Problems arise because, by virtue of restrictive national provisions on working hours, after a certain period of surveillance the surveillance units halt the surveillance and/or do not resume it the following day because of manpower shortages'.
I hope that the name of this mysterious Member State neighbouring Germany does not begin with the letter 'F'.
Whatever the case, the problem cannot be resolved by greater police intervention in the Member States.
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the report on checks at the common borders but have certain reservations concerning Amendment No 4 through which the police would, in certain circumstances, be given the ability to carry out identity checks and provisionally arrest people in the territory of another Member State.
We also wish to highlight Amendment No 1, which would give the police from another Member State the right to continue surveillance if the receiving Member State were not in a position to do the same.
The national police force's monopoly on the use of force is a basic rule in a democratic society.
As is also stated in the Schengen Convention, police should only have the power to take action in another Member State in very special circumstances.
Giving foreign police the right to take over surveillance or make arrests in another Member State obviously means that the work concerned can be done more efficiently.
At the same time, it is important to point out that, when it comes to action taken by foreign police, the legislation of the receiving Member State reigns supreme.
The regulations and traditions of the Member States vary, especially where procedures for identity checks and arrests are concerned, and they should not be subject to harmonisation.
It must be ensured that the right of the police to carry out surveillance of suspected criminals outside the police's own Member State is not abused and that local legislation and regulations are fully complied with.
There must also be guarantees that all the requirements of the Schengen Convention are observed in their entirety before foreign police take action in another Member State.
That concludes voting time.
Mr President, this House has this morning approved the Minutes of yesterday's sitting.
There is a contradiction between what was approved this morning and the verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday.
In the Minutes we approved this morning, in the part concerning my words yesterday, at the end of the paragraph it says that "the President cut him off, pointing out that this matter had already been raised".
In the first place, what I mentioned was not raised by the President.
But in the verbatim report there is no mention of how I was interrupted.
I would like the verbatim report to include the words: "The President cut him off".
This is not a minor point.
The President stopped me exercising my right of free speech.
He was nervous when I mentioned that one man was killed by the Guardia Civil.
I was trying to explain what had happened.
I was not able to do that.
For the future, I expect and hope that this House will respect the right of every MEP to free speech and that situations such as yesterday's will never happen again.
I would ask Vice-President Dimitrakopoulos to accept that he acts in an indelicate and partisan manner as a Member of the PPE Group of this Parliament.
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I have just two things to say.
Firstly, I consider that my fellow Member, Mr Dimitrakopoulos behaved entirely correctly, clearly respecting all the Rules of Procedure. Secondly, we will, of course, endeavour to make the text of the Minutes consistent with the verbatim report so that both say exactly the same thing.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the Council statement on defence policy, including EU/NATO relations and the following two oral questions:
O-0089/01 - B5-0012/02 to the Council by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on European armaments policy;
O-0090/01 - B5-0013/02 to the Commission by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on European defence-related industry.
I am very pleased this afternoon that we are joined by a Defence Minister from the presidency.
In plenary session that represents a precedent.
This is the first time in the European Parliament that the emerging policy and politics of European security and defence has had a debate led by a Defence Minister.
That is an important contribution.
I want to thank the Minister of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to express my enormous personal satisfaction and that of the Spanish Government at this first appearance, as has been highlighted by the President, which, furthermore, if you will allow me, is for me a re-acquaintance with the parliamentary world.
I had the honour of presiding over the Spanish Parliament - the Spanish Cortes Generales - during the last legislature as President of Congress and my true and definitive political vocation is a parliamentary one.
Consequently, it has also been an honour for me to have the opportunity to receive the Chairmen of the Defence Committees of the Parliaments of the fifteen countries of Europe, together with the representatives of the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU, in order to deal, quite rightly, with the objectives of the Spanish Presidency of the Union during this six-month period, which I also explained in this Parliament's Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 18 February.
I would like to start by describing the form my speech will take: I would firstly like to briefly point out the precedents and principles which inspire the European security and defence policy and then move on to an analysis of the objectives of the Spanish Presidency in the three areas into which these objectives have been grouped. The operational dimension, the institutional dimension, and equally importantly, the dimension relating to all the issues of concern to public opinion, both national and European.
To start with the precedents, I must point out that our real mandate, following the Saint-Malo meeting, started in December 1999 in Helsinki when it was decided to create a European rapid reaction force, which would consist of at least 60 000 troops deployable within two months and for at least one year and including logistical support and air, sea and land resources for carrying out the missions we have christened 'Petersberg tasks', in a reference to the famous palace near Bonn where they were analysed, and which are basically the maintenance or enforcement of peace and rescue and humanitarian missions, which will have to be created by 2003.
Therefore, since the beginning of 2000, in just two years, we have largely been able to implement this main objective in such a way that, following the Portuguese and French Presidencies, bodies were created which were initially transitional and which are now permanent, and a catalogue of military capabilities has been created, which has since been updated and to which the contributions of six aspiring countries have been incorporated and which was revised by the previous Belgian Presidency, whose work I am grateful for.
The military objective slowed down somewhat during the Swedish Presidency, although that Presidency did make good use of its time to develop civil crisis procedures and management bodies.
As you know, the Laeken European Council declared this rapid reaction force operable, but I must say frankly that this operability is for the moment more virtual than real, and this means that the Spanish Presidency's mandate is even more urgent following the events of 11 September.
I would now like to briefly indicate the principles and firstly point out, as this House knows very well, the intergovernmental nature of the area we are dealing with from which, furthermore, stems the principle of voluntarism, the direct link to the European Council and the sui generis organisation of this area, which includes the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General, who will subsequently have the opportunity to speak to this House concerning another area, the PSC, the Military Committee and the European Military Staff.
The second principle is that of mission speciality.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this principle of speciality must be understood as a principle of evaluation, and I therefore repeat that we are talking exclusively about military missions for the carrying out of Petersberg tasks, humanitarian peace enforcement or peacekeeping missions, or rescue missions.
Hence one of the difficulties, Mr President, in including the contribution of European military capabilities to defending against external terrorism, when necessary, which is connected to the main priority of the Spanish Presidency, which is the fight against terrorism and which, nevertheless, in the current state of development of our missions as a result of the principle of evaluation, we cannot undertake without a prior Council declaration which I will refer to later if there is time.
The third principle is that of subsidiarity, obviously not in the traditional sense understood by this House and by all European law, the former Community law, but simply in the sense that our tasks as Europeans in the Europe of the security and defence policy are subsidiary to national defence, which corresponds - since it still forms part of that core, previously a hard core, of sovereignty - to national governments.
It is undoubtedly also subsidiary to collective defence, which for the majority of the countries of the Union is attributed to the Atlantic Alliance, so that our missions, in turn, are in this respect subsidiary to the collective defence which falls to the Atlantic Alliance, but are no less autonomous for that.
Therefore the fourth principle is the principle of complementarity, so that, by appropriately combining the structures of the Atlantic Alliance with those of the European Union, we can maintain those principles, which common sense suggests are absolutely essential in order that there be no duplication or redundancy of structures, planning or expenditure.
At the end of the day investments in defence are like the two sides of the same coin, as in the case of our common currency.
Please allow me now to refer, before listing the objectives of the Spanish Presidency, to the slogan chosen by this Presidency for this six-month period: as you know, 'more Europe', which applies both internally and externally.
More Europe internally means, in terms of the European security and defence policy, that the European citizens should acquire a greater awareness of the need for a common foreign and security policy.
More Europe externally means no more and no less than confronting an essential need.
Ladies and gentlemen, please believe me that I am expressing not only a personal opinion but also that of the Spanish Government when I say that the European security and defence policy is an essential need for the European Union.
If Europe wants to have a united presence in the world it is essential that it has a common security and defence policy.
The European Union cannot have credibility in the world without having its own united voice in the field of security and without that voice being accompanied and supported by military capabilities.
We have had the opportunity to witness this shortcoming.
I also believe, ladies and gentlemen, that neither is it feasible in the long term to have a common monetary policy if there is no European common foreign and security policy to support that currency.
As I said earlier, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can group the objectives for these six months of the Spanish Presidency into the following three areas: operative or operational objectives, institutional objectives and objectives relating to public opinion.
Beginning with the operative objectives, which are clearly the most technical, I must tell Parliament that they were the main focus of the informal meeting I held with the my colleagues, the Defence Ministers of the Union, on 22 and 23 March in Zaragoza.
We have all decided to make the Headline Goal and its military capabilities our main priority.
And in this respect I must firstly point out that we are working on determining the immediate response elements for the possible carrying out of the Petersberg tasks agreed in Helsinki.
This need to determine the elements for immediate response also stems from the recently proven need to choose certain capabilities for the Headline Goal - its catalogue - so that there may be procedures to allow it to be mobilised immediately in the event of crisis.
We have not simply tried to construct a mini Headline Goal, nor to create a parallel Headline Goal, but to determine the procedures for selecting capabilities that would be available in the initial moments in order to confront a crisis more rapidly.
Secondly, we are promoting progress in the designation of a general operational headquarters.
To put it clearly, with the informality which is normal in a parliamentary debate, the Laeken Declaration on Operational Capability does not for the moment tell us where the general operational headquarters to lead a force commissioned to carry out a Petersberg task in a situation of crisis would be.
We still do not know, but neither do we know what the elements of that force which would have to be deployed in the initial moments would be.
Therefore, these two objectives are essential to making the Declaration on Operational Capability effective.
There are sufficient offers of general headquarters to determine what the immediate future of those general headquarters may be.
We need to ensure - and we have established the requirements - the corresponding multinationality of its structures and the harmonisation of its procedures and operation.
The Presidency will continue to promote lines of action for the work on this issue: developing normalised operational procedures which will govern the operation of future general headquarters and, secondly, also participating in the general headquarters panel which has been created within the European Action Plan that I will now refer to.
In fact, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken Council approved a Belgian proposal, sponsored by the Netherlands, for an action plan for European military capabilities.
It is simply the working method for indicating the shortcomings of our catalogue and for providing the means to resolve that lack of capability.
By mobilising the Chiefs of Defence Staff of each of the Member States, the Spanish Presidency sought to determine what they saw as the most significant shortcomings in capability in the catalogue.
An answer was given in record time and seventeen panels of experts have been created and are now operating, and they are working on analysing solutions for the twenty-three priorities or shortcomings considered the most important.
For our part, we are making a cooperative effort to head four of these panels, which, by way of example, relate to attack helicopters, in-flight refuelling, air carrier capability and field hospitals.
We are also participating in eight other panels.
In Zaragoza, we held a preliminary exchange of views on the direction to take for the provision and funding of the new capabilities that are necessary as a result of the studies under way and original ideas for common funding have been put on the table, which we are studying and which perhaps I will also be able to explain in detail later on.
Furthermore, and in accordance with the permanent objective of transparency in our actions with regard to the Atlantic Alliance, the European Union group of experts known as the Headline Task Force is already operating and carrying out studies and is meeting frequently during our Presidency together with NATO experts, who will continue to support this process with full cooperation and transparency with the work of the Atlantic Alliance in order to develop its defence capability initiative.
In this field I must also mention the need for us to create a mechanism for developing capabilities which can clearly indicate at any time our situation in terms of European capabilities or lack thereof.
It must naturally be an autonomous European Union mechanism but at the same time, for our own benefit, it must draw on the positive experiences of the Atlantic Alliance.
There is no doubt that the greatest difficulty lies in the relationship with planning procedures of the Alliance forces in aspects such as the appropriate form and the tasks of the group of capabilities.
That no doubt brings us to an important, if not decisive, aspect, not just of our Presidency, but of the development of the European security and defence policy, which is the relationship between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, the development of the so-called Berlin Plus agreement, particularly in the chapter relating to the permanent access of the European Union during crisis management processes to NATO's capabilities.
The Barcelona European Council stressed the importance of reaching and concluding permanent agreements between the European Union and NATO as soon as possible and has charged the Presidency and the Secretary-General, the High Representative, with making the necessary high-level contacts in order to make the negotiations a success.
Our Heads of State and Government have simply stated that we cannot go on delaying the creation of a permanent framework for cooperation with NATO and that ad hoc or case-by-case solutions could lead to situations of stalemate similar to those we have already seen and would harm the Union at the least appropriate time, at the point of implementing, for the first time, a crisis management operation, seriously jeopardising its present and future prestige.
Mr President, I will leave, in case there is greater interest on the part of the honourable Members, the examination of the assumption by the European Union of the leadership of certain missions, both in relation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the continuation of the Amber Fox operation, and the assumption of certain responsibilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it remains for me in this field to mention the importance of the CME 02 exercise, which will test our capacity for organisation by means of crisis management procedures in May.
It is going to take place during the Spanish Presidency and I can guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that the difficulties which initially seemed insoluble are being overcome and also confirm to you that we will carry out this exercise not only on the date set but - I am sure - with success, giving an appropriate role to the various European Union institutions, such as the Military Committee, the Political and Security Committee, the Secretary-General, the High Representative, and the Chiefs of Staff.
I referred to a second area, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, which is the institutional field.
In this regard I must point out that Spain, together with certain other countries, has promoted the need to create and formalise a Council of Defence Ministers.
Please understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not just a question of adding another Council to the European institutional galaxy; it is simply a question of those of us who hold this responsibility being able to fulfil it, being able to work.
We neither want to replace nor interfere with the competences of the Foreign Ministers; we simply want to do our work, to be able to deal with the problems I have referred to: the effectiveness of the Headline Goal and the possible deployment of Petersberg tasks.
To this end, the Council is of essential importance.
We have taken a first big step, because it has enjoyed full consensus, which is the meeting, under the umbrella of the General Affairs Council, of the Council of Defence Ministers, consisting solely of Defence Ministers, during May in Brussels.
Secondly, and within the institutional objectives, I will move on to discussing the bases for a European arms policy, which will also provide an answer to the questions and concerns of Mr Brok.
In reality, although very briefly mentioned in the Helsinki declaration, there had so far been no attempt to implement - or at least to establish the bases, to pave the way to - a European arms policy.
And we wanted to take this step in a decisive manner.
It is in no way a question of interfering with the European arms industry, which would not fall within our competence, but it is a question of setting the bases, the elemental principles, of a European arms policy.
Earlier I said that the European security and defence policy is absolutely essential to the Union, and an arms policy is also essential to any defence policy.
We have therefore prepared a kind of decalogue - the number of principles is of minimal importance at the end of the day - which achieves consensus on the broad principles that would govern a European arms policy.
This list is based on the notion that the European arms industry must be at the service of the CFSP and not the other way round - which may seem an obvious principle, but in reality quite the opposite is usually true - and that it must be based on the principles of voluntarism, transparency and coordination with other organisations.
Amongst the concrete measures envisaged we also incorporate the harmonisation of operative requirements, the common use of capabilities, the possible acquisition of those capabilities via a European arms agency, which unifies or at least coordinates the existing ones, the study of an accounting system more suited to reality, which facilitates the long-term funding of certain systems and also the search - as I said before - for new common funding formulas.
The need to define a methodology to deal in the medium and long term with the lack of capability identified in the Helsinki catalogue brings us to these principles of a European arms policy, which will be examined by the national arms directors of the various countries at a meeting organised by the Presidency for 29 April.
Finally, Mr President, I am coming to the end of the time available to me and, in trying to sum up aspects which are no less important but which are clearly not the essential priority, the operational aspects, please allow me to refer, in the seconds remaining to me, to those aspects which relate to the creation of an awareness of European defence amongst public opinion and to aspects connected to that awareness.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed events which require us to construct a legal acquis of humanitarian law for Petersberg tasks in the future.
When Spain made this proposal the events of 11 September had not yet taken place.
After 11 September, some months afterwards, certain events have demonstrated that it is absolutely essential for us to clarify the law applicable to crisis situations.
I am clearly referring to the treatment given to prisoners, the treatment of the civil population, the treatment of private property and the relationship with civil authorities in the implementation of these tasks.
We thought that this could be a road which starts in Salamanca, European Capital of Culture during these months, where many years ago, in the sixteenth century, the ius ad bellum and the ius in bello were born, and to that end we have also called a meeting in Salamanca in May, to which the representatives of all the countries of the Union and also third countries are of course invited, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency could not ignore the Mediterranean dimension of the CFSP.
As you know, a meeting has been scheduled for 22 and 23 April in Valencia, which is very timely.
We did not want the CFSP to be left out of this Mediterranean dimension and, to that end, we have also scheduled a seminar in Barcelona for 20 and 21 April on the Mediterranean dimension within our common security and defence policy.
It is simply a question of letting the southern Mediterranean countries know that the Headline Goal is not a threat, even less against them: it is a question of establishing stable contacts with their armed forces, with their governments, which enrich the Mediterranean as an area of security and prosperity.
And finally, also with this objective, there will be a meeting in Cartagena, following a Belgian initiative, of the people responsible for public opinion within the various defence departments, together with specialists from various media, in order to give new impetus to the understanding and communication of our message to the European citizens.
If I may be allowed to abuse your patience, Mr President, I would like to make a final brief comment, which I believe to be important, on terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have already pointed out that the Spanish Presidency - and President Aznar was able to say this in this House - treats the fight against terrorism as its main priority.
In these circumstances, there is no need to stress why Spain is morally obliged to place the fight against terrorism at the forefront of its Presidency.
We have given the subject much consideration together with our defence colleagues in the European Union and we agree that the fight against terrorism should not fall within the Petersberg tasks, as I previously anticipated.
We also agree that the fight against internal terrorism in the Union should correspond to the Rule of Law by means of its normal procedures, by means of courts of law and State security forces, but we could not remain passive in terms of the defence of our citizens in the face of possible terrorist attacks from outside the Union, which would undoubtedly require these common military capabilities we are trying to create.
I am referring to our capabilities to tackle arms of mass destruction, NBC - nuclear, bacteriological or chemical - and also to our intelligence capabilities, the ability of our forces to protect themselves during missions and, finally, our capability to protect what has come to be known as the common space or European single sky.
These capabilities, these tasks, make up the considerations and the basic approaches of a document being prepared by the Spanish Presidency to submit to the Seville European Council, where we hope it will be approved and for which we would also like the support, as for everything I have mentioned, of this Parliament.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for this debate, especially as we are also celebrating a premiere in the debate being opened by the Defence Minister of the Spanish Presidency.
I think this is a positive message, one that we receive as such and for which we are grateful.
Mr President-in-Office, I also think you were right in what you said at the end about terrorism and what Spain is quite rightly trying to do about it.
Looking, though, at the post-11 September political landscape, I feel that here too we may have taken a lot of decisions and discussed a lot of things, but that a lot of momentum has been lost in the national ministerial machinery as regards the actual implementation of this campaign against terrorism and the clarification of the issues on the interface between external and internal security.
In this very week just past, the European Mission in the Middle East has shown us how little political influence we have.
One reason for our lack of influence is that, alongside our great efforts on the foreign aid front - the European Union gives three times as much in overseas aid as the United States of America - and despite our growing involvement in the field of civil crisis management, we are still not in a position to give real security guarantees because our military capacity is still far from sufficiently developed.
The decisions we have made in recent years, ranging from the Treaty of Amsterdam by way of Cologne to the present day, were outstanding, but their implementation is still, in many areas, deplorable in the extreme.
Following as I do the debates in some of our Member States on the A 400 M cargo aircraft, they indicate to me that the objective may well be in view and figures are perhaps provided, but the actual implementation and equipment are inadequate and too slow; hence we play a small role because we are not taken seriously, because we cannot really deliver, and because things are not being implemented as they should be.
This brings us, of necessity, to the institutional issues.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I disagree with your statement that this is an exclusively intergovernmental function.
Overseas aid and civil crisis management are to a large extent a matter for the first pillar and their financing should be handled via the Budget.
It is not solely and exclusively an intergovernmental function, but a combined one, and, seeing that its weaknesses are on the intergovernmental side, we therefore think that the Convention must make improvements and come to final decisions notwithstanding the need to allow for issues of national sovereignty, which play a role in this issue.
We cannot, with Brussels, come to majority decisions to the effect that the soldiers of every EU country are to go to war.
The national parliaments have important things to say about this.
Yet we must, for example, get the idea of enhanced cooperation accepted, in order to bring into being a coalition of the willing.
In Nice, we achieved this everywhere except in the area of defence policy, just where we needed it most.
In Nice, this was, alas, prevented; we must make the decisive breakthrough now.
We want, clearly, to do this jointly with our partners in NATO, which is indispensable to collective security.
We also have to organise European security and defence policy in such a way that those NATO states that are not in the EU do not feel themselves excluded.
An intensive dialogue must take place, and hence I also think it right that we should find a solution with Turkey so that there is a proper process of consultation if something happens in Turkey's vicinity.
In this sense, it is to be hoped that the agreements, which we have unfortunately not had officially submitted to us, represent steps in the right direction.
The Council, though, must take up a clear position, so that the European Union's autonomous right of decision as such is not thereby jeopardised.
Perhaps this will be supplied in the course of this debate, and we will thereby become more secure in our position on this issue.
We must recognise that we agree on many things, but not on how they are to be implemented.
This is true also of arms policy.
We see how there is an ever-growing technological gap between Europeans and the USA, and that we are no longer able to really wage war together, because the technological differences have become so massive.
This has catastrophic consequences, not only for our defence policy capacity, but also in terms of industrial policy, which makes it also an issue for Europe's internal market.
I am glad to see Commissioner Liikanen here with Commissioner Patten.
I can well imagine that this interface with industrial and arms policy will mean that the European Research Framework Programme for Joint Projects could increasingly be used in the field of military research.
Perhaps consideration could be given to how this might be done and to how resources can be pooled in acquiring equipment.
There are certain things that we can acquire jointly - transport capacity is one example - in order to synergise on that basis in maintenance, acquisitions and much else, thus achieving more reasonable costs.
We spend 60% of what the United States does on military requirements, but with 10% of the outcome that they achieve.
This obviously has to do with us being organised in the wrong way.
This means, if our budget resources really are tight even at a European and national level, that it must surely be possible for us to organise ourselves in such a way - that is, on Community lines - as to do what has to be done and achieve the desired effects in our common interest.
This naturally involves the arms exports issue and the clarification of European competences in order to remove the lack of uniformity in the code of conduct.
The European Union must get better at protecting its interests, including the military ones, and also in order to secure peace.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree with you, and believe that the example you have given is a very good one, that a community with a common currency also has common interests in security policy.
This is a reason why we must reach the point where, in a European Union with an internal common market, a common currency and a common legal system, we no longer have areas with a lower standard of security.
We must enforce a common standard of security.
I wish to express my gratitude for our being permitted to advance this in a cooperative process.
Mr President, Minister, let me first thank Parliament for giving the Commission this opportunity to debate the vital matters covered by these motions, and let me also thank the Council presidency for the contribution it has just made through the Spanish Minister of Defence, who made an extremely interesting and important speech.
I particularly endorse all that he said in his closing remarks about terrorism and the importance of giving terrorism the priority which it deserves to be given by pluralist democracies.
Some Member States have a particular concern about defeating terrorism in all its manifestations.
As you said, Mr President, my colleague Mr Liikanen will intervene in a moment on defence trade and production issues but let me say something about the Commission's overall approach to security and defence.
I start from the extremely strong conviction that it is not possible to divide foreign policy neatly into civil matters on the one hand, and military and defence issues on the other, as if they were unrelated and as if they could be handled without reference to one another.
The European Security and Defence Policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy.
The Treaty requires that the Commission should be fully associated with that policy.
The Commission has no direct role in military aspects, which are themselves limited by the Treaty to the so-called Petersberg tasks.
But in practice our full association with the common foreign and security policy means that we are closely involved in the policy as a whole.
That is as it should be - because a coherent overall European security, conflict prevention and crisis management policy is bound to embrace both civil and military matters, and this is a point to which I want to return at the end of my remarks.
The European Union has international relationships and programmes in many fields covering, for example, energy, environment, economic cooperation, human rights, justice and home affairs, external assistance programmes and so on. It may be that, in a crisis, initiatives are taken which also involve military deployments, or have other defence implications.
But in that case the military element is one strand in what must be a seamless and integrated European policy towards the country or region in question.
Take the example of the Western Balkans which we have debated so often in this Chamber.
After a long period of bloodshed and inter-ethnic strife culminating in the successful military campaign to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the European Union launched a concerted effort to restore stability and to bring about thoroughgoing political and economic reform in the region.
We have created a framework of Stabilisation and Association Agreements to encourage regional integration and to give these countries a long-term political perspective of European Union membership.
We are managing a key part of the UN Mission in Kosovo.
We also took initiatives such as the Energy for Democracy programme in Serbia, which had explicitly political, as well as economic and humanitarian objectives.
All these have been elements - and important elements - of an integrated European security and conflict prevention policy in the region.
The European Commission continues to play a central part in the conception and execution of that policy.
But the EU's policy in the region has also involved military deployments - for example in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where NATO deployed overwhelmingly European forces in support of a political settlement at a time of rising inter-ethnic tension and violence.
The deployment had to be closely co-ordinated with what the European Union was already doing.
Mr Solana and I were directly involved in mediation at the time the force went in, as Parliament knows.
The Commission supported the political purposes of the military deployment through its Rapid Reaction Mechanism, helping to restore confidence in the region and to reduce inter-ethnic tension through an emergency house-reconstruction programme and through other measures.
Now, at the European Council in Barcelona, heads of government have expressed the European Union's availability to take responsibility for a follow-on military operation, if certain conditions can be fulfilled, including permanent arrangements on European Union-NATO cooperation.
The Commission is not directly involved in that decision, which touches upon the physical security of national military personnel deployed in the region - nor do we seek direct involvement.
But, again, we must be associated in so far as this will add value to the European Union's overall effort.
We need to be able to make our voice heard because, as I have said, military decisions also have implications for the European Union's comprehensive security policy in the wider sense, as I have described it.
The linkages between defence and military aspects of CFSP, and the more traditional areas of Community concern, are complex and often politically sensitive.
The European Commission stands ready to play its part in using the potential of the Treaty to help to develop a strong, efficient and viable European armaments industry.
It is clear from the motions before us today that this is as the European Parliament would wish.
Most Members of this House, for example, would support the Commission's initiative to launch the Advisory Group on Aerospace - or STAR 21 as it is known - to consider the strategic challenges faced by the European Union in that crucial sector.
We welcome the participation in that Group of Carlos Westendorp, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and of Karl von Wogau.
We are ready to play our part as I say.
But we need to proceed in such matters in close cooperation with Member States who retain national responsibility for many of the policies involved.
The linkages between civil and military concerns, and between European Union and national responsibilities, in the conduct of an integrated security and crisis management policy are still being thought through.
