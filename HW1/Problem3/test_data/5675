In general, we were expecting greater impetus, but our stance will, however, be constructive.
It is not in our interests to list expenditure, but to defend the rights of Parliament and of the European Union.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, it would seem that the many Members who are absent consider todayâs presentation to be merely a routine procedure.
Yet this is by no means the case for myself or for the Commissioner, who can even understand me when I speak Polish.
What is so special about 2006?
Firstly, it is the final year of the current Financial Perspective.
This means that new and expensive tasks have appeared that did not feature in our earlier plans, and as a result funding will be tight, especially under the third and fourth headings.
We will inevitably have to reach additional agreements with the presidency, which by then will be British.
Secondly, 2006 is a transitional period towards the new Financial Perspective.
As such, it presents us with a problem regarding the level of payments, which is nearly EURÂ 7Â billion lower than the ceiling for payments as a percentage of GNI set in the Financial Perspective, and lower than the 2005 level of 1.03%.
We should give careful thought to the extent to which this will meet our real needs in 2006.
Although some features of the 2006 budget are familiar from previous years, there are some new priorities. These include an attempt to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy by means of a new injection of funds.
According to the Commissioner, funding for this Strategy will increase by 8%, which will mean cuts to other areas of expenditure under the third heading.
I would add that increased funding cannot be a substitute for the genuine reforms that are the essence of the Lisbon Strategy.
Another new priority relates to a number of challenges we face in terms of foreign policy.
Above all, these involve the reconstruction of countries devastated by the tsunami disaster, and the provision of EU support for the awakening of democracy and civil society that is taking place beyond our eastern border.
There can be no question that this priority will make it necessary to use the flexibility instrument.
Another priority that has been added by our rapporteur is youth, and this will be the distinguishing feature of Parliamentâs budgetary strategy in 2006.
I have already emphasised the strong links that exist between the negotiations on the annual budget and those on the multi-annual Financial Perspective.
It is quite clear that it will be easier for us to negotiate the 2006 budget with the British presidency, and that these negotiations will be conducted in a friendlier atmosphere, if the Luxembourg presidency succeeds in concluding negotiations on the multi-annual Financial Perspective.
I have no idea whether this is a realistic aim, but I believe that it should be one we all share.
Â Â  I understand that the physical preliminary draft budget is with committee secretariat, but that other copies will be available later this week.
The item is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Valdis Dombrovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2006 (2005/2012(BUD)) (A6-0106/2005).
Â Â  . Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the following priorities have been put forward in the estimates of income and expenditure in the European Parliamentâs budget for 2006.
First, the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement, by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the 2007 round of EU enlargement, when Romania and Bulgaria will join.
The current situation is worrying: despite more than a year having already passed since EU enlargement, many permanent posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant.
It is forecast that by the end of 2005 only 78% of the permanent posts allocated to the new Member States will be filled.
The European Parliamentâs Secretary-General will therefore have to issue a report on the reasons for the delay and make proposals for remedying the situation.
One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff.
The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of European Parliament budget resources.
This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; supporting requests for new permanent positions from the budget only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; supporting new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources.
Of course, the issue of the sum of over 200 million euro per year which is spent on top of everything else in order to provide the European Parliament with a seat in Strasbourg is still a topical one.
The main problem is the maintenance of two European Parliament buildings in parallel, in Brussels and Strasbourg.
It must be acknowledged that this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the European Council.
The third priority is improving EU budget terminology, making it more complete and more transparent in order to show taxpayers more clearly how their resources are used.
Improvements will be needed to the draft terminology that has been proposed, so that it can better fulfil these criteria.
In speaking about the European Parliament budget, I would like to stress that a total budget expenditure ceiling will be set according to careful evaluation of justified needs.
Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.
The proposal by the European Parliamentâs Secretary-General sets a budget for the European Parliament for 2006 of 1.3416Â billion euro.
We welcome the Budget Committeeâs support for the rapporteursâ proposal to reduce this amount by 20Â million euro.
The experience of previous years, when large amounts of unused resources have been reallocated and some money has not even been used at all, demonstrates that we have an opportunity to spend European taxpayersâ money more prudently.
The final ceiling on expenditure for the European Parliamentâs budget will be set at first reading.
I would like to stress as important aspects of Parliamentâs work in 2006, first a better explanation to EU citizens of the European Parliamentâs work, placing particular emphasis, in this connection, on the role of the European Parliamentâs information offices in the EU Member States, and second, preparations by the European Parliament to play a larger role in the legislative sphere, as provided in the EU Constitutional Treaty.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that 2006 is the last year of the existing financial perspective.
In this regard, the question of the amount of payment appropriations from the joint EU 2006 budget is particularly topical.
It is important that the total amount of 2006 budget commitment and payment appropriations should correspond to those commitments which the EU has entered into, including those connected with EU enlargement.
I would like to call on the EU Council to reconsider the attitude it adopted in connection with the EU budget for 2006, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations.
If we want to see the EU as a reliable partner, it is important that the EU should fulfil its commitments, including the commitments which it entered into in connection with the enlargement of the EU.
It is important that in this financial perspective the commitments that have been provided for should be correspondingly reflected in the budget for 2006.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by extending the warmest of thanks to our rapporteur, MrÂ Dombrovskis, for having taken on â and continuing to perform â the thankless task of dealing with the Houseâs budget, for which he can expect more than just praise and rejoicing on the part of his fellow MEPs, and to which he is devoting himself with a great deal of passion.
So, first of all, a very warm âthank youâ for doing that, from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
There is just one issue I want to raise, and it is one that matters a great deal to me.
How much money does the European Parliament need?
The figure of â20% of administration costsâ is being both whispered in the corridors of the House and held up as incontrovertible truth.
In this year alone, in 2005, Mr Secretary-General, some EURÂ 50 million will be surplus to requirements, quite simply because we have to keep to this magic figure of 20%, but without having anything to spend it on.
In 2006, we will be having more of the same thing.
Even now, in your preliminary draft budget, as adopted by the Bureau, there is reference to EURÂ 90 million in unused funds.
I really do wonder what it is doing there.
Do we really have to take money out of the European publicâs pockets and allow it to be added to an over-expanded budget, knowing perfectly well that cannot even spend it?
As I see it, that really does raise the question of whether this is the right way to go about things in the long term.
What I recommend is that, as there is money that we do not need, that â as we can already see â we will not need next year, we should not even include it in the budget!
I would have been very glad if Mr Onesta, who has drafted amendments on this topic, were present here today to take responsibility for the proposals he has made.
One reason, though, why these funds are not going to be used â and not spent on other things either â is that we are well aware that we will need these amounts of money if we get a Statute.
I really would ask that we draft an austerity budget for this House!
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me first of all to express my thanks to the rapporteur for his report.
Broadly speaking, we are in agreement with the main thrust of his arguments.
Naturally, we agree with his view that more needs to be done to improve the rationalisation, accountability and disciplinary rigour of the budget.
An area which seems to be problematic is that of staff recruitment.
I suppose it would be correct to assume that staff requests were based on justified and realistic needs.
Consequently, it is very difficult to understand or justify the delays in the selection and recruitment process relating to enlargement.
Action has to be taken to rectify the situation and to address this pressing issue.
Having said that, however, I do not agree that an interim, makeshift solution of employing temporary staff should be considered a viable option or alternative.
Whilst I can appreciate the reasoning behind this argument, I fear that this type of compromise, if accepted, could lead to a malpractice which may feature occasionally in our future budgets.
The rapporteur has, moreover, put forward for our consideration a reduction in the margin of the contingency reserve.
In principle, we agree that appropriations should relate to specific activities and we should avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the financial year.
Nevertheless, we have to take into consideration the challenges we face in the near future and the uncertainties which are still evident, relating among others to multilingual services, property investment, the Statute for Members, as well as the adoption of the Statute for Membersâ Assistants, which has our full backing and support.
In view of this, it would be prudent to agree with the amendment proposing that the final decision on this item should be taken at a later stage.
In fact, I think that the rapporteur did well to postpone the final decision on the gentlemanâs agreement relating to the 20% level of heading 5.
I agree that this benchmark is not tied to an irrefutable and absolute fixed law and we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are convinced that it is necessary.
However, I do not think that this is the case and it would be inadvisable to do away with these guidelines now.
Ironically enough, if used effectively, the stability of the 20% guideline could provide some sound budgetary rigour and efficiency.
Naturally, we support the arguments that to achieve budgetary efficiency we have to take a critical look at all forms of expenditure, make more efficient use of resources and avoid waste and duplication of functions.
We should continue to focus on our core services and activities, which leads me to another important point.
We have not as yet, albeit it with some justification, experienced the full impact of the âraising the gameâ exercise.
It seems to me that to date only a few objectives have been achieved.
Given that the necessary structures are in place, we would realistically expect that in the coming budgetary year most of the targets would be met and a reform implemented to eliminate overt and covert bottlenecks.
On another level, we very much welcome the proposed improvement in the visitorsâ service.
From my very short and limited experience in the European Parliament, I think that the programmes are a practical and direct tool for improving the perception of the EU.
In addition, they have a multiplier effect, which should not be underestimated.
I also warmly welcome the proposal to improve the strategy on communication and information.
Over the years, we have not dealt with this issue adequately.
Whether real or perceived, we know that there is a barrier between the EU and its citizens.
More could and should be done on this important aspect.
If we really want our citizens to feel that the European Parliament is their parliament, and that it represents their aspirations, then an effective information and communication strategy has to be implemented swiftly.
That should be one of our main priorities.
If we fail in this, we will have failed in a very real and fundamental key objective.
Lastly, I congratulate Mr Dombrovskis again, not just for his report but because he as a new Member, coming from a new country, has provided us with an example that shows that this integration process can be productive and efficient.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I want to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Dombrovskis, on an excellent report.
The Parliamentâs budget is a complex administrative budget demanding a good deal of familiarity with Parliamentâs working methods and procedures.
The rapporteur has succeeded well in this, and this is reflected, for example, in the small number of amendments.
I wish him every success in the future too.
The Parliamentâs budget is still characterised by the shortcomings caused by enlargement.
Although the new Member States have been with us for over a year now, a considerable number of the posts created for them are still unfilled.
Parliamentâs administrative departments even estimate that perhaps just under 80% will be filled by the end of the year.
The situation appears to be especially problematic in the linguistic sector.
As it is the case that for the European Parliament to function democratically there is a need for multilingualism and good language services, due attention should be paid to the smooth running and effective functioning of the linguistic service.
The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on budget presentation.
It requires continual development.
As with the Commissionâs budget, the Parliamentâs budget needs to be developed in an activity-based direction which clarifies and validates personal accountability.
The degree of efficiency achieved should be clearly deducible from the presentation.
In future, we also need to establish various indicators to provide a basis for analysing the action taken.
It is particularly important to focus attention on how efficiently Parliament itself works.
The âraising the gameâ reform is especially important for all Members of Parliament.
They have to take decisions on issues which are more complicated than ever.
For that reason, it will be necessary to give additional support to legislative work.
The Parliamentâs budget has traditionally been kept at a level corresponding to 20% of administrative expenditure.
As it has been possible to maintain rigour in parliamentary expenditure, particularly as a result of good building policy, there would seem to be a good deal of room for manoeuvre at present: anything up to EUR 90 million.
Because there is a surplus from last year, it is impossible at this stage to predict what the actual needs will be.
Accordingly, the final decision on the contingency reserve must be left until the autumn.
It will be unnecessary to increase the Parliamentâs budget unless there are genuine reasons for doing so.
A 20% limit is not a target we should be aiming at, but a self-imposed ceiling.
The report before us will provide a good basis for follow-up work.
Â Â  Chairman, Madam Commissioner, distinguished House. The most recent opinion poll surveying the attitudes of Slovakiaâs citizens to the European Union has given aÂ clear answer.
A year into the EU accession, 83% of Slovakiaâs general public have aÂ positive opinion of that step, and today the Slovak Parliament ratified the draft Constitution for Europe.
On the other hand, the citizens of Slovakia are becoming extremely sensitive to the problems associated with constraints on the exercise of the MEP mandate, especially of the Members representing the new States.
These constraints are due to the time-consuming administrative processes within the European Parliament in providing linguistic support, adequate translation capacities and availability of interpretation services in the parliamentary committees and political groups.
The draft resolution to the European Parliament budget tabled by Mr Dombrovskis â and IÂ am taking this opportunity to thank him for his fine job â aptly responds to this situation.
It is only regrettable that the original wording of the draft resolution, which described delays in recruiting new staff as unacceptable, has been replaced in the current version by aÂ softer attribute, âdeplorableâ. Inadequate linguistic support undermines the principle of equal opportunities and limits the exercise of the MEP mandate, especially of MEPs from the new Member States.
This essentially implies discrimination, which is contrary to the spirit of aÂ united Europe, aÂ Europe that we were joining as new members, and is genuinely unacceptable.
It would be undoubtedly deplorable and inappropriate if approval rates vis-Ã -vis a united Europe were to decline in the new Member States as a result of shortcomings in the administration of the European Parliament rather than due to budgetary restraints.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to concentrate on three issues: the global level of Parliamentâs budget, personnel policy, and information policy.
Concerning the global level of Parliamentâs budget, the Secretary-Generalâs proposal set the level of Parliamentâs budget at 20% of heading 5, which is EURÂ 1Â 340Â million.
I strongly support the rapporteurâs proposal to reduce the appropriations of the contingency reserve by EURÂ 30Â million and enter in the buildings reserve an amount of EURÂ 10Â million.
The report also underlines that the level of Parliamentâs budget should be determined on the basis of justified needs and reminds us that conciliation appropriations should be avoided.
The European Parliamentâs personnel policy should be improved. Improvements should be brought in to speed up recruitment procedures to fill the 750 unoccupied posts within the European Parliamentâs administration and to create a truly merit-based promotion system.
The report also underlines its concern about the accelerated shift of auxiliary to contract staff and requests detailed information on this issue.
I suggest that we, the European Parliament, should call on the Secretary-General to examine ways to mitigate the effects of the abolition of the status of existing auxiliary agents of the political groups who are awaiting the completion of recruitment procedures.
We should call on the Secretary-General to present the Bureau with a proposal to modify the internal rules on recruitment adopted by the Bureau on 3Â MayÂ 2004, to enable political groups to benefit from the same recruitment provisions that apply to Parliamentâs administration.
Last but not least is information policy.
The rapporteur supports improving the visitorsâ service and strengthening the role of external offices.
It is underlined that in order to reach the citizens, Member Statesâ communication policy should take account of national differences.
Finally, I would like to thank Mr Dombrovskis for an excellent report.
Â Â  Mr President, this report is a twofold scandal, in that it is a bitter reflection on the majority opinion in this House, and lays bare the tricks with which this House works.
This report was originally couched in very general terms, but, by way of oral amendments, decisions have been incorporated in it to the effect that, of Parliamentâs expected surplus â totalling EURÂ 90 million for 2006 â EURÂ 60 million should simply be kept in reserve â where, as we know, all sorts of things can happen to it in the course of the Budget â and a further EURÂ 10 million be put aside for buildings, even though various people, including the Secretary-General, who is here today, have always said that we do not actually need it for that.
Instead of simply handing this money back to the European taxpayer, rather than doing something for the reputation of this House and demonstrating that, yes, we have got the message and can manage with less, it has been fraudulently added to the budget by means of amendments, and it is worthy of note that those amendments were oral.
Why do I describe them as having been added fraudulently?
I do so because I, as a full member of the Committee in question and entitled to vote, objected to them, and my objections were simply passed over; there have to date been no replies to the objections I have raised to the Bureau and to the President of this House.
According to an undated letter, all that was not meant that way.
That is a matter of dispute.
I will use all legal means at my disposal.
Neither this resolution nor this report have come about in a lawful manner, nor may the vote proceed tomorrow.
For the sake of the European taxpayer, I call upon the few who are present here to vote against this report, and, in particular, against these specific parts of it.
There will be signed motions to this effect.
Â Â  Could you please confirm whether you have received the letter from the President of Parliament in reply to the complaints you raised?
If not, I will send an usher around with a copy of it.
Â Â  Mr President, at lunchtime today I received, by fax, an undated letter in English, which I presume is what you are referring to.
Let me add that other Members have, within the space of three days, received replies of immense length, but, despite repeated warnings, this matter has been dragged out.
I would also add that I have already replied to this letter, firmly in the negative.
The way this matter is being handled is one I regard as irregular and unlawful.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliamentâs budget for 2006 ought to reflect a number of the key priorities set out in the Dombrovskis report.
As an MEP from a new Member State, I should like to alert the House to several practical problems, which are directly related to the fact that certain aspects of the way in which Parliament works have still not been changed following last yearâs enlargement.
My primary concern is that the official languages are still not accorded equal status, even though a year has passed since enlargement, and that interpretation is not available at many committee and delegation meetings into the languages of all those present.
There are also major delays in distributing documents in Membersâ official languages.
These problems are a direct result of the slow progress made in employing officials from the new Member States within Parliamentâs administration, and it is not only interpretation and translations that have been affected.
The number of people from the new Member States working for Parliament continues to be very low, and we are still a long way from filling all the posts for which funding was earmarked in the budget.
There is absolutely no justification for these delays, which really are quite substantial.
According to the Dombrovskis report, it is likely that only 78% of the jobs that have already been created will be filled by the end of this year.
In my opinion, urgent steps must be taken to rectify this state of affairs, and to ensure that citizens from the new Member States are represented equally within Parliamentâs administration.
I also find it intolerable that European Parliament signs in Parliamentâs buildings are still not displayed in all of the EUâs languages.
My attention was drawn to this by the first group of visitors that came from the Czech Republic back in November 2004, and in spite of the reminders I have sent to the quaestor, nothing has yet been done about it.
The services offered to visitors to Parliament do however operate relatively smoothly.
I have already invited two groups of citizens to Strasbourg, and their reactions lead me to believe that such visits are extremely important.
Nevertheless, we could still improve the way we communicate with the public.
I regret to say that no publicity materials are available in Czech or in the other languages of the new Member States, and no copies of the European Constitution are available for visitors from the new Member States.
I believe that something must be done about this in the near future.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak on Parliamentâs budgetary estimates for 2006 and the Dombrovskis report on these estimates.
The EU draft general budget for 2006 was presented a short while ago to the House, and so I should like to start with three comments on this draft.
Firstly, as a representative of Poland, which is a new Member State, I am alarmed at the extremely low level of payments provided for in this budget, namely 1.02% of EU GNI.
It should be noted in this connection that under the current Financial Perspective, the ceiling on payments for 2006 is 1.08% of GNI, or in other words EURÂ 7Â billion more in absolute terms.
The second point I wish to make is that it is the European Commission that has proposed this level of payments, even though it was only recently that this very same institution advocated average annual payments of 1.14% of GNI in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
In my opinion, it will not be an easy task to explain to EU citizens how it will be possible to fund all of the EUâs expenditure from a total of EURÂ 112Â billion, with payments expected to reach around EURÂ 130Â billion in 2007.
Thirdly, I find it puzzling that this budget provides for a significant increase, or more precisely a 6.2% increase, in expenditure on administration, whilst expenditure on external action has dropped by 2%, and expenditure on the pre-accession strategy has decreased by as much as 4% in relation to 2005.
Following on from my previous point, I should like to move on to the issue of Parliamentâs budgetary expenditure in 2006.
This is expected to amount to 20% of total expenditure on administration, or in other words to EURÂ 1Â 342Â million.
This represents an increase of 5.5% in relation to 2005.
It should be stressed that the main reason for this increase in funding is to ensure that funds are available to complete the EUâs enlargement to include 10Â new Member States, and to enable preparations to be made and the necessary funds to be earmarked for Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession in January 2007.
I would take this opportunity to note that only 78% of enlargement-related jobs for which provision was made in the 2004 and 2005 budgets will be filled by the end of 2005, which is extremely alarming.
In conclusion, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Dombrovskis on having drafted a comprehensive report on Parliamentâs expenditure in 2006.
It covers not only issues relating to enlargement, but also those relating to the quality and efficiency of Parliamentâs work, in particular the work done by Members on documents drafted in their own languages.
It also details the problems we face in bringing Parliament and the fruits of its labour closer to the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I want especially to thank Mr Dombrovskis and the others who have had a hand in this report.
No other parliament in the world â or so I believe â saves the taxpayer a two-figure million sum in one year.
Such economy with money is indeed praiseworthy.
We are, as we know, pressing for the adoption of the Statute, which will, while relieving the national budgets of a massive burden, mean additional expenditure for Parliament.
If we add up the average cost of an official, then this precautionary measure â along with what the Statute is going to give us â is particularly worthy of attention and praise.
We will, in future, have the task of explaining this Europe of ours far better than it has been.
We have to make the people more aware of what the European Parliament does.
One of the main criticisms levelled during the election was that people hear too little about this Houseâs political activities.
I wish to call on those who exercise responsibility in it to put far greater effort into information policy than they have been wont to do so far.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am responding to Mr Martinâs reservations relating to the legal aspects, not to the substance.
The set of oral amendments he mentioned was submitted the day before voting in the Committee on Budgets to its members and there were no reservations regarding these amendments.
After voting for several of them, MrÂ Martin started to raise reservations, but without clarifying on which Rules he was basing his reservations.
Therefore, I went ahead with the vote, having the unanimous support of the Committee on Budgets.
That is my clarification.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a statement in accordance with Rule 145.
What Mr Lewandowski has said is quite inaccurate.
The practice in this House, both in the plenary and in the committees, is that if an objection is made to an oral amendment proportionate to the quorum â which means one person objecting in a committee, or 37 Members standing up in the House â the amendment cannot proceed to the vote.
I would point out to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this practice, and this rule, is not dependent on the point in time at which such an oral amendment is moved.
We all know that the written amendment generally goes into rather more detail.
The very same thing that I have described we last saw this Monday in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the chairman of which â himself also from a new Member State â kept on asking whether there were any objections to an oral amendment, and it was plain for all to see that there would have been no vote if any objection had been made.
What is going on here is an attempt at evading responsibility, at avoiding the admission that something has been done in a way that ought not to be possible.
I insist that, in terms of substance â I have been given this speaking time, I am entitled to it under the Rules of Procedure â I did indeed refer to Rule 150, which precisely ...
Â Â  The Commissioner for the next debate has not arrived.
Otherwise, I would not have allowed this exchange.
The President has written to Mr Martin.
The letter states that the objections that Mr Martin raised were not concerned with linguistic problems, but concerned the substance of each amendment.
Given that, the President believes that the decision made by the chairman of the committee to proceed with the vote was in line with the Rules of Procedure and past practice.
Since Mr Martin has indicated that he intends to raise this again tomorrow, I suggest that he follows that procedure.
I do not want to pursue this now.
I should like to add, Mr Martin, that I hope I did not hear you accuse the chairman of the committee of misrepresenting what happened.
You must be very careful about what you say.
The interpretation I heard suggested that you were suggesting that he was lying.
You must not say that.
The Secretary-General has listened with great attention to the interventions of all colleagues.
I am very grateful to you.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on institutional aspects of the European External Action Service (B6-233/05).
Â Â  . Mr President, I think that we as Members of this House have the duty to find out about the exact starting time of debates, and there is no excuse whatsoever for absence.
We have sufficient means of finding out when we could attend a debate here.
In addition, I should in all honesty say that since only on a rare occasion does the Commission respond to my pertinent questions, I am not all that interested in the Commission position.
That is just by the by.
I have been both amazed and amused by the nervous tone of the question that the Committee Chairman, Mr-Leinen, has put.
It betrays the fear of an outspoken advocate of the Constitution that one of this Constitutionâs most striking innovations, namely the advent of a European External Affairs Minister, will turn out to be the intergovernmental Trojan horse.
It appears that this minister and his administrative machinery, the European External Action Service, are now also causing doubts in the minds of those in favour of him, but it is far too late for that.
In of Friday, 6 May, Henry Kissinger clearly indicated that the creation of one telephone number will not solve the lack of common external policy.
I can, in fact, recommend that article to you all.
What matters, after all, is the content of what will be said when the telephone rings.
Once again, the European Union is making the classic mistake of cushioning the lack of political agreement with purely institutional measures.
An honest analysis of these institutional measures reveals that the much-praised, but very unfortunate, construction of the double hat is disturbing the institutional balance among the European institutions.
The advent of a European External Affairs Minister goes against the important maxim that the various institutions operate independently of one another.
Indeed, paragraph 7 of Article I-26 stipulates that members of the Commission must not receive any instructions from any government, institution or body.
It appears that this provision does not apply to the Commissionâs future Vice-President.
I would defy all advocates of this new role to refute this.
This minister, but also the European External Action Service, will be a constant source of interinstitutional tension, and I have not even mentioned the funding of the officials employed in that Service, and relations with national diplomacy, to which we have devoted another fine hearing, ending in many question marks.
Mr Leinen doing the splits, however, is small beer compared to the athletic acrobatic skills that the future minister and leader of the external service will need to display.
As a fervent opponent to this Constitutional Treaty, I hope that it will be rejected in France, just as it will be in my own country.
Should that not happen, there will be a continuing need for close monitoring on our part of this dangerous adventure called the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have just come from a public meeting in Lorraine on the European Constitution, at which the majority of people were in favour of our having a European foreign minister and him having an External Action Service under him.
I am confident that people throughout Europe take the same view of things: Eurobarometer, for example, constantly echoes the popular desire that Europe should speak to the world with a single voice.
It is for that reason that provision is made for this in the European Constitution.
A foreign minister would give European values a face and speak up for European interests in the world.
If he is to perform these tasks, he will, of course, need the External Action Service of which we have spoken.
His dual role makes the construction rather complex, and it is to this that we must find a solution.
I believe that we must do so in the spirit of the Constitution â and what is the spirit of the Constitution?
It is that the former second pillar, with its rather intergovernmental approach, be integrated into the Community method.
The whole point of the debates in the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference was to integrate what was the second pillar into a European Union possessing legal personality and intended to act, both internally and externally, as a single entity.
Article 296 of the Constitution states that the foreign service shall be established through a resolution of the Council, following consultation with Parliament, and with the Commissionâs consent.
That is the point we are addressing today.
The Commission has a part in shaping the foreign service.
We, in this House, were concerned that the Council had moved on much further with its work, had started driving in fenceposts and already had definite plans in mind, while the Commission was being too hesitant and taking too reserved an approach to this issue.
It is for that reason that we have, today, raised the question of how the Commission intends to ensure that the Community method is further developed and guaranteed in the foreign relations sphere, of how â in administrative and financial terms â the service is to be organised, and how Parliament will be able to monitor what it does.
We should use all available means to prevent a third bureaucracy coming into being alongside the administration of the Commission and the Council; that would be the worst possible thing to happen.
The question then, of course, arises of whether the foreign service is part of the Council or of the Commission, and this is where we have to consider the existence, even now, in many countries, of delegations that could become EU embassies.
I think it would be right and proper to make this service â where its organisation and budget are concerned â part of the Commission rather than of the Council.
That the Council would have a full part to play would nonetheless be guaranteed, for it is quite clear that the service would exist to implement the decisions taken by the Council as a political entity.
Examples of this kind of duality exist in many countries, including in Germany, where, at certain administrative levels, offices serve both the local authorities and the State.
Far from being unheard-of, it could work in this case too.
We also have to decide what the External Action Service is meant to do or refrain from doing.
I do not believe it would make sense to create a mammoth authority with responsibility for every portfolio from Commissioner Mandelsonâs trade to Commissioner Michelâs development policy.
These must be parcelled out between a traditional foreign service, for which the foreign minister has responsibility, and other Directorates-General and Commissioners with their own remits.
Having the foreign minister also as a vice-president of the Commission would, of course, allow powers and responsibilities to be concentrated in one pair of hands, and consistency to be established in this area.
We look forward with eager anticipation to what the Commission has to say to us, hoping that what is done about this important issue will be faithful to the spirit of the Constitution and will make it manifest.
Â Â  . Mr President, the new arrangements in the field of foreign relations provided for in the Constitutional Treaty present an opportunity for the European Union to strengthen the efficiency and coherence of its external action.
That is one good reason why the Constitutional Treaty should, hopefully, be ratified.
In particular, we need to bring together as far as possible the two pillars of the Union's external action: Community external relations and the common foreign and security policy.
That will increase our impact, strengthen our voice and help us to promote our European values and interests worldwide.
For this reason, the Commission supports the creation of the double-hatted Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.
In fact, the Commission proposed this idea to the Convention.
It is a logical and necessary improvement of the structure created by the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties.
The future minister, building on his experience as High Representative, will at the same time be a Vice-President of the Commission.
As a member of the college, he will have access to Community competences and to the tools of the Community method, which will be essential for his tasks.
It follows that we are strongly in favour of the creation of an effective European External Action Service to enable the Minister/Vice-President to do his job effectively in full respect of Community procedures.
The Constitution confirms the Commission's important responsibilities in foreign affairs, including its role in external representation of the Union and in the execution of the budget.
It enhances its role of coordination and coherence in the different areas of external policy, and this will be the special responsibility of the Minister/Vice-President.
Under the Constitution, as under the present Treaty, the Commission will implement the budget under the scrutiny of Parliament.
The rights of Parliament will have to be respected, both as budgetary authority for the operational and administrative budget and in its role in multiannual programming.
President Barroso and High Representative Solana have agreed to work closely together.
As you know, the future proposal for the establishment of the services will be made by him as minister and decided by the Council after consulting Parliament and obtaining the consent of the Commission.
The Commission, including the Minister/Vice-President, will seek to preserve and promote the Community method, which has proved its capacity to work and achieve good results in external relations.
More generally, the Commission will be active and vigilant in safeguarding the institutional balance.
Member States have started to discuss the issues concerning the establishment of the European External Action Service and are beginning to understand the complex issues involved.
A process of reflection and comprehension is continuing in capitals, notably on the status of the future service.
There is a general agreement that it should be of a nature, but there are differing ideas as to what this could mean in practice.
Let me say a word on the question of the administrative status of the new service in relation to the Commission and Council, which is a key point in the draft resolution of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The various issues concerned are still under discussion, so it is too early to give a definitive answer.
The various requirements imposed by the Constitution, for instance regarding the inclusion of officials from the Commission, Council and national diplomatic services, will have to be met.
The responsibility of the Commission for the execution of the budget and in relation to Community policies should be preserved.
At the same time, duplication should be avoided.
Synergies and efficiency should guide the preparations; stronger and more coherent external action should be the guiding principle.
The next step will be a joint progress report to be submitted by the High Representative and the Commission to the European Council in June.
In this context, the views of Parliament are important, and I am therefore pleased to participate in your debate today.
I conclude by repeating that we, in the Commission, share the objective of parliamentarians to safeguard and enhance the Community method, and the role of the Commission and Parliament in this process.
At the same time, I believe that we share with you the aim of creating new structures that can really contribute to improving the effectiveness, coherence and influence of the Union's policies and actions in the world.
Naturally, there are still uncertainties on various sides: Parliament, the Commission, the Council Secretariat and Member States all have their concerns.
But we believe that the chances and opportunities for the Union and its institutions can, in the end, overcome those concerns.
We should use this opportunity to make progress towards a stronger and more effective European foreign policy.
Â Â  Commissioner, we began the debate without you.
Perhaps in your reply at the end of the debate, you could make some reference to the fact that you were late and explain why that was so.
Since you are responsible for relations with the European Parliament, this would be helpful.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have had to endure MrÂ Belder telling us what he thought, or rather what he did not think, about the Foreign Service.
That is the masochism we have to suffer in this Parliament, and you, Mr President, are largely responsible for it.
Having said that, however, I believe that this is a crucial issue and I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken this initiative.
When we discussed this issue in the Convention, it caused enormous controversy and my friend and colleague Elmar Brok was one of the people who worked hardest to move in this direction.
If you were to ask me which of the innovations in the European Constitution was the most significant, I would have no hesitation in saying the Foreign Affairs Minister.
I believe that the figure of Foreign Affairs Minister, double-hatted, that is to say, appointed by the European Council but Vice-President of the European Commission, has prospered in the end because, for the intergovernmentalists, this is a way to get their hands on the Commissionâs money and staff and, for the more Communitarianists, this is a way to have a say in the Unionâs foreign policy.
The way we structure this Minister's fundamental instrument, the Foreign Service, is therefore very important.
And, Madam Vice-President, you have been extremely reserved. What do I mean by that?
That you have told us nothing. In the document prepared by your services, you have told us that you are negotiating and that we will wait to see what happens.
Well I would like to tell you that for my group, the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this is a very important issue and that, given that foreign policy is something for governments rather than for peoples, for princes rather than peoples, as the old saying goes, we in this Parliament want control over the Unionâs foreign policy.
The location of the Foreign Service is therefore a crucial issue.
We will therefore examine the location for this Service very closely and my Group friends and colleagues will undoubtedly be able to tell you very clearly in their speeches where we want it to be located.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am approaching the subject from the angle of development cooperation.
We regard the creation of the European External Action Service, following on from the European Constitution, as being of enormous importance.
We see the establishment of this service as an important step towards a Europe that speaks with one voice and plays a more effective and coherent role in the world.
I want to focus on the significance of development cooperation policy as one of the cornerstones, and a major one, on which the EUâs external relations policy is based.
Two concepts are central in this: independence and coordination.
With regard to independence, development cooperation is an independent area within the very broad range of external relations.
This position will be reinforced in the new European Constitution, because development cooperation and humanitarian aid will form independent objectives, with their own legal basis.
Since these areas of policy are pursued at Community level, the Commission and Parliament have a major role to play in them.
It is of the utmost importance that this responsibility should remain with both institutions.
At the same time, though, coordination between the different components of external policy must improve.
We are in favour of incorporating this service in the Commissionâs remit, on the provision that the Council determines how the intergovernmental competences are fleshed out.
Coordination between the different components is necessary for a coherent policy, which is an explicit requirement in the Constitution.
That was, in fact, already the case in the Maastricht Treaty.
Coherent policy must ensure that achieving the main objectives of development policy (the millennium objectives for development) is not being tripped up by another leg of external policy, such as trade policy or defence policy.
We should also avoid duplication, for that is a waste of time and money.
We should therefore join forces, also on the ground.
Finally, I should like to add that the funding of this service should not be at the expense of existing external policy budgets or achieving the millennium objectives.
The European External Action Service is an important new concept within European external policy, which we must shape carefully by respecting the Constitutionâs provisions and the European Parliamentâs rights.
It is of the utmost importance that the Community model should be respected in this area and that the Commission should be able to maintain its role as executor of the policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, the setting-up of the External Action Service is extremely important, but it is also a very tricky thing to do successfully.
Succeed, and we will have achieved functional integration on the ground in third countries, whose greater efficiency will not only project the interests of the Union more effectively across the globe, but will also percolate up to the analysis and planning level in Brussels.
The Foreign Minister needs a first-class service to fuel him with the resources and intelligence he needs and also to recruit and train a diplomatic service that is properly European.
I welcome the Commissionerâs cautious statement, but it is quite clear that agreement is far from being achieved inside the Council, especially between the interests of the smaller and larger Member States, and some of the principal problems remain to be resolved.
The Commission must certainly seek to recruit the trust of the foreign ministries of the Member States, but it also needs to preserve the special prerogatives and experience that it has acquired over decades across the policy spectrum, from development to the environment and, of course, including trade.
Parliament is clearly nervous that the President of the Commission could be reduced to being the Unionâs Minister for the Interior while leaving the complete foreign dimension to the Foreign Minister/Vice-President.
That would emasculate the Commission and do a great disservice to all concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The question of the distinguished MEP, Mr Leinen, was asked as the Member States set about ratifying the Constitutional Treaty.
I am happy that my country, Slovakia, today ratified this Constitutional Treaty, all the more so that I have been involved in drafting it.
It is in accordance with this Constitutional Treaty that the European Parliament should prepare itself for playing a new strengthened role.
Until now, the European Parliament has had but aÂ minimal influence in the foreign policy area, which was largely exercised through decision-making powers with regard to the budget.
We should realise that the European Parliament is the only European institution directly elected by the citizens.
We should therefore eliminate the democratic deficit and make sure that the European Parliament is directly involved in the decision-making process with regard to foreign policy.
The European Parliament should not be merely consulted.
The shaping of the European Unionâs position in foreign policy may not be left exclusively under the purview of diplomats.
The Commission and Council should cooperate with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the other committees as required.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European External Action Service is a wide-ranging undertaking in administrative terms, and probably the most important structural issue to emerge from the Constitution, at least as regards the shape of the European Unionâs future executive activities.
We really do, I think, have to make a success of this, for it will be decisive in determining how Europe may play its part in the world, and I also believe it would be wrong to approach this issue in a defensive way, by saying that the foreign minister is to do what the Council does today, and then cobbling something together, leaving development and trade with the Commission as before.
The foreign ministerâs task, irrespective of who has responsibility for what, is to determine the substance of external action as a whole, resulting in a natural tendency for everything to come within his remit.
It follows that a defensive approach on the part of the Commission will not help move things forwards.
It must instead be proactive; rather than allowing decisions to be taken elsewhere and all except certain subject areas to be outside its competence, it must press for every decision to be taken within the Commission.
That will be the key issue.
Mr Dehaene, who will speak shortly, was in charge of the working group on this at the Convention, and so he knows what the Convention wanted; what it wanted was to take the Community method further.
Much as I am obliged to you, Commissioner, for indicating that you share Parliamentâs desire to move the Community method forward, does this mean that we will have a single European external action service that is â organisationally, administratively and in Budget terms, dependent on the Commission?
This is a clear and simple question, and no answer has been given to it.
We therefore ask you to do so, perhaps when revisiting the issue.
We are willing to support the Commission, and it was MEPs that got the rule that this can be done only with the Commissionâs consent accepted by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference.
I hope that the Commission will be courageous enough to seize this opportunity and to come to this decision for itself.
No decision can be taken in the face of its opposition, and I hope that you will therefore go further than the general Community method by adopting the position of the declaration Mr Leinen has submitted, according to which the external action service will, in administrative, organisational and budgetary terms, be attached to the Commission, while, of course, faithfully implementing the Councilâs decisions on matters in which the Council is competent.
I believe that the dynamics of administrative development mean that this is the only way forward that is in your interests and ours.
Perhaps you could make your answers plainer, and then even I might understand them.
Â Â  â Mr President, we all agree that the Constitutional Treaty introduces important institutional innovations as far as external relations are concerned. We have referred to the creation of the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs and the establishment of the European External Action Service.
It would be no exaggeration to say that, with these new institutions, the institutional embryo of the future common European Ministry of Foreign Affairs is being created in the European Union.
I am one of those who believe that the Constitutional Treaty could take bolder steps in the direction of deepening these policies, extending the qualified majority and further strengthening the jurisdiction of the European Parliament in the field of common foreign policy.
In all events, however, under present circumstances and taking account of the correlations, we have a positive and compelling compromise, which is why I support a vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty.
As regards the new institution of the European External Action Service, we must start preparing for it to operate as of now, so that we are ready as soon as â I trust â the Constitutional Treaty enters into force in November.
There is too little time, if you think that important institutional and organisational matters need to be resolved.
That is why Jo Leinen's initiative was the right initiative at the right time.
However, I must point out that the best possible solutions need to be found in order to strengthen the efficacy, consistency, cohesion and visibility of external action.
One of the basic issues is the reinforcement of the advisory and controlling role and greater involvement on the part of the European Parliament, both now, at the preparatory stage, and once the European Service is up and running.
That is why I propose that we ask the President of the Commission and Mr Solana to submit a joint progress report to the European Parliament, before presenting it to the European Council in June, and to promise to consult Parliament at all subsequent stages.
Â Â  Â Â Â I have a great many doubts and reservations about the setting up of a European External Action Service, and I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to three I regard as crucial.
The first relates to the question of whether Community legislation provides a legitimate basis for the European External Action Service.
The relevant articles of the Treaty on European Union have admittedly been cited, as well as other pieces of legislation, but the main point of reference for the establishment of this Service is the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
It follows from this draft Treaty that the setting up of an EU Diplomatic Service is a simple consequence of conducting a common foreign and security policy and appointing an EU Foreign Affairs Minister, as already mentioned by previous speakers.
It should be pointed out, however, that the draft Constitutional Treaty has not yet been adopted, and what is more, that there are serious grounds for believing that it will be rejected by the citizens of the Member States.
The question is therefore whether we should not acknowledge that any discussion of a European External Action Service would be extremely premature at this point in time.
I would also suggest that this is yet another example of the EUâs arrogant attitude towards the citizens of Europeâs sovereign states.
Since the EU institutions appear to believe that they have the right to act ahead of time, I would ask whether the Commission has a plan B, in case the Constitutional Treaty is rejected.
Secondly, the governments of the Member States entered into a commitment when they signed the draft Constitutional Treaty in November 2004, and this commitment has questionable consequences.
The Member States undertook to refrain from, and I quote: âany action that might impede entry into force of the Constitutionâ.
Does this automatically mean that the Member States must engage in mindless propaganda that advocates the adoption of this Treaty?
Does this not preclude the provision of reliable and objective information on the contents of the Constitution and the effects it may have on the lives of Europeâs nations?
Finally, my third concern relates to the planned structure of the European External Action Service, as the latter may entail the creation of a new army of officials with unclear, or even only partial, powers.
We cannot even be sure that this structure will not involve the same matters being dealt with by the Directorates-General, the External Action Service and the other Commission agencies.
The end result of this will be a burgeoning of the EUâs bureaucratic machinery, even though the latter already lacks transparency and merely places an undue burden on taxpayers in the Member States.
What financial impact is the establishment of the European External Action Service expected to have?
How will these costs be shared, and who will bear the greatest burden?
Furthermore, I should like to ask how many officials currently work in the Commission services responsible for EU external policy, and how many officials are expected to work in the future External Action Service?
Â Â  Mr President, in answering this debate, I should like to invite the Commissioner to focus on two points.
One follows on from what the last speaker said.
Since the External Action Service can only have legal status and legitimacy if the Constitution is approved, the Commission and the Council, by working to put the structure, staff and framework of the EAS in place, is surely engaged in blatantly presuming the outcome of the ratification process.
In this regard, can the Commission tell us how much it is budgeting to spend on these presumptive and pre-emptive moves that it is taking?
How much has this speculative venture cost us to date and how much is it likely to cost us in the next 18 months?
Secondly, could the Commission spell out for the wider public its vision of how the foreign affairs of Member States will be conducted once the EAS is in place?
Specifically, is it correct to conclude that national foreign affairs will then only be able to be conducted in a manner consistent with the common foreign policy and will only be able to operate in a manner that is subservient to the EAS?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate you for looking rather enthusiastic, though I have my suspicions that you would much rather be eating asparagus with the rest of the House at this moment.
I have three general points.
First of all, I think that this is probably the most important institutional question that we will face within the next four to five years.
It is really about executive power: it is about who runs foreign policy â the Commission or the Council.
I am very happy that the Member States have taken the issue forward.
I am happy that they have provided five for the Antici Group; I am happy that they have been dealt with in the Coreper meetings; and I am also happy that the Commission has had confessionals with the Member States.
Most of all, I am happy that, in the European Parliament, we have brought the debate and the discussion out into the open.
The second point I wanted to make is that I think an external relations service for all of us will bring only benefits.
In many ways, this whole issue has only winners.
It is about providing us with better consular services; it is about providing us with better reporting; and, in general, it is about providing us with a better common and foreign security policy. Because, as we all know, without a functioning civil service on a European level, it cannot work.
The third point I wanted to make â and this is to reiterate what Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Brok said â is that there are two key issues that we are looking at from this side.
The first is that, even though the system might be it is very important that two things remain with the Commission: one is the budget and the second is general administration.
To finish off, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope they stay very firm to the end, because we have to avoid the counter-contamination of issues such as trade and development going over to the intergovernmental and Council side.
Never underestimate the capacity of the Council Secretariat to pull the rug out from underneath the Commission â they will do it if they get a chance.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, as Mr Brok already pointed out, I should like to give testimony as chairman of the Conventionâs external relations working party, whose main concern was to avoid the eventual adoption of a double external policy, one derived both from the Council and the Commission.
On a positive note, the working party wanted to achieve greater coherence and continuity of policy, as well as to make it possible to deploy all the EUâs resources for common external policy actions.
Although a majority of the Conventionâs members were of the opinion that this could be best achieved via the Community method, we were sensible enough to realise that this is at the moment not feasible.
That is why this compromise has been worked out between those in favour of an improved status quo and those in favour of communitisation.
The External Affairs Minister would be President of the Council of Ministers, determining its agenda and, as its spokesperson, guaranteeing the coherence and continuity of policy.
As Vice-President of the Commission, he would also forge a link with Community policy.
In addition, with the Commissionâs approval, he would be able to use Community funds to back up his policy.
The working partyâs position was that, ideally, he should consult the Commission about his initiatives, and get it to support them, from the very outset.
We had even proposed that, in the case of a common initiative of the External Affairs Minister and the Commission, the Council should decide by majority.
To most, that appeared to be a bridge too far, but I would nevertheless claim that the success of the External Affairs Minister and the influence he will be able to exert will largely depend on the way in which he fits in with the Commission and works with it.
From the very start, the working party realised that the External Affairs Ministerâs logistical support was crucial.
We have always argued in favour of changing the delegations into a unified external representation in the form of EU embassies.
In Brussels too, the Minister should have a strategic service at his disposal, comprising both Commission and Council officials for the moment and diplomats posted from Member States.
Although this service will need to work for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission, the working party took the view that, in terms of dynamics, it was best if it was brought within the Commissionâs scope, even though it has to be at the loyal service of the External Affairs Minister and the Council of Ministers.
It appears to me that setting up a new autonomous administration is miles removed from what we wished for.
We wanted to abolish the pillars, yet a super pillar is being created, in the shape of the new service.
Similarly, to decommunitise the Commission services also seems to be a step in the wrong direction.
The Commission must defend its position to the utmost and find a place for this external affairs administration in its services.
The Commission should not forget that it must be in agreement and has the last say, therefore.
In the Brok report, we in this House will clearly speak out in favour of these solutions and wholeheartedly support the Commission, but it is up to the Commission to guide the negotiations.
Â Â  Mr President, the whole issue of a common Community diplomacy is one about which I and my national party have serious reservations.
I cannot deny that the huge clout the Commission now wields from its aid activities and its monopoly on external trade brings with it an additional large international political and economic dimension as well.
Furthermore, given the concomitant development of the CFSP and CESDP, although ostensibly intergovernmental, there has been a rise in the international profile of the EU as an actor on the world stage.
However, coming from a large country â the UK â with a proud and independent foreign policy, I oppose the proposals in the draft EU Constitution, which sets up for the first time the legal personality of the EU and establishes the post of Foreign Minister, led by the new five-year Council President.
All of this is designed to create a more coercive and binding common foreign and security policy, threatening full UK policy independence in the field of foreign affairs.
Clearly, in the EU of 25, there are now many more small countries like Mr Stubbâs home country of Finland facing the prospect of a six-monthly EU presidency if the Constitution does not come to pass.
For them, it is attractive to see the economies of scale which can come from an EU diplomatic service, including their national staff manning Community delegations.
There will also be financial savings from the establishment of full-blown EU embassies, in the unlikely event that the Constitution comes to pass, which can replace, in part, small countriesâ bilateral missions, if necessary.
Nevertheless, I sympathise with better and more thorough diplomatic training for Relex staff sent abroad in the Commission delegations.
I support more formal European Parliament scrutiny in the form of hearings of delegation heads of mission by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on appointment of this Parliament.
Also, MEPs should enjoy more formalised assistance when on mission â which, it must be said, we normally do.
However, I have serious worries about granting the EU more trappings of statehood, which the EAS signifies, if it further reduces my countryâs ability to conduct its own independent foreign and security policy when it is in our own national interest to do so.
Â Â  â Perhaps the most complex, controversial and fascinating aspect of the challenge of constitutionalising Europe is that of external action.
Through external action, Europe spreads a new style of governance around the world, characterised by the active sharing of democratic values and respect for human rights.
Consequently, the External Action Service does not only mean administrative and financial streamlining, and a desire to organise.
The Service now demonstrates that the EUâs foreign policy is a shared project for life, a model of consensus on the broad horizons for the human race that Europe is drawing for itself and for its relations with the world.
All of which calls for its institutions to work together transversally and for external policy decisions to be rooted in democracy.
The emerging Constitution illustrates that decisions on common foreign policy are now being made on the basis of criteria that are not exclusively intergovernmental, but rather transversal to the European institutions that process political decisions.
Accordingly, the Commissionâs action automatically sets off a connection with Parliament.
If we are to have a coherent Europe, with a clearly defined strategic vision based on multilateralism and on a new system of international law, we need to ensure that the institutions interact in synergy with one another and that there is permanent internal consensus.
This is the way forward for the new European External Action Service.
The following questions are thus raised, with regard to the service: What is its organic configuration?
How will it handle its enormous multidisciplinarity?
How will it set up its chains of authority?
How will it prevent tension arising between the Council and the Commission, not to mention the tendency for relations between the two to descend into feudalism?
Lastly, how will it set out the chain of responsibility, including the chain of democratic responsibility?
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the few of us who are usually here at the night sitting of the European Parliament.
It can sometimes be somewhat of a challenge to follow the time planning of the European Parliament.
I was under the impression that this would start at 10 p.m.
That is why I was here ten minutes earlier â happily together with Mr Leinen â and I thank you for welcoming me to the debate.
I have listened with great interest to what parliamentarians have said tonight in this debate because the European External Action Service is a subject that arouses passions.
It touches on institutional and constitutional issues of fundamental importance; the creation of a Union Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will at the same time be a Vice-President of the Commission, is a key innovation in the institutional architecture of this European Union.
It brings close together the two pillars in the field of foreign affairs â the Community method and the intergovernmental method.
This two-hatted Minister will have tasks of different kinds.
That is why the creation of this service is such an important and difficult challenge.
I shall comment briefly on a few issues that were raised.
To Mr van den Berg, I would say that development policy is and will remain a key component of European Union policies and an important asset for Europe in the world and in the context of the Constitution.
Development policy is not subordinate to other policies.
It retains its special status in the frame of the Community method, but all the policies need to be better integrated in a coherent foreign policy concept. This will strengthen, not weaken, the effectiveness of the Unionâs development policy.
I can assure Mr Duff that the Commission is not going to be emasculated by the Constitution as regards Community competences.
The Minister and his services will be bound by Commission procedures and the principles of collegiality, under the guidance of the Commissionâs President.
I entirely agree with Mr Brok that we should not be defensive.
For the Commission, the new arrangements under the Constitution offer more opportunities than risks.
It is also important to underline that nothing can be decided against the Commission in this field.
To Mr Allister and others, I would say that we are not prejudging the ratification of the Constitution.
We are simply preparing the decision, which can only be taken after the Constitution is ratified and comes into force, and after Parliament has given its opinion.
On the implications for the budget and for personnel, no plans or estimates or calculations have been made because we are not yet at that detailed stage of planning.
Parliament, as budgetary authority, will decide on all these figures later on.
I think those are the principal issues raised, and I can assure you that Parliamentâs views will be taken into account as this dossier develops in the coming months.
In particular, the resolution which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted on Tuesday â which I understand will go to the plenary session in two weeksâ time â is a contribution which must be taken into account, not only by the Commission but by Member States and the Council as well.
We expect further technical work to continue in the second half of this year, so that decisions of principle can be taken in the course of next year when the ratification of the Constitution is completed.
Parliament will be formally consulted on the proposal regarding the Minister at an appropriate stage, so tonightâs debate will be followed by others in which Parliament can amplify its views in the light of progress on which the House will be kept informed.
I shall conclude by repeating that we in the Commission are conscious of the concerns of parliamentarians to safeguard and enhance the Community method and the role of the Commission and Parliament in this process.
I know this is something that Mr Brok is concerned about.
We share with you the aim of creating new structures which can really contribute to improving the effectiveness, coherence and influence of the Unionâs policies and actions in the world.
Â Â  We will check on the information that you were given, Commissioner.
In my book an attractive woman is always allowed to be late.
With the exception of one Member who spoke before you arrived, Commissioner, all the Members who spoke in the debate are still present. That is unusual.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for saying that nothing can be decided against the Commission.
That is what is stated in the draft Constitution.
I am obliged to her for making this clear once more.
What is at issue is not whether Parliamentâs positions can be taken on board, but the fact that we have asked what the Commissionâs negotiating position is, in other words, whether or not it is arguing that this service should be attached to it.
We would be very interested to know what you think about this.
Nor is the issue in any way about the involvement of Parliament; on the contrary, we are here today to help the Commission avoid the situation in which it would be an internal market mechanism and the Foreign Minister a powerful figure in his own right, and instead establish that it is the Commission which, administratively speaking, performs the European Unionâs role in the world.
Mr President, perhaps you could supply me with the document that would provide us with a basis in law for ascertaining that Parliament has to nudge the Commission in the right direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, I just wish to say that it is important to understand that we are not yet at the negotiating stage.
We are still at the preparatory stage, where we look at all the technical details.
It would be unfortunate to lock ourselves into negotiating positions now.
There is too much technical and preparatory work to be done before that.
As I said earlier, we will keep Parliament informed of our progress.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in Brussels on Thursday, 26Â May.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Javier Moreno SÃ¡nchez, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the assessment of the Doha Round following the WTO agreement on 1 August 2004 (2004/2138(INI)) (A6-0095/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking everybody who has contributed to enriching this report, which we will vote on tomorrow, for their cooperation.
This report provides a balance between, on the one hand, this Parliament's full support for the defence of the Unionâs interests in the negotiations under way and, on the other, its ambition to ensure that this development round ends in success, which would mean the full integration and participation of the developing countries in the world economy.
Through this report, this House intends to send a decisive political message of support for the progress of the negotiations, in which the Commission is playing an essential role, reiterating our commitment to the WTO and its multilateral system of trade which, undoubtedly, is the best mechanism for promoting fair trade, demonstrating solidarity, in a way that benefits everybody.
This message comes at a very appropriate time, since the Doha programme is at a crossroads, it is at a key stage and must not be allowed to move backwards.
Following the failure of the Ministerial Conference in CancÃºn, the agreement of 1 August 2004 is of unquestionable political importance, since it put the negotiations on the right track, and furthermore recognises the need fully to integrate the developing countries into the world economy.
This is just a road map, however.
The success of the negotiations depends on the firm political will of all the parties to reach a fundamental agreement in Hong Kong.
We must go there with an ambitious and balanced proposal in the different areas covered by the agreement: development, agriculture, industrial products (NAMAs), services and facilitation of trade, without forgetting the need to put development at the forefront of the negotiations, despite the fact that agriculture is unquestionably the motor for them.
In pursuit of this objective, concrete and specific commitments must be achieved with dates and time limits by means of a transparent, effective and inclusive process of negotiation, in which all the member countries of the WTO participate fully.
In the field of development, we must ensure that the negotiations deal with the problems linked to poverty, malnutrition and hunger in the world, with a view to reducing them by half by 2015, as laid down in the Millennium Declaration, by means of a closer relationship between the WTO and the other international organisations.
It would also be useful for the Commission to produce proposals to establish commercial integration mechanisms for developing countries to compensate for any possible losses resulting from trade liberalisation.
Progress in the fields of technical assistance and the creation of capacity and the promotion of South-South trade are also of particular importance in terms of guaranteeing the integration of developing countries into the world economy and promoting their export capacity.
In agriculture, the members of the WTO must work in a balanced fashion in relation to the three pillars â export subsidies, internal aid and access to the market â in order to produce detailed negotiation guidelines for Hong Kong and a parallel disarming by all the members of the WTO.
With regard to access to the markets for non-agricultural products, the NAMAs, the way must be opened up to flexibility and the application of non-reciprocity for developing countries, applying the principle of special and differentiated treatment to them.
With regard to services, during this month revised quality offers should be presented and, with regard to services relating to the basic needs of the citizens, I do not believe that the developing countries should be required to liberalise them.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the success of the Round, the legitimacy and the credibility of the WTO, also undoubtedly depend on civil society feeling the benefits provided by international trade.
In a process in which, since Seattle, there is great social interest, it appears essential to emphasise the role that democratic Parliaments must play as an expression of the citizensâ views within international fora such as the WTO and, in the case of this Parliament, as a body responsible for democratic control of the Unionâs trade policy and a future co-legislator in this field, once the European Constitution enters into force.
If you will allow me to refer briefly to a highly topical issue, this is an additional argument to add to the long list of advances represented by this Constitution and which justify a European vote in favour, both in France and in other countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as the Spanish poet, Antonio Machado, said, âTraveller, there is no path. The path is made by walkingâ.
And we are half way between Geneva and Hong Kong; between nostalgia for what is being left behind and eagerness to reach our destination.
We must go to Hong Kong with an ambitious and balanced proposal which civil society and all the member countries of the WTO can relate to and which will bring results they are satisfied with.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez on his excellent report, which reflects very well not only on its author but also on this House as a whole.
I welcome this debate, because I regard Parliament as the Commission's essential partner in the conduct of our trade policies, that is, in particular, the case in advance of the Doha Round, which remains our number one priority.
Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez has underlined the need to make progress on all the issues in this wide-ranging agenda, with a clear emphasis â which I strongly support â on the objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development.
Those were at the heart of the founding charter of this Round, and they remain as important today as they were when they were first articulated.
Since I took office, I have made every effort to advance the DDA and to keep it on track.
I want Doha to put trade at the service of development.
That is what I believe in and stand for, and it is at the heart of the policies I am pursuing.
However, Europe cannot do this on its own.
As I said in Geneva on my very first day as Trade Commissioner, the EU cannot be the WTO's sole banker.
Last summer, Europe had the courage to put its agricultural export subsidies on the negotiating table.
It is now up to others to show their hand.
In concrete terms, this Round has to yield improved market access and increased business opportunities all round, not only for developing countries â I expect and want them to be the biggest winners of this Round â but also for our own industry and service providers in Europe.
That will enable us to build on Europe's strengths in the knowledge economy, for the prosperity and benefit of all.
Market access in industrial products â NAMA â and services too are key issues in the Round.
Without progress on these issues, there can be no conclusion to the Round.
To achieve this, I want to ensure that the more advanced developing countries engage more intensively on non-agricultural issues.
Thus far, they have pushed hard their case on agriculture, as they are perfectly entitled to do, and as I would expect them to do.
However, they have shown little willingness to embrace the necessity of real movement on their part on NAMA and on services, even where objective analysis suggests this would be in their own economic interest.
This has to change.
We all have to show a willingness to adapt, to change and to accommodate others' interests.
That is why we have made our move on agriculture.
The other main industrialised countries now need to follow our example to be more proactive on services and to work on their own agricultural reforms in order to match what we in Europe have put forward.
Last week, several informal meetings of WTO trade ministers took place in Paris.
I expressed my very real concern about the slow pace of the present negotiations.
I called on all members to stop playing their cards so close to their chests and start putting them on the table.
That goes for all of us, I am not just pointing the finger at others.
We all need to do that, not Europe alone.
I also explained our idea of what an ambitious round should amount to.
It requires parallel progress on all three pillars of the agricultural negotiations â not just export subsidies â including the tariffs and quotas that restrict market access.
There must be visible efforts by all industrialised countries â not only the EU â to reform their farm policies; and a substantial and real â not just paper â reduction of industrial tariffs by all countries in a position to do this, including the advanced developing countries, always respecting the special circumstances of the weak.
Offers on services that provide genuine new business opportunities must be tabled and the WTO's rulebook substantially strengthened, be this in regard to trade facilitation, anti-dumping or geographical indications.
I also renewed my plea for additional efforts to address the specific concerns of the developing countries, and especially â though not exclusively â the poor and vulnerable ones, through special and differential treatment in the Round and by the richer parts of the world substantially stepping up aid for trade.
You are quite right to identify capacity-building â the essential support we need to give â to enable trade to take place to facilitate that adjustment, so that developing countries, in particular the weaker ones, can genuinely participate in the opportunities for trade that we are advancing through this Round.
We made progress in Paris.
We reached agreement on the vital but highly technical issue of the conversion of specific duties â so many euros per bushel of this, so many euros per kilo of that â into their percentage ad valorem equivalents.
While the core issue of how much and on what basis these tariff equivalents will be reduced remains to be discussed â that will come later â we now have a basis on which we can move forward on agriculture and, as a result, on all other aspects of the DDA.
On this I should like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of Mrs Fischer Boel.
Agriculture is a tough subject and I respect how she handles it.
We can also expect progress in relation to industrial tariffs in the months to come.
Many members also reaffirm their intention to submit improved offers on services by the end of this month.
We expect intensified discussions among key players between now and the mini-ministerial in China, which will take place on 12 and 13 July.
Before the summer break, we should see a first approximation of what a possible Hong Kong package could look like.
If there is any chance of an ambitious outcome in Hong Kong at the end of this year, and thus an ambitious Round, this first approximation, which I hope that we can see in July, should, at the very least, firstly, establish areas of growing convergence amongst WTO members issue by issue.
It should also provide clarity about our shared level of ambition on the core market access issues â agriculture, NAMA and services; and, finally, identify the key problem areas on which agreement will have to be struck to ensure success at Hong Kong and then complete the Round.
I am glad that these ideas are contained in the chair's summary of the Paris mini-ministerial.
You can rest assured that it is in this spirit of high ambition that the Commission will continue to work towards Hong Kong.
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with much of the report, but I just wish to pick out two specific points.
Regarding the special mention of flexibility for developing countries in paragraph 6 of the report, the Commission agrees with the thrust of the point being made.
We are prepared to grant flexibility to developing countries through special and differential treatment, both for LDCs and other weak and vulnerable countries.
However, we can do this only if we take the level of development into account and that means differentiating between developing countries issue by issue.
We cannot simply accept a 'one-size-fits-all'.
The second point concerns the suggestion of a 'development box' in the agriculture negotiations mentioned in paragraph 9.
The Commission can agree that the framework can and should protect EU interests. However, it is over optimistic to say that: 'âŠ the EU will be able to cope with these reductions' in domestic aids that distort trade.
On market access, the report assumes that very positive treatment granted to sensitive products will allow the EU to protect its market organisations.
This is certainly what the EU hopes, but difficult concessions on some products will still have to be made, even in the best of circumstances.
Let me finish there.
I will listen to what Members of this House have to say and respond at the end, if and when I have an opportunity to do so.
Again, I thank Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez for his report and this House for the opportunity to debate this very important subject.
Â Â  . The negotiations at the Doha Development Round are intended to give the economies of the developing countries a shot in the arm and also to give them a genuine place in the world economy.
They are geared towards a fairer distribution in the world.
In order to fight world poverty, we agreed on what we termed the millennium objectives for development.
Sound trading conditions for developing countries can make a significant contribution, and this is what we should be aiming for in Hong Kong.
There are a number of points I should like to raise, some of which the Commissioner has already mentioned.
In our trading policy, we should be able to draw more of a distinction between the different developing countries.
The discrepancies are too great for one uniform framework.
There are strong and weak, large and small economies.
There are countries with much and little scope for production and growth.
We should be able to customise our policy more.
That is why special and differential treatment of the developing countries should be one of the key items on the agenda in Hong Kong.
There has been much talk about the consequences of the agreements in Hong Kong will have for the trade concessions that have been made to developing countries, which they fear will be eroded.
I would ask the Commissioner to inform this House after the negotiations of whether they in fact have been.
Thirdly, it seems that developing countries are still scarcely able to derive any real benefit from the opportunities that are given to them, and so I wish to highlight the importance of capacity-building and technical assistance.
We must work hard on those aspects in order to reinforce the countriesâ export and trading capacity.
It is also important, where countries rely on one or two export products, to try to encourage them to diversify.
I would now like to turn to export subsidies, which were already mentioned by the Commissioner, and whose adverse effects on the local markets are already known.
We must work on a timeframe to phase out export subsidies as a matter of urgency.
It is unfortunate that no end date has been stipulated in the text.
Finally, the European Union has an important task in Hong Kong.
We all know how the negotiations in CancÃºn went.
This should not happen again.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which is a sound one, and for the good cooperation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs debate is especially important as we are in an accelerated phase of negotiations in Geneva.
You have said that last week, in Paris, the Ministerial meeting had progressed.
For my part, Commissioner, I should like to make four observations.
Firstly, I am very concerned about the attitude adopted by numerous countries that are not genuinely committed to these negotiations.
I claim as evidence the complete absence of real progress made in matters other than agriculture.
The discussions surrounding the access to the market in industrial products and services are at a standstill, as are those concerning the rules.
We cannot endorse such unbalanced negotiation in which agriculture pays for every other sector, when the European Union has made enormous efforts in this particular sector.
Secondly, the success of the negotiation round requires a genuine undertaking of responsibility from emerging countries, such as Brazil, India and China, in the negotiations.
These countries must also open up their markets to other developing countries, as the real driving force of development will lie, in the years to come, in the growth of trade between countries of the south.
Thirdly, the recent decision of the Appellate Body in respect of sugar reminds us that there is no honesty in negotiations.
It is therefore crucial to evaluate each point of the negotiations from the perspective of WTO legislation in order to prevent a situation in which the compromise we have accepted is dashed by a decision taken by WTO judges and in all likelihood also penalises the poor countries.
We must re-examine this issue.
The fourth and final point â and the most important point â that I should like to impress upon you, Commissioner, is that the negotiators taking decisions today carry a heavy responsibility faced with the future of millions of men and women.
It is easy to conclude negotiations, but I believe that problems will perhaps only surface in the more distant future, when you will no longer be in charge.
I have faith in you.
Yet, above all, do not leave it to your successors to resolve the difficulties.
From this moment on, before signing or saying yes, let us consider the issue together twice over so that we can pass on an acceptable dossier to your successors.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the challenge of the Hong Kong Conference lays down the boundaries of the credibility, operational acceptance and dynamism of the WTO.
In my opinion, there are five structural reasons hampering the negotiations of the Doha Round:
First, the inability of leading trade partners to reconcile themselves to ceding internal financial and political independence.
Secondly, the difficulty in taking decisions, due to the huge increase in numbers in the WTO, accompanied by its increasing heterogeneity.
Thirdly, the lack of equilibrium in the liberalisation of trade between advanced trade systems.
Comparatively speaking, the Union has made the greatest concessions, with the result that the European market is the most open market in the world.
Fourthly, the unwillingness on the part of other international actors also to assume a leading negotiating role.
Fifthly, the defensive stand of the developing countries towards the new subjects of negotiation.
The extension and reinforcement of the multilateral regulatory framework of the WTO, which constitutes the EU strategy, is limited by the principle of the specialisation of international organisations.
This principle also lays down the boundaries of the further development of the WTO both in the global organisation of social policy and in the global organisation of environmental issues.
Consequently, what needs to be established, in my opinion, is a new global 'umbrella' architecture to house the following pillars:
- the WTO, which satisfactorily promotes the efficient distribution of resources;
- an international economic organisation for international economic stability;
- an international development organisation for the international redistribution of resources and support for the development of poor countries;
- an international environmental organisation for the protection and improvement of the global environment and natural resources.
The terms of the globalised economy dictate new overall regulation of the global economic system on the basis of the social and ecological market economy, regulation which will promote the distribution of resources, stability, international solidarity and environmental and consumer protection.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to raise a couple of points that need to be borne in mind when considering this report, which is, after all, the first to be presented by the Committee this year.
We will then, in the second half of the year, produce a second one to follow, observe and comment on the Commissionâs deliberations and negotiations.
As far as both the Committee and my group are concerned, the question to which it gives rise is what can be done, firstly to ensure that we are actually being helpful, in a supportive way, in bringing about a positive result in Hong Kong â even though there will be no final conclusion, a positive result would be nice in any case â so that negotiations can then be continued on a sound footing; secondly, also in order to ensure that the great claim we make in the title of âdevelopment roundâ is justified by reality; and, thirdly, to ensure that the European Unionâs interests are defended.
This is of course a very complex business when one bears in mind that the outcome of CancÃºn was not exactly a very good one, that we have had a very difficult start and that the negotiations are currently looking rather shaky.
There is also the problem of the countries with emerging economies, which are fighting to be allowed to take up a leading, global role in the world.
That is very much apparent from the example of China â about which we will have a debate tomorrow â but also from Brazil and, of course, from India.
All this adds up to a very difficult and complex situation.
There is another aspect to which we have to give consideration.
I would ask you, Commissioner, to revisit the subject of how in fact this House, the Committee on International Trade and yourself are to relate to one another in the course of this year.
If the new treaty were already in place, Parliament would have a very great deal more power, with more direct machinery for consultation.
Our mechanisms are very good and long-established, but they are all somewhat informal in nature.
At the same time, though, it is also the case that the public would like to see us more directly involved, with more power and more rights in a process involving negotiations on agriculture and services sectors.
These are very sensitive areas, debate on which can be very vigorous, and on which there are no ready-made and unambiguous positions, whether in our group, in this House or among the public at large.
How, then, can we ensure that, in the course of this year, we can organise this critical process involving the Commission, the Committee and Parliament in such a way that the result is fruitful cooperation over and above what we have already established, and including the critical areas I have mentioned?
If you actually have to make changes to the negotiations, or changes to your plans â and you can rest assured, Commissioner, that you will have to deal with these things â then how can it be guaranteed that cooperation will be so close that we will really be able to discharge the responsibility placed upon us by the public?
Â Â  . Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which, I believe, provides an excellent overview of the current state of play in the negotiations following the WTOâs Geneva framework agreement and on the eve of the conference in Hong Kong.
Clearly, the success of the Doha Development Round is crucial to a further liberalisation of world trade.
Indeed, after the failure of CancÃºn, the credibility of the multilateral trading system is at stake.
While the success of Hong Kong is crucial to further economic growth, it will also be a serious test of the WTOâs legitimacy.
I share Commissioner Mandelsonâs view that the Doha Round should primarily be regarded as about development.
Trade and development must go hand in hand and greater involvement of the developing countries in the framework of a fair world trade is an essential component in the fight against hunger and poverty in the world.
It is promising that last week, a compromise was reached about import levies on agricultural products and that with it, an impending failure of the Doha Round was warded off.
The translation of linear import levies into common percentage-based tariffs, based on the value of the products, is a careful, but nevertheless, important step in the direction of a blanket agreement on trade in agricultural products.
My group, however, remains convinced that all export subsidies in agriculture must eventually be abolished, for it is, and remains, unacceptable that current EU agricultural policy should cost an average European family approximately EUR 100 extra and should make it harder for the developing countries to escape the poverty trap.
The World Bank calculated recently that success in this trade round can lead to an increase in worldwide income by EUR 385 billion per annum.
If Africa can increase its share in world trade from 2 to no more than 3%, its annual income will increase by USD 70 billion.
That is far more than what it is now receiving in development aid.
For that reason alone, we cannot afford another failure.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez for his work on this issue, but I think it will come as no surprise to him that, unfortunately, our Group cannot support his report as it stands.
While there are some good parts, highlighting the aims of sustainable development and poverty eradication, these are sadly undermined by the overall direction of the report, which is an uncritical endorsement of deregulated free trade as the principal means of achieving those goals.
The assumption still seems to be that more trade automatically equals more growth, which automatically equals more poverty reduction, yet the reality on the ground is quite different and, as the recent UNDP Least Developed Countries report makes clear, greater integration of some of the poorest countries into the international trading system has generally not led to poverty reduction amongst the poorest people.
Another assumption underpinning the report is that, if only the WTOâs critics understood the institution more, then somehow we would mysteriously fall in love with it, or, as the report puts it, âthe WTO must provide adequate information and explanations to civil society [...] in order to avoid the process of globalisation and the role played by the WTO being widely misunderstood and misrepresentedâ.
Quite frankly, this is unhelpful and patronising nonsense.
Increasingly, large sections of civil society know exactly what the WTO is about, and they know precisely how damaging the process of economic globalisation can be.
What we need is not a cosmetic public relations exercise but a fundamental, thoroughgoing reform of the institutions and the rules of world trade so that sustainability and equity are genuinely put at their heart.
Now to some of the detail: our Group has retabled its original amendment on commodity prices.
Falling commodity prices is one of the single greatest reasons why poorer countries do not get a fairer deal out of world trade.
As many as 43 developing countries depend on a single commodity for more than 20% of their total export revenues.
If prices for the 10 most important agricultural commodities exported by developing countries had risen in line with inflation since 1980, those exporters would have received around USDÂ 112Â billion more in 2002 than they actually did, which would have been twice the level of official development assistance.
Frankly, I find it extraordinary that the Committee on International Trade, which prides itself on saying that trade should support poverty eradication, could have rejected an amendment which sought action on stabilising commodity prices.
I hope that the plenary will support us on that tomorrow.
We have also tabled an amendment on the Commission mandate.
It is hard to imagine what justification the Commission can possibly have for working on a mandate that is six years old and which, therefore, fails to reflect any of the important changes that have happened since it was agreed.
Perhaps Mr Mandelson could tell us what that justification is because, from an institutional perspective, we cannot pretend that, after two out of the last three ministerials ended in collapse, we are dealing with business as usual.
We cannot ignore the resistance of many countries in the south to embark on more and more new competences for the WTO.
Now that a new Commission is in office and as the new WTO Ministerial approaches, we should give a sign to the international community that Europe reflects these changes and is able to learn from the mistakes made in both Seattle and CancÃºn.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astonished to hear in this House that the WTO is the vehicle for improving and promoting fair, inclusive trade.
How can such an idea be asserted?
We only have to look at the tangible results of the rounds of negotiations that have been and are still being held.
How can we talk about reciprocity between a giant and a dwarf, between David and Goliath?
How can we hope for developing countries to be the winners of this round if we do not change our policies?
Why do we not enter into the merits of the results?
Why is there no mention of how subsidies given to 25Â 000 cotton growers in the United States have reduced millions of people to starvation in Central Africa?
Why is there no mention of how TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) have deprived and continue to deprive 30Â million people â the great majority in Africa â of anti-AIDS drugs, and of how the enforcement of TRIPS in India has halved the number of people in the developing world who have access to anti-AIDS drugs?
Why is there no mention of the disaster caused by the subsidies for intensive agriculture paid out by Europe and the United States?
At the Cancun Ministerial Conference, that disaster united Brazil, India and the countries in the South against Europe and the United States.
Furthermore, what preparations are we making for the next WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong?
The impression is that we will succeed in liberalising the social services and health services, in the name of an economic liberalism that will quite simply end up making those services fee-based â and controlled by large multinationals â in the countries in the South, denying access to a large proportion of the population.
Why is no mention made of the Economic Partnership Agreements?
We have discussed them and we have seen their tragic result in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly held at Bamako.
Through the appeal for complete liberalisation of trade with countries in the South â particularly Africa â and the abolition of import duties in those countries, such agreements contributed to destroying their economies, denying them the opportunity to autonomously choose their own strategies for a different kind of development.
In contrast, I believe that we should fight for a reduction in the role of the World Trade Organisation.
We should fight to ensure that a whole range of goods can come under the management of other agencies, such as United Nations agencies for instance, starting with agricultural and pharmaceutical products.
For these reasons, our group expresses its entirely negative opinion on the report presented to this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite the failure of the CancÃºn Conference in September 2003, multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO are still defined by the Doha programme.
The agreement reached in August 2004 by the General Council of the WTO has managed to relaunch these negotiations, and I welcome this.
From the outset, let me say that I also welcome the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
I am particularly pleased that the proposal on behalf of the Committee on International Trade is a considerable improvement on the original document, notably in relation to how to include developing countries in the world trade system, and the importance to be attached to the liberalisation of certain non-essential services and, importantly, to the solutions being proposed to reduce agricultural protection.
The compromise amendments adopted in committee have, in my opinion, improved this text.
This report is a fair analysis which takes due account of European expectations and interests in the context of what is bound to be a difficult round of negotiations.
In the context of the WTO talks, I am concerned about agriculture and, in particular, about the future of small family farms in my own country, which, let it be said, are the backbone of Irish society.
There can be no question of changing the European agricultural model or the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform.
As far as European farmers are concerned, they have signed up to a reform which I consider to be cast in iron and which remains valid until 2013.
They have signed up to a reform that was moved to bring the CAP into line with the WTO.
They have signed up to a deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector.
Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families.
There can be no question of going back on any of those commitments.
I must say, Commissioner, that I am encouraged by what you have just said in this regard and I believe that you will rigorously defend our interests here.
Finally, I think that we all agree that the WTO is the best forum in which the rights of all states â rich and poor, developed and developing â can be protected.
I also believe that multilateralism is the way forward and I am pleased that the Commission has maintained this position.
I look forward to the Hong Kong Conference in December of this year.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is absolutely vital that we make headway in this round of negotiations, which are about reform and liberalisation.
The World Bankâs calculations, to which Mr Van Hecke has just referred, indicate that a successful conclusion to the Doha round could increase global incomes by up to EURÂ 500Â billion per annum, and so success at Doha means war on poverty, it means large-scale and effective development aid and hence a chance of prosperity and social justice for everyone in the world.
It is a chance that we must seize for the sake of the people of Europe and people around the world.
I would like to take up the issue of public participation, which Mrs Mann and Mrs Lucas have just mentioned.
We still have a clear recollection of the images from the âBattle of Seattleâ.
More and more people see everything that is summed up under the heading of âglobalisationâ as a danger rather than an opportunity; in Europe, whole generations are completing their schooling without having been taught what underpins the social market economy and world trade, which leaves them open to misinformation and at the mercy of deceitful campaigns.
We watch our media reporting almost exclusively about the relocation of production, rather than on the creation of new jobs or increased prosperity, both of which we owe to world trade.
We see this making people more and more insecure, and we see radical groups like âAttacâ, among others, using the funding they receive from the Community to work against the Communityâs interests by misinforming and frightening people.
I would therefore ask the Commission â through you, Commissioner Mandelson â to devise a scheme whereby, in parallel with the negotiations, a campaign may be pro-actively mounted to win the public over to free and fair world trade, enabling people in Europe and around the world to be persuaded of the benefits of global trade and taking them with us as we go down this right and necessary road.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its launch, the WTO has been heavily criticised.
Today, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of this organisation, we could take stock and ask the following question: do we need the WTO?
In the context of the relentless growth of globalisation, we unquestionably have no option but to acknowledge our need for a multilateral organisation.
To the other question, âdo we need this organisation the way it is currently run?â, however, my response would be far more cautious.
Indeed today, the world is still not managing to distribute its wealth in a balanced way.
Trade has a significant role to play in creating this balance, but its existing rules have until now remained largely indifferent to the demands and needs of a large part of the planet.
Faced with this observation, I sometimes harbour the naive hope that the Hong Kong Conference, which will take place at the end of the year, will alter this undeniable fact and will, above all, finally fulfil the hopes raised by the launch of the Doha Development Programme.
Last month, on 10 and 16 April, hundreds of NGOs and associations made their voices heard throughout the world in support of fairer trade.
I share their opinion that trade based on the sole and simplistic principle of casual will not result in greater distribution of wealth; quite the opposite.
Our priority must be to reorient international trade in order to equip it with a genuine economic and social justice dimension.
If we really hope to help the poorer countries to benefit from globalisation, we must re-evaluate all world trade rules in a more equitable manner, by considering the link between trade and sustainable development.
In my opinion, members of the WTO should therefore include these principles amongst their objectives, but above all they should draw on the outcome of the practices and the rules enacted so that they are then in a position to adapt the policies conducted in a more fair and equitable way.
I also hope for a transparent WTO, and a credible and legitimate organisation, whose decisions could be upheld by its members and civil society.
As a European Member of Parliament elected by European citizens, I can only state, and above all regret, the current lack of information of which I have fallen foul, to enable me to satisfactorily carry out my democratic control function.
Yet more regrettable is that we, as European Members, have no say in the Commissionâs negotiation mandate.
The same applies, however, to our future.
Whilst I am anxious about the consequences and repercussions of the Directive on services for our European public services, I am easily annoyed when faced with incidences of the liberalisation of services at international level, which could threaten â often public â services linked to citizensâ basic needs in countries that often have the most urgent need of them.
If we are widely agreed that services linked to healthcare, education, and cultural and audiovisual sectors have exceptional status in the negotiations, we must not, however, forget the services that relate to basic needs such as water and energy, since we cannot call on developing countries to liberalise these services when this would lead to their being dismantled.
I should like to point out that we made a commitment in New York, in 2000, in support of the eight Millennium Development Objectives.
These development objectives cannot be dissociated from the Doha Development Programme and the negotiations taking place.
We cannot make promises one day and then quickly forget them the next.
The case of the Philippines is one example amongst many others of the harmful effects of liberalising water distribution services.
In fact, following the liberalisation of this service in 1997, the price of water not only increased by 600%, but the very quality of the water also dropped to such a degree that it today causes illness.
I am most fearful that, by the year 2015, we will not succeed in halving the percentage of the population that lacks permanent access to water.
If we cannot have access to water, we cannot live.
Â Â  Mr President, we have, tonight, already heard a great deal about fair trade and about trade in a spirit of solidarity.
The rapporteur wants it to benefit all, and Mr Caspary has calculated for our benefit that EURÂ 500Â billion will make everyone rich and happy.
Even Commissioner Mandelson gives me the impression that he believes that the abandonment of agricultural production by our own countries would cause an outbreak of prosperity in the countries of the developing world.
I do not share their idealism.
Trade neither feeds the hungry nor makes the poor rich, and those who make money out of it are primarily those interest groups who demand free trade out of the desire to profit from it to the exclusion of others.
To Mr Caspary, who so breezily talks about âfree and fair tradeâ, I say that free trade and fair trade may well be mutually contradictory and exclusive.
We ought to examine more closely whether that is so, and that is what I would like to do.
Commissioner Mandelson spoke of the need for us to do away with restricted market access, particularly for foodstuffs.
I would point out to him that the European Union is the worldâs biggest importer of foodstuffs, so this is not about market access but about the conditions subject to which the products find their way onto our market.
If the European Union gives the least developed countries free access to our market, that free market access does not automatically make them rich; one must, on the contrary, consider the conditions applicable to the free access to the market in this instance.
If they manage to sell their products at our price levels, then they will be able to develop their national economies, but if the multinationals buy from these countries at below the poverty threshold, it will be the ruin of them. They bring their goods to our markets at prices that destroy our agriculture.
The Commissioner spoke of the need for a proactive movement towards the provision of services, but we cannot all cut each otherâs hair; on the contrary, we also have to produce something.
In the agricultural sector, we need services through production.
The maintenance of cultural landscapes renders a great service to European society, one for which farmers must be paid subject to the terms and conditions obtaining here.
On the global market, professors, bankers and even Commissioners reach a lower price than agricultural products, and that is why we have to talk about terms and conditions, which means about adjusting them and making them fair.
It is not a simple matter.
It is simple to define the word âfreeâ in quantative terms, but to do so in qualitative terms takes some effort.
Although abolishing export subsidies in one of our major importing sectors was the right thing to do, it would be pure lunacy to abandon our own production and let the world come to us.
We need a special form of external protection, with the conditions to which production here and our own farmers are subject replicated abroad, and we have to set the conditions, the prices and the levels in such a way that these countries can develop their economies rather than being forced under the poverty line, and without our own farmers going bust.
Commissioner Mandelson, I hope that we will soon be able to discuss these matters with you at rather greater length and in somewhat greater depth in the Committee on Agriculture.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, what the Commission was mandated to do in 1999 it showed itself incapable of doing, not only at the negotiations in Seattle, but also at those in CancÃºn.
I believe this was the right thing to happen; it should have led to the Commission being given a modified mandate, one that focussed not on more deregulation and the opening up of markets, but on organising real fair trade between the various countries of the world, which are developed to greatly differing degrees.
Fair trade means the introduction of a system in which everybody involved can see that they have a real chance of developing, and are enabled to seize this chance.
For some countries, that may mean protecting their markets until such time as the regional economy has become sufficiently strong to stand up to foreign competition.
In other regions, this may mean opening up a market in order to offer other providers export opportunities.
Rather than exerting even more pressure to bring about the opening up of markets, this would mean reducing the pressure, which has become a permanent feature.
Agreements such as GATS or NAMA can rob developing countries of the chance to build up their own industrial and service sectors and, at the same time, to develop high environmental and social standards.
It is the current debate on textile imports, though, that shows us the other side of the coin â what the opening up of markets means to the industrialised nations.
When talking about the Doha development agenda, the term itself indicates that development has to be on the agenda, and that it must not just be about the opening up of markets.
Issues such as preventive health care, education, social protection and environmentally-friendly production methods are inseparably part of it.
This is more important to us than the Singapore issues, even if they appear to have been reduced in number from four to two.
What matters to us is that trade systems should come into being that make it possible for the prices of coffee, cocoa, textiles, bananas, cotton, sugar, and many, many other products to be kept stable.
I believe that the right approach is not more competition, but more cooperation.
Export subsidies for large-scale agri-businesses must be done away with.
No attempt must be made to deregulate public services, in particular the supply of water.
Alongside the WTO, the relevant UN institutions â UNCTAD or the ILO, for example â must be given greater weight in development matters.
The European Union must come to give a different answer to that which it has given hitherto to the developing countriesâ calls for the implementation of âMode 4â.
Demanding of the developing countries that they should open up their markets to goods, services and capital, at the same time as the European Union denies less-qualified workers access to its labour markets, in which there is supposedly freedom of movement, has nothing to do with equal rights.
If you want world trade, you first have to ensure balanced development, or else what will be promoted by trade will not be progress, but growing disparities between the poor and the rich.
What I really do want to say to Mr Caspary is that those who regard âAttacâ as a radical group have not grasped the idea that it is from the presence of differing views that democracy draws its life!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should also be asking ourselves in what ways Hong Kong and the Doha round can help us achieve the Lisbon objectives.
Our primary concern is with growth and employment, and we know that the trade unions, the pensionersâ associations and children are all calling for more money in their pockets.
Growth is essential to our society, and I prefer not to think about the sort of debate we would have in this House if we were to say that we wanted to achieve the opposite of Lisbon.
It is because we agree on the importance of the Lisbon goals that it is important that the WTO round be well-prepared.
While there is a need for better organisation within the WTO, we must also ensure that we arrive at Hong Kong with a sound minimum compromise in our pockets, which, last time in CancÃºn, we failed to do.
If our experts in Geneva do not manage to work out a minimum compromise, we will again risk failing to achieve credible results.
What is central to the development agenda is that prosperity must be worked for; it can be shared out only once.
If you want to have it for the long term, you have to work for it yourself.
This is where small and medium-sized enterprises need access to markets.
Loans are needed for firms to be started up, for training and for infrastructure.
We have to give thought to how, in this round, we can get prosperity in these countries to increase: not by redistributing wealth, but by helping people to help themselves through the traditional structures of family businesses, to which these countries are accustomed.
We have to enable these, the poorest countries in the world, to get access not only to local and regional markets, but also to global markets, and for that we need the parliamentary dimension.
What we need, Commissioner, is not more power, but quite simply for the best ideas to compete.
We in this House are willing to help you get them to do this, and to enter into a dialogue with you in order that we may, together, achieve what is best for Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we all welcome the positive outcome of the August 2004 agreement which was, to a great extent, the result of Community initiatives.
We hope that the final outcome will perpetuate this Community effort and initiative.
Farming ended up being the most important chapter in the negotiations, despite the fact that we had insisted from the outset on balanced attention to all aspects of the Round, with fair results for all sectors and all partners.
However, the final agreement should not bring into dispute any aspect of the recent reform of the common agricultural policy and should safeguard equivalent commitments for all trading partners.
The question of access to the agricultural product market and, more importantly, the technical aspects of the method for calculating ad valorem equivalents proved to be the key point in the negotiations.
The technical commitments should be such that the sustainability of Community products is safeguarded.
Protection of agricultural indications and the incorporation of non-trade aspects should not only be an objective, but should also constitute a precondition to the final agreement.
These elements also determine the multi-operational role of European farming.
Cotton was put forward as a major issue for the promotion of negotiations with less developed countries.
We hope that additional commitments for this product will also concern other trade partners.
The report by Javier Moreno SÃ¡nchez succeeded in safeguarding the balance in the matter of his proposals for WTO negotiations.
Commissioner, I would suggest that you follow the rapporteur's 'poetic principle'.
It maintains that the interim agreement constitutes a step along a road which is not ready made: it is the act of walking that creates it.
However, the objectives are ready made and the potential for derogations cannot be limitless.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Moreno SÃ¡nchez on his excellent report, which demonstrates vision and the capacity to identify common objectives, in such a broad and complex as the Doha negotiations.
The purpose of this Round, which has been called the âDevelopment Roundâ since it began in 2001, is to strengthen the basic principles of the multilateral commercial framework, responding appropriately to the problems of the developing countries.
Success in the negotiations must allow them to make trade an integral element of their national development policies and, to this end, we must have sufficient flexibility to deal with the precarious situation of the least-developed countries, to recognise the new role of the emerging countries and to tackle the particular impact of liberalisation processes on the vulnerable countries.
Aware of these problems, the rapporteur rightly raises the need to provide specific technical assistance and to create capacity in the developing countries; the possibility of introducing a development compartment, for the least-developed countries, in the negotiations on agriculture; promotion of South-South trade and the need for the emerging countries to continue to open up their markets to the least-developed countries; and recognition that the principle of special and differentiated treatment should be the backbone, which would involve non-reciprocity in trade rounds, and which must be adaptable to the characteristics of each developing country.
Its application must make it possible for the International Monetary Fund, and other organisations, to establish a trade integration mechanism intended to compensate for the losses they may suffer as a result of trade liberalisation.
As rapporteur for the report on the System of Generalised Preferences, I am very pleased with the rapporteurâs support for my proposal that attention be paid to the erosion of tariff preferences that may result from the Round, repeating the request that the Commission produce a special report examining its impact and proposing the measures to be adopted.
The Moreno SÃ¡nchez report makes a magnificent contribution to clearing up reservations and moving forward a Round that satisfies the aspirations of all of its members to make progress.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the good work and the excellent report and would like to single out three items that I regard as important.
First of all, transparency, which other Members have already mentioned.
It is clear that the subject of the negotiations, and â presupposing that negotiations are brought to a successful end, the actual decisions taken will have a considerable impact on a huge number of people.
That is why it is essential that a democratically elected Parliament such as ours be kept constantly informed in detail about the negotiations and involved in them.
The Constitution will offer us more scope in this respect, but I would urge you, Commissioner, in the next couple of months and years, to do more than you are strictly speaking required to do in order to involve this House, and, by extension, civil society, in this matter.
Secondly, world trade must also be fair.
It should benefit everyone, but the developing countries, in particular.
One of the key objectives must be to eradicate poverty with a new and customised trade policy.
For that purpose, we must first of all ensure that those countries are given the necessary technical back-up during the negotiations in order to further develop their negotiating scope, and also to work on capacity-building.
In addition, the outcome of the negotiations should be what I would refer to as âdeveloping-country-friendlyâ.
That will require some political courage and also concessions on our part.
Let me take as an example the gradual phasing out of our export subsidies, for which a clear timeframe should be drafted in my view.
My third, and last, point concerns the liberalisation of trade in services, which is important and creates great opportunities, but we must clearly define the area.
After all, there are services which should ideally not be managed by the free market, namely the services of general interest.
These should remain outside of the negotiations and do not, in my view, only concern education and health care, but also, for example, water, the source of all life, as someone said before.
Unfortunately, there are now examples in some developing countries of the privatisation of water supplies having had very pernicious effects.
I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you share this view.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like straight away to endorse the sentiments of the last speaker.
I know exactly the point he is making about water and other essential public services.
Nothing that will be done in this round, and certainly no part of the policies that the Commission pursues, will infringe or endanger those basic interests and requirements of life.
I can assure you of that.
If I can go back to something that Mr RÃŒbig said earlier when he talked about the need for the round to end in a sound minimum compromise, he is right.
It sounds as if he is looking forward to a round that ends without ambition.
That is not what he meant.
To achieve a sound minimum compromise is the hardest thing.
Standing here responding to this debate tonight, that end looks a long way off.
But it is coming towards us.
I say that for two reasons.
First of all, the negotiating authority and mandate of the United States will not continue indefinitely to sustain the life of this round.
That is something we need to bear in mind.
Secondly, there is such a thing as negotiating fatigue.
I am beginning to see some signs of fatigue creeping in, an impatience, a desire to get to the end in order to move on.
I think that impatience is healthy.
I hope it is healthy, and I hope that the sort of negotiating fatigue that we are starting to see will encourage people to show their cards a little bit more, to project to the end game in this round, to see how, when all the parts are fitted together, we will see a round that ends genuinely in wins all round for people, but not least and in particular, for those members of the WTO who are most in need of a successful and ambitious end to this round.
Bearing in mind some of the contributions that have been made, for example, by Caroline Lucas and MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf, I respect entirely where you are coming from in the remarks that you make, but I profoundly disagree with you in your rejection of the premises and basic principles of the international trading system.
I hope you will forgive me when I recall the enormous benefits that the richer and well-off countries have derived from the international trading system.
Now that we have done so well, now that developed countries are so well off, and now that we in Europe are doing so well after decades of open trading, your approach seems to me simply to want to knock the ladder away for the rest of the world to catch up.
And I reject that.
I think it is a rather self-defeating approach to make.
Of course trade is not some magic wand.
Of course trade is not the answer to the development needs and requirements of every poor and vulnerable country.
But equally, we have to recognise that no country has made itself prosperous or better off by cutting itself off from the rest of the world.
That is at the heart of your prospectus.
I agree that access to markets is not enough in itself.
You have to help poor countries produce products, increasingly higher value-added products, to enable them to trade profitably in the global economy.
Simply opening your markets is not an end in itself.
Enabling people to produce and supply into those markets is the crucial point, and was at the heart of Mrs Martensâ remarks at the opening of this debate.
I strongly agree with her when she identifies preference erosion as such a problem for many single commodity-dependent developing countries.
It is a very difficult thing and is a huge challenge for us in Europe to deliver effective help and assistance to countries which are highly dependent on single products.
When we talk about the reform of sugar, raised earlier in the debate, we know that we have a responsibility not only to manage and bring about that reform in the interests of the people we represent, or the people you represent in this Parliament and whose interests I reflect also, but we also have to make sure that the assistance in adjustment and restructuring that we deliver to poorer, less well off developing countries, for whom sugar is absolutely central, not only to their economy, but to the fabric of their society.
Such commodities are a lifeblood for countries and we know the obligations and responsibilities that we have to such countries.
Agriculture is without doubt the most complex and challenging subject of negotiation in this round.
I agree with Mr Daul that we cannot place all the weight of this round on agriculture.
I think I made that clear in my opening remarks and I certainly accept his view that agriculture must not foot the bill for the all the other sectors.
I want to ensure that we look to the long term in this round â yes, including after I have ceased being a Commissioner.
I do not look forward to that as an early prospect, but one day others will take over and you are absolutely right.
The actions we take now and the negotiations we undertake in this round, have to ensure that there is a sustainable future for European agriculture.
We must not put that at risk, we must not put it in jeopardy and nothing that I or the Commission do in the course of this round will create such a risk.
That means, too, that adjustments have to be managed and reform and change embraced; of course, we must.
Of one thing I am sure: you cannot just leave agriculture to the free market.
You cannot do that in terms of the security of the food supply, but also the importance and the weight you attach to sustaining rural communities, which are an essential feature and component of our way of life, of European civilisation.
When we talk about agriculture and the interests of people who live in rural communities, their interests in this round, for me it highlights the importance all the time of explaining, justifying â I think you used the term âadvertisingâ â what we are doing in this round.
Advertising in the literal sense is what we need to do.
We have to advertise the huge potential benefits and prize that is in our grasp in the successful and ambitious completion of this round.
We have to advertise the rationale for our negotiations; they are complex, they are difficult for the ordinary citizen to grasp â heaven knows, I find them difficult to grasp sometimes and I am the Trade Commissioner.
It should not be taken as a given, as an assumption, that what we do in this round we can simply deliberate on and decide behind closed doors and pass down to a grateful public at the end of the day, as if that is the beginning and end of involving civil society.
I say this, too, not only because I am very conscious of the sensitivities, fears and anxieties that these negotiations highlight â trade is a very political subject indeed â but because it also highlights the important role of parliamentarians: Members of this Parliament, but not just this Parliament, members of all national parliaments are involved as well.
That is for two reasons, first of all, parliaments in their work, and the scrutiny offered by parliamentarians, puts pressure on people like me to explain and justify what we are doing.
I think that is very important.
But, secondly, what you are doing is representing civil society in a representative and authentic way, in ways that non-governmental organisations do not always do entirely faithfully.
When you offer that scrutiny and when you offer that representativeness, what you are doing to this process is conferring legitimacy on it.
Legitimacy that it would not otherwise have if it were simply conducted in secret without any transparent way of working, without any accountability for what we are doing and saying during the course of these negotiations.
So I agree with those Members who have emphasised the need for Parliament and parliamentarians to have a role.
It is true that if we had a constitution, the role and access of Members of this House to this process would be formalised.
Nonetheless, without the Constitution so far, we still have a very good relationship, we were able to achieve across the range of what we do informally what in time I hope and predict we will be able to cement formally as well.
When it comes to issues like services â water and other public services â which, in particular excite anxieties amongst the general public, then it is right that the general public, the citizens, are able to see in their democratic forum, in this Parliament, their anxieties and their concerns being properly aired and properly represented.
That is why I am grateful to those tonight who have raised the issue of services and have done so in such a constructive way.
I hope that meets the point of those who have emphasised, quite rightly, the role of civil society in this.
It also touches on, and I fully accept, the future role and performance of the WTO itself, as MrÂ Papastamkos has raised in his own contribution.
To those who attack the WTO more sharply, I would say this: I do not know of an international institution, I do not know of a better form of global government that exists in our world today that matches the WTO in its democracy â yes, each Member of the WTO, big or small, powerful or weak, has the same vote and it is one vote.
And it takes decisions, and it makes findings against the most powerful in the world.
It is the only international institution, it is the only organ of global governance that I know that can challenge and compromise the sovereignty or the United States and get away with it.
It is the only organisation I know that can enforce its decisions, arbitrate between countries, however mighty and powerful they may be in the international community.
I think that is something to celebrate and applaud and it is something, in my view, that we should build on rather than condemn.
I am sorry I have not responded to all the questions that have been raised.
But I want to emphasise this point in conclusion: there is a genuine need for us to put development at the heart of this round; it is absolutely central to Doha and its founding values.
Those who argue, as some have done in their contributions tonight, that the capacity to trade is crucial, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
It means overcoming barriers at ports, enabling trade to be facilitated.
That is why that part of our negotiations, in my opinion, is so important.
It is about the ability to get goods to market and to meet standards, which is why aid for trade is so important.
Yes, our SPS standards, those standards that protect the health and safety of European citizens and consumers, are very important and we should uphold them; our citizens â people you represent â would expect us to do so.
But, equally, we have to understand that for many in developing countries, these standards look like barriers.
These high standards of health and consumer protection look like protectionism to the outside world.
They are not, but it places a great obligation on us, not only to maintain the integrity of our standards, but actively to go out and help and deliver assistance to poorer countries to enable them to meet those standards, meet those requirements, rather than simply shrink away from them and in the process, taking their goods and what they offer to our markets with them.
Let me finish on this point.
I agree that the common agricultural policy is a bit of a problem in some ways, it is a great necessity, a source of life and livelihood and very important in sustaining our rural communities in very many ways.
But what are the problems we have in the common agriculture policy?
The CAP is really not responsible for the problems of world poverty today.
Europe offers the most open markets in the world.
The tendency of some to turn the common agricultural policy into some sort of devil incarnate, as far as developing countries are concerned, is misconceived and misplaced.
Of course it needs reform, and if I can just make the point about family farms to Mr Ã Neachtain, I want to protect small farmers, too, but let us remember in the context of our discussions about the future of the common agricultural policy â and I think I am right in saying this â that 75% of CAP payments go to farmers with above-average incomes.
So when we are talking about protecting small farmers and when we are talking about protecting the incomes and livelihoods of some of the less well off people you represent in Parliament, let us also remember that they too need reform of the common agricultural policy.
Yes, preserving the European model of agriculture, but not preserving the CAP in aspic for all time.
It can, and should, work even better than it does for the people who are most in need.
In conclusion, if we can reach broad agreement at Doha, at Hong Kong and after, it will be a huge achievement for the world.
It will enable us to complete a round that has stretched over the life, not just of one or two, but of three Commissions.
It is a huge prize, a great prize that is in our grasp.
That is why, in my view, however taxing and however vexing this round is, we certainly should not give up, and nor will we.
There is a huge amount to achieve for the most needy and the most deserving in our world, as well as countless millions of our own fellow citizens.
There is a lot at stake, a lot to play for and we are going to proceed on that basis towards eventual success.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement.
Commissioner Mandelson misinterprets me in supposing that I do not want to address the poverty that is in the world.
What is the case is that my group and I are giving some thought as to how we can enable people living in poverty to have a share in our prosperity.
We also have some clear ideas as to how to go about this.
I hope that Commissioner Mandelson will join us in entering more deeply into debate and thus be enabled to interpret our thinking better.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  . The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the implementation of WTO rules by China (B6-0230/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that I have the honour to present on behalf of the Committee on International Trade relates to the current state of our commercial relations with China.
As you know, Chinaâs entry into the WTO in 2001, which Parliament supported, was the result of a laborious negotiation in which the European Union played a very important role.
There were no precedents for the entry of a commercial partner whose rules were at such variance with the common system.
We should remember that to join the WTO was an objective actively pursued by China for ten years, to which end it carried out a series of detailed concessions in all sectors, it committed itself to fulfilling all of its obligations and accepted the monitoring of that compliance.
This has been expressed repeatedly by Chinese leaders, particularly since the policy implemented by Deng Xiaoping.
So far, the predictions of generalised conflict with China have not come true. Nevertheless, recurrent problems arise in fields such as the protection of intellectual property â the fight against forgeries and counterfeits â the transparency of legislation, standardisation and certification, the openness of services, in particular financial services, telecommunications and transport, and numerous non-commercial obstacles, such as the CCC, the notorious China Compulsory Certification, which is almost impossible to obtain.
The essential issue, however, is that China has to deal with a significant contradiction: to open up its markets and to protect its own industry, within a context in which rules such as the application of the ILO conventions on child labour, the establishment of free trade unions, etc. do not fall within the context of the WTO, but are important, as is environmental protection, and in this regard I would like to point out that China signed the Kyoto protocol two years ago now.
We are currently in a situation in which it appears that China is operating extremely close to the limits of what may be acceptable.
And the case of textiles, which other Members have mentioned, is an example of this, since it is affecting many countries and not just the European Union.
I am not advocating that we call into question the decision taken on 1 January on total liberalisation, but rather that we examine, for example, the possible significance of a policy of dumping in terms of invading markets, how energy can be subsidised, how funding policy is being applied and whether there is privileged funding, etc.
These are important issues.
Another specific and very significant example is the recording industry, which is facing a very dramatic situation in Europe.
At the moment, the majority of pirating, almost 70Â %, takes place in China and much of it is taking place on the Internet.
Furthermore, it is almost impossible to receive royalties, because structures do not even exist.
In any event, I would like to point out that the European Union has supported China's integration into the world economy.
This is a challenge for everybody that requires a process of economic and social reform on an unprecedented scale.
China still has ten years to complete its transition to a market economy.
In any event, it is the case that China has already moved from a centrally-planned economy to an economy which appears to be governed by Manchesterian capitalism led by Communist mandarins.
It is for the Chinese to take charge of their own development, but it is important that we have control involving the greatest possible transparency and knowledge.
In summary, Mr President, we have reached the final phase of the Doha negotiations, which must be concluded in Chinese territory, in fact, with such decisive issues as the openness of its economy, the exchange rates of its currency and stability in a part of the world in which a very alarming arms race is taking place.
Furthermore, China plays an important role in the Club of Twenty, which brings together some of the great tenors of the new world stage, and because of its history, because of its weight and also because the European Union has advocated that China should be incorporated into world trade, I believe that it makes sense at this point to ask these questions, taking the view that we are all in the same situation regardless of our specific characteristics, but that we must respect each other in order to survive together.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to respond to this debate.
It is important. It raises some very serious issues for us, and I am very glad this initiative has been taken.
I am also very grateful to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Trade for making his points in such a balanced and moderate, but no less serious way.
I agree that we have a great challenge on our hands to bring about the progressive integration of China to the global economy and to the international trading system.
We also have a responsibility to those whom you represent, and to whom others of us are accountable and are answerable, to smooth these changes in the best way we possibly can.
It is true that in one sense China is testing the limits of what is acceptable, as the honourable Member said.
Another way of putting it, however, is that China is presenting a competitive challenge to us in Europe to which we need to adjust.
Now many have.
In some cases though that adjustment remains to be made and we have to assist people in doing so.
My broad view is that Chinaâs renaissance in recent years brings with it many implications for the European Union and it is essential that we equip ourselves properly to deal with these challenges.
I believe that Chinaâs astonishing economic growth will be good, not only for China but also for Europe and for the rest of the world.
That makes it all the more important that we build the sort of dynamic relationship with China that is based on partnership, cooperation and respect, not just for each other, but for a rules-based multilateral economic system.
It is against that backcloth that I want to address two sets of issues this morning: first of all, the appropriate response we need to make to textiles imports from China and, secondly, what we need to do to continue to push China on its WTO implementation record and in particular its record of enforcement of intellectual property rights.
I shall first address the issue of textiles.
The level of textiles imports and the dramatic increase that we have seen since the beginning of this year, when textile quotas were finally removed, has become a very sensitive topic in many of our Member States.
There are many who have serious concerns and anxieties.
It is clear why and I understand those anxieties.
I am confident that our response is both appropriate and proportionate, but also legally defensible.
We have to satisfy both those requirements, basing our response on facts and data.
We need to act with a degree of caution, but also determination.
