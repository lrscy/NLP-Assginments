You have affirmed your belief in that, and for that we are grateful to you.
If we go down this road together, we will share in success.
Thank you for your time, Mr Poettering.
When I congratulated Mr Schulz and Mr Watson, I had not been told that Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Frassoni had also been elected co-Presidents of their groups; I too would like to congratulate them.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the congratulations; I, in my turn, want to congratulate all those who have been elected, irrespective of to what, but I want, for the moment, to focus on Mr Ahern's speech.

I think it is good that Mr Ahern has come to this House; I am grateful to him for being here, for the fact is that it is not the most obvious thing to do.
Not all his colleagues in the European Council can manage to summon up the nerve to come here and affirm their belief in Europe.
I want to make it clear that I think the Heads of Government who are publicly backing the European project deserve credit for coming here and saying that, whatever difficulties they face, they are standing up for Europe.
(Applause)
The fact is that there are too many of them who come here, who do not make their presence felt, who avoid this House and stop off perhaps only to collect some money from this or that European fund to take back home, where they will say that Europe is the problem!
There are too many of their kind around.
What we need are men and women who are in positions of leadership in Europe - be it in the Member States or in the European institutions - and who openly affirm their commitment to this project, and that, Mr Ahern, is why I have to start by thanking you for being here.
Let me make a second comment on the substance of your speech.
One can say 'yes' to absolutely everything in it, Prime Minister; the five priorities that you set out, the conviction that Ireland is in favour of the Constitution as a matter of principle, your desire to retain what is at the heart of it, your warning to us not to abandon that, for its essential content is the foundation for Europe's future - all these things are marvellous, but all that is missing is Ireland's ratification of it, so I urge you to summon up your courage and do that; if your speech today is a cake, that would be the icing on it.


I do not, however, want to demand too much of you, for you have at least taken the right step in the right direction, and even if Ireland were to ratify now, that would get us little further down the road, but, in any case, nineteen out of twenty-seven states would then have ratified it, and the fact that eighteen already have done so or are about to do so means that we can and must take note that the majority of the Member States of the European Union want what is in the Constitution, while those who do not are in the minority.
It is, I think, permissible to say that it is this minority that has to give way.
It is not acceptable that we should all be debating the future of Europe, while those who said 'no' think it is nothing to do with them, so the Dutch, and the French too, must get into step in a future process on the basis of a document to which the overwhelming majority of Member States have said 'yes'!
I believe that, if we do not move too far from this document, if we really can retain that which it contains, we will be saving the President of the Commission from having to run around like a water diviner in search of portfolios for his Commissioners.
If you need proof that Nice does not work and that we need the Constitution as a matter of urgency, then what we see happening with the Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania is it.
Many thanks, then, Mr Ahern; as we journey towards a renewed constitution, we need you, and we thank you for your encouraging speech.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's research - presented to one of our committees last week - has revealed, there is at least as much a communication crisis in the European Union as a constitutional crisis.
We risk slowly but inexorably losing the confidence and trust of our citizens by our collective failure to respond to their concerns and our inability to frame a coherent and acceptable response.
Those concerns are many and varied, but to my mind they hinge around responses to the challenges of the world in which we live.
We witness rapid world population growth, even though it is declining here, and failure to share equitably the fruits of our endeavours or the benefits of modernity.
As a result, many vote with their feet.
We are creating a global economy without forging a comparable global social contract.
We face a major challenge, as the Prime Minister mentioned, from internationally organised crime, with some criminal gangs now more powerful than some national governments.
Yet the Union seems more geared to solving yesterday's problems than today's or tomorrow's.
The tools to solve these problems are at our disposal in a common foreign and security policy and a justice and home affairs policy, but they lie unemployed.
The irony is that the Constitution as it emerged from the Convention probably met most critics' concerns.
Unfortunately, Europe's political class failed to explain this, for which we all share responsibility.
We left the field open to the Constitution's detractors and there is little sign yet that France will have a more serene or informed debate on its place in Europe in the run-up to next May's elections, or that the Netherlands, emerging from elections last week, has really made up its mind.
It would be too easy to conclude that the victory for the anti-European parties is confirmation that we got it wrong, but we need the Prime Ministers of those two countries to come here to explain to us how they see the way forward.
In Poland there is denial, and from across the English Channel an eerie silence reflecting relief and embarrassment in near equal measure.
I hope the Germans can relaunch the debate.
I applaud Angela Merkel's determination to do this, but I suspect she will find it extremely difficult within the period of the German Presidency.
This is where Ireland can play such an important part, Prime Minister, not only because of the role you played in the Convention, or your experience of adverse referendum, but because of Ireland's role in looking for what you called a return to the balance and the substance of the constitutional treaty, and in working together with Portugal and Slovenia.
Go out and build a coalition of smaller countries that know how important it is to respond to the challenges of globalisation.
Go out and build a coalition of the political forces which, in response to the challenges of globalisation, recognise that we need to keep the drawbridge down rather than pull it up.
We have to show our citizens that the European Union can work on energy policy, on issues like mobile phone roaming charges, and in particular on justice and home affairs.
We can do that with the existing Treaties by use of the passerelle clause.
By any objective standards our Union is a great success.
Therefore, think less about changes to the Constitution and more about building the collective courage to go out and persuade people why it is necessary.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Ahern, re-election puts one in a good mood; perhaps that is the reason why my group has asked me to speak today, so that I might not be a mild-mannered group chairman.
I do, of course, Prime Minister, welcome you warmly on behalf of our group; thank you for coming.
As you said, nobody knows what the future has in store for the constitutional treaty.
I must admit that I would be happier if I definitely knew what the governments had in store for it; one and a half years' break for reflection and thinking, one and a half years, already extended by a year, and what has come out of it?
I can neither see nor hear anyone thinking, and nobody is talking to us, although you have today, and you are one of the few.
We will perhaps return to your proposals, but what - over these eighteen months - has actually been thought or clarified?
The great and good are not asking what lies behind this crisis; they do not want to know what motivated those who, in France and the Netherlands, said 'no', or about the disappointed expectation of the public, and just why it is that the public have been so systematically disappointed.
Nor are they asking about new ways forward, about new exit routes from this crisis.
Where, in fact, is any thought being given to that?
I do not see much real cause for hope in a new beginning under the German Presidency of the Council.
I have been an observer of this since it all started.
What brought about this constitution-making process was not insight or idealism; nor were the Heads of Government inspired by a vision to embark upon it.
What did it was the lamentable fact that Amsterdam was a failure, that Nice was an outright disaster, that there was a massive crisis of confidence among all Europe's peoples.
It was the fact that this Union was up against a brick wall; the fact that it was, quite simply, impotent.
Then, of course, there was the double 'no'.
One ought to look into the reasons for it.
What astonishes me is that politicians like opinion polls, and I have never heard of anyone who would shy away from quoting a good one.
Eurobarometer ran very comprehensive and good surveys following the French and Dutch votes into the reasons for them, and into the public's expectations, and - I am not going to talk about the people who voted 'yes' in what are now eighteen Member States with a massive majority of the people and states of Europe, but about the 62% of Dutch people and 65% of French people who said 'no' - well, they also said: 'yes, we want a European constitution; we want it to be revised' and they even said what they wanted this to achieve, namely more powers for the Union in social matters.
I have never heard a member of a government reflect on that.
What you said today leaves me quite astonished.
In essence, what you say boils down to two familiar proposals: a treaty instead of a constitution.
I have to tell you, Prime Minister, that it was only the governments - and not the people of Europe - who were irritated by the idea that this political community should be endowed with a constitution.
Forcing through the actual policies in the way you propose will fail, precisely because of this crisis of confidence in Europe, this crisis of European democracy.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Ahern, it was with some excitement that I listened to your speech.
I think we have reached a point that could easily be defined as the 'point of no future' if we were working on the basis of 'business as usual'.
While Mr Ahern was quite clear in making the future of Europe dependent on what becomes of a constitutional treaty for the European Union, that does, however, presuppose that there has to be a long-term discussion process with that Union's citizens.
There are more reasons than those already - and repeatedly - adduced for why people are afraid that this European Union will be unable to offer them a future.
I do not see the text as submitted as providing any answers to a dichotomy that is, alas, all too often put to one side, for, although we have defined what wealth has been brought into this European Union of ours by way of every kind of people and nation - namely their highly diverse cultural identities - we have not, however, managed to define what we, together, are going to do with all this wealth.
It is one thing to ask what we bring with us, but considering what we are to do with it, how a shared political identity can be fashioned out of it, is a process that cannot be run as a sideline and certainly not on the basis of people being told the same thing over and over again, that being that they have not yet understood what good we are trying to do.
That is why I think that we have to take on board people's day-to-day experiences of the European Union and make actual policies that have to do with their future and their present, on the basis of them.
This is particularly true in relation to the issue of a social European Union, the neglect of which to date has been positively criminal.
There is, in fact, no point in us discussing this or that while people experience the precise opposite, as we have seen from the debate in Brussels about the Volkswagen workers, and in assorted other areas too.
The unfortunate fact is that, in the day-to-day lives of many, the European Union's presence is felt in the shape of decreasing job security and less social security, and that is not going to get people engaging with these processes and affirming their belief in them, even though that is precisely what we need, and I think we should have more discussion of how we create the conditions in which cultural identities can develop into shared political identities and into a civic identity for the European Union.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, it is a great honour for me to extend a warm welcome to the Taoiseach here to the European Parliament today.
Your visit shows your understanding of the important work of the European Parliament and the need for the European Union to find a solution to the constitutional difficulties which the Union is experiencing at present.
There are increasing difficulties within the European Union, not only on the Constitution but also, as other colleagues have mentioned, regarding globalisation, economic development and the common foreign and security policy.
The Taoiseach has given us a great vision today, not just through his words but also because of the experience he brings with him.
In nearly ten years in the European Council he has seen many leaders come and go, but he has also seen many of the crises that people previously thought would rent the European Union apart and found solutions for them, in particular concerning the agreement on the constitutional treaty.
There is no point going over what should or should not have been.
It is now up to the Member States in their period of reflection to present ideas as regards what should be brought forward.
Not just because we need a new treaty, or a new set of rules, but because we need to continue to demonstrate a vision to those countries on our borders which aspire to become part of the European Union and look to it as a model of peace, prosperity and stability.
I am thinking in particular of the countries in the Balkans.
We held out a candle of hope to them and, unfortunately, because we can no longer accommodate a further enlargement, that candle of hope could be extinguished, just when they are beginning to grow economically and find a new way forward in political and democratic terms.
With regard to globalisation, our main focus should be on making the European economy better able to deal with the situation in the 21st century.
This requires greater investment in research and development, greater use of innovation and technology and, I must stress, greater collaboration between universities and research institutes in the European Union through the European institute of technology.
Finally, I should like to tell the Taoiseach that it rests on him as the leader of one country to present that vision.
He spoke about the peace process in Northern Ireland and the importance of the European Union's role in that regard, not only in economic and financial terms but also in the model and vision it provided.
We must find a new Europe for the 21st century, where everybody can belong to that commonality.
But all groups must be sure that the diversity within the European Union today, and beyond it on the European continent, is respected in a process for collaboration and collective agreement rather than for domination.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Taoiseach here for an honest discussion about the future of Europe, but, as I was once told when asking for directions, I would not start from here.
Taoiseach, your government has cultivated Ireland's image in Europe as a success story, the once poor nation made good, but this House deserves to know what lies behind this so-called success.
As the Irish know, Ireland is now open for business, but closed for people.
We spend freely to lure the market but cut every corner in social spending.
It is this mentality that has lengthened waiting times for vital hospital procedures to months instead of days.
It has also seen families of children with disabilities badly treated, like the O'Cuanachains, hounded through the courts at a cost of millions just this year instead of their five-year-old child being given an appropriate education.
This is also the mindset which makes our Environmental Protection Agency a rubber stamp of approval for even the dirtiest business, no matter how damaging it is to the environment; a mindset that opens Ireland to toxic industries like incineration, which Irish people do not want.
You also seem to believe that the mental health and suicide problem, which grows with our economic success, is a mere inconvenience and not a tragedy that our country has never really addressed.
Similarly, there are tens of thousands of unpaid carers whom we should be supporting for the valuable work they are doing, but whom your government treats like Oliver Twist asking for more.
Why, Taoiseach, has your government destroyed our sugar industry for an EU scheme, when Irish agriculture is struggling for survival and when we need biofuels like ethanol?
Why did your government vote to allow EU funding for embryo-destructive research, when our people have always cherished the most vulnerable citizens?
Finally, Taoiseach, why have you come here propositioning us with a dead Constitution that the Irish do not want.
We already have a truly great Constitution, for which Irish men and women laid down their lives, a Constitution which gives us a genuine foundation for real and respectful cooperation with our European neighbours.
Ireland is a great country with amazing people.
They certainly deserve better and I think you will finally discover this when you put the Constitution, or whatever you decide to call it, to a referendum.
Mr President, to what do we owe the visit by the Irish Prime Minister today?
Could it be connected to the upcoming Irish election, to allow Mr Ahern to be seen back home as a statesman on the European scene?
One wonders!
The last time Mr Ahern was here at the end of the Irish Council Presidency, he was celebrating having overseen an agreement between the Heads of Governments on the EU Constitution.
He readily basked in the adulation of Europhile fanatics in this House.
By now, November 2006, he and they assured us that the EU Constitution would be in full operation.
But, as often happens, they reckoned without the most important component of democratic politics: the views of the people.
As the Constitution floundered on the rocks of rejection in France and Holland, Mr Ahern - though an avowed Euro-enthusiast - and my government in the United Kingdom lost their nerve and hurriedly abandoned the prospect of giving the people of the British Isles a chance to give their verdict by postponing the referenda, because they were fearful of the result.
Now he returns to tell us again of the marvels of European integration and that the rejected Constitution must be revived.
It seems to me that it is a stale message about a moribund Constitution from one who may well soon be judged by his own electorate to be a stale politician.
Mr President, I shall try to deal quickly with the issues.
I want to thank everybody for their welcome - I did not detect that from the last speaker, but from everybody else anyway!
(Laughter)
I want to thank Mr Poettering for his remarks.
The European Parliament's participation in the IGC during the Irish Presidency was extremely important and constructive.
The European Parliament was clearly very much part of it and it clearly should be involved in taking the process forward.
I think that is what you requested, and you certainly have my support in that.
I thank you for your remarks about the declaration in Berlin.
I support you.
Your issue about the reforms of Part I and the values and getting ourselves ready for the challenges in the future are all things that I readily agree with.
Mr Schulz spoke about the five priorities based on the future of Europe and the ratification process.
Ireland would have preferred it if everyone had ratified it at the same time, as that would have resolved a lot of problems without all the debate.
We have to remember that there are 16 or 17 countries that are committed to ratifying the Constitution: the majority of the parties, particularly the three large parties in our Parliament have clearly stated their support for it.
We believe that there must be some clarity.
Unlike other countries, because of our written Constitution, whatever happens we always have to have a referendum.
We do not just want to be putting words out that we know will change in some format because whatever happens, it will be entered into our Constitution.
We have to have certainty in that, but there is certainly no fear of us having referendums.
Mr Watson brought up the concerns of citizens and the global contract.
The big issue for that is for countries to show their support.
You mentioned the issues of JHA being consistent with the Treaties that are already there, dealing with issues of crime and the common foreign and security policy.
The biggest way we can show the developing countries our support is through our commitment under the UN to ODA.
That is what I try to practise, because you can talk all you like, but you have to be prepared to put your money into it.
For us as a small country, getting to 0.7 per cent is the small matter of EUR 1.5 billion!
That is a lot in our budget, but we are moving towards that fast, and we are doing that to help not only our own people but also the less well-of in various parts of the world.
I agree that if Chancellor Merkel can get the balance and substance right, it would mean amendments.
We accept that and we can move forward.
Mr Voggenhuber was right that a reflection of one and a half years has not brought us very far.
I accept that point.
However, neither have we gone back.
We are here in a reflection period and we must find a way forward.
Not everyone will agree, but I and 17 or 18 countries believe in the balance and substance of the constitutional treaty, with some amendments if it means accommodating France and the Netherlands - which we accept is the right thing to do.
Ultimately we will have to do that and get the institutional balance right and find a way forward.
It is not just some theoretical pro-European issue, it is to make the functioning of Europe correct for the future so that we can continue with our environmental and economic progress and our common foreign and security policy.
That is why we negotiated a treaty.
However, I accept your point: 13 months on is a long time, but there are still reasons for voting.
We shall have to deal with those reasons.
The reasons why we need a Union that can continually cater for new members - now 27 and in a few years' time possibly 30 - and our new neighbourhood policy were outlined in the Nice and Amsterdam Treaties.
We do not have the institutional changes and the balances that can cater for that.
That was the whole project, and the European Parliament was as strong an advocate for that as anyone.
Mrs Zimmer asked about a common EU identity and social dialogue.
From the time I entered political life in the 1972 referendum in Ireland I have always believed that social dialogue was absolutely essential to Ireland's future.
Ireland has succeeded and no longer has the high unemployment of 17 or 18% of the past, when the annual emigration equalled the entire labour market growth of the country; when our exports were in decline and economic growth was negative; when we had no money for the less well off in our society.
That was when we did not have social dialogue.
Economic performance and dealing with the agenda on competitiveness and social policy are mutual friends and they can work in harmony - they are not exclusive policies.
It is when they work together.
With respect, I never quite understand when people are arguing the issue on Europe why we always forget all the positives.
That applies to members of the European Council - I would accept that criticism - and I think it applies to Members of the European Parliament.
However, look at what has been achieved because of the strength of Europe.
Look at the equality agenda. Look at the health and safety agenda.
Look at the welfare agenda.
Look at the mobility of workers.
Would any of these have been here if this institution had not been here, if Europe had not been here?
Not a hope in hell!
Europe has achieved this.
So to talk against your own achievements is never a good idea, in my view.
Europe has achieved all these things and the chance of our harmonising, getting stronger environmental laws, more cooperation and helping less developed countries - all these are European policies that never would have happened otherwise.
Europe has pulled Ireland and other countries up and it has applied pressure, it has fined and prosecuted people.
However, the fact is that the citizens have gained from every one of those issues.
I would say to my good colleague, Mrs Sinnott, that the reason we have progressive disabilities legislation, the reason that we are putting huge resources into disability, the reason we have an Environmental Protection Agency, the reason we have far greater health policy, the reason we are able to support these things, is not because there is any difference between the 1937 Constitution - which treasures all the people and children of Ireland equally - and what we have today.
It is because we have been able to make progress because Europe has progressed.
I think these are great issues.
I am delighted to see Mr Allister here.
His party has moved forward progressively.
It has moved away from the past, even if not all of its members have, including himself.
However, we are moving on, we are making progress.
I will deal with my electorate and I wish you well in your February election, too.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
It is inevitable that our debates should always have a national component.
Various Members will now speak.
Mr President, as leader of the Fine Gael delegation in the largest and most influential group in the European Parliament, the PPE-DE Group, and on behalf of my colleagues Mr Coveney, Mr Higgins, Mrs McGuinness and Mr Mitchell, I have great pleasure in joining in the welcome to the Taoiseach today as the Prime Minister of our esteemed republic (notwithstanding the politically-hyped and inaccurate reports to the contrary in recent times).
We are Irish, Taoiseach, and as such we are European.
Our ancestors, the Celts, lived, thrived and established settlements throughout the European continent, from the shores of the Mediterranean to the peaks of the Alps, from the plains of Romania to the Atlantic coast, and, like many recent new arrivals in our own country, we migrated here to the continent seeking asylum from war, disease and over-population, seeking economic opportunity.
Over the subsequent centuries, Vikings, Saxons, Anglo-Normans, Jews, English, Scots, Spaniards, French Huguenots and many other races came, saw and intermarried with the Celts.
The modern day Irish you see around you at home, and indeed around here today, are the result of this genetic soup of different European races.
The history of Ireland and that of mainland Europe are inextricably linked.
The Irish monks travelled throughout Europe establishing Christian monasteries in such far-flung places as Iceland and Ukraine.
Our cultural and political links with Spain and France lasted for centuries, throughout the time when we were ruled by the British Crown.
Many Irish battalions served in the armies of the great European powers down the years.
Our very Constitution makes reference to our gallant allies in Europe.
And yet, for some reason during the past decade, an apathy, an ignorance about Europe or the European project has seeped into the Irish society, into European society.
Europe has become associated with Brussels and viewed from the Member State perspective as a place far away, with little relevance to the day-to-day lives of our citizens.
I believe that the rationale for the European project which rose out of the ashes of the Second World War, its very raison d'Ãªtre, has never been fully explained or understood.
Yes, Europe's political class, as another colleague said, continues to fail to explain the project and claims all the credit for itself at national level instead of acknowledging the European Union's role.
It is only since we joined the European Union that Ireland has become truly independent.
Culturally and psychologically, membership of the Union has broadened our horizons and encouraged us to look outwards.
Ireland's success in leaving behind the oppressive legacy of colonialism and building the new relationship with the UK, which has underpinned the Northern Ireland peace process, must be seen as a significant part of modern European history paralleling the fundamental rapprochement between France and Germany.
I admire Ireland's membership of and contribution to the Union.
I look around me at home and I see a confident, pluralistic society far removed from the introspective, sectarian Ireland in which our parents and grandparents were raised.
Europe has helped define our place in the wider world.
I salute the Taoiseach's Presidency of Europe and his particular contribution towards the finality of the Convention and the wonderful work being done by the Forum on Europe under the chairmanship of Maurice Hayes at home at the moment.
(GA) Thank you all very much.
(GA) Mr President, I welcome the Taoiseach.
It is extremely important that you are willing, Mr Taoiseach, to discuss matters pertaining to the future of Europe with us.
We all understand that the population of Europe is concerned.
It is not easy to arrive at a solution to the problems which are the basis of that concern.
I welcome your commitment to the substance of the constitutional text.
However, Member States and the Council are currently denying Europeans the accountable, democratic, and socially engaged Europe they want.
Why, Taoiseach, are you and other Heads of Government blocking key social directives on ferry crews, working time, migration and temporary work agencies?
Will you now help unblock all of these, as a means of rebuilding Europeans' confidence in Europe?
The Constitution must not be filleted.
A mini-treaty will give us a mini-Europe, when we need a strong, democratic Europe capable of coping with the global challenges we all face.
The most democratic way forward is to negotiate legally-binding protocols to address the concerns raised by the pro-European French and Dutch electorates.
Such an approach would reassure those pro-Europeans who voted 'no', would not oblige those who have already ratified to reopen the issue and would make it more likely that those yet to ratify, such as Ireland, can do so.
(Applause)
(NL) Mr President, it is unfortunate that not more Dutch people are taking part in this debate, because the Netherlands rejected the Constitution last year, and all the parties that were opposed to this Constitution achieved huge gains in the elections last week.
We do not yet know what form the coalition will take, but I hope that the Netherlands will once again show the ambition and vision to which Europe was accustomed from us, instead of constantly putting our foot on the brake, because Europe must, as a matter of urgency, be reformed.
Since the veto has a paralysing effect in the area of security, Member States increasingly resort to informal arrangements, thereby ducking both national and European parliamentary control in a kind of parallel, opaque and undemocratic decision-making structure.
Vetoes can also be abolished without the Constitution, for example in the area of police and judicial cooperation.
Without the Constitution, Council meetings can be completely out in the open and attention can be devoted to citizens' initiatives that are backed up by a million signatures.
The Europe of the governments and diplomats has reached its limits.
It is therefore more logical to look for a solution in a public debate, for example in the Convention, rather than in closed negotiations between ministers and Heads of Government.
That is how we also avoid blockades by individual countries.
Prime Minister Ahern is probably right in saying that it is better to improve the Constitution by adding bits to it rather than by reducing it to its bare bones.
He is also right to say that simultaneous ratification across Europe would be much better than national procedures.
The highest priority, though, must be the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The European fundamental rights are the beating heart, the very soul, of our community, and Europe will not exist unless it has a soul.
I therefore endorse what Prime Minister Ahern had to say.
(DE) Mr President, as you can see, my group has organised a collection of speaking time today, so what you are getting is a speech in instalments - European rhetoric, new style.
As I said earlier, Prime Minister, we have had a two-year period of reflection in which there has been no reflection, any more than we have had the loudly-trumpeted debate with the European public.
The Commission's 'Plan D' exists on paper and nowhere else.
Even though I hear all the promises from the governments, who never tire of telling us about their plans for rescuing the constitution, if I listen very carefully, I am reminded of the Trojan Horse, in that, if you put your ear to the wooden horse, you hear the clink of weapons and become aware that it exists with quite different purposes in mind, things that have absolutely nothing to do with what we have been, for years, hearing and discussing in the European public square, or with what I see as being the causes of this crisis.
What do we hear from the governments?
We hear that they are putting a treaty together!
Well, an international organisation really is the last thing that we need.
It is not the sort of political community that will defeat nationalism.
In actual practice, Europe always loses out from any such balance between it and nationalism.
The public want a constitution because they can see that it is about a political community, and because what they had been promised was the political unification of Europe, the political unification of this continent.
What we get instead is more talk of a treaty.
You also, today, promised us even more competition.
Never - in the Netherlands, in France, or anywhere else in Europe, at hundreds of debates and events - have I heard calls for more competition.
'More competition' is something demanded only by the elites, by the neoliberals, and by governments.
Let me tell you, speaking as one who has been given the chance to pick up what the people are saying, that what we need is a balance between economic and political integration, in the shape of a social Union.
How often do you propose - through your intergovernmental, self-aggrandising management of the Lisbon process - to report to the public that it has yielded nothing?
That is what the public demand to know.
What has become of the governments' dialogue on a social Union, on putting an end to tax dumping and social dumping in Europe?
That is what the public want to know.
You talk about a sense of security; now that, if you do not mind, is what I call populism, for appealing to security always presses the right buttons, but not a word has been said about the Charter of Fundamental Rights for months, not even about parliamentary monitoring, as shown by the CIA abductions and the failure to explain just how and to what extent European governments helped it with them.
Nothing is being said about the enhancement of Parliament's functions, about a Charter of Fundamental Rights enforceable at law, or about the protection of the public - yet that is what the public themselves are talking about!
From deep within the Trojan Horse, I keep on hearing other things, like talk of military cooperation - security again - but nothing whatever about a common, democratic, autonomous foreign policy, about playing a responsible role both globally and within the WTO, a role defending a fair system of global trade and putting development policy on a completely different level.
I get the feeling that, in amidst this crisis, the ordinary citizen has been lost from sight.
The governments, in the armour and costume of knights, have reappeared before us and are blocking Europe's way.
(GA) Mr President, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach here today.
I am very pleased that the Taoiseach is addressing today's plenary session.
The European Union is in a phase of transition, continued expansion, new cultures, new ideas and new challenges.
The important question is how to meet these challenges.
Is it through a race to the bottom, as evidenced in Ireland during the Irish ferries dispute last year and repeated many times since, or is it by ensuring that we are at the fore in demanding the highest standards regarding rights, reform of bureaucratic EU structures and a political programme that truly puts the people of the European Union first?
We must promote a Europe that seeks to protect the most vulnerable, particularly the 65 million living in poverty across the Union.
Taoiseach, we must do the same in Ireland, and this means succeeding in our peace process, ending partition, building strong public services and promoting equality in every aspect of life.
I believe that we can meet all these challenges, but only if there is real political will: a will to radically alter the EU's current and future priorities.
This is not a matter of presentational nuance.
It is a matter of substance. I would ask you, Taoiseach, and other EU leaders to truly listen to people across the EU and to respond to their needs.
This can be best done by defending workers' rights, protecting public services and halting the drive towards a militarised and fortressed European Union.
We in Sinn FÃ©in, and our colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group, are committed to ensuring that the future of Europe is based on principles of democracy, equality and solidarity.
(GA) Mr President, I extend a warm welcome to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to the European Parliament.
I am delighted to hear him speaking about the future of Europe in Parliament today in our own native language, Irish.
This is a symbolic step as Irish will very shortly be an official working language at Institutional level in Europe.
The Taoiseach is greatly to be praised for his efforts to influence the Council of Europe and the various governments, to ensure their support for his proposal: to upgrade Irish at European level.
Romania and Bulgaria, who are poised to gain representation at the level of the European Commission, made a comprehensive presentation in Parliament this week.
I fully support the decision of JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, to give the responsibilities for multilingualism to Leonard Orban, Romania's nominated Commissioner.
We all know that Europe is hanging in the balance at present as regards reform and greater efficiency of Institutional procedure.
I believe that modern Institutional procedure will strengthen the role of the European Union and ensure that the Union is able to speak, able to address economic challenges which face many of the Member States at present.
Germany will assume Presidency of the Union on New Year's Day next year, God willing.
President Merkel has already indicated that she intends to address the difficulties concerning the Constitution of the Union during her period in charge.
It does not help that the Union's Constitution was rejected in the Netherlands and France last year.
France will have a newly elected President next year and I hope that he or she will be able to make greater efforts than have been made heretofore.
There are great challenges ahead for us but let us not beguile ourselves about that.
Reforms must be made within the European Union and priority must be given to the work programme of the various Institutions for this reform.
There is a danger that the Union will be ineffective if this is not done immediately.
Thank you very much.
(EL) Mr President, Mr Prime Minister of Ireland, if I were an artist and I was asked to draw the future of Europe, I would use black paint.
We are following in exactly the footsteps which destroyed the Holy Alliance, in other words the previous unified Europe two centuries ago.
We may have laws in Europe, but we have no national conscience.
We may have capital but we do not have sufficient development.
We may have industry, but we have no energy.
We may have a great deal of land, but we have no borders.
My question is: who here can tell me where the southeast borders of Europe are?
They are flexible.
There are two problems: energy and the guardianship of America.
It is a lie that America is leading us into permanent adversity with Russia, into reservations about China and into entanglement in Afghanistan and Iran?
Is it not America that distorts our vision of what is happening in the Middle East?
Is it not America that prevents us from developing an independent foreign policy?
That is the truth.
Is there any reaction?
Is there any inclination for Europe to acquire autonomy?
We have a strong currency and we also have a central bank; but we do not have our own army.
We can pass a constitution, but which army will defend the principles and values which that constitution will profess?
ÎÎÎ€Î, with its American supreme commander, Turkish chief of staff and its Canadian chairman?
We need to decide.
Do we want to take on the structure of a state or will we be - what we are - under the guardianship of the Americans?
Apparently we have no energy.
There is a great deal of oil in the Aegean.
Come and get it.
The American and Turkish economies do not allow that.
There is oil which can resolve all of Europe's problems.
So let us make an effort to be independent, to be masters of our own house, so that we do not depend on the Americans.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to welcome the Irish Prime Minister.
The Institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - are in favour of a new model of Europe: we need to find out whether this new model is in line with what the voters want, voters who, at least in France and the Netherlands, have rejected the proposals made by the Convention.
May we never forget to take account of the will of the people and not of certain ideals, which, noble and grand as they may be, are not shared by citizens and voters.
This, in my opinion, is the fundamental issue for the foundations of a possible future treaty.
Let us begin, for example, to dispel certain myths: some say that we need to change because we now have so many more Member States.
The United States grew from 13 to 50 States, keeping the same Constitution more or less unchanged since 1776.
If the bureaucrats need a new instrument, the same is not necessarily true for voters.
Voters must be persuaded of the advantage of a new Europe: we need to make them understand, for instance, why being in the European Union is better than being in Switzerland or Norway, which do not belong to the Union.
If we do not succeed in making them understand this concept, it will be difficult to achieve a consensus.
I have one final observation to make: the Italian President, Giorgio Napolitano, has called for ratification of the treaty, but the treaty is already dead.
This would only be a waste of time and energy now that, without the two ratifications by the Dutch and the French, it is pointless to continue with others, which, in any case, would have no practical effect.
Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome the Taoiseach to Parliament.
I would like to start on a note of harmony in saying that I have read with great interest his recent statements on the passerelle clause in matters relating to justice and home affairs and I entirely agree with him that we should not proceed down that road.
Criminal justice policy, the fight against terrorism and action to defeat trafficking and illegal emigration, are matters that rightly belong to the nation state, yet we have not even explored all the options to improve intergovernmental cooperation in these and other justice fields, and I believe that we should.
As for the Constitution, the debate now seems to be entering the realms of fantasy.
The French and Dutch people delivered the fatal blow, and yet we hear this week that the Finnish Presidency has been quietly stock-taking with Member States to see whether it can somehow be resuscitated.
Mr Sarkozy calls for a 'mini-Constitution'.
The Commission rejects it.
The German Government says it wants the Constitution kept intact and then resurrected.
The outgoing Dutch Government made clear it would not have a second referendum.
The British Government, true to form, appears to be split: the Foreign Secretary says it was a grandiose scheme which had failed; the junior Europe Minister says we need to address the substance of the Constitution.
Well, has the penny dropped yet?
Europe needs to move on.
It needs to move on to stop alienating the electorate in a dangerous way.
I have called consistently for reforms.
We must have economic reforms.
We must address the failure to achieve the Kyoto emission targets.
We must have those fundamental reforms, enabling us to compete with the emerging giants in Asia.
We need to have agricultural policies that do not undermine the fight against global poverty and we need effective leadership.
As my party leader has said, it is because we want to see a future for the EU and believe in a strong Europe that we call for a change of direction.
Our continent is crying out for leadership and we debate a piece of paper.
I have to say that history is sadly littered with unwanted and inappropriate pieces of paper.
(PL) Mr President, six months have elapsed since the last debate on the future of Europe held by the European Parliament.
Initially, the legal framework for the future of Europe was to have been provided by the Constitutional Treaty.
This future is unfolding before our very eyes, since then it has been decided to proceed with the next phase of enlargement and welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Union.
At the same time, however, there is a sense in which the future has been put on ice until the second half of 2008, which is when the reflection period for the Constitutional Treaty is due to end after being extended for a second time.
In my view, we should use this second period of reflection primarily to consider the increased scepticism expressed by Europeans on further enlargements of the Union.
The citizens of Europe need to appreciate and understand that decisions on the accession of new Member States are taken entirely responsibly.
They also need to have the assurance that such decisions are made with full consideration for the Union's budgetary capacity, thus guaranteeing that it can function efficiently in the future.
As earlier strategic decisions to ensure Europe's economic competitiveness with other parts of the world are implemented, it is important that we strengthen the role of education in the development of future generations of innovative Europeans.
We should promote a creative economy based on knowledge and imagination, as this will be the key to success for European businesses at global level.
A well-educated and dynamic European Union society is a sine qua non for the Union to play a leading role on the world stage, and to prove that as well as dealing with its own problems, it can also successfully combat international crime and terrorism.
(GA) Mr President, firstly, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach.
I am happy to say that, broadly speaking, I agree with your analysis.
We do need to change the context, highlight the positives and retain the balance and essential substance of the Constitution.
The impasse in the Constitution was precipitated by the 'no' vote in France and the Netherlands, but, in my opinion, this was not a 'no, no, no' to everything European.
It was a wake-up call saying, 'The future of Europe concerns us as ordinary citizens and we too have a role to play'.
Democracy, like life, can be a messy business and, while leaders must lead, they must also listen.
We have had our period of reflection and we now need a period of consolidation, where the EU is seen to deliver for it citizens on the Lisbon Agenda, on protection of workers, on support for European business, on environmental sustainability and on the ability of the EU to compete as a player on the global stage.
In essence, the EU must manage the challenge of globalisation for all its citizens.
If the EU can deliver on this major task, then I believe it has a solid future.
(GA) Mr President, I also welcome the Taoiseach to the European Parliament today.
During this period of reflection, it is clear that certain people are contemplating one thing only, namely, how to get the best response.
Be that as it may be, so much importance attaches to the debate about the future of Europe that it is necessary to include as many voices as possible from every sector of society and the range of the various opinions must be respected and attended to.
We welcome and even encourage such debate.
There is a vision of Europe which places people, equality, social and economic rights and civic rights at its centre.
That is our vision in Sinn FÃ©in and the vision of our partners in the GUE/NGL Group.
Citizens are concerned, they are concerned about militarism and about making Europe into a fortress, they are concerned about political and economic power going further away from the ordinary person.
They are also concerned about privatisation and that equality, sustainability and social cohesion will suffer as a consequence.
We heard part of the response to that from the Taoiseach today, but the Council and the European Commission must state clearly whether or not they have heard those concerns and tell us how they are to proceed from here.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of today's debate is the future of Europe, in respect of which we fear the worst in view of Turkey's persistent refusal to abide by its obligations in international law resulting from its customs agreement with the EU, and hence to allow Cypriot ships in its ports, and particularly in view of the way in which Europe has reacted to this.
Turkey still fails to respect basic human rights and flouts international commitments.
It is a state that categorically refuses to reconcile itself with its neighbours Cyprus and Armenia and is already intimidating European Member States.
Despite all this, official Europe insists that the negotiations be continued.
Turkey aspires to be European, but takes its cue from the United Nations, the United States in other words, in order to escape its European obligations.
In the current circumstances, then, its accession to the EU remains out of the question.
If Turkey is laying down the law even now, what will happen if it is allowed to join us at the negotiating table?
If the EU wants to remain credible in the eyes of its citizens and to safeguard its future, then Europe must send out a strong signal and cease the accession negotiations with Ankara with immediate effect.
(EL) Mr President, Prime Minister, I too shall take my turn in congratulating you on your presence here today.
I think that all of us here in this Chamber agree that the European Union of the 25 today and of the 27 in a month's time cannot function with the same rules as the Europe of the 6, the 9, the 10 or the 15 Member States functioned.
I recall that in May, during the previous debate again on the future of Europe, the Belgian Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the next German Presidency.
Mrs Merkel expressed its intention to table proposals for the European Constitutional Treaty.
We welcome her intentions, but I wonder if something of the sort is realistic or if this is an effort to resuscitate a text which is already dead.
The answer cannot be unequivocal, because it obviously depends on the objective which is set.
I sent letters to the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Blair, and to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, back in July 2005, in which I referred to the limitation of our demands to the regulation of institutional matters alone, such as the legal personality of the European Union, the new weighting of votes in the Council, the increase in the competences of the European Parliament, the creation of a position of Minister of Foreign Affairs and even the creation of a position of president of the Union, a reduction in the number of Commissioners, the abolition of the system of the three pillars and the strengthening of the institution of reinforced cooperation between the Member States.
I believe this is the only way that Europe can get out of the crisis it is in today.
(DE) Mr President, I congratulate the Prime Minister on his speech to this House, and am also grateful for his clear line on the constitutional treaty - no new negotiations, no cherry-picking, no residual stump of a treaty, no mini-treaty regulating just a few institutional matters - for such a thing, as has already been said here, really would rob the new treaty of its heart and soul.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, the popular participation aspects, the democratic aspects - all these things belong together.
The whole thing was a package deal, an all-embracing compromise, and it must not be torn asunder.
That is why our watchword must be that we will not yield on the substance that the new treaty can have, but we will be flexible about the form it can take.
I fully agree with you that such a treaty must not be a book, but must instead be compact, precise and brief.
All the things we might consider cutting out of the treaty are to be found in its third part.
You also made reference to additional elements; it is by these that we may be enabled to address the concerns and fears of people in the Netherlands and in France, but we also need these two countries to give us a clear idea of what they want to see changed.
There are Members in this House who seem to know what the people wanted; I found their 'no' utterly vague, with no clear indication of where it was actually coming from.
That is why we will have to wait for the French election and for the new Dutch Government if we want to know exactly what additional elements will be needed.
I would like to see you deliver this speech not only in this House, but also in many of the capitals in the EU.
It was under your presidency of the Council that agreement was achieved, and so you have a responsibility to seek out those who are friends of the Constitution and get this project completed after all.
Mr President, the Taoiseach properly said that the achievement of the 2004 package was extremely tricky and complex.
Surely it would be sensible, therefore, to ring-fence the preamble and the first and second parts from renegotiation and to focus all the effort on modernising and improving Part III?
Surely we cannot achieve greater competitiveness, a strengthened social partnership, improvements to a common energy policy and so forth without a substantive improvement to Part III?
(Applause)
Mr President, in the language of some of my ancestors, I should like to say to the Taoiseach:
(GA) Welcome to the European Parliament.
Welcome to the Parliament of Europe, which symbolises the motto of the European Union, 'unity with diversity'.
There are representatives of every political party in Europe, from Left to Right, from capital cities to regions, from governing parties to opposition parties.
It is the Parliament that voted by 500 votes to 137 to endorse this constitutional treaty as the best way forward for the future of Europe.
So I am particularly glad to hear you say today that we must find the solution to these issues, because the problems the constitutional treaty was intended to solve have not disappeared overnight.
They have not gone away.
We must find a solution acceptable to all 27 countries, including the two that voted 'no', but also taking account of the 18 that have voted 'yes', which will wish to keep the text as intact as possible.
I was glad to hear that, though it has not yet ratified, Ireland also wishes to keep the text as intact as possible.
That is an important message for us.
In the UK too, my Government signed the constitutional treaty and was re-elected on the basis of a manifesto that said that it would campaign with enthusiasm for this constitutional treaty.
There is wide recognition that whatever solution is found next June, and one must be found, it should take account of the will of the majority and keep as much as can be salvaged of this constitutional treaty.
Prime Minister of Ireland. Mr President, in response to all of the speakers, there is obviously a great divergence of views and opinions, but this Parliament, by an enormous majority, did ratify and support the Constitution.
However, I want to thank all the Members for their points of view.
It is useful for me as a Member of the European Council, and having been so involved in the Constitution, just to hear those points.
I think the exchange from that has been very valuable.
It gives me a perspective that I suppose is difficult to get from this remove.
As all of those Members have said, it is important we listen to the people.
It is not always possible to listen to all the people, but in that case you can listen to their elected representatives.
This has afforded me the opportunity of explaining the rationale underpinning so many views on the Constitution.
I have also had an opportunity to give my views.
I think that the Constitution is a very balanced and fair document.
I think it is an equitable document.
Of course it is made up of compromises.
When you are trying to get 25 countries - as it was then - to agree, there have to be compromises in the text.
It was not just a quick question of any one person saying 'this is the position'.
Things change.
As I went around Europe there were many issues that were totally different in different countries, that caught the public imagination, that created a lot of difficulties in the media, and then people had to change or deliberate on what wording they could agree on, so it is not perfect insofar as it is just written with no ambiguities whatever, but it has been negotiated.
There are those who believe that perhaps it was written in isolation - I think there were some comments about that.
I understand that after a few years, but I would remind Members of Parliament that the Convention had a very active group from Parliament.
They worked very hard.
They were the representatives of the people, they were elected by the people, they were answerable to the people and I think the governments are too.
You cannot have a Constitution that is negotiated by 500 million people.
You have to have their representatives doing it, and I think they did a good job on it.
So sometimes that is the issue about legitimacy and democracy.
I noted the points about fighting for the issues of human rights and values, and that this is what people are about, and not crime and drugs.
The people I meet are far more concerned with both issues.
They want to see that the rule of law, the rule of courts, the legal system protects everybody equally.
However, they also want to see that those who are involved in criminality across borders and those who are engaged in criminal activity are dealt with.
So if you are a supporter of human rights, then you are obviously a supporter of the Constitution, because the Charter for Fundamental Rights is the first time in Europe that we have put all these things into the Constitution so I think you should definitely be a strong advocate of the Constitution.
I think what is necessary for us now is not to try to renegotiate everything.
With the German Presidency coming up, the Chancellor has clearly stated that she will set up a small group of officials to deal with a small group of officials in every country to identify where there are differences or difficulties.
In my view, that should count 90% of the Constitution out.
The focus and the concentration and effort will then be on the remaining 10%.
My colleague from Ireland, Mr De Rossa, made a very fair point, one I have made several times, and it happened in the case of Ireland and Nice.
The issue then is to try to get protocols to deal with the issues, that is the sensible thing: not throwing away parts of the Constitution that have been agreed upon by Parliament, by the Council, by 18 countries across Europe, but to try to find and accommodate the difficulties and analyse what the difficulties are in those countries which have voted 'no', or perhaps others which have reservations.
That is not an impossible task.
It has been done already in the countries where the Constitution was lost.
As stated earlier on, there were opinion polls looking into what those issues were and trying to deal with those issues.
I think that is possible.
If those issues are looked at in the IGC or the Council, it should be possible.
I do not think it should take a long time.
I would just ask Parliament, and hope - as I will try to do in Council - to keep supporting the Constitution with the balanced view that we have to deal with a small number of outstanding issues as regards some countries and perhaps as regards countries that have declared their positions recently because of changes in governments.
We should try to deal with that.
If we can do that, then with the reason and purpose and the whole desire to have a European Constitution - if that is what it is called; that is not something I get too excited about - we can move forward collectively to do that.
I really believe it is possible.
(Applause)
Thank you, Prime Minister, for your speech which I personally found very useful and pragmatic.
The debate is closed.

Russia-EU summit (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Russia-European Union summit.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighteenth EU-Russia Summit was held last week in Helsinki.
In accordance with established practice, the Summit dealt with the 'four common spaces' the two sides share, as well as international issues more widely.
The Northern Dimension Summit between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland was held at the same time.
Our wide-ranging discussion on matters crucial to relations between the EU and Russia was conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
With regard to the new EU-Russia treaty, we saw that the process of establishing a negotiating mandate had been an intensive one over the previous few weeks.
The EU will continue to deal with the issue of the mandate, with the aim of commencing talks as soon as possible.
Four Permanent Partnership Council ministerial meetings have been held this autumn to enhance concrete cooperation.
These have been between the EU and Russian Ministers for Transport, the Environment, Justice and Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs.
With regard to the Common Economic Space, we found that there had been positive developments in many sectors of cooperation.
Agreement was reached at the Summit on charges for Siberian overflights and putting an end to them.
Furthermore, European Union and Russian Heads of State or Government recognised the enormous common interest that they had and the dependence on both sides in energy relations.
The European Union highlighted the importance of the principles of transparency, predictability, reciprocity and openness in energy markets, investment and the transit infrastructure.
These principles should also be incorporated in the new EU-Russia treaty.
The Union insisted that the parties must guarantee their commitment to comply with the Energy Charter.
Other themes of the discussion were the growth in trade and investment between the European Union and Russia, traffic congestion and the development of an electronic customs clearance system, on which we made very obvious headway.
We said that progress in the talks on Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation will have a very positive effect on the economic space shared by the EU and Russia.
Negotiations on extensive and comprehensive free trade between the EU and Russia can be started when Russia has joined the WTO.
The dialogue on the environment endorsed at the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council (Environment) in October will create a basis for wide-ranging cooperation.
Cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs has made progress in many sectors.
We considered it of major importance that the agreements on visa facilitation and the readmission of illegal immigrants signed in May should come into force as quickly as possible.
On human rights, the European Union voiced its concern regarding the situation in Chechnya, and was of the opinion that it was important that all human rights crimes should be investigated thoroughly and individuals guilty of them brought to justice.
The EU also mentioned the matter of preconditions for developments in the rule of law, for freedom of expression and for an independent media, including investigations into the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and the Mikhail Khodorkovski case.
The EU referred to the human rights consultations organised at the start of November, which went more deeply into these issues and examined the human rights situation in Russia more exhaustively.
The EU said that it was committed to closer cooperation on human rights and developing consultations on the subject.
The European Union and Russia stressed the importance of direct contact between their citizens as a basis for a strategic partnership.
This partnership can be enhanced in particular in the domains of education and culture.
Cooperation between universities, as well as student exchange programmes between the Union and Russia, have been high up on the agenda this autumn, and we want to put effort into this in the future too.
Our view was that cooperation in international matters is important for security and prosperity in Europe as a whole.
We recognised how positively relations had developed in the context of several international matters.
Cooperation between the Union and Russia must nevertheless be made to move in a more obvious direction.
Some of the international issues raised were the Western Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the situation regarding North Korea, Georgia, Belarus and Moldova.
A Northern Dimension Summit was held to run alongside the EU-Russia Summit.
At this summit, new basic documents, the Political Declaration and the Framework Document, were approved.
With these decisions in place, the Northern Dimension will be renewed from the start of next year.
The renewed Northern Dimension represents the common policy of four equal partners: the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland.
The Northern Dimension policy covers a vast geographical area, including the Baltic Sea, Northwest Russia, and the Arctic regions.
It supports the implementation of the four common spaces between the EU and Russia in this geographical area.
Moreover, the Northern Dimension focuses on special issues in northern regions, such as the vulnerable environment, indigenous peoples and health.
A joint steering group of partners is to be set up for the Northern Dimension to speed up practical cooperation.
The existing Northern Dimension partnerships - that is, the Environmental Partnership and the Partnership in Public Health and Well-being - we want to continue and develop further.
We shall also aim to examine the potential for applying the partnership model in the transport and logistics sector and strengthen cooperation in the area of energy efficiency.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I am most grateful for the opportunity to inform you about the EU-Russia Summit, which took place in Helsinki.
This was the third EU meeting with President Putin this year, following the one in Sochi in May and the dinner in Lahti, which gave us a good opportunity to speak about energy issues.
Like my colleague, I greatly welcome the fact that Commission Vice-President Barrot and Minister Levitin were finally able to sign the Protocol on Siberian overflights.
We have been working on this issue for many years and this is an important achievement, bringing an end to a persistent irritant in EU-Russia relations.
It was also one of our conditions for Russia's WTO accession.
Therefore I warmly welcome this achievement and thank Mr Barrot for his efforts.
Immediately before the summit, we had a very good discussion on closer economic integration with EU and Russian business leaders.
They delivered a message of strong support for the benefits this would bring to the business communities on both sides.
Later, at the summit, there was a consensus that we should carry forward work on this subject over the coming months.
Our vision is the creation of a common economic area, essentially operating the same rules and providing for fair trade.
On energy, President Putin confirmed that the Energy Charter Treaty would not be ratified as it stands, but he also clearly expressed willingness to come to a deal that would respect the interests of both sides and include the principles of the Energy Treaty, as he said in Sochi.
He called for reciprocity, including access for Russian capital to key strategic industries in the European Union.
It is unfortunate that it was not possible to announce the opening of negotiations for our new strategic agreement.
However, I am confident that the remaining difficulties will be resolved shortly.
President Barroso made it clear, after the inspection carried out by officials of our Food and Veterinary Office, that we consider that the ban on certain Polish exports is not proportionate.
He pressed President Putin strongly to lift it and, in any case, to agree to tripartite talks between Poland, Russia and the Commission to settle this issue.
President Putin made it clear that the issue was not Polish meat as such, but the transit of meat from other countries through Poland to Russia.
Finally, as far as the new agreement is concerned, it was reconfirmed, vitally, that there will be no legal vacuum when the current agreement reaches the end of its initial ten-year period.
Even though we have not yet started negotiations for an agreement, we can continue and we have a legal basis.
Another important issue already mentioned tonight is that of the long queues of vehicles waiting to enter Russia at EU borders.
We agreed to give urgent attention to that.
A mission involving the Commissioner for Taxation and some Member States had already taken place at the various borders between Russia and the Member States.
We all noted that the origin of this problem was the growth in trade, namely the increase in trade between the EU and Russia, on the one hand, and the overall increase of trade with Russia, including transiting, on the other.
But the infrastructure is already at maximum capacity and Russian procedures are cumbersome.
For instance, there are currently seven security procedures, which Mr Putin has promised to reduce to two.
That is very important.
For its part, the Commission will shortly be making proposals in its report to address some of these customs issues.
We also offered to cooperate on a pilot project.
The question is whether data can be dealt with on the basis of a computer-based system.
There was also a generally positive assessment of cooperation on Freedom, Security and Justice.
The Russian side said that the agreements on visa facilitation and readmission would be sent for ratification soon.
This is very positive, because readmission also helps the European Union.
I would like to express my appreciation for the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee's input on Kaliningrad.
On this matter, Russia raised the future of the Lithuanian scheme for cost-free visas, aluminium export duties and the treatment of minorities in Latvia and Estonia.
We made it clear that these issues have either already been resolved or, in the case of visas for visitors from Kaliningrad to Lithuania, can be addressed.
On external security, the European Union pressed for more cooperation in the common neighbourhood, while Russia emphasised non-proliferation and disarmament, particularly with regard to Iran and North Korea.
President Barroso outlined progress towards meeting the Kananaskis commitments.
It was agreed that new ways to cooperate on crisis management should be pursued.
We also raised concerns regarding the human rights situation in Russia, notably the killing of Mrs Politkovskaya.
President Barroso indicated that the perceived lack of due process caused concern in the European Union.
As requested by the President of Parliament and other honourable Members, he also raised the case of Mikhail Khordorkovsky.
President Putin defended the situation in Russia.
I will not repeat the comments made by the Presidency on foreign policy issues other than to note the importance we attach to cooperation at the United Nations on Iran, to promote the six-party talks on North Korea and to work with Russia in the Middle East through the Quartet.
Russia asked for an urgent meeting of the Quartet, which we hope will take place before Christmas.
We also need to work intensively to reduce our differences on Georgia and Kosovo, on which an exchange of views was held.
Finally, as my colleague said, the special Northern Dimension Summit took place for the first time.
It was a success and I welcome Russia's involvement in that overall idea.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, a close partnership between Russia and the European Union is of vital interest to both sides, but for that partnership to be viable it must be based on balance: balance between the interests of the Union and the interests of Russia, and balance as regards economic issues and issues of democracy and fundamental human rights.
Looking at recent summits, some progress was made.
As was mentioned, rights in respect of Siberian overflights will meet WTO standards.
That is a good thing. The visa facilitation of last year is also a good development.
However, in general, the summit was disappointing.
The Polish veto plays a major role.
Although in general we are against vetoes and we must all work together to get this veto from the table, I must say that the European People's Party understands the Polish position.
We agree with Commission President Barroso, who has called the ban on Polish meat by Russia an excessive reaction.
He saw no reasons for maintaining this ban.
That is why the European People's Party calls upon Russia to work constructively with us to get this veto from the table by finding ways to lift the ban on Polish meat.
We would like to see the same attitude to Georgia.
We hope that, as regards Moldova, the ban will go from the table - we saw an announcement about that today and we would ask Russia not to threaten to have bans on all of the European Union when Romania and Bulgaria enter.
If we can proceed with the negotiations, let us talk about balance and economy.
If Russia wants to invest in our industries, we must be able to invest in the same way in Russian industries.
Let us talk about the energy chapter, where we hope, after the agreement in principle, that the basic principles of the chapter will be accepted.
Last but not least, let us talk about human rights.
I hope the human rights dialogue can take place in public.
I really hope that Russia will send good signals after the recent suspicious assassinations by first of all catching the killers of Anna Politkovskaya.
Let us, as Europe, be united on this more than ever before.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as the representatives both of the Council and of the Commission have indicated - without, however, spelling it out explicitly - there is no doubt that relations between the European Union and Russia have become problematic.
My group was in favour of embarking on negotiations with Russia, on the grounds that this would have been the test of whether or not that country really was willing to engage in fair negotiations and arrive at fair outcomes, but we do very much understand what motivated Poland to exercise its veto, and, if discriminatory action is being taken - for that is how I understand what the Commissioner said - then Poland deserves our full solidarity.
We cannot tolerate discriminatory or unfair treatment of any one or more Member States of the EU.
Secondly, what is absolutely necessary now is that the European Union should act as one.
It is not acceptable that individual countries should set off on solo jaunts and make it possible for Russia to cherrypick certain countries with which to carry on separate negotiations.
I trust that solidarity within the European Union will remain unimpaired.
Thirdly, our common neighbours need support, for they are in a difficult position where Russia is concerned.
It is the idea of offering them support that underpins our ideas for an EU/Black Sea community, which we will be discussing in this House in December.
Fourthly, there is the human rights issue, about which we will not be silent, whether or not we now start negotiations, but we cannot possibly accept it when President Putin says, on the one hand, that he has nothing to do with all the things that are going on, while, on the other, doing nothing to ensure that those who are responsible end up before a judge.
It is the President of Russia who now needs to deal with this matter - him and nobody else.
None of us - certainly none of the members of my own group - wants another Cold War with Russia, but we will not be silent for as long as such violations of human rights are going on as we see at present, resulting in the deaths of people who are contending for the free expression of opinion in Russia.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, a new atmosphere of cooperation has emerged between the European Union and Russia in recent months: the Spirit of Lahti, as it was called after the informal summit in the autumn.
Furthermore, it was in this selfsame spirit that we were able to bring off the recent EU-Russia Summit.
A feature of the Spirit of Lahti is the ability to deal with difficult matters openly.
There were also frank discussions in Lahti and Helsinki on questions of human rights and democracy.
At the summit meeting in Helsinki, agreement was hampered by a row which prevented the recommencement of talks on the new partnership agreement.
The parties might nevertheless have realised that they could work together on the basis of the current agreement, which is still in force for the time being.
Talks on the new partnership agreement must get under way as soon as possible.
New ideas on how to improve cooperation, on the other hand, can be generated on the basis of the current agreement.
There was a positive outcome at the Summit in two important areas.
First, payments for Siberian overflights will gradually start to be reduced, and they will be phased out entirely by 2013.
Next, agreements between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland on the Northern Dimension were signed while the Summit was being held.
Thus, in the north we reached a new agreement which will provide a framework for cooperation in the four 'spaces' which the EU and Russia have agreed on establishing.
Lorry queues on the border between the EU and Russia were discussed.
Discussions on this have been taking place today at talks between the Finnish and Russian Prime Ministers in Moscow.
The problem is that checks on the Russian side can be carried out by as many as seven officials.
Now that number is being dropped to two, and border checks will be speeded up in other ways too.
In any case, we need a quick solution to this urgent problem.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the relations and discussions between Europe and Russia are like surrealist art or a Woody Allen film.
One of two things is true.
Either Polish meat is bad, in which case Mr Putin is right and this meat must no longer be distributed in Europe.
Or Polish meat is good, in which case it can be distributed in Europe and what Mr Putin and Russia are doing is unjust and sanctions must be taken against them.
There is no question of exaggerating or not exaggerating: either it is true or it is not true, that is all.
Secondly, with regard to human rights, Mr Putin, with his angelic face of a judoka trained by the KGB, repeats to us time and again: 'I have nothing to do with this business'.
Assassinations take place all over Europe, a woman is assassinated in Moscow, an ex-KGB agent is assassinated in London and Mr Putin repeats: 'I have nothing to do with it'.
Evidently, it was Mr Khodorkovsky who, from his prison, organised the assassination of Mrs Politkovskaya and it was Mr Lebedev who, from his prison, organised the assassination of the ex-KGB agent.
Only one thing is certain: the laws passed in the Duma are laws that have been passed by Mr Putin's party, with the result that the opposition no longer has the right to speak, that non-governmental organisations no longer have the right to voice their opinions and that European foundations no longer have the right to exist.
Again, on this subject, Mr Putin tells us: 'I have nothing to do with these events. I was at a conference in Paris, in London or I do not know where and I do not know what has been passed in the Duma.'
We must not be taken for fools.
I would prefer it if there were no prospect of cold war.
No one wants cold war, but everything has its limits. We cannot accept that a public politician should lie to us continually: either Mr Putin chooses to be polite and to answer our questions, or we will take a different tone with Mr Putin.
We may need his energy, but we do not need someone who constantly mocks us.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, it would be very bold to claim that the last summit in Finland was a success, although we made our own contribution to the summit.
Our so-called solidarity was of absolutely no use.
Whilst it is true that Russia needs the Union, it is also the case that the Union needs Russia.
As long as we pursue an increasingly fierce Russophobic line, Russia will pragmatically continue to work together with the no-less-pragmatic EU Member States that are her biggest economic partners, that is to say, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, among others.
This cooperation continues apace, to no one's great surprise.
We will not integrate a Community perspective into the energy agreement with Russia if we simply favour European firms and help them to make profits from Russian energy supplies.
We will not enjoy mutually advantageous and much-needed relations with Russia, if, for example, in official negotiations between EU and Russian parliamentary delegations, some of the seats reserved for the EU Parliament's representatives remain empty.
It is hard to negotiate properly with one's eyes and ears closed.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, there is every indication that Russia does not wish to accept the implications of the 2004 enlargement.
It is failing to proceed with the signature of border treaties with Latvia and Estonia, and has resorted to the use of gas to blackmail some Member States.
Most recently, Russia has been conducting discriminatory trade policy against Poland, on the basis of forged veterinary certificates.
Poland cannot tolerate such discrimination.
More importantly, Poland cannot agree to opening talks under conditions dictated by Russia.
I am grateful to the Commission for recognising these problems and seeking solutions to them.
I would point out also that the tension surrounding the latest summit involves much more than relations between the Union and Russia, and how that is resolved will determine the standing and future of the whole Union.
If Russia succeeds in dividing us, the chances of developing a political Europe and of institutional change will be much reduced, particularly as regards a common foreign policy.
It does not make sense to create new institutions if they are not underpinned by common convictions, and if a common political will is lacking.
Should Russia succeed in dividing us now, it will go one step further next year, and in the meantime our common foreign policy will be two steps behind.
We should not therefore be surprised if NATO is assuming the political initiative, for instance regarding a common energy policy.
NATO is already drawing up a detailed outline of its future role on this vital issue.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the latest EU-Russia Summit did not bring any specific results.
Nonetheless, the way the meeting unfolded allows us to draw several conclusions which could be relevant to future negotiations on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Firstly, it is standard practice for Russia to resort to tactics aimed at shattering the Union's unity, by presenting current disagreements as bilateral problems with particular Member States.
This is what has happened with regard to the ban on imports of Polish foodstuffs.
The same tactic had been applied previously to Latvia and other Baltic States.
This approach has proved successful because certain groups within the Union joined in with the criticism of Poland, drawing on elements of the rhetoric used by Russia.
Secondly, whilst the Union is very sensitive to the issue of respect for human rights in the Member States and throughout the world, such as in relation to the war on terror, it applies different standards to Russia in this regard.
EU decision-makers deliberately avoid posing difficult questions, and if such questions do arise, for example, concerning politically inspired murders or the situation in Chechnya, they unreservedly accept President Putin's evasive responses.
It is worth emphasising that good political and economic cooperation between Russia and the EU is highly desirable, but the unduly submissive attitude the EU has adopted in its dealings with Russia so far will not help attain that objective.
Ratifying the Energy Charter Treaty and a more determined response to human rights violations should be deemed priorities in relations with Russia.
Maintaining European Union solidarity in dealing with a difficult partner is just as necessary.
Mr President, Russia, in its four common spaces engaging with the EU, remains our strategic partner.
We need a strong, united and stable Russia as an ally against rising Islamist terrorism, working with us through the Quartet in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict, preventing in the UN Security Council Iranian and North Korean nuclear proliferation, as well as being a reliable trading partner in its supply of 30% of the EU's gas needs.
Nevertheless, we take a dim view of the atrocities in Chechnya, the deterioration in human rights and democratic freedoms - in particular press freedom, and contract killings of journalists and opponents of the Government, such as my constituent from London, Alexander Litvinenko.
We also reject the traditional Russian habit of cosying up bilaterally to big Member States such as Britain, France and Germany, in order to pressurise others such as the Baltic States and, most recently, Poland, by banning its beef exports.
Russia all too frequently invokes phytosanitary regulations to bully troublesome 'near-abroad neighbours' such as Moldova and Georgia, where wine and mineral waters were banned.
Otherwise, Russia uses differential gas pricing by Gazprom as a foreign policy instrument to put pressure on neighbours such as Ukraine.
Recently, NATO released a report suggesting that Russia is planning a 'gas OPEC' with Algeria, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which would be a serious threat to the EU's external energy security interests.
One way of responding to this, particularly after Russia's refusal to sign the Energy Charter Treaty, is to tell President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, on his visit to Brussels next week, that his country, like its ethnic cousin Azerbaijan, would be welcome in the European Neighbourhood Policy, rather than Kazakhstan joining Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in the Yalta Treaty's Single Economic Space.
(FI) Mr President, Minister, I will only speak about energy, because one cannot speak about everything, and I want to raise half a dozen points or so.
For us, it is vital to have security of energy supply, but what is important for Russia is that it has the security of a permanent customer.
We need the market to be opened up on both sides.
We also need long-term trade agreements.
Russia needs them too, as it has to invest in its energy industry, which is almost in tatters.
The energy debate needs more political guidance on our part.
Energy is a very political issue.
Despite that, we talk about all manner of things here, but we do not even go to Russia to familiarise ourselves with the energy situation.
We need to go there.
It has been a long time since anyone went there with this in mind.
Finally, I want to say that energy is now a source of conflict for us with Russia.
It cannot be taken care of with electricity or gas, but is a job for the politicians.
So we have to act as politicians in the domain of energy, and together with Russia find a form of cooperation that is satisfactory to both sides.
(Applause)
. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion of the new partnership agreement with Russia is a significant step in our cooperation, which will also help to resolve the energy issue.
In the name of good relations, however, we should not disregard the package of demands which we need to put forward to Russia in order for this cooperation to be possible.
We should not ignore the fact that in Russia democracy is being squeezed, and there are shocking restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
Intimidation of political opponents and the murder of journalists are becoming more frequent.
In the last seven years, 13 journalists have been killed, but not one contract killing of a journalist has been uncovered.
At the same time, Russia's authorities are doing nothing to tackle racism and xenophobia.
Quite the reverse: in Russia, violence has become part of the system of government.
Russia is using the trade sphere as a foreign policy tool, by putting forward very high standards for its partners, which it, however, uses selectively.
The European Union must ensure that Russia displays a genuine will to resolve these issues, and that it concludes border agreements without delay with Estonia and Latvia.
This requirement must also be stated in documents, and I would like to thank the Commission for addressing these questions.
(DE) Mr President, our relations with Russia are of strategic importance.
Looking at the developments in the Middle East and considering the use made of Russia in the Security Council in matters relating to problem areas such as Iran and North Korea, we know that it is in our interests to have Russia on our side when dealing with these.
We also know that mandate to negotiate a new partnership and cooperation agreement is to be extended to include the incorporation into that agreement of matters touching on energy security, democracy and human rights in Russia, and, if that is to be done, then negotiations are necessary, and a veto, by preventing the resolution of such issues, is not helpful.
At the same time, though, it strikes me as of the utmost importance that the Commission and the Council, in the course of their negotiations, should bear it in mind - and you can use this as an argument, if you like - that any such agreement must, at the end of the day, be ratified by Parliament and that we will not accept an agreement that does not include certain conditions that are decisive in terms of solidarity between all Member States of the European Union.
I would like to address one thing that makes it clear that it is self-evidently in our own strategic interest if the European Union acts as one in foreign policy matters, while also making clear that solidarity can be manifested also in smaller matters such as, for example, the issue of trade with Poland.
If the impression is given that we are up in arms about the trade measures of a third country when they affect Germany, or the United Kingdom, or France, and make a great song and dance about it, smaller or newer Member States get the idea that their problems are not treated as being equally important, and we end up with a credibility problem.
In view of the way in which this issue of trade between Russia and Poland has been handled so far, I can quite understand what the Poles are getting at.
No actions are now being taken against a single country, quite simply because there is now only one trade policy.
I therefore ask the Commission, and the member of it with responsibility for trade matters, to put this on the priority list in future, something that was not done for Poland, or, indeed, in the matter between Iran and Denmark three-quarters of a year ago.
I think the Commission has to come to understand that this sends an important message to the people living in the Member States, that message being that we take their concerns seriously and care about them.
That makes it easier to achieve agreement on other matters.
(PL) Mr President, the Russian Federation applies double standards to Member States of the European Union, dividing them into good and bad states.
The good ones are rewarded with normal relations, whereas the bad ones are penalised with sanctions such as trade restrictions.
This is the age-old policy of divide and rule.
We do not have any influence on the Kremlin's ambitions, because it is enjoying a renaissance of its imperialist outlook.
Its leaders can afford to think this way as the prices of oil and gas are rising and we have to pay them.
The way we react to this policy is crucial.
If we do not all stand shoulder to shoulder in our response, we will simply be fuelling Russia's imperialist approach to international relations.
I am not saying this to put the fear of Russia into us, but to ensure that improved relations between the European Union and Russia are based on a sound and stable footing, and all divisions between the good and the bad, the victors and the vanquished are done away with.
(PL) Mr President, the outcome of the summit in Finland was not what it might have been.
Our esteemed Russian partners would do well to learn the lesson of that experience.
Russia and the European Union must recognise that this spells the end of a certain method of resolving issues between Moscow and the EU, and in particular between Moscow and some of the stronger and richer Member States.
There can and must be an end to bilateral schemes between Russia and Germany, Russia and France or Russia and the United Kingdom and there must instead be honest debate with the European Union as a whole.
The European Union also needs to learn from this experience.
Any issues that might be an obstacle to inclusive agreements should be fully resolved in advance of such a summit.
The Russian embargo on Polish meat was a case in point.
The rest of the EU should not be surprised that Poland dug its heels in over this issue, which is of great importance to us.
We saw it as a kind of litmus test not only of Russia's intentions towards Poland, but also of the intentions of the other Member States towards our country.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that we must never allow European solidarity to be an empty slogan.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for raising these human rights issues with our Russian partners.
However, in the present situation, it is not enough to raise delicate issues.
We are also entitled to receive meaningful answers, and then to see changes in the negative pattern that can currently be observed.
Only such changes, by means of positive reforms, could stimulate the new trust we badly need to continue our strategic partnership.
At this point, the Commission has to convince the Russian administration that democratic values do not have a second-rate status in our negotiating package.
This is just what the democratically minded citizens of Russia expect from us, and we cannot betray them.
Secondly, I encourage the Commission to be more active in standing up for EU solidarity - our basic principle.
All too often, the EU regards Member States' relations with Russia as merely a bilateral issue.
The EU's message to Russia at this point should be that if political or economic pressure is put on one Member State, then that will be a problem for the whole of Europe.
This could convince our partners to change their behaviour.
Finally, the EU does have leverage over Russia.
Russia does not care any less about its relations with the EU than we care about them.
Russia cares about its image as a global partner, so we should also make Mr Putin work to convince and prove that Russia could get rid of this negative pattern, or at least stop lying to us.
. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs LehtomÃ€ki.
I think that the work which you have accomplished at the summit and what you discussed was all very good.
Of course, we wanted talks to be begun on the new agreement.
Why?
Because, of course, we want security of energy supplies.
I do not think, however, in any case, that we should ignore any of our Member States.
What we need here is solidarity.
I would just like to point to a few examples from the past year which, in my view, show that Russia's attitude is selective.
It began on 1 January by the cutting of gas supplies to Ukraine, and after that we learnt that wine from Moldova was no longer acceptable, but that wine from Transnistria, where the technologies are the same, was acceptable.
Next, Georgia failed to obey - suddenly some scoundrel blew up the gas pipeline near Georgia's border, and Georgia had no gas supply for a week or two.
Lithuania - the country is selling its shares in the Mazeiku oil refinery to the Poles, not the Russians.
Suddenly an oil pipeline cracks, and oil no longer reaches the Mazeiku refinery.
Just a short while ago, some of Latvia's canned fish was withdrawn from circulation in Russia.
Our food health inspectorate checked tinned food originating from Russia in our country and in Germany, and found the same increase in these substances for which Russia had taken us to task.
So I mention these examples of how Russia, unfortunately, always finds a reason to reproach others or suspend supplies or impose an embargo.
Thus it seems to me that it is extremely important to include security of these energy supplies in the new agreement.
I wish you success in your task.
(HU) Mr President, trade is a very important element of the relations between Russia and the European Union.
The basis for trade is legal security and predictability, and to this end, joint trade agreements must be respected.
The EU must insist on full compliance with the principles and rules laid down in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
The Russian import ban on Polish meat products and other agricultural produce is an infringement of these principles and rules.
These measures are excessive and unjustified.
They should have been withdrawn long ago.
The debate on trade remains unresolved because Russia does not show any willingness to cooperate.
The EU must insist on the observance of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, and must stand in solidarity with our Polish friends, speaking with one voice in order to encourage the Russian party to honour the trade agreements.
We must make it absolutely clear that the EU does not tolerate any of its trading partners using discriminatory measures against one of the Member States.
A unified position is important as well because Russia is now threatening to impose an import ban on all meat products from the EU because of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
This matter also has particular significance from Hungary's point of view, since large quantities of wine are sold in Russia under the label of 'Tokaji' although they have nothing whatsoever to do with the Tokaj region.
Russia is thus infringing on the various rules protecting origins laid down in the partnership agreement.
It is because of this as well that the EU must take a unified stand on this issue.
(PL) Mr President, the European Union must show solidarity in its dealings with Russia.
Moscow wishes to divide the countries of the Union into good and bad partners.
The good ones are the largest and richest countries such as Germany and France.
Those are the countries with which Mr Putin wishes to conduct his European policy.
Bowing to such treatment will mean the end and the enslavement of the European Union.
We must speak with one voice in our dealings with Russia.
The European Commission should have intervened earlier over the issue of Polish food.
Poland's concerns over the building of the northern gas pipeline should also have been taken more seriously.
Russia is an important partner for the EU.
We must insist on respect for freedom of expression and association within Russia, and also on respect for human rights and freedom of activity for the opposition.
It is not true that all Poles are anti-Russian.
We appreciate Russian culture.
We believe Russia is a remarkable nation that has produced outstanding figures in culture, science and music.
It paid a very high price for the madness of Bolshevik-Communist utopia.
We shall always support those who like Hertzen, Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Bukovski, Kovalev or Politkovskaya dared to speak openly about the need for a free and democratic Russia determined to devote all its energies to its own development and to improving the lot of its own citizens, whilst refraining from imperialist subjugation of its neighbours.
President-on-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for this intense but worthwhile debate.
A sign of good cooperation is that everything, even problematic issues, can be discussed.
This prerequisite for good cooperation was met at the EU-Russia Summit.
We were able to discuss even these difficult issues in concrete terms, and not just in terms of the principles involved.
It is very obvious from this debate that we need a balance in cooperation between the EU and Russia.
In the opening speeches of the Summit, both sides laid great emphasis on the fact that we, the European Union and Russia, exist in a state of great mutual dependence.
We are dependent on them for many things, and they are dependent on us.
Part of this balance is the notion that one approaches the partner on an equal footing and, furthermore, with respect.
Moreover, the best results in cooperation with Russia are achieved specifically through dialogue and working closely together. That will not come about if we approach the partner in the belief that everything is right with us and everything with them is hopelessly wrong, and that we will teach them what they need to do.
The best results are achieved through open dialogue on all issues, at the same time maintaining respect for the partner.
The European Union's basic values are not up for negotiation in this dialogue.
Our values are not for sale.
The matter of human rights is central to the dialogue between the Union and Russia.
Absolutely crucial to their practical implementation is progress in the area of the rule of law in Russia.
The Union will be working closely with Russia in many ways to establish the principle of the rule of law.
Our four 'spaces' for cooperation are a good opportunity for closer cooperation, not just in the energy sector, but in many other areas too.
Now that we have to work to achieve a new mandate for a new partnership agreement, it is worth remembering that the existing agreement also allows us to cooperate more closely and effectively.
So we do not have to just wait around for a new mandate: we can move on on the basis of the present one.
The debate also made much of the importance of solidarity within the European Union.
In this case solidarity is very evident in the fact that, right to the last, the Commission and the Presidency of the Council did their utmost to find a solution to the remaining areas of discord and to start talks on the new agreement.
In that, unfortunately, we failed, however.
President Putin said very clearly several times that Polish meat is welcome in Russia.
From their point of view, the problem is that meat produced elsewhere with Polish labels on it is coming into the country, and that they cannot accept.
Continued efforts need to be made to resolve this problem and reach agreement.
Just prior to the Summit, the news broke that the United States of America and Russia had concluded a bilateral agreement on Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation.
As this major step on the road towards Russia's membership of the WTO has now been taken, it is clear that Russia will be joining the WTO in the near future.
That will also bring with it new and really positive prospects for economic cooperation between the European Union and Russia.
Commissioner Mandelson and Russian Trade Minister Gref also put forward their views at the Summit.
We therefore have plenty of excellent opportunities, but also plenty of problem areas where cooperation has to be continued.
Cooperation has to be on an equal basis, and one where there is mutual respect.
Mr President, EU-Russia relations are indeed highly complex.
On the one hand, Russia is a strategic partner, and on the other hand it is a common neighbour.
We have to find a balance between these two very important elements.
Second, with regard to the issue of meat, we have worked very hard with the Poles and with the Russians, but we as a Commission do not even have an official responsibility for that.
We are responsible for imports, but we are not responsible for exports.
Sometimes these things matter; for instance we have asked for trilateral committees.
That is what we have offered.
We have asked why we do not sit down together trilaterally and try to find a solution.
At the end of a lengthy discussion, as regards illegally imported meat from third countries to Russia - it was not about Polish meat, I can only subscribe to that - Mr Putin agreed that he will now instruct his agriculture minister to work more intensively with the Poles.
I hope that means the path towards finding a solution is clear.
Unfortunately, I do not think we have more legal possibilities.
Our colleague's comments on the WTO were very true.
This will give us more legal possibilities.
I am also happy to tell you that today we adopted the Neighbourhood Policy communication, which will be coming to Parliament in a few days' time.
I will officially present it to the media on Monday, because today we had the discussion on Turkey.
We are also talking about cooperation around the Black Sea.
I wanted to mention that, because it came up in the debate.
We think it is highly important to have the neighbours to the east together with the Black Sea cooperation - that means Turkey and Russia together.
In the end, we have to re-engage and find solutions together.
In this new agreement, there will also be the whole issue of energy.
Many of those issues have already been addressed.
The other day we had a very important energy conference in Brussels, and there is a whole set of different ideas on transparency, reciprocity and legal certainty for investments.
That progress was made at Lahti, and that progress also has to be incorporated into our agreement, because we need a stable market of technology and a stable market that will help all of us using Russian revenues and resources, and help our own possibilities as consumers.
Let me also say that we have shown the highest possible level of solidarity with Poland.
I do not accept that this has not been done at the maximum possible level.
On the other hand, we want to go on working, so I think we have to have this complex, balanced relationship.
It was a very frank and open meeting. That is always good.
I prefer a frank and open talk, and having a chance to solve one issue, maybe solving others the next time around.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the December part-session.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(PL) I would like to express my grave concern about the ban on the import of plant and animal products from Poland that the Russian Federation has imposed over the last 12 months.
I appeal to the European Commission to take more decisive action to resolve the problem.
In view of the impasse in relations with Moscow it would seem that the best way forward is for this matter to be dealt by Russia and the European Union at the highest political level.
Given the difficulties concerning trade in agricultural products with Russia, I believe it would be appropriate to empower the European Commission to determine trade policy as a whole, encompassing not just import-related, but also export-related issues.
The whole of the EU may well experience difficulties trading with Russia, not just Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.
The existing principles of separation of access to third country markets by individual Member States result in an uneven playing field for exports and discriminatory treatment of certain Member States.
The division of competences regarding imports and exports appears to run counter to the principles of the single market and the provisions of Article 133 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, according to which the common commercial policy must be based on uniform principles, relating to export policy amongst other matters.
In addition, current European Commission practices should be improved, so that it does not take unduly long to resolve any problems that may arise, and to allow a swift response to unexpected situations.
(FR) Those who take the hardest line against Russia today are often those who, for a long time, denied the existence of the gulag, the totalitarian nature of communism and the threat of Soviet imperialism.
For 74 years, the communists violated the most fundamental freedoms and solidarity, going as far as to force children to denounce their parents.
It is not surprising that, coming out of this nightmare, Russian democracy is not yet perfect.
Our democracies are no better.
In France, for example, the Front National, representing over 15% of the electorate, has no representatives in the National Assembly, and the parties in power want to prevent its candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from standing in the Presidential election.
Unlike Turkey, which the Europe of Brussels wants to welcome, Russia is a fully European nation.
United by the same Helleno-Christian roots, our peoples are also sadly united by the same threats: falling birth rates and immigration, materialism and Islamism.
The time has now come to reunite the Eastern and Western branches of our civilisation, beyond the dividing line of Theodosius, to reconcile the heirs of Saint Benedict with those of Saint Cyril.
(PL) Russia is a very important neighbour of the European Union, and the European Union is an important partner for Russia.
For this partnership to be sound and genuine, Russia needs to understand the nature of the EU, and the EU ought to help it to do so.
The European Union is based on the principle of solidarity among its members.
Consequently, this policy of sowing dissent between Member States of the Union and Russia's use of bilateral contacts to exert pressure on certain Member States is something we cannot tolerate.
To put this another way, Polish meat is also European meat.
The unjustified ban on the export of Polish meat to Russia is a problem for the EU as a whole, not a matter for bilateral relations between Poland and Russia.
Upon investigation it emerged that the doctored meat certificates, which served as the pretext for placing the embargo on Polish meat, involved meat produced in the USA and exported to Russia via Lithuania.
The embargo was therefore a political measure.
I am glad the Finnish Presidency is choosing its words carefully and describing cooperation between Russia and the EU over energy in terms of positive interdependence.
The question arises, however, as to what that really means and how the Russians would understand being positive and interdependent.
In order to avoid disagreements over interpretation it would be best to include the main elements of the Charter and the Transit Protocol in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Russia and the EU.
This would ensure liberalisation of gas supplies from Central Asia through Russian territory.
Accession of Bulgaria - Accession of Romania (debate)
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 September of this year, the European Commission presented its report on Romania's progress towards accession.
It is now for Parliament to give its opinion.
This is an important moment, as we are coming to the end of a process that will see the conclusion of the latest wave of enlargement.
It is not the beginning of the next wave but, in reality, the end of the fifth wave.
It is a time of great historic significance since it signals the reunification of the European continent.
I should like, in particular, to take this opportunity to thank the Commission and, firstly, Commissioner Rehn who, throughout this process, has done some very painstaking and very rigorous work and with whom we have enjoyed smooth and excellent cooperation during the last two years.
Moreover, my report does not neglect to congratulate him.
I would also thank most sincerely all those fellow Members who have significantly helped improve and supplement my previous reports. I would thank, in particular, my colleagues not only in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also in other bodies of this Parliament for their often pertinent comments and suggestions.
This report is in the spirit of the previous reports since it is couched in terms that are meant to be positive, encouraging and open while remaining, I hope, tough, yet balanced.
It also follows closely the conclusions of the Commission in its report of September 2006.
As I see it, matters are clear. Romania was not ready in 2004.
Since then, it has made considerable efforts, putting in place an impressive series of modernising reforms.
It was important to emphasise this, and I wish to follow Mr Van Orden's lead by, in turn, warmly welcoming Romania, as he, for his part, welcomed Bulgaria.
In essence, this is a short report that focuses on two points in particular: the accession date and the support and verification measures envisaged by the Commission.
The report is structured around six main issues.
First of all, the report pays tribute to the Romanian authorities for the considerable progress they have made since the beginning of the process.
Everyone agrees that the efforts at reform engaged in by the Romanian Government and authorities have been extremely significant. It was therefore necessary to underline this in our resolution.
In September of this year, the Commission went on to recommend that Romania join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
My report supports this conclusion, for which I had, moreover, been hoping and praying for some time.
The wording also emphasises that, in the areas identified as problematic by the Commission's May report, substantial progress has been made.
It also notes that three areas were identified by the Commission in September as ones in which additional progress needed to be made. These were reform of the justice system, the fight against corruption and - to a lesser extent, I think - the absorption of Union aid in the agricultural sector and from the Structural Funds and the application of the acquis communautaire in certain areas of food safety.
Fifthly, my report supports the Commission's proposal to introduce mechanisms to verify and support progress in these areas on the basis of a list of identified objectives.
Such measures were applied during the previous enlargement, and this for the benefit of all the parties.
It is not, therefore, a question of stigmatising or isolating Romania but, rather, of supporting it in its efforts to consolidate the reforms under way.
Sixthly and lastly, my report urges the Romanian Government to take all the measures necessary and to make full use of the time remaining before accession so that recourse to the safeguard clauses might be avoided.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the general structure of the report.
Only five amendments have been tabled for plenary, reflecting, I believe, the broad consensus that has emerged in relation to this document - a consensus we sought within the various committees.
I now turn to some of the positions adopted by my group.
My group will not be advising Members to vote in favour of Amendments 1 and 2 by Mrs Gibault and Mr Cavada.
These amendments do, however, reflect a statement signed by more than 400 Members, including myself.
On a personal basis, I shall, therefore, vote in favour of them, but my group's position will be expressed through a free vote.
My group will support Amendment 5 by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the efforts made by Romania towards accession and will vote against the same group's Amendment 4, which is already covered by the report.
Where Amendment 3 is concerned, my group will abstain.
Here, then, are the fruits of work that I have been doing for only two years - a period shorter than that of Mr Van Orden's involvement - and that had, moreover, been begun by others, notably by Mrs Nicholson, who preceded me as rapporteur.
I am submitting the results of this work to you with some satisfaction because, in essence, I have always championed the same position over the last few years.
We have a common destiny.
Romania's and Bulgaria's place is in the European Union.
We have to move forward. We needed, therefore, to be sympathetic, but firm.
I believe that Parliament's position, which closely resembles that of the Commission, was the right one to adopt because it has allowed the necessary reforms to be carried out and because, at the same time, it enables our common objective to be realised, namely the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on the date specified.
I think that we must welcome this event as one more staging post on the way to the reunification of Europe.
I hope that the consensus for which we have all worked will be reflected in an unambiguous vote by Parliament.
I should like the message received by Romania tomorrow to be a positive one, delivered loudly and clearly and, if possible, by a substantial number of people, whereupon Romania should receive a warm and sincere welcome.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 12 October the Council welcomed the Commission's monitoring report on the state of preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for EU membership.
According to the Commission, Bulgaria and Romania have shown through the progress they have made that they will be ready to accept the rights and obligations of membership on 1 January 2007.
The Council examined the monitoring report thoroughly and reached the same conclusion as the Commission.
We also acknowledged the reforms which both countries had carried out, and urged them to bring to a conclusion the remaining preparations for membership.
The Council has expressed its support for the cooperation and verification mechanism relating to the reform of the judiciary and action to combat organised crime and corruption.
This mechanism also makes it possible for safeguard measures to be adopted if necessary.
The Council also supports the other measures mentioned by the Commission to ensure that EU policies are carried out properly and that the work of the institutions progresses flawlessly after Bulgaria and Romania have joined the Union.
The Council stresses that both countries need to continue their political commitment in order to resolve outstanding issues.
Bulgaria and Romania have to report back regularly on progress made in meeting the benchmarks.
The first report should reach the Commission by the end of March next year. The Commission will then report back to the European Parliament and the Council on the progress made with regard to the benchmarks by June of next year.
The Council will re-examine the situation in June 2007 when it has received the Commission's report.
The European Parliament's views have been taken into account throughout the entire accession process for Bulgaria and Romania.
Representing the Presidency as I do, I want to thank the members of the Delegation to the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee and those of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee, as well as all the Members of the European Parliament, for their important contribution to Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to the European Union.
We will also obviously take due account of the reports being discussed here today.
The Accession Treaty ratification process in the Member States has almost drawn to a close.
We expect to be able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members of the Union on 1 January 2007.
Their accession to the European Union will conclude this historic fifth enlargement of the EU, which so far has proven to be such a success.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici, for their well-balanced, substantive reports, which, like the Commission reports, give credit to progress, but also highlight the areas where outstanding issues still exist for both countries.
Both our institutions support the accession date of 1 January 2007.
This is a historic achievement by Bulgaria and Romania, and I should like to congratulate them warmly.
The key to their success was a combination of their own efforts with the strong encouragement and support of all institutions of the Union, not least of this House.
Their accession will mark the completion of the fifth round of enlargement.
I am happy to inform you that the ratification procedures in all 27 Parliaments have now been successfully finalised - I should add the European Parliament to that list.
The Commission looks forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania as fully-fledged members of the European Union on 1 January.
Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress after the publication of the September report.
Bulgaria reported that border control and border management now benefit from increased cooperation between different offices, resulting in more arrests related to the smuggling of goods and human beings.
Cooperation between the prosecutor's office and the police has improved, resulting in indictments and the dismantling of criminal groups.
Romania has made further progress in modernising its detention facilities and has launched a new awareness-raising campaign against corruption.
Official charges have been brought to parties involved in privatisations in the energy sector.
So far, signs in other areas which were critical in September, such as aviation safety in Bulgaria and motor vehicle insurance systems in both countries, are rather positive.
Final decisions on these issues will be made in December 2006 - very soon.
In some other areas, specific measures have recently been taken to guarantee food safety on the internal market.
Products from pigs and live pigs are not allowed to be exported from Bulgaria and Romania to the internal market, due to the existence of classical swine fever.
The lists of agri-food establishments which are allowed to produce only for the national market, for a maximum of three years, have been updated.
The Commission is setting up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.
This mechanism will enable the Commission to keep a close eye on developments in these very important areas.
The Commission has identified benchmarks for both countries, which they need to fulfil in these critical areas.
Preparations for the Commission decision establishing the details of this mechanism are now advancing.
It will be adopted before the end of 2006. It will allow the Commission to be thoroughly informed about the further reforms and actions in these important areas.
There is one issue that I know to be of particular importance to the European Parliament: that of the application of safeguard measures.
I can assure you that the Commission will apply the appropriate safeguard measures if one of the countries fails to fulfil the benchmarks adequately.
The Commission can decide to apply the justice and home affairs safeguard measures at any time, if necessary.
Bulgaria and Romania will certainly enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of our common policies and institutions.
I should like to thank you for your support - in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Parliament as a whole - and for your constructive, substantive approach over the past years for this important step for our common European project, which will now continue with two important new Member States.
(Applause)
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (HU) Mr President, the Romanian Government deserves our congratulations for the efforts it has made in the process of integration in Romania.
The population of Romania deserves to see its accession become a reality at last.
In the opinion accepted unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I have been the draftsman, I have, in addition to the questions raised by the Commission, emphasised the rights of children and of national minorities, and most of these issues have made their way, in the form of a compromise solution, into our report as well, thanks to the good will of the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici.
Why is this so important?
Because while it may appear that everything is fine, in reality the expectations of minority communities - such as autonomy - are treated as taboo subjects.
Meanwhile, regions with Hungarian inhabitants do not have equal opportunity to access EU funds.
Multiculturalism in higher education today means in reality, in the Romanian context, that at the trilingual university of Cluj/KolozsvÃ¡r, faculty members who put up a 'No Smoking' sign in Hungarian are dismissed from the university.
It is my hope that 1 January will bring a change to the entire population of the country, including the Hungarian community, and that this inevitable change will bring about a change in mentality.
I hope that the significant questions, including minority questions, will not become the tools of mere political show.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion on the accession of Romania on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to express our satisfaction, because Romania is developing - metamorphosing we might say - and progress is manifest everywhere, not only in the economic sector and job creation, but also in sectors which are crucial to democracy and the quality of life in the European Union.
The authorities and society have understood the importance of education, transparency, justice, the protection of minorities and healthy conditions of development for children and progress has been made in this direction, as the report informs us.
The Committee on Women's Rights expresses its satisfaction about the integration of a significant portion of the acquis communautaire concerning gender equality and encourages the government to continue in this direction and to cooperate both with the administration and civil society in applying this acquis.
We also consider the creation of institutions such as the parliamentary committee on equality and the national equality body important and would highlight the need to secure funding and the staff needed in order for them to function.
We were particularly concerned about the phenomenon of violence against women, both in the family environment and in the consequences it has on sexual exploitation.
We even included statistics that illustrate that the phenomenon is worrying.
Allow me to give a clarification here: our report, on the relevant paragraph of which you set an internal vote, concerns 800 000 women a year.
I should like to clarify that these are data given to us by organisations in Romania for 2002 to 2003, for one year.
It does not mean that there is this number of victims every year. In all events, the phenomenon is worrying and I believe that both the government and society will work in this direction.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (PL) Mr President, the fifth enlargement of the European Union will take place in January 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania join.
We are all eagerly awaiting this event, and appreciate the tremendous effort made by these two countries in preparation for membership.
Nonetheless, Bulgaria and Romania must continue with their reforms, particularly as regards combating corruption, organised crime, the drugs trade and people trafficking.
It is also essential for these two countries to improve the transparency of the activities and procedures of their public administrations, and their capacity to absorb resources, so as to be able to properly manage structural and agricultural aid from the Union.
There is concern about the poor living conditions still prevailing in children's homes and institutions for the disabled in both countries.
The unfortunate lack of legal provisions protecting the rights of ethnic minorities and facilitating their integration through access to education and training in both countries has also been noted.
It is important, however, to recognise the magnitude of the work already completed and its obvious effects, and to welcome almost 31 million new citizens of the European Union on 1 January 2007.
We must ensure that from the beginning, these people feel that they are much-wanted members of our common European family.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, this is a very important, historic debate in this House.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs for all the work they have done, and Commissioner Rehn for the clever and efficient way in which he has prepared the process that will now lead to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007.
This is also an opportunity to say a final word of welcome to both countries as members of the European Union.
It has been a long and arduous process, but it is all very rewarding in the end, especially for the two countries, which were not able to join in 2004.
They can now join the other central and eastern European Member States as full participants in the Union.
We asked a lot of these countries, and we can see the results of their efforts, especially over the past year.
I should like to congratulate both countries for this result.
Throughout the process, our group has been very supportive of the accession of both countries on the earliest possible date.
I would also like to welcome our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues, who have been Observers so far, but they will be full Members of this House as of 1 January.
I am convinced that they will continue their constructive work after that date.
I personally am also happy for another reason: I have been participating in so many debates on Romania and Bulgaria, and I am happy that this burden will now shift to other committees in this Parliament!
This is the final debate prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on Romania and Bulgaria.
That is also a good thing.
Nevertheless, Parliament will remain involved on the basis of our reports, and on the basis of the progress report that the Commission will have to present in future on the homework still to be done by the two countries.
I am quite convinced, however, that both governments and parliaments are well aware of what has to be done.
Finally, as my last remark on Romania and Bulgaria, I should like to welcome all of you, and I am quite sure that both countries will play a constructive role in the future development of our European Union.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - It gives me the greatest pleasure, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to welcome both countries into the European Union.
Mr Lambsdorff has allowed me the opportunity of thanking Mr Van Orden for his dedicated and serious work, which has helped Bulgaria immensely to accede to the Union on this date.
Bulgaria's accession process has not always been a smooth one.
Mr Lambsdorff has empowered me to suggest that this is not entirely Bulgaria's fault.
