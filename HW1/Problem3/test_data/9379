I am sure there is a reason for it, which I shall ponder on overnight.
I am sorry that we have run out of time, but these things happen and there is nothing I can do about it.
I hope, understanding as I do your answer, Mr President, that I have the good fortune to appear higher on the list the next time you are in the Chair for Question Time.
I hope so too.
I shall heed your advice, Sir, and next time I shall be my usual strict self.
As we have run out of time for questions to the Commission, questions 38 to 77 will be answered in writing.
Question time is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on report (A5Â­0203/2001) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation [COM(2000) 847 - C5Â­0764/2000 - 2000/0343(COD)].
Mr President, this is the continuation of the debate on Mr Collins' report on occurrences in aviation and the reporting thereof.
Occurrences can prevent accidents, and the duty to report therefore helps increase safety in aviation.
By gathering statistical data on the nature and number of certain occurrences, existing safety regulations can be improved or new ones introduced.
The more information gathered in a broadly-based database, the better the analyses.
The proposed measure has a strongly preventive character.
It is therefore only logical that a legal framework be created at European level.
The future European Safety Agency could also stand to benefit from this.
The success of the proposed system will depend on the degree of its confidentiality.
Detailed information should only end up in the hands of relevant users.
Those reporting occurrences must be certain that the information provided will only be used for statistical purposes.
After all, this is not about apportioning blame or liability.
Technical defects tend to be reported more readily than human errors, whilst the second category is of major importance where occurrences, and hence safety, are involved.
Pilots, for example, will only volunteer this information if confidentiality and anonymity are guaranteed.
The European Parliament' s amendments are specifically intended to strengthen this element.
The success of the new Regulation will depend on the cooperation of those directly involved. That is also evident from the discussions we have held on this platform and in the committee.
There is a need for regular evaluation and reporting on the implementation, to assess whether the reporting systems work.
People in the field need to be involved, and that is also the purport of Amendment No 12 which we re-tabled.
On the basis of evaluation, the lists of occurrences to be reported must be also be updated.
However, not only do we want to know to what extent occurrences are reported, we also want to know the type of occurrences that recur time and again and the safety conclusions that are drawn from these.
That is the purport of Amendment No 11.
In my opinion, the public is entitled also to obtain that type of information.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberal group supports the tenor of the rapporteur' s proposals.
How often do I read in the paper that one or other incident has occurred.
It is by no means always serious, but still.
It is therefore in the interest of safety that an effective, transparent system be put in place for reporting these incidents at international level, so that we can gain an overview and draw lessons from the data gathered.
However, our group attaches great importance to the extent to which the information received from those who report who actually require the information will be given it.
Secondly, it is, in our opinion, important for the anonymity of those who report incidents to be protected.
That is, of course, to be welcomed, but if individuals who report incidents are guilty of gross negligence, it must be possible to prosecute them.
It is not acceptable for people to be cleared of their negligence by reporting the incident involved.
We are therefore pleased with the support which our amendments received in the committee.
However, we do struggle with a few other amendments, and I would mention Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7 for the same reasons, in fact, that we tabled our amendments and that we received that support.
Amendment No 5, in particular, does not promote clarity, but as I said before: I should like to thank the rapporteur, and the liberal group supports the proposals on the whole.
Mr President, we will be abstaining on this report.
We have nothing against the fact that Member States inform one another about air traffic incidents that have occurred in their respective air space - nothing could be further from the truth.
However, the explanatory statement, whilst confirming that most air accidents are due to human factors, casts light on the problem from just one perspective.
It does not mention the fact that two of the main causes of incidents and accidents in airports and airlines are the widespread job insecurity and the number of staff being cut back.
Yet, the number of passengers and flights is constantly rising and they are rising increasingly quickly.
Staff cut backs are all the more shocking because the large airlines are making huge profits.
The Air France group has, for example, just announced a gross operating surplus of FRF 10 billion, or approximately FRF 200 000 per company employee, and, in spite of the substantial increase in the price of kerosene, the company has just increased its shareholder dividends by 57% this year.
In order to reduce the number of incidents or accidents in the air, we should begin with a huge recruitment drive for airports and airlines, and make jobs more secure.
After all, the priority should be the safety of passengers and staff, and not shareholder profit.
Mr President, I welcome with satisfaction the proposals before us because I believe that not only will aviation safety in general be improved, but this will also strengthen cooperation procedures, as well as reinforcing preventive strategies.
Importantly, this report will also offer an adequate degree of confidentiality for the people closely involved, who have the most intimate knowledge of how to run a safe aviation industry: I refer to aircraft crew, air traffic controllers and maintenance personnel.
It is also important for us to stress best practice, particularly in the area of research and development.
Here we welcome the setting up of the European Coordination Centre for Aviation Incident Reporting.
That is why we support the rapporteur, who has been as careful as ever to ensure consistency between EU legislation and the international framework provided by the ICAO.
This is also the reason why we cannot accept the excessive restrictions implied by some amendments adopted in committee, especially those that seek to hide the responsibilities of the operators.
Companies will not become safer and more competitive if we hide these responsibilities.
We believe that customers have the right to be fully informed.
Similarly we cannot accept those amendments that deliberately try to weaken the position of people in the industry, whose duty it is to accurately point out incidents.
To have a reliable system of occurrences reporting in civil aviation, we have to ensure confidentiality for the people who report them.
The Commission's proposals are right, even if there may be a risk of legal implications.
The only risk to safety we can see comes from an attempt to dilute the proposals in favour of the airline companies.
I thank Mr Collins for his excellent report and hope that his common sense approach will be adopted by Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner De Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Collins for his successful report.
The continuing growth of air travel is causing pressure on air travel safety.
Safety precautions are essential.
Although air travel has been a relatively safe form of transport, the congestion of airports and airspace has increased the risk of accidents.
The majority of accidents are due to human factors.
Aviation is becoming more technical and is increasingly relying on the ability of staff on the ground to produce safe air navigation services.
For this reason it is important to obtain information on the functioning of these services.
Gathering and storing information about exceptional occurrences and exchanging information are vital to increasing the safety levels of civil aviation.
It is important that exchanging information regarding risk situations and accidents functions both within and between Member States.
Member States must exchange experiences and information so that more risk situations can be avoided.
If the transfer of information on security deficiencies is to be improved, however, we have to guarantee the data protection of individuals and companies, as Mr Collins proposes in his report.
Each year, Member States must submit a report on the level of safety of civil aviation.
If a risk situation or accident is due to serious negligence, the Member State must have the right to initiate legal proceedings.
In my opinion, cooperation between Member States to increase safety in civil aviation is an important precaution due to the growth of air travel.
The safety of Europe' s airspace is to everyone' s benefit.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the utmost respect for this House, and of course for what is set out in the agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission, and I must therefore express my surprise at the fact that the author of this report is not present to hear the debate on it.
To be honest, I cannot understand it.
Having said this, I would like to thank you for being here and for what you have said, and say that I hope that this Directive will be quickly approved, and that we will accept all the amendments tabled by your Committee, except for one, Amendment No 11, as the Member States themselves will have to publish their own annual report on an incident reporting system.
With regard to Amendment No 2, although we accept it, it should be formulated differently to prevent the system from recording several reports on the same incident, which could distort the corresponding analysis.
Out of the new amendments, Amendments Nos 12 and 13, Amendment No 12 is not acceptable, while we accept Amendment No 13, as we think that it approves the Commission' s own text.
I assure you that the Commission, like you, will continue to work to improve and increase the quality of air safety in Europe, which is something that concerns us all.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de PalÃ¡cio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Work equipment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5Â­0156/2001) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council Common Position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (2nd individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [5766/2/2001 - C5Â­0135/2001 - 1998/0327(COD]
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we can say that none of us would like to continue to hear that every year in the European Union 500 000 falls from height are recorded, out of which 300 000 result in sick leave of more than 3 days, 4 000 involve serious injuries and 1 000 are fatal.
Nor would we like to have to repeat that these accidents take place mainly in work carried out on scaffolding, platforms and high places.
I do not wish to refer to issues that should be dealt with by the rapporteur, whom I must congratulate, even though he is not here, not only on his work, but also on the sensitivity that he has shown on these issues affecting workers, who often lack training and preparation.
We should not forget that construction is a bridging sector, which enables workers to move from the agricultural sector into the service or industrial sectors.
I think that the rapporteur' s sensitivity has enriched the debate as many of the amendments tabled were accepted, all of which aimed to enrich the debate and contribute to the adoption of measures to make employment safer.
We know that zero risk does not exist, life is risky and work, which is the ultimate in active life, involves risks.
We have a generic text, in our Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has been published but not incorporated into the treaties, which in Chapter IV, under the heading Solidarity, states that "Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity".
I would also like to say that respect for health, safety and dignity means a commitment from everyone, first of all from the workers themselves, and also from employers.
Perhaps we should not establish a hierarchy, as we would obviously put the employers first, but the workers themselves must always have the necessary awareness and training to take on the risk, accept the risk and know how to respect it.
No type of administration should be outside this commitment.
Finally, I would like to discuss this commitment from all in the sense that, as Bertrand Russell said, in order to be happy we need three things: the courage to accept the things that we cannot change, enough determination to change the things that we can change and the wisdom to know the difference between the two.
I think that, in this sense, the fight against accidents at work should be one involving constant determination and constant courage from everyone.
Mr President, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to apologise for the fact that Mr Skinner is not present in the Chamber.
He must be detained by something very important, for we are all aware of Mr Skinner' s great commitment to getting this matter finalised.
EU rules are, of course, often criticised for being much too detailed.
Rules concerning employees' health and safety are no exception.
However, the directive which we are to be involved in approving today shows why that degree of detail really is necessary.
We already have general rules to protect employees, including against falls from height, but the fact remains that falls from height account for 10% of all industrial accidents in the EU.
That is partly due to the fact that the rules are not kept on work sites, but it is perhaps also due to the fact that there is a lack of more precise instructions as to how such accidents are to be prevented.
Anyone who has tried to climb up scaffolding knows how, in that situation, one wonders whether the construction, which looks so flimsy, has been put together properly.
It requires a certain knowledge to erect scaffolding properly, and I believe that the required training in the erection, modification and dismantling of scaffolding can help improve safety.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, not only on behalf of Parliament but also on behalf of all those people who work on scaffolding, for a good result has in actual fact been achieved.
Clearly, we have not, however, solved all the problems with this directive, and I can see four points in particular that we shall have to do further work on.
First of all, I very much support what the common position states about the need to find a solution concerning employers and the self-employed.
I should like to see these people in general covered by the rules concerning the working environment, both because of competitive considerations and because their actions can help improve safety on the work site.
Secondly, we must look at the requirements made of those products designed to improve scaffolding.
It is a major problem for those who erect scaffolds that the components are often very heavy.
They are thus not only very difficult to handle, with the risk too of dropping them, but they are also a contributory factor in causing those who work with these materials to become worn out.
A third point is training.
We have found a satisfactory solution in this directive, but I believe that training is one of the points we must be very careful about in the future.
Moreover, I believe that, as time goes on, it will be quite natural to make much more stringent demands upon the content of training.
Let us now see, however, how the Member States set about the task.
Fourthly and finally, there is the attitude to health and safety.
Legislation alone cannot prevent accidents of this kind.
Prevention has a lot to do with the authorities' having the proper opportunities to monitor whether the legislation is being complied with, but also with individuals' taking the new safety rules seriously.
We cannot have those who work on scaffolding playing Tarzan out on the work sites.
This directive now provides a series of clear instructions and, if they are used correctly, then I believe we can get something done about the unduly high number of accidents there are involving falls from height.
Thank you very much, Mrs ThorningÂ­Schmidt.
With regard to your initial information, I would say that the rapporteurs are clearly those with the greatest interest in being present at these debates, as one would, of course, expect.
The absence of rapporteurs from debates is something that must be pointed out.
It must at least be communicated to the Bureau sufficiently in advance, both out of common sense and for the smooth running of this House.
I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr Collins informed the Bureau that, since this debate would continue after 9 p.m., he would not be able to be here at this time.
The Bureau was, therefore, aware of this fact.
With regard to Mr Skinner, the Bureau was unfortunately not given any information or explanation.
I think that, in future, the Bureau will have to inform rapporteurs that if they are for any reason unable to attend, they must proceed in accordance with the basic rules of courtesy and of respect for the Chamber.
Mr President, first of all, I want to say that I think Mr Skinner has carried out a very incisive piece of work, something which I think must also be said this evening.
As chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have supported the conciliation that has been achieved concerning a change to the scaffolding Directive.
It provides more precise rules for health and safety in connection with the use of ladders and other work equipment on scaffolding, and I want to congratulate Mr Skinner on his work.
It is therefore a question of revising existing rules, and it is clearly of practical significance in terms, for example, of its demands for training and the issue of including self-employed persons under the rules.
Unlike a number of other Members here in the Chamber, I have not, during the discussion of the proposal, felt any need to raise the issue of whether we should have this kind of directive at all.
I do not think that that was on the agenda this time, but I should like, at the last moment, to say a little about the matter, for there is a lot of talk nowadays about lists of competencies and new forms of governance. What should the EU deal with?
Which tasks must the national states carry out and in what ways are they to be carried out?
I am absolutely in favour of common EU rules ensuring that free competition in the internal market does not become competition in a poor working environment.
Is safety in relation to scaffolding really a matter for the EU, however?
Would it not perhaps be better to take the decisions concerning safety on scaffolding closer to the building sites concerned?
This might be at a national or local level.
I started giving some thought to this in the middle of the very exciting and detailed discussions we had on, for example, the use of ladders on scaffolding around the old houses in Amsterdam.
Another issue is that of how it is to be ensured that the rules are in actual fact implemented and that we do in actual fact see fewer accidents involving falls from height.
While we have been discussing this Directive, I have in fact been paying more attention to the scaffolding in Brussels, and I believe, to be honest, that we shall have a serious problem implementing this directive.
The discussion we are also having in other contexts about new forms of governance must also deal with the way in which we are to regulate the working environment most effectively.
Are we to continue issuing detailed laws and regulations, or should we focus more upon how these work in practice?
Is there some other way in which we can oblige the two sides of industry and the national governments to ensure a good working environment?
I think we need some new thinking.
Mr President, Mr Skinner, Commissioner, it gives me great pleasure to be able to discuss this topic.
One of the Dutch newspapers this morning carried the headline, 'Europe safeguards the window cleaner' s bread and butter' .
That was a reference to the concern that it would no longer be possible to use a ladder for work.
This directive has finally provided a solution.
It means that a ladder can be used for work, provided the work is short-term and it poses a limited risk.
That is precisely where the whole problem lies.
This news is music to the ears of people in the Netherlands, at least the window cleaners, along with an entire professional sector of self-employed who carry ladders around in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe, such as maintenance people, painters and decorators, and so forth. But they are all getting excited about nothing.
For the time being, anyway.
For it may well be that, at national level, the measure will at some point be interpreted to mean that 'short-term' is not a full working day, in which case the work can, strictly speaking, not be carried out.
I am only highlighting this issue. We have not solved the problem.
The directive causes problems of enforceability.
If we concern ourselves with working conditions in this House, we should do this effectively, and our efforts must be geared towards the relevant categories of people: employees, self-employed with no staff, self-employed with staff, etc. There is room for more clarity in this respect.
Mr President, in the previous debate in September last year I confirmed that health and safety was an important issue, and I commended the rapporteur on the thought that he had put into his work.
I am delighted to see that he has finally arrived here so that he can hear me say that yet again.
My complaint was then, and still is now, that this was a matter best left to Member States or indeed to local authorities - a point already made most eloquently by my colleague, Mr Jensen, a few moments ago.
When the original Commission proposal on this subject was published, it said: "The difficulties of implementing the provisions on the ground should not be underestimated in the case of SMEs".
Despite this comment the rapporteur put forward even more detailed amendments and then blithely stated in the September debate: "This is a small- to medium-sized business-friendly piece of legislation".
Coming straight after the report of Mr Hughes, earlier today, suggesting a number of amendments to the proposed extension of the working time directive to mobile workers, one thing is very clear.
The people who believe that the EU should legislate in the finest detail, the people who are piling on more burdens on business without even understanding that is what they are doing, are not some unelected Brussels bureaucrats, they are Britain's very own Labour MEPs.
I now understand what Tony Blair means by Labour leading in Europe.
When it comes to extra red tape British Labour MEPs are way out in front.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative proposal we are now discussing, whose content is to be welcomed, goes some way towards meeting the need to combat the phenomenon of accidents at work caused by high falls from ladders and scaffolding. This phenomenon is, unfortunately, all too common throughout the European Union.
We cannot repeat often enough the huge number of accidents that occur: according to information supplied by the Commission, around 500 000 falls from a height occur every year, 300 000 of which cause more than three days' absence from work.
Furthermore, of this total number, around 40 000 serious accidents are recorded and around 1 000 deaths.
In most cases, these accidents are caused by the improper use of scaffolding and ladders.
In this area, as in other areas in the social sphere, we need to encourage the adoption of measures and common legislation to encourage the setting of standards and a levelling upwards, which would represent added-value for all of the Member States.
I am sure that, in my country, where this type of accident has reached frightening proportions, this directive will make a valuable contribution to preventing them. It will also provide an incentive to the competent national authorities to define stricter and more rigorous rules on the use of such work equipment.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise the positive manner in which the Council has worked in close cooperation with Parliament on this matter.
Although we sometimes tend to criticise the positions adopted by the Council, we should give praise where praise is due.
. Mr President, I am very pleased with the generous remarks that have been made and apologise for not being here on time.
We can thank the chauffeurs' service of Parliament.
As wonderful as it is at ferrying us in every day, they seem to have left me behind some half-an-hour after I asked for them to be there.
Apart from this complaint, I should like to thank all the services that have been a part of this very successful report.
I see Simon Duffin, for example, from our secretariat in Parliament, who was instrumental in bringing about many of the compromises, agreements and consensus in our committee.
We should be generous in our praise for people like Simon and others in the Commission who worked tirelessly in bringing about this particular report.
It is a first.
Through an informal process, it may beggar belief to Mr Bushill-Matthews- although I thank him for his original praise to begin with - that it is an employer-friendly report.
There is nothing like this that has come through the processes of health and safety.
That may stagger you, but it is true.
It is true for various reasons.
Perhaps we ought to start off by reminding ourselves of the very reason why this report came about in the first place.
The report was lost as a scaffolding or works-at-height directive, as an annex to an original report.
The reason why it was lost was because originally it was blocked for reasons I will not bother to go into now.
But sense prevailed and now we have it back.
Five hundred thousand people each year fall from heights.
That is quite a staggering amount across the European Union every year.
Forty thousand - as you have probably already heard - are seriously injured; seriously enough for them to have three or more days off from work.
A thousand, very sadly, die each year, with the consequent effects on administration, the burden to businesses of finding replacements, of training, finding the costs for compensating the relatives.
That is quite a burden for business.
Across the European Union the costs are estimated as being in the region of EUR 28 billion every year.
That is enough for a whole host of hospitals, schools, roads, or whatever you want, across the European Union.
Yet we still persist in allowing accidents to happen in the workplace.
Forgive me for being passionate about this, but if you can stop accidents in the workplace, I say you are doing a favour for the workers in the enterprise and for the businesses themselves.
We should strive to do that in the most reasonable and practicable way.
Those people who know me, know me for being a practical person, not somebody up there in the clouds wishing further ideology to descend on businesses, but somebody who sees the real advantages for the person in the workplace.
I worked at heights.
I worked on scaffolding.
I worked on ladders.
I tried to carry things too large for people to be able to carry.
I have seen it.
Let me tell you these are not fly-by-night dreams of someone in Parliament.
If I am a Labour MEP who has brought legislation in, I am very proud to do that because we may see a reduction of accidents in the workplace as a result of such legislation.
Not only that, it is employer-friendly because it brings about a level playing-field.
No longer will we have the competitive basis, on which some companies wish to compete, of people who prefer to miss out all these rules and regulations in favour of seeking the lowest cost, the lowest denominator in the workplace.
That puts at risk the lives and livelihoods of those people who are the most vulnerable - the people who are working there.
Parliament has been incredibly successful in this process. It has been successful for many reasons.
It has partly been successful because it has been able to include things which the Commission and the Council were not originally willing to consider.
These are not burdens.
I do not think that including self-employed people in this particular legislation is burdensome.
When you look at the contracting industry - take electricians, for example - the vast majority are self-employed.
The report has not only looked at contracting industries in the building sector but looked across a wide spectrum of people working at heights.
It is not just people working on building sites that fall from buildings or scaffolding, it is across a range of different industries.
It seems remarkable that this could be so misrepresented.
Parliament also stood out in favour of maintaining a sensible balance between too much detail and that which needs to be regulated.
We need regulation if we are to have the kind of standards which a civilised European Union wants to see.
This move was underlined by the fact that Parliament took a very mature interest in some of that detail and effectively helped people, for example, who have to carry huge weights on ladders, to consider the very serious problems that could happen to themselves and the very serious injuries.
Not all the amendments came from the Socialists.
It is not as if we were some devious clique involved in destroying businesses.
Amendments came from the other side of the House as well.
Let us not forget that.
You are criticising your own colleagues as well.
This is a very successfully arranged piece of legislation.
It has been achieved through consensus and goodwill in our committee.
I thank all the people who have been a part of that.
I hope we will be able to enjoy the success for many years to come.
. (ES) Mr President, I would first like to express my pleasure at representing my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, in the legislative process of this proposal for a directive on falls from heights that you are likely to finally adopt tomorrow.
I would like to say that thanks to the tenacity of Mr Skinner, the rapporteur, an agreement was reached with the Council, and therefore there is finally a common position that will enable us to break the deadlock and move forward with this.
The issue of self-employed workers still has to be dealt with, as has been pointed out, and the Council and the Commission plan to issue a joint declaration expressing their desire to find a valid solution for all those involved in preparing, carrying out and completing temporary work at height.
I would like to congratulate everyone on their work, especially the rapporteur, and all the speakers, and say that when we are talking about health and safety at work we do not consider whether we are dealing with salaried workers or independent workers.
What is important to us is the health of workers, however they are contracted and whatever their method of work.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de PalÃ¡cio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European Union's oil supply
The next item is the report (A5Â­0163/2001) by Mr Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Communication from the Commission on the European Union's oil supply [COM(2000) 631 - C5Â­0739/2000 - 2000/2335(COS)].
Mr President, perhaps I could waste a little time because earlier on we were informed that the Linkohr report would be taken at 10 p.m.
Obviously you have been speeding through things at an extraordinary rate and Mr Linkohr must have been under the misapprehension that he was not required until 10 p.m.
I have only just got here myself as a shadow rapporteur.
Could we perhaps waste a little time?
Mr Purvis, clearly a multitude of reasons can be given, but Mr Linkohr is very well known in this House and is extremely responsible.
I am referring more to coincidence than to his personal responsibility.
I am sure that he has a legitimate reason for not being here now, but I must also say that in terms of programming speeches, the Bureau makes quite accurate estimates for speaking time.
Members must therefore keep an eye on the display board and have an idea of when their time is approaching.
Parliament must have this balance - and I am by no means criticising the three rapporteurs who, for a host of reasons are not here today - if it is to function and work properly I am sure, however, that Mr Linkohr is on his way.
-DE), draftsman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are so dependent nowadays on oil as a source of energy that, if it were to stop suddenly, almost everything would grind to a halt.
For example, can you imagine life with no aeroplanes and no cars?
The Commission communication on Europe's oil supply, which is exceptionally important in content and most daring in form, Mr Linkohr's report on it, the opinions of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has done me the honour of appointing me as draftsman, are clear and, to a greater or lesser extent, all come to a number of revealing conclusions.
First, at current rates, the worldwide consumption of oil will rise from 77 million barrels a day in 2000 to 115 million barrels in 20 years, i.e. it will almost double.
Secondly, specialists forecast that the maximum [output] will not exceed 90 million barrels a day and that the number of new fields discovered will continue to dwindle.
Thirdly, Europe is totally dependent on oil imports.
The present figure is 75% and it is expected to top 85% in 2020.
Fourthly, the price of crude oil is expected to remain high, at least 22 to 28 dollars a barrel, and will most probably continue to rise.
I this is combined with the high value of the dollar, the cost will inevitably rise, making European products less competitive, due to the high rate of tax on petroleum products in the European Union.
This, of course, will exacerbate inflationary pressures.
Fifthly, huge numbers of people die in road traffic accidents, almost as many as the number of people who die in major wars.
Sixthly, 70% - I repeat 70% - of the atmospheric pollution of our planet is due to transport and only 7% is due to industry and we should refrain from misleading criticism which only targets industrial pollution, given that cars and aeroplanes cause most of the pollution on our planet.
As I have checked and there is still time, I should like to finish my point because I think that this is an important issue.
Oil is, however, a valuable commodity in other important sectors, such as the pharmaceutical industry.
Consequently, as it is a non-renewable source of energy, we should not waste it.
If all this is true, and this is what the Commission report tells us, then what we need to do is obvious, but it is also extremely difficult.
In the long term, we - and the European Union in particular - must look for alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, hydrocarbons, of which there is an abundance on our planet, nuclear energy - concentrating on nuclear fusion - and of course, sustainable sources, of which solar energy is the most important.
In the short term, and I am almost finished, the European Union must look for oil and natural gas from several geographical sources, especially in the Caucasus.
We also need to try and reach an agreement with OPEC on more stable prices and payment in euros rather than dollars and, at the same time, to increase our safety stocks.
(The President cut the speaker off)
, rapporteur. (DE) Mr President, if we had held this debate on the oil supply of the European Union six months ago, far more attention would probably have been paid to it and a host of journalists would have been here so that they could report on it the following day.
I doubt if this will be the case today because things have calmed down somewhat since.
Surprisingly, back then, when oil prices were indeed rising, albeit not so dramatically, the streets were full of protesters and if a country had held elections, the government would probably have had terrible trouble getting re-elected; even though there is nothing they can do about it, psychologically it makes a huge difference.
People were confused and many took to the streets in anger.
What exactly is my point here?
My point is that oil policy can have an extraordinary effect on public opinion in our countries and we must be take care when talking about oil.
Obviously, people are getting used to higher prices.
The price of oil has since risen to 30 dollars a barrel, yet there is no revolt - at one time, even that rise would have constituted a danger.
What I am trying to say here is that this is not an insignificant issue and we should make an effort to help stabilise prices - knowing full well that prices will, of course, tend to go up before they go down over the next few years, due to the shortage of oil and for ecological reasons, and that abrupt changes are dangerous.
The Commission published a communication back then, on which I should now like to congratulate it.
I think it is an exceptionally helpful and intelligent communication and I think the most important message - and it is this message which I also want to get across in my report - is that we need proper relations with OPEC.
We need dialogue with OPEC and, more importantly, we need the European Union to speak with one voice in this dialogue.
Not with fifteen, with one.
I am pleased to pay you the compliment, Commissioner, but I would have said it anyway: it must be the Commissioner who speaks for the European Union.
I can imagine that the band which OPEC is aiming for will be pegged at between about 22 and 28 dollars a barrel.
Even 30 dollars would not be a catastrophe, even if, because of inflation, we would, of course, be more comfortable with 25 rather than 30 dollars.
So where are the bones of contention, including here in Parliament?
First, there is the question of tax harmonisation, of the harmonisation of duty on mineral oils.
I am an ardent advocate of this sort of harmonisation, although I know that many of my fellow members take a different tack, believing that tax policy should be subject to competition.
However, I think it is absolutely essential and fair, in the interests of truck drivers and haulage companies in competition with each other, that we harmonise competitive conditions.
The second divisive issue that is causing problems is the use of stocks.
Now I too know that these stocks, which we have estimated at 90 days, are, of course, minute compared with the size of the oil fields underground and that releasing these stocks will have little impact on the cost of energy.
I am not so naive as to have overlooked this.
However, I believe that it makes sense, psychologically, to release them in a crisis, but I admit that we could argue the point.
The third point we need to discuss - and I am being very cautious here - is the use of fiscal instruments in the event of a crisis.
If you object that this is highly adventurous, then I would remind you that the French government granted tax relief back then, contrary to European directives, and has kept it in place to this day.
In other words, we have to deal with a real situation here, which we cannot allow to put us under pressure.
What gives me food for thought is that OPEC stands together with the USA on climate policy.
In other words, they are a partner in the US alliance, which could be dangerous when it comes to climate policy.
I really would like to be able to discuss climate policy with OPEC.
I think that we could well broker a compromise here.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. (DE) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Linkohr on his report, even if, as rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I am not totally happy about the fact - although this will depend on the outcome of the vote - that scant attention has been paid to one fundamental factor, namely the utilisation of oil in the transport sector.
Mr Linkohr has described the circumstances in which oil prices fluctuated abruptly and erratically and has pointed out that a whole series of countries took measures which were out of kilter both with the rules and principles of the European Union and with what we are debating today from the point of view of sustainable development, because we must not forget that the debate is not just about this report, it is about the huge task of the Swedish presidency and the Gothenburg summit as regards sustainable development.
Even if the topical subject of Ireland is taking centre stage, we should not forget this fundamental approach.
I particularly welcome the fact that the President of the Commission said quite clearly today that sustainable development is one of the cornerstones of development in the European Union, including a transport policy geared towards sustainable development.
This also includes, as Mr Linkohr said, a price policy which prevents erratic fluctuations but which does not follow the populist line of: the lower the price of transport, the better.
No, what we need is a pricing system and structure in the transport sector which is keeping with transport policy objectives, especially where oil is used.
And the transport policy objectives, as the Commissioner also sees them, consist of shifting more traffic from the roads to the railways wherever it is possible and makes sense to do so.
When we have adopted a railways package, when the Commissioner has proposed the additional measures which we are waiting for, then it will make sense overall to boost sustainable development by shifting traffic, especially freight traffic and passenger and local traffic, on to the railways.
The last point I want to mention here is planning policy.
We know it cannot happen overnight but I think - and this too is contained in the Linkohr report - that we must urge individual Member States to think in their future planning policy about providing public transport which is as efficient and environmentally-friendly as possible wherever land is developed and houses, factories etc. are built.
This too is important if we want to ensure that sustainability is not just dead letter.
Mr President, Mr Linkohr's report is much to be welcomed.
It is a balanced report with workable suggestions on how to improve the intermittently precarious oil supply situation.
That it is precarious can be seen from the spike in prices which occurred last autumn, or as is occurring now with Iraq's decision to stop oil exports.
It is precarious because we depend on supplies of oil from unstable parts of the world.
It is intermittent because these crises endure for relatively short periods as market forces come to bear and rectify the situation.
Indeed the volatility of oil prices, ranging in the last 18 months from USD 10 to 34 per barrel, is as much a problem for the suppliers as it is for the consumers.
This gives us an opportunity, because stable prices are of interest both to us in Europe and to the oil supplier countries.
We should make a much more consistent effort to develop a dialogue with the oil supplier countries, with the Middle East, with Russia, with the Caspian and Caucasus countries and with West Africa.
This dialogue must not just be pursued when there is a shortage, or when there is a seller's market, or when it is in our interest.
It must be pursued also when the boot is on our foot, when there is a glut and a buyer's market.
As a practical example, Europe should encourage and facilitate the construction of oil and gas pipelines from these places to the heartland of Europe.
Nor should we overlook the potential of our indigenous oilfields, notably those in my Scottish constituency.
Research and investment and improved recovery techniques have already extended the life and productivity of the North Sea and continental shelf oilfields.
But more can still be done.
We must also pursue opportunities for saving energy, above all in the transport sector.
Yes, we must do what we can to promote renewable and alternative energies.
But we cannot share Mr Linkohr's enthusiasm for harmonising tax rates and using harmonised tax, applied at European level, and the manipulation of strategic oil reserves to regulate oil prices.
Tax rates are for the Member States to set and clearly they are quite unwilling to sign up to the long-delayed directive on taxation of energy products.
Taxes on energy should be set in the context of an open competitive European market which, in itself, will ensure that fuel costs are not too far out of line from one country to the next.
We cannot afford to hobble our economies, our industries and those who live and work in our rural and remoter regions.
Yes, oil supply is a matter which has to concern us.
The Commission's communication and Mr Linkohr's report are valuable contributions to understanding the problem and defining possible solutions.
If we can succeed in amending the few unacceptable aspects that I have detailed, this group will be pleased to support Mr Linkohr's report.
Mr President, Mr Linkohr, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the security of energy supplies is not new to the European Union.
As the rapporteur mentioned, the hike in oil prices just over a year ago gave us an indication of how easily Europe could be destabilised by the speculative manoeuvres of the major oil exporters.
Once again, Europe has been unable to take coordinated action because of its great dependence.
Today, therefore, it is particularly crucial that we adopt a coherent strategy to allow the European Union to provide this security.
In 2000, Europe imported 75% of its total oil requirements and by 2020, this figure will reach 85%.
We must, therefore, take steps to reduce our dependence.
These measures include, first of all, diversifying our supply sources and we must develop long-term strategies for the Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Caucasus regions, if only to limit the influence of OPEC.
In this connection, we have just cause to welcome the European Commission' s energy initiatives in the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
The European Union has everything to gain from stepping up the dialogue, by means of the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Forum.
Reducing our dependence on oil exporting countries can also be achieved by diversifying the energy sources.
I am thinking, of course, of sources of renewable energy and biofuels.
I am also thinking, however, of nuclear energy, even though I know that many people here are opposed to this.
Of course, we must obviously stress the need for research in order to minimise the production of waste and risks to safety.
Gas may also represent an alternative energy source and I support the proposal seeking to carry out a feasibility study on the construction of new oil and gas pipelines between the Middle East, West Africa and Europe.
Another aspect of our strategy must focus on the rational use of energy and I welcome the Commission' s proposal to submit to the Gothenburg Council a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which will aim at more efficient use of energy.
Lastly, transport is a sector that deserves all our attention.
According to current forecasts, the transport sector will account for 71% of demand for oil by 2020 and, as rapporteur, I note with interest the request from Mr Linkohr to carry out research under the Sixth Programme for Research and Development.
To sum up, I also believe that tax harmonisation has an important role to play in the strategy that I have just mentioned and I support the proposals that have been made on this by my fellow Member, Mr Linkohr.
I would, moreover, like to end my speech by offering him my warm congratulations for his work and for his skilful approach.
Mr President, Commissioner De Palacio, I would also like to thank the rapporteur Mr Linkohr for an excellent report.
Our group supports the main points of the report.
The Union' s dependence on oil imports is increasing worryingly while, at the same time, the availability of oil is decreasing and its price rising.
The goal of the Union' s overall strategy must be to seek to reduce Europe' s dependence on importing energy.
At the same time effective dialogue is required with groupings of oil producing countries, exactly as stated in the report.
In this context I would like to mention cooperation with Russia.
Among other things the gas and oil resources of the Barents Sea area are an important reserve also in terms of European energy provision.
The Union should also seek more decisively than previously to replace oil with other sources of energy.
Renewable energy sources and biofuels in particular can replace part of oil consumption and at the same time promote the Kyoto objectives.
This requires that the Union direct more of its resources than previously towards researching renewable energy and promoting its use.
Nor should we overlook local renewable fuels whose renewability can be successfully proven, such as peat, cork waste and olive stones, for example, depending on the geographical area.
An important means of reducing dependence on oil is also saving energy.
One example is taking into account energy aspects to a greater extent in construction and transport.
The simplest way of saving energy is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings by harmonising building regulations towards energy efficiency.
At the same time, oil-based raw materials can be replaced by renewable materials such as wood, for example.
In the transport sector, oil consumption can be reduced by better planning, new technology, environmentally-friendly means of transport and by investing in research into fuels to replace petrol.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Linkohr for a very fair report.
I agree on the importance of far-sighted policies.
When oil prices rise we conserve energy, when they fall we do not.
This has been very short-sighted, as I am sure the Commissioner will agree.
Energy saving and the rational use of energy must be part of our strategy for security of supply.
The rapporteur has rightly pointed out that it is possible to save large quantities of oil using existing technology.
Around 20% of production could be saved simply by using energy-saving windows.
Oil is a costly, non-renewable energy source, which should not be used wastefully.
I therefore support the Commission's proposal to submit to the GÃ¶teborg Council a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources aimed at more efficient energy use.
What is even more important is the transport sector.
Here the emphasis on biofuels and renewable energies is most welcome.
We need to develop a new generation of vehicles.
Energy consumption in the transport sector is our greatest problem.
The report makes very welcome proposals here.
The Green Group cannot, however, agree that nuclear energy is safe or an acceptable replacement for oil.
Instead, let us have the same kind of investment in renewable energy that we have seen in nuclear energy over the past 40 years.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our oil supply problem is a very real problem.
However, the report under discussion makes no attempt, in my opinion, to address it from the point of view of the interests of the people of Europe.
The objective of its basic approach is to enhance Community imperialism within the framework of competition with the United States of America.
Certain objectives, such as restricting the power of OPEC and drawing up a long-term strategy for the Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Caucasus regions, are evidence of a multi-faceted policy of imperialistic intervention.
At the same time, the rapporteur acknowledges that the crisis in 2000 was not a real supply crisis.
In fact, subsequent developments proved that speculation by monopoly groups and heavy taxes in the European Union were to blame for high prices.
Nonetheless, the report attacks tax cuts and proposes that taxes be harmonised upwards, concealing this anti-grass roots measure beneath a mantle of environmental sensitivity.
Of course, everyone agrees that we need to develop energy-saving technologies and promote renewable energy sources.
However, the oil supply problem cannot be resolved within a neoliberal economy in which the more we consume, the greater the profit.
I think that only a fully nationalised energy agency can take charge and make proper use of existing energy sources in each country, taking account of both the economic cost and environmental protection, while safeguarding the interests of the people.
This is a highly political issue and has to do with the facility for centralised planning within an economy in which the people own the means of production in sectors of strategic importance.
Mr President, diversification is the key word for the Commission and the rapporteur with regard to the European Union' s energy supply. That is one of the ways of preventing greater dependence on imported oil.
First of all, the dialogue with oil-producing countries could lead to a greater diversity of suppliers.
This welcome spreading of risk prevents individual countries from assuming too much power in the European oil supply.
In addition, the Commission and rapporteur are using the dialogue as an instrument for more stable price development.
However, this is easier said than done.
Moreover, both the use of strategic supplies and excise measures are not sufficiently convincing as price instruments.
The risk is that these price instruments might only delay the synchronisation of supply and demand because the market does not highlight the incentives sufficiently.
There are solutions other than price management.
For example, it could be examined whether a greater surplus capacity in the refineries could offer solace.
Greater capacity can meet an increase in demand without the immediate need to put the prices up.
Thirdly, diversification according to the type of energy source is necessary, as proposed by the Commission and rapporteur.
That is why other energy sources need to replace natural oil in the sectors where that is possible.
Natural gas and renewable energy sources can thus contribute to a greater diversity of supply.
Despite this, sustainability is more than simply promoting renewable energy sources in a focused manner.
National sustainability strategies provide the market with a variety of policies providing additional cover.
At European level, it is important to avoid a situation where this diversification in terms of energy sources and geographical origin leads to competition at the expense of environmental standards and working conditions.
A first step in this connection is a certification system for type and origin.
Specific national policies are then possible for each energy source.
In the enlargement process, this approach might meet the need for flexibility for both Member States and candidate countries.
Finally, the pursuit of low prices to the exclusion of everything else will lead to countries with the lowest cost price dominating the market.
That is why price management must not be the main issue of the dialogue.
The preconditions for a reliable and sustainable energy supply, on the other hand, should be.
Mr President, I congratulate my colleague, Mr Linkohr, on this report.
It is a welcome contribution to the wider debate on security of supply of energy in Europe, on which I am working at present.
I should like to pick up on four points.
Regarding paragraph 1, calling for effective dialogues with supplier countries, earlier this afternoon I attended a meeting where we heard about the work of the Energy Charter and the importance of putting that framework in place, in particular for our trading and investment relations with Russia as a primary source of oil and gas.
I would like to emphasise the importance of that initiative.
Next, paragraph 7 calls on the EU to make greater efforts to replace oil as far as possible.
I support that paragraph.
There is great potential and we are looking forward to hearing from the Commission later this year with proposals to encourage bio-fuels and other alternatives as a supplement - and perhaps a complement - to oil at present.
Thirdly, paragraph 27, on a different tack, urges the Commission to encourage enhancing production of oil in Europe through improved techniques of extraction.
This also must surely be a sensible policy to make the best use of our own resources.
Fourthly, paragraph 30 calls on Member States to work on the housing and transport sectors as areas where we can dramatically improve our energy efficiency and our conservation of energy.
These both have to be a sensible approach.
Finally, it seems to me that perhaps the most important thing we have to do - which is a challenge ahead of us - is to influence and change public opinion on the need for conservation and efficiency.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Linkohr for his excellent report.
In my opinion, however, we are not dependent on oil but dependent on cars and transport.
This is what we are dependent on, this is what will soon consume 70% of oil.
They also surround this building, all the European Parliament buildings and all the offices, the same vehicles which consume our oil.
By the way, who has ever heard of car-free offices?
There is no such thing.
Engine technology can be changed and fuels developed but the most efficient solution can be achieved by reducing traffic or by switching to rail, as has now been suggested.
The rapporteur proposes more energy-efficient windows.
That is a good saving. It would save 20% of oil.
We did this in Finland as far back as 25 years ago - triple glazing.
What next?
Transporting energy is one problem.
I support local forms of energy.
In Finland, for example, 30% of the land area is bog.
We use less than one percent of this and it does not have to be transported anywhere.
These are the right solutions.
Therefore, for us using the annual growth in peat makes sense.
However, it is clear that these savings will not be achieved in time.
Renewable energy sources are not sufficiently fast.
Therefore, we will have to do something else and as far as I am concerned this is either nuclear power or natural gas.
Let us choose natural gas, it can be found in the north in the Barents Sea area as Mr Pohjamo said.
There is an incredible amount of it there, more than in the Caspian Basin.
It could be the high point of the northern dimension.
I thank the Commissioner for the energy dialogue with Russia but it has to be speeded up.
My proposal is to focus on cooperation between the Union and Russia which will create shortcuts.
Russia' s partners are large and they are used to shortcuts.
They will enable us to gain speed and at the same time develop legislation.
Besides, there is a war going on in the Caucasus and there is peace in the north.
There is nothing there except polar bears and silent Scandinavians.
This cooperation would work and would secure energy provision.
Mr President, Commissioner, what is the comparative of ridiculous? A parliamentary debate at the witching hour, just before the witching hour.
I apologise for being late, as were other fellow Members, but I do have an explanation.
We look around and think, hardly anyone is here and the few that are here, who were here before and have already spoken, evaporate like ghosts which materialise somewhere else shortly afterwards and then disappear again.
If this were merely a ghost debate, it would not much matter.
But we are taking about taxes, transparency, democracy, the substance of a modern economy and mobility.
Luckily we have a Harry Potter among us, played tonight by Rolf Linkohr, who is doing his best to ensure that we make some sort of progress here and who has a watchful, unwavering eye for fundamental principles of which many of us are simply no longer aware, fundamental principles for our present society.
The fact that only 11 Members are still here says much about both the strength and the powerlessness of this Parliament.
Nonetheless, the debate is a central debate, when you think what the problems are, and there are three problems, I think.
First, there is the problem of democracy, social justice and ecology in Europe.
Even if we manage to achieve the breakthroughs which we need in the area of democracy and maintain the tendency towards an equitable mix in the social fabric, the huge ecological question still remains.
And this is the subject of this report.
One point in this report demands our attention because it is, I think, a really important point. I refer to Amendment No 6 which, if it gets through plenary - and I hope it does - will change a general proposal to the Council into a clear demand to push ahead, at long last, with tax harmonisation.
Tax harmonisation, especially in the energy sector, is an absolute priority if our citizens are to understand that we have converged not just socially but democratically too.
We must put a stop to imbalances whereby a truck driver from Austria, for example, is exposed to totally different conditions of competition than another driver a few kilometres down the road in Germany or France.
This is where we call on the Commission and, more importantly, the Council, to do something.
I hope that we will make some headway here via this energy report.
Without transparency there can be no democracy, not even in Europe.
That is why I am ardently in favour not just of accepting the report but also of pushing ahead with tax harmonisation.
Protection of pigs
The next item is the report (A5-0210/2001) by Mr Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Directive [COM(2001) 20 - C5-0039/2001 - 2001/0021(CNS)] amending Directive 91/630/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs.
Just the subject for a midnight debate.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Maat of the Group of the European People' s Party and Mr Kindermann of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for what was unusually constructive and fruitful cooperation in the Committee.
There was, of course, overwhelming interest in this report, such that no less than 135 amendments were tabled.
We jointly made these into 10 compromise amendments adopted by a very large majority of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I should also like to thank the Commission and the Swedish Presidency for their very constructive cooperation.
The Commission' s proposal, which forms the basis for the measures concerned, contains many good features, but I do not think that it is sufficiently far-reaching.
What I do not see are common rules for European farmers competing in a single internal market.
Animal welfare and the needs of pigs are of course one and the same, whether the pigs concerned are in the north or the south.
Naturally, there are differences in temperature, but that only, of course, increases the need for overhead sprays, for harmonised rules concerning ventilation and for very good training for all EU farmers.
I also think we are obliged to adopt common rules for European farmers and that we must not only ever talk about minimum rules.
That is also, of course, what the Commission has proposed.
It is clear to everyone that the different Member States do not attach equal importance to animal welfare, and it is therefore necessary for ourselves here in Parliament, together with the Commission, to decide that these concerns should be raised jointly.
Otherwise, it will be possible justly to accuse us of not complying with our own decisions. The fact that we in Europe make high demands in terms of animal welfare makes our European pig breeders less competitive than producers outside the EU.
In order to meet this problem and in order to ensure that consumers have clear and lucid information about products that witness to a high standard of animal welfare, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would request the Commission to take initiatives to produce common rules for the labelling of pork that complies with these high standards.
I have a lot of sympathy for the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy about introducing an import ban on products from third countries which do not comply with those standards we require. However, that is, of course, the same as proposing, or supporting the idea of, a trade war, and that is something I do not think we should do.
It is therefore a problem that the Commission should solve under the aegis of the WTO.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would also ask the Commission to prepare a report on the situation regarding implementation of the existing directives from 1991, for it is of course not only a question of fair competition in the world market but also, to a large extent, of fair competition in the internal market.
The Member States send information about the directive to the Commission, but we are not given this information here in Parliament.
The Commission ought now to gather the information and present it in a report explaining how the directive has been implemented, just as, this afternoon, we heard Commissioner Byrne provide a clear explanation of progress where animal transport is concerned.
It could well be that the Commission appreciates the need for common rules, such as those within the transport area.
I am very much looking forward to the Commission' s relevant proposals, which we expect to receive in October of this year.
It is now, therefore, the Commission' s task to look after the interests of European farmers in the forthcoming WTO negotiations.
As has been said, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes partly solving this problem by introducing a common welfare-marking system.
It is, of course, obvious that every time European pig producers have a cost imposed upon them, it is not imposed upon our competitors, then we may be in danger of losing market shares.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also wants the Commission to propose rules for keeping pigs outdoors, now that the rules governing intensive pig rearing are soon to be in place.
We also have a duty to have definite rules adopted governing other pigs.
More and more pigs are kept outdoors, and it is therefore necessary to secure common rules governing access to mud baths and shade and any other facilities relevant to keeping pigs outdoors.
We have also tightened up the rules on training.
It ought quite simply to be a requirement for farmers to have practical and theoretical training so that they are able to look after their animals responsibly.
Like the introduction of overhead sprays, this tightening-up of the rules provides for animals' greater welfare, and these matters are very, very important.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Busk on his excellent report.
He has managed to incorporate most of the legislation that went through the Committee on the Environment, which is important.
It is also important that we push this legislation forward so that the consumers can have a product which they know is perfectly safe, is reared in an environmentally-friendly manner and which they can eat with total safety, knowing that the animal has had an excellent life.
It is up to farmers to follow the legislation through.
Mr Busk touched on two or three important issues.
I will reiterate them very quickly.
One of them was transport of animals.
We are well aware of the importance of that and I know Commissioner Byrne, is equally aware of it.
Bringing that legislation into the WTO negotiations is vitally important, as is clear labelling.
Let me add, speaking not just from the viewpoint of the Committee on the Environment but also as farmer, that what we must not do within the European Union - and here I plead with the Commissioner, knowing his views on the way we import and export our products - is to end up putting legislation in place which exports the very industries on which we are legislating now in the EU.
If we do that, then we simply end up exporting animal welfare outside the European Union where we have no control over it.
We must have equality, not just within the European Union, but also for products coming into the European Union.
I plead with the Commissioner to make sure that sort of legislation is in place, so that we do not have products coming into the European Union which are not of the same standard that we set.
I know it is very difficult for people to understand this, but I hope that the Commissioner will follow it through and keep that legislation in place.
Mr President, I should first of all like to extend a warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Busk, for the excellent cooperation.
I should also like to thank Mr Kindermann, who helped us find a solution in a number of compromise amendments.
My second point concerns the Commission. I should like to thank Mr Byrne for coming up with a proposal at any rate.
But at the same time, I am of the opinion that the Council should also be here today.
For if we consider this legislation on the welfare of pigs, I cannot help but observe that the discrepancies between the European Member States are unjustifiably huge, so huge that they are posing a threat to our free internal market.
It is, in fact, unacceptable in this Europe that, as a result, prices can differ between the various pig holdings in Europe by up to 30 to 35%.
This situation is, at the same time, a criticism of the Council, which is requested to draft general rules.
In actual fact - that is why I am so pleased with Mr Byrne' s presence here this evening - this matter is also of relevance to consumers, for we are once again debating a directive which has implications for farmers. But what about the implications for consumers?
On behalf of my group, I should like to expressly underline that we are particularly concerned about this aspect for, in the final analysis, this proposal will lead to extra investments for pig holdings without any guarantee of an increase in yield.
This concern must be reflected in whatever approach is adopted, be it via a European premium policy or an extra surcharge for consumers.
In any case, animal welfare may no longer lead to huge differences in terms of competition, and the bill may not always have to be paid by European farmers alone.
I wanted to make this quite clear.
I will not elaborate on the content of the report.
Mr Busk made an excellent job of that.
Mr Sturdy expertly outlined the consequences for the WTO negotiations.
We all know that animal welfare is an incredibly difficult issue in the WTO.
But if European society cares about animal welfare, it also has the costly duty to ensure that it is put on the agenda in the WTO negotiations, and to take this matter into consideration in politics in general.
We could talk about this topic ad infinitum.
We have been approached by various organisations with different points of view, as well as by consumer organisations, animal protection organisations and farmers' organisations.
I have increasingly noticed that, sometimes, there is definitely a basis for an alliance.
But such an alliance could only be set up if the necessary funding started to become available and if the consumer were far more involved.
Although my group welcomes the agreement reached, it is very concerned about the implications for farmers.
We also believe that, slowly but surely, the implications for consumers should be made clearer.
Mr President, following intensive negotiations and an excellent job by Mr Busk, we are now in a position to debate his report here in Parliament.
On behalf of my group, I should like to thank both him and Mr Maat for their work.
I think that the compromise proposals negotiated will bring us another step forward in improving how pigs are kept.
But it is and remains just a compromise.
Optimum demands, often couched in emotional terms, are self-evident but cannot be implemented as they stand.
In the final analysis, every new legal framework has a huge impact on the people affected.
It is important here for us to have flexible transition times.
Adjusting to other or new animal husbandry systems takes time and, more importantly, costs money.
The conditions of competition are particular harsh in the pig production sector.
I should like briefly to address another two points: first, extra space for fattening pigs and, secondly, castration.
Neither is covered by the Commission proposal but I think that the European Parliament should set higher standards for the protection of animals here.
The 1997 Scientific Veterinary Committee report on the welfare of pigs gives us a starting point here, especially for the space which fattening pigs require.
We would not be able to get the general ban on the castration of pigs which some people are calling for across to German consumers in my view.
Whether or not double vaccination of males can replace castration only time will tell.
But I think this is the most practical solution.
As far as the timetable is concerned, I think we have found an acceptable compromise.
Holdings will have time to change their production methods over a fairly long period of time.
Finally, I call on the House to adopt the report as it stands.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, when we received the Commission proposal, we were somewhat undecided in committee as to whether we should deal with it at all because, with all due respect, it was very insubstantial.
We received a poor quality, inadequate document and considered whether we should return it to sender and ask for a reasonable proposal on the protection of pigs.
But it must be said, Mr Busk, that you deserve our warmest congratulations on your work.
That includes Mr Maat and Mr Kindermann, who helped with the compromise amendments.
Now we have a proper proposal and, once again, Parliament has done a good job.
It is also a good thing that we intend to adopt it now because, had we decided otherwise and rejected the proposal, animal protection associations would again have accused farmers of wanting to stonewall, of wanting to put commercial interests first.
But that was never our intention; we want to implement animal protection, obviously in tandem with farmers' commercial interests.
As Mr Sturdy just said, we obviously need to ensure that the standards which we set at home also apply to products imported into the European Union.
In this sense, we have to work towards reasonable external protection which adopts a qualified version of what we describe here as the European way in agriculture and have again implemented in such detail here.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before going into the directive on the minimum requirements for the protection of pigs in detail, I should like to make a few basic points.
I personally consider that it is high time we got the debate on animal protection back on track.
The debate on animal protection has thrown up highly exaggerated demands recently, in the wake of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises and with regard to the quality of food, which are totally unrealistic.
I all too rarely hear any serious debate with qualified specialists.
Too often hysteria gets the upper hand and hits the headlines.
I will not beat about the bush: animals are animals and people are people.
We keep animals in order to make use of them and if we want animal husbandry which is suited to the species, then it must indeed be suited to the species.
This means, for example, that animals such as chickens, pigs or fish are not being kept in a way which is suited to their species if we try to apply humane or ethical concepts to them.
I know full well that agriculture is a difficult area, especially with the work it has to do and the problems that it has, and especially for those who are not directly affected.
That is why it is all the more important for us to be able to make an informed judgement and to apply that judgement so that everything we decide here can be implemented and applied in practice.
We cannot issue policy from an ivory tower and we have failed in our duty if our policy is not reflected in practical measures for our citizens.
Now to the report. I can support the compromises found with all my heart because the minimum requirements set here pose no problems for Austrian agriculture or Austrian farmers.
Economic and ecological aspects need to be taken into account in the debate.
The geographical location of the farm also plays a part, as do structural requirements.
Development funds must be channelled to this sector because there is huge potential for investment.
I should like to close by saying that specialist training for stockmen and other people involved is absolutely essential.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has presented a proposal on minimum standards for the protection of pigs in order to improve the welfare of these animals.
I think it is a real pity that animal protection directives are being issued rather than regulations.
I say this as an enthusiastic supporter of regulations because, when directives are implemented, they generally bring new distortions of competition in their wake in my country.
I do not intend to address all the individual compromise amendments proposed here because a great deal of what we have set out here is, in my view, glaringly self-evident.
To cite just one example: training for qualifications is recommended, but young farmers in Germany gave up trying to survive in this fiercely competitive sector without qualifications a long time ago.
I think it is a great pity that the Commissioner does not have much time to listen but I shall address the controversial interests of consumer organisations once again, given that they are wheeled out in every debate and everyone keeps saying that consumers are calling for better protection for animals.
Just by chance, I received Commissioner Fischler's press communiquÃ© yesterday in which he said during an interview with a German broadsheet that consumer habits have now reversed post BSE.
According to Commissioner Fischler, people are increasingly turning to cheap supplies once more.
My many years' experience confirms precisely that.
People obviously have to watch their budget and we need to be sensitive here and not overstep the mark.
Everything we do has a very decisive impact on costs.
Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths.
We almost make out that we are experts here.
I think others are far better placed to judge.
Mr President, I think that you know everything there is to know about pig production in Bavaria.
You know what it means when we talk about docking tails, castration, teeth clipping and all these important things.
I should like to close by saying that we need to strike a balance between animal protection, health and environmental aspects.
We also need acceptable transition times for the whole business.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must first congratulate Mr Busk because he has worked hard, but I must express my disagreement with the content of the amendments that we are going to vote on this morning.
I am probably the only speaker from a southern country, which, moreover, is the largest producer of pigs in the European Union.
Like the rapporteur, I want all the standards to be as uniform as possible in the whole of the European Union, but we need to harmonise standards that can be applied from Lapland to Andalusia, and after that, each country or each region can set the levels as high as it likes.
What is neither fair nor contributes to European integration is trying to rigidly impose the standards, customs or traditions of one country on the rest, or trying to level standards upwards, because this makes us think, on the contrary, of obstacles to trade.
The circumstances surrounding breeding and agricultural activities are very different between the north and south of the European Union, because the temperatures, the hours of sunlight, the species that are bred, the technological situation of the sectors, etc. are all different.
And, as it says in Amendment No 7, and I quote, "the scientific justification for laying down new conditions is based on the situations obtaining in the northern European countries".
Indeed, it has not been taken into account that there is not a sufficient supply of materials such as straw in hot countries, because it ferments with the heat and causes infections, nor that the slatted systems for facilities in southern countries act as a regulator.
It is asked that irrigation systems be installed to regulate the body temperature of the pigs, but nothing is said about installing heating in cold areas.
Anyway, it has been shown that in northern countries many more piglets die than in hot countries, simply because it is cold and the piglets cuddle up to the mothers and the mothers squash them.
Neither is anything said about the health aspect of the animals.
And, with regard to the managers and workers on farms, I can assure you that, at least in my country, they are true professionals and take responsibility for training themselves, because therein lies the future of their farm.
I think that it is ridiculous to require in a directive that they study and have a qualification in order to do their job.
Allow me to finish, Mr President, by saying that Spain has many reservations on the proposal from the Swedish Presidency on the system for maintaining sows.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive before us centres around the welfare of the animals.
I am delighted that we are reforming animal protection at European level.
It would, of course, have been better, in order to safeguard equal conditions of competition within the Community, if we were to issue regulations, which are directly applicable and valid in the Member States, rather than animal protection directives.
Animal welfare must form part of our basic ethical philosophy.
However, this philosophy should not stop short at the borders of the EU.
Similar demands must be introduced in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and this, Commissioner, is a leitmotiv running through this evening's debate.
We must be aware of the fact that high animal protection standards in the EU lead to higher production costs.
Our pig breeders then have to complete with imports from third countries which do not apply these animal protection standards and can therefore offer much lower prices.
That is the fact of the matter.
New animal protection standards also mean changes in farming systems.
Farming systems set up recently in accordance with the relevant legislative specifications are to be given a transitional period in which to adapt.
As far new investments in holdings are concerned, I agree with the proposal that the new specifications should be implemented by 2003.
With a binding, cross-border ban on the castration of pigs, pig breeders and the market could, in my view, adapt perfectly well to the resultant changes.
But we now call on the Commission to supplement the annex to the directive by 2002, so that male pigs are only castrated by people who have the knowledge and are qualified to do so.
Castration not performed correctly results in constant pain.
Account must be taken of specific details on holdings, such as the size of pens and how pregnant sows are kept.
In addition, account must be taken of the pigs' natural habits, so that the pigs can keep themselves constantly occupied with food and any other material in which to root.
One thing is for sure: whatever efforts we make to improve how pigs are kept, consumer trends will confirm whether or not we have been successful.
I would like, first, to thank Parliament for the priority given to this issue.
Only two days ago the Commission, together with the Council presidency, had the opportunity to set out its views and commitments in relation to animal welfare.
I very much welcomed the broad support expressed by Parliament.
I would also like to thank Mr Busk, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the support given to this specific issue of the welfare of pigs.
The intensification of pig farming in Europe over the past ten years has led to practices which cause unnecessary suffering and which are increasingly proving to be counterproductive.
I took the advice of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare very seriously in preparing the Commission proposal to bring current legislation in line with the scientific evidence.
The Commission proposal prohibits the confinement of sows during most of their pregnancy to individual stalls which severely restrict their freedom of movement.
The use of tethers for sows and gilts will be definitively forbidden.
The proposal also sets out rules to improve the living environment of pigs and piglets in general, setting requirements for living spaces, floor surfaces and proper feeding systems.
I can accept Amendment No 13 because it improves the Commission proposal.
Aware of the importance of the effects of stockmanship on the welfare of pigs, the Commission proposal introduced new requirements for the persons attending to the animals.
Amendments Nos 28 and 30 build on this, calling for certified training for the personnel attending to the pigs, and therefore can be accepted.
Even if I share the aim of Amendments Nos 1 and 26, they are not acceptable because they request initiatives that the Commission is already taking.
I would make specific reference to the fact that the Commission has proposals in place under a Commission directive, under the comitology procedure, in relation to tail docking, teeth clipping, castration, light requirements and teeth grinding.
All of that will be dealt with under the issue of comitology.
I should like to take the opportunity to draw Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's attention to that particular fact, as I know he likes to take an overall view of the legislation that comes before the House.
A second proposal for a Commission directive amending the technical annexes to Directive 91/630 has been discussed by the Standing Veterinary Committee during the past months.
These technical amendments regulate noise levels and light access for the animals to food and materials for rooting, timing of weaning of piglets and floor surfaces; they also prohibit the worst type of routine mutilations.
Amendments Nos 8, 27 and 33 cannot be accepted because they reduce the possibility for the Commission to take urgent action to adopt technical improvements for the welfare of the animals.
I cannot accept Amendment No 38 because the definition of manipulable materials is already foreseen in the annex and will be discussed further in the Standing Veterinary Committee.
Amendments Nos 2, 10 and 31 add new aspects to the Commission proposal and introduce further initiatives.
These are welcome, as is Amendment No 5, that sets a date for the Commission report on further questions related to the welfare of pigs.
Further scientific elements are also necessary to establish new rules for the stocking densities applicable to pigs for fattening.
It is for this reason that Amendment No 11 cannot be accepted.
The Commission is already committed to further analyse the issue from the scientific and economic point of view and to take the necessary steps.
We are all aware that animal welfare carries a price and the measures outlined in this proposal are no exception.
In an industry as competitive as the pig-meat industry, where margins are extremely tight, even small price differentials can have important competitive implications.
The Commission is not blind to these implications.
The proposal is based on extensive consultations with experts from inside and outside the Commission that led the Commission to the conclusion that the additional costs are a price worth paying.
Amendments Nos 36 and 37 are not acceptable because the delay proposed for the application of the new requirements to all holdings is too strict and would significantly raise the costs of conversion.
Data available to the Commission show that the costs would be increased from EUR 0.006 per kilo for a pig carcass to EUR 0.02 if the conversion is carried out with a delay shorter than ten months.
That is 3.3 times the cost.
Amendment No 35 is unacceptable for legal reasons and because we have assessed the costs.
Amendments Nos 3, 4, 31 and 34 suggest that EU initiatives be taken on animal welfare only after having considered the global dimension of the agricultural trade.
These amendments cannot be accepted.
I should recall that the Commission is already considering the global dimension of the trade in animals and animal products, including in relation to the World Trade Organisation that a number of you mentioned.
There is a common misconception that putting forward animal welfare issues in this context is a protectionist agenda.
The Commission considers that we have a duty and a responsibility to press for recognition of these standards, both on purely ethical grounds in recognition of the need for the humane treatment of animals, and in recognition of the higher costs which these standards entail for producers and consumers in the EU.
These are legitimate issues, which deserve to be discussed on the international stage.
It is essential to share our knowledge of animal welfare with countries outside the European Union and to create a harmonised approach towards this issue.
I am grateful for the constructive approach given to this dossier by the European Parliament.
In summary, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 5, 10, 25, 28 and 30 in full, and Amendments Nos 13 and 31 in part.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
The next item is the report (A5-0209/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision [COM(2001) 81 - C5-0138/2001 - 2001/0045(CNS)] on further exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that I was able to listen to the last debate because, as you perhaps know, Mr President, I have always taken an interest in institutional matters and I was astounded to learn that the length of a pig's tail is a comitology issue.
In this respect, I am that much wiser now and wished to thank you for that.
(Laughter, heckling: cynic!)
Allow me to get to the point, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf!
The European Parliament is prepared to provide exceptional assistance to Kosovo as quickly as possible, which is why we accepted the request for urgent procedure this week.
We want to make our contribution as quickly as possible; we do not want to throw up any obstacles which prevent peace from being restored in this region.
But, my dear Commissioner, please take our request seriously; after all the cooperation in this procedure, this will only happen in the long run if we are given the information we need to carry out our parliamentary control function properly, safeguard coherence with other programmes, such as CARDS, and apply a uniform procedure here, in cooperation with UNMIK.
Because we have to understand that one of the main problems in this region is due to the fact that numerous groups are trying - with a great deal of commitment - to provide help, but with very little coordination.
It is an age-old problem which Parliament deplores and which the Commission itself deplores.
That is why, despite all this commitment, many of them are still failing to achieve the positive results which we consider necessary.
Because, if too little progress has been made in Kosovo so far, this also has to do with the fact that Macedonia is being destabilised from within Kosovo, with all that this implies.
Commissioner, we also think that a correlation needs to be established with other donors and how much rapid financial assistance they are willing to provide.
We expressly adopted a proposed amendment in committee which does not attach any conditions to services by other donors, but the correlation needs to be established, so that the European Union is not left standing alone in the front row here and other donors honour their promises accordingly.
The point of this programme is to build up a reasonable administration, to build up a reasonable infrastructure and to build up reasonable, self-perpetuating economic growth, thereby creating the conditions needed to bring about lasting stability and peaceful coexistence between people and ethnic groups.
That is why we look on this assistance as an offer to the people there.
But now the people must show willing and understand that the circle of violence has to be broken.
As Mr Lechner and I specifically discussed today, this political correlation needs to be clearly discussed here.
That is why, Commissioner, I should like once again to stress that we do not want to be a hindrance when it comes to approving funds quickly and that we need to make a joint effort to ensure that these funds are used sensibly and are not wasted and that urgent objectives are in fact achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Brok, I agree with Mr Brok's report and I fully subscribe to the content behind the form.
We need and we want to give money and we want to give it quickly.
We are more than prepared to do so but certain framework conditions have to be complied with.
One thing is for sure and that is that we demand that the majority in Kosovo give the present minority, i.e. the Serbs, Romas, Sinti, Bosnians etc. a chance to develop and live a proper life in this country.
This will be a particularly decisive question when elections are held in autumn.
How representative will these elections be?
I am delighted that elections are being held, but how representative will they be if not everyone in the country can take part or those who do later flee?
Secondly: another decisive point - as Mr Brok mentioned - is that we expect the Albanian majority in Kosovo to distance itself from all the small groups - not the Albanians per se in Macedonia, but the small groups, the KLA or quasi-KLA organisations up to no good in Macedonia. This is absolutely essential because Macedonia has a democracy, unlike in former Yugoslavia, where it is understandable up to a point when people take up arms in order to defend themselves against terrorism and repression.
But Macedonia has a democracy, democratic potential, and the European Union in particular will help the Albanian minority, which is a large minority in Macedonia, to develop.
But we expect the Albanian majority in Kosovo, with all due respect for the justified claims of their brothers and sisters in Macedonia, to distance themselves from terrorism.
Thirdly: I think that, as far as economic questions are concerned, it is important for Kosovo to develop its own economic resources over the course of time.
I refer in particular to the question of the mines in Trebca.
I know that mines are not necessarily a modern economy's first choice nowadays, but I think that every avenue needs to be explored - even if the conditions of ownership have not been completely clarified - so that they can develop their own resources.
A problem arises in this context and I am delighted that Commissioner Solbes Mira is here and I can specifically ask him.
The problem which arises concerns the changeover to the euro.
What will happen to the de facto currency in Kosovo and in other areas of the Balkans, but especially in Kosovo? I refer to the Deutschmark.
I read in a report recently that this will cause huge problems and I should like to ask you Commissioner if the Commission has thought about this or made any announcements on this?
Will the Commission address this and, if so, when, so that some form of solution can be found to this question, which is fundamental to the development of Kosovo?
First of all, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Brok for his report and to Parliament for its swift reaction to the Commission' s request and for speeding up the procedures that I hope will enable us to reach a favourable agreement on this issue.
I feel that it is essential to point out that we are not talking here today about part of the action used by the CART programmes and therefore, we are not talking about Kosovo aid projects as part of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
We are talking about macroeconomic aid to Kosovo, which is a different type of measure.
We are talking simply about budget aid for the United Nations administration in the area.
As a result, some of the problems that you have put forward in your proposals, as we will see later, should, in our opinion, be interpreted differently.
The Community made a contribution of this type in 2000, amounting to EUR 35 million, and the proposal that we adopted in March of this year involves EUR 30 million, which will be allocated to the Kosovo budget in two parts, in order to start up or rather to maintain the operation of UNMIK in the area.
Of course we are responsible for the fourth pillar, and this also means paying particular attention to some of the essential changes to the economic system that are currently being made.
We are not talking about our aid, but about elements associated with the introduction of a market economy.
We have made a great deal of progress, for example, in establishing a banking and payment system, in developing the private sector and in aspects of taxation, including obviously all aspects of public spending.
We are talking about an exceptional type of aid, which is not dedicated to specific projects and is not linked to any other type of commitment.
In this respect it is radically different from the CART aid, which is why it needs a different legal basis, as we explain in our proposal.
With this aid, as in the past, we are going to fund the current expenditure of Kosovo' s budget, and we are talking about salaries for judges, teachers, doctors, the sale, or rather support of public utilities, and, in short, about the basic costs of running the country.
It is true that there is some investment expenditure associated with public companies, but we are mainly talking about current expenditure.
Of course, in answer to some of Mr Brok' s questions, first of all a system should be put in place to enable Kosovo to gradually take on its own financial costs.
We agree with this idea and our medium-term objective is for the Kosovo budget to be able to fund itself.
Last year, the funding was 50-50.
Our aim is that progress should continue to be made and we hope that in 2001, 75% of the total budget will be covered by own funds.
Another of your concerns was to know what is happening with the other donors.
There is a reasonable amount of burden-sharing between the donors.
For the 2001 budget there are other donors who are going to contribute, namely the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Turkey, Canada and the World Bank, to a total of EUR 43 million. Out of these EUR 43 million, EUR 31 million have already been paid out, which is clearly positive and enables us to be reasonably satisfied about the problem of equal distribution of the burden.
Of course we are not considering an additional budgetary allocation.
There are resources to carry out this funding with the proportion of the macroeconomic aid included in budgetary heading B7-548 related to the Balkans.
I would also like to stress that, when we implement this assistance, we not only insist on establishing a stable economic framework, but also on policies being created that are aimed at achieving economic stability.
Along with the other donors we are continuing with the necessary commitments in order to pay out these amounts, as the Kosovo authorities have to comply with the obligations and commitments made.
With regard to the amendments that have been put forward, I would like to make a few comments that could help the debate.
First of all, we can quite readily accept some of the amendments.
I am referring to Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6 and 9.
We feel that there are other amendments that are not justified, not because we disagree with them in principle, but because they are not necessary: for example, Amendments Nos 4 and 5, which refer to the distribution of the burden.
This is clearly covered in Recital 9, which says that "the provision of external budgetary support, fairly shared among donors, is essential to help cover the residual financing needs ".
Nor do we consider Amendment No 10 to be necessary, because it states that the aid must clearly focus on the budget.
The aid is purely budgetary, and it is not therefore necessary to highlight a point that we feel should be taken for granted.
There is a series of amendments which, in my opinion, are mistaken in their understanding of the nature of macroeconomic aid: these are Amendments Nos 2, 8 and 13, which refer to linking this type of macroeconomic aid with the CART programme, and they therefore ask for the same conditions as for the CART projects.
However, we are not talking about CART, but about something completely different.
This is not one of my colleague Chris Patten' s responsibilities. I myself have direct sole and exclusive responsibility for the budget within the area of macroeconomic aid.
Therefore, we think that these amendments should not be included, because they would cause some confusion.
There is a series of amendments regarding deadlines, procedures and monitoring, in particular Amendments Nos 7, 11 and 14.
I would like to comment on each of them.
A problem about which Mr Brok is particularly concerned is that of information.
Obviously we are prepared to provide all the necessary information.
The problem arises if this information has to be drawn up in the context of other aid, in accordance with the progress of the reform.
We are currently providing information on macroeconomic aid and we are prepared to do so and include this aid with other macroeconomic aid, providing all the necessary information so that Parliament can effectively carry out its monitoring work.
Amendment No 11 considers the possibility of creating a group within the Council, of a political nature, to undertake consultations on the implementation of this aid.
I stress this again, we are talking about a different type of aid, and we think that the systems already in place for macroeconomic aid should be applied, and not systems for other types of measure.
With regard to the problem indicated in Amendment No 14, the need for the conditions of economic policy to be fulfilled and for a link to be established with Amendment No 4 and for the funds to be used for this type of aid, we do not think that this corresponds to the nature of this measure.
We are talking here about assistance, as I was saying, for UNMIK' s budget, with very specific objectives.
It is true that we should also use these objectives in order to improve the economic situation and the market economy in Kosovo, but there are not conditions as with other types of aid.
I would like to make a comment on two other amendments that I think are of interest: Amendment No 12 asks for two things.
Firstly, for the aid to be implemented within a maximum of six weeks.
We can undertake to implement it as soon as possible. We think that to aim to pay out the assistance in the middle of August, at a time when we all know the difficulties with budgetary procedures, is at best a risky idea.
For this reason we do not think that this request is correct.
With regard to the possibility of passing on the memorandum of understanding that is made between UNMIK and the Commission, I must point out that this memorandum contains some sensitive information and therefore we think that a more efficient system is for this information to be given to the chairmen of the various committees, but under no circumstances for the memorandum of understanding to be sent out.
Lastly, the Commission could accept Amendment No 14 if it were worded differently.
That is, if the report were presented in September of the previous year, as these reports are prepared for June and if we could provide the information by September, but not before.
The Commission accepts the spirit of the request, but we think that its wording needs to be improved in order to prevent practical problems.
A final comment on Mr Swoboda' s question on the use of the euro in the Kosovo area.
I would remind you that, as you know, this was a unilateral decision taken by the Kosovo authorities.
The German Central Bank is perfectly aware of this information and of this situation, and the Kosovo bank and payment authority, the German Central Bank and the Austrian Central Bank are currently in contact in order to seek a solution to the problem.
I can therefore inform you that these talks are now taking place and I hope that they will achieve a favourable result so that the change will pose as few problems as possible.
The Commission is following this matter with the greatest interest, although it is more directly the responsibility of the European Central Bank and the national central banks than of the Commission.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, I would like to return to a matter which I am recorded as having raised in yesterday's minutes.
Question Time to the Commission yesterday was truncated to a single hour, during which only five questions were answered.
One of the most important aspects of the structure of the Union is the real accountability of Commissioners before this Parliament, which must relate to questions of relative detail that can be raised at Question Time, not just to issues of general policy.
It will be disastrous for the Union if we carry on this practice of truncating Question Time and having very few questions dealt with properly.
One possibility suggested to me is that we might at least contemplate having a weekly Question Time in Brussels, as well as in Strasbourg, so as to provide for thorough questioning of the Commission on points which our constituents wish us to raise with them.
I am glad to see Mr Provan here today, because this kind of question falls within his remit as a Member of Parliament's Bureau.
I put it to Members that it is vital that we question the Commission effectively.
We are not doing this at the moment.
We are taking note of your comment and it will be duly considered.
Mr Andrews has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I refer to an administrative change that has been made in Parliament, which comes to me as news.
Apparently, a contract has been signed by a new travel agency to replace Wagonlit.
Since I came to this House in 1984, Wagonlit has provided an excellent service.
Now we have a new travel agency coming in to takeover, maybe to save the Community a few pounds.
Travel for Members of this House is difficult enough without bringing in new agencies, without consulting Members.
Some of the best travel agents who have served the Members of this House are going to leave.
There should be more consultation when administrative changes of this kind are made.
I think it is not a Parliament decision but a Commission decision.
It is yet another undermining of the services to which Members are entitled.
I hope the President will inform us of the reasons for the allocation of these contracts and the savings made.
I have absolutely no interest other than the convenience of Members.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We are taking note of your concern and the Bureau of Parliament will consider the matter.
Mr Fitzsimons has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on another point of order in relation to the Minutes.
Much of the debate here yesterday focused on the Irish people's decision in relation to the Nice Treaty.
I merely wish to say on this point of order that the Irish people took a democratic decision that we all accept.
The Irish people believe in the European Union and in enlargement, and will deal with these issues in its own time and in its own way.
My real point of order is this: I strongly deplore the fact that, while Mr Le Pen was speaking in this Chamber, the French National Front waved the Irish flag beside him.
I can assure the Members of this House that in doing so, the French National Front was abusing the Irish flag and everything it stands for.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Like Mr Andrews, I, too, feel a great deal of concern at the way this matter of the travel office has been handled.
I am not sure that the administration has actually raised it with the College of Quaestors, which would be the correct body to refer the matter to.
It is really for them to look after Members' interests.
As far as Mr MacCormick is concerned, I am glad to see Mr Corbett sitting here because it is the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that is now looking at this matter, after the Bureau decided to refer it to them.
I think he has the matter well in hand.
Mr President, I would like to raise two different points.
First of all, I would like to point out that, with regard to the very legitimate question about the lack of time for Question Time, we cannot reduce the length of the Strasbourg sessions and then worry about the lack of time we have in which to deal with problems and propose to finish things off by overloading the Brussels agenda.
The terms of the Treaty make it quite clear. The Brussels sessions are intended to complement the Strasbourg sessions and we cannot, therefore, make them more intense, when we are not fully using the time that we have at the part-sessions.
This must be reiterated, otherwise we really do face the prospect of having sessions that are utterly disorganised.
Mr President, I have a second brief comment - completely unrelated to the first - which is to do with the Minutes that you approved with your customary diligence and your usual skill.
I would simply like to say, and I think that this can be added, as I made this comment earlier, that I abstained from voting on the resolution on Gothenburg - I did not vote in favour.
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
The correction that you have pointed out to us will be made.
Mrs Klamt has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I wish to raise a point about yet another problem with the travel office in Strasbourg.
The administration of the European Parliament stipulates in the contract that only vehicles without taxi signs may be used.
This appears to contravene French legislation.
The French Ministry of the Interior stated in a letter back in 1998 that special rules apply in Strasbourg.
For about the last two months, drivers working for the European Parliament have been repeatedly stopped and checked by the police, as was the case on Monday at Strasbourg Airport, while Members of Parliament were sitting on the plane.
If we demand that they get an additional vehicle for the travel office just for the week of the part-session - which is now only four days long - then it would seem to me that we have overstepped the mark and are guilty of harassment.
I should therefore like to urge you, Mr President, to make representations to the French Ministry of the Interior on the need for a permanent, practicable regulation for the drivers.
If, in addition to poor flight connections to and from Strasbourg, further restrictions are imposed on Members via the travel office, Strasbourg will become an even less attractive location.
Thank you, Mrs Klamt.
We will deal with the matter.
Mr Corbett has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, what Mr Bourlanges said just now about the lack of time in Strasbourg is somewhat exaggerated.
If you look at yesterday's minutes, you will see that under Item 5 it says that 'the sitting was suspended at 11.30 awaiting voting time and resumed at 12.00'.
So we had half an hour to spare.
That time could have been used more profitably in this plenary session.
Hence it is totally incorrect to state that the problem with Question Time to the Commission stemmed from our not having sufficient time because we no longer sit on Fridays.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
Structural measures
Mr President, the two reports that I am presenting affect seven regulations, the reform of which we are debating, and which refer to the outermost regions of the European Union, that is, Guadeloupe, Martinique, RÃ©union and Guyana, part of France, the Azores and Madeira, part of Portugal; and the Canary Islands, part of Spain.
Distance, internal dispersion and climate have been significant obstacles to their development.
Distance and transport costs for imports and exports, and the small size of these territories have prevented them from attracting and benefiting from significant investment.
Declaring its duty of Community solidarity in responding to the needs of these outermost regions, between 1989 and 1991 the European Community adopted some other action programmes due to their remote and island nature, called the POSEIs.
The aim was to promote sustainable development and strengthen job-creating production sectors.
This was done using the Structural Funds and by favourably adjusting common policies, particularly the CAP.
Special aid was thus established for particular local products and the supply of raw materials was improved through specific supply arrangements included in the respective POSEIs.
The favourable measures established by the Community have been combined with very significant efforts on the part of the Member States directly concerned: France, Portugal and Spain, and by the regional and local administrations.
Considerable progress has therefore been made, but despite this, there are still inadequacies, which is why we need to maintain the measures, even improving the mechanisms to seek even more positive results.
In any case, in order to continue to make progress in integrating these regions into the European area and in order to deal with phenomena that have appeared recently with the growing process of globalisation, we need to have a sounder legal basis and strengthen the regulations that have been operating up until now.
We have been working on this for months, also relying on the fact that in Amsterdam, the recognition of the specific nature of the outermost regions and the commitment to support them in order to overcome their problems was introduced into the Treaties in Article 299.
The reform plan that was presented to us was moving in the right direction, but it fell short in its proposals.
For example, it did not propose the essential change to the legal basis in order to refer to the new text of the Treaties that I have just mentioned, but it was certainly a good starting point for our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to work on.
The committee had better cooperation from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the latter in order to bring about the change in the legal basis.
We also listened to the authorities and social sectors of the territories that we are dealing with and we thus arrived at a series of amendments that were debated and adopted in the committee proceedings.
As well as the amendment on updating the legal basis, there are amendments that respond to joint demands from the different regions and others that are specific to each of them.
Among the joint ones it is worth mentioning the possibility of these regions being able to export products produced with raw materials introduced to the islands under the SSAs with rights to refunds, the need to increase support for the livestock breeding sector and to boost agricultural and food SMEs.
The amendments on specific sensitive products from each region concern tomatoes in the Canary Islands, livestock, milk products and the sugar industry in the Azores and the wicker industry in Madeira, and support for rice in some of the French territories.
With these amendments we are expressing our will to overcome once and for all the problems of our outermost regions.
They are not about subsidising economic and social backwardness in these territories, but about acting decisively to permanently overcome this backwardness and thus to offer those who live there living conditions and prospects for the future that are comparable to those of the rest of the citizens of the European Union.
Besides, the costs of the improvements that we are proposing are certainly insignificant in the context of the budgetary proportions that the Union deals with.
I will finish by thanking the officials of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their dedication and professional attitude, and also by expressing my thanks to the Commission and the Council, who have supported us by showing interest and understanding.
If, as I hope, Parliament adopts what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is submitting for its opinion, it will be the Council of the Union that will have the responsibility of not disappointing our expectations, which are in fact those of the people of the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Martinique, Guadeloupe, RÃ©union and Guyana.
Please bear in mind that it is in measures such as this that the confidence of citizens in the activity of the European Union is at stake, as is, in short, the credibility of our project.
Mr President, my report also relates to the implementation in the fisheries sector of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which concerns the EU' s ultra peripheral regions.
The Treaty acknowledged the specific nature of these regions, and also defined them according to both their handicaps and the difficulties they face, which are due to their remoteness, their insularity, often because of their difficult topography and climate, and even occasionally their economic dependence.
Since the Treaty was signed, it has enabled the policies affected to be legitimately adjusted whilst safeguarding the coherence of the Community legal system.
In the fisheries sector, three Member States are affected; Spain, Portugal and France.
Seven regions are also affected and these are the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and RÃ©union.
Many special measures are therefore permitted, namely, the Structural Funds, for both fishing and regional policy.
This adjustment has, of course, been approved in the report that I am presenting. Some amendments have also been tabled, which I would like to take you through briefly.
I tabled one in particular, which was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries.
This is Amendment No 5, which concerns the FIFG intervention level, the financial instrument, in the ultra peripheral regions, which is very important for those involved, in other words, the fishermen.
The Commission is proposing to increase the Community contribution for these regions, which is a positive step, up to a maximum of 85%, with the exception of fleet renewal and modernisation of fishing vessels and pilot projects, where the contributions remain exactly the same as in the previous regulation and are therefore unchanged.
My amendment and the amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries are therefore based on this 'exception' .
Basing its argument on the current state of stocks and the need to protect them, as well as the obligation to maintain equivalent fleet capacity, the Commission is proposing that neither should the rate of Community assistance be raised nor the rate of private self-financing reduced for fleet renewal and modernisation.
This position does not appear to point in the right direction and does not fulfil the Treaty objectives designed to help the economies of the ultra peripheral regions catch up with the remainder of the EU.
We should, therefore, and this is what is being proposed to you, adjust the rates in Group 2.
This would have a positive impact on the development of inshore fishing and the improved processing of catches and would also meet the expectations of those working in the sector.
Moreover, even though there may be over-capacity in more central areas, this is not the case in all the ultra peripheral regions, or at any rate, it is much less certain.
Lastly, Parliament has stressed the need to improve safety on board vessels. Vessel renewal and modernisation in the ultra peripheral regions is a key element in providing fishermen with proper working conditions.
This amendment proposes, therefore, to increase the A rate or the proportion of the European Union to 50% and the C rate or the proportion of other national or regional contributions to 40%.
In my view, this amendment to the report is essential.
There is a second amendment, Amendment No 6 by Mrs McKenna, which does not present any problems.
It states in the report that these adjustments and changes must not be used to maintain the system of flags of convenience; we must, therefore, include a sentence in this report which refers to some kind of legal precautionary principle in this matter.
Lastly, there are Amendments Nos 7 and 8, which raise the issue of non-retroactivity.
This issue was raised at the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries.
The Commission was, moreover, not very specific, and was even hesitant, not to mention the fact that it did not provide an answer in its reply.
The amendment is still on the agenda, since it was re-tabled.
The opinions of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are positive.
At the beginning, the Committee on Fisheries did not deliver a favourable opinion, at least not wholly favourable, and took the view that this principle of non-retroactivity was a fundamental principle of Community legislation.
Given that the two other committees delivered a favourable opinion, however, and that the European Commission was not very specific, I propose to deliver a favourable opinion.
If this turns out to be absolutely impossible from a legal perspective, the law will settle the affair.
If it is possible, we must do so, and if we do, we will have voted in favour of a very good cause.
Mr President, as I think that you all already know, the negotiations to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco came to an end without that renewal having taken place.
You will also be aware that the negotiations went on for an extraordinarily long time, 15 months, which placed the Community fleet in a truly unprecedented position, stopping activity for a period that had not been foreseen by Community legislation.
Article 16 of the FIFG Regulation, in letter b) of Paragraph 1, allows the temporary inactivity of vessels to be funded if a fisheries agreement is not renewed for 6 months, which may be extended for 6 more months, following the presentation of a conversion plan.
This period and the extension period ended on 31 December, while we were still in the middle of negotiations with Morocco.
The Commission realised then that shipowners and crews could not be left unprotected while the negotiations continued, which is why the proposal for a Regulation that is being voted on today was presented in order to change the legal basis of the FIFG Regulation with two objectives: on the one hand, enabling the aid to be extended for 6 more months, until 30 June, and on the other hand, authorising the Member States concerned to exceed the threshold of 4% of the FIFG budget that they may use for aid due to the inactivity of the fleet. The period had, obviously due to the extraordinary nature of the situation, had already been long exceeded.
It was therefore a totally reasonable proposal.
However, when the report that we are debating was practically finished, the Council of Ministers in April considered the negotiations to be completed, and in May the Commission had still not presented its proposal for measures that would consider the conversion plan.
We know that the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Regulation in this respect at the next Council of Fisheries Ministers on 18 June, but for technical reasons it will not be able to be adopted until 3 July, which will cause a considerable delay in the timetable, given that consultation by the European Parliament is also provided for.
The shipowners will also have to be able to closely consider the options available to them, according to the type of vessel that they have, as choosing between scrapping their vessel, locating it in another fishing ground or forming a joint venture with a foreign partner are business decisions that cannot be taken lightly.
On the other hand, the workers concerned will probably have to wait even longer, as they will be dependent on the decisions of their companies in order to know, for example, whether they are going to leave a fishing ground in order to fish in another or if they are simply going to be unemployed, in which case the formula chosen will be scrapping.
It is obvious that these decisions cannot be taken before 30 June, when the formulae that will ultimately be offered to them are still not known now.
Therefore, before this report was voted on in committee, I introduced an amendment to change the dates of the Commission proposal and put them back from 30 June to 31 December.
The Committee on Fisheries understood the situation perfectly and, also taking into account that extending the period does not carry financial consequences for the Community budget, as the aid will continue to come from the FIFG of the Member States concerned, it decided to unanimously support the amended content of the report.
I therefore hope that in the light of the reasons that I have given and following the unquestionable support of the Committee on Fisheries, this plenary will be able to also adopt the text that is being voted on today.
Meanwhile, I would not like to finish without being able to congratulate the two rapporteurs and especially, from my point of view, for the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Poignant, and I assure him that our group will support his report. I would like to highlight Amendment No 5 to that report, because I think that it fits in much better with Article 29, Paragraph 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, which allows a maximum contribution of 50% to SMEs in the outermost regions.
We should not forget that measures to modernise vessels tend to be what makes the difference between a competitive business and a business in difficulties, as well as ensuring that its workers have a more decent employment.
Precisely for this reason, they should be the last public investments that should disappear or stop being well provided for financially.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and also on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would like to point out that the consultation that has been made in the European Parliament on the individual application of Community provisions in various areas to the outermost regions of the European Union, such as the agricultural measures of the POSEI and the structural measures in agriculture and fisheries, fulfils the procedure laid down in the legal basis that is in Article 299, Paragraph 2 that was mentioned of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, modified in Amsterdam.
Secondly, I would like to point out once again that the majority of the outermost regions, which include the group of islands from which I come, the Canary Islands, are islands and are remote from the Community area and from sources of supply to the international markets of essential products for consumption and processing.
I would also like to say that, from a political point of view, these proposals, although they come late, come at an interesting time, due to the new context in which we find ourselves as part of globalisation, expansion and new agricultural agreements with third countries.
They recognise positive aspects, such as regional diversity and the individual socio-economic and geographical characteristics of the outermost regions.
They aim to fulfil the objective of economic and social cohesion, they are balanced for each and every one of the regions affected and implicitly recognise the rights of the citizens of the European Union within the financial neutrality recommended by the Commission.
In some cases we have incorporated significant changes, such as the inclusion of Canarian tomatoes in the assistance under the agricultural POSEICAN programme, and the review of some products initially included in the SSA (Specific Supply Arrangements), and improvements in aid for the agricultural and livestock sectors of the French Overseas Departments, Madeira and the Azores.
All these things are aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the outermost regions, their businesses and employment, and at respect for the environment and recognising the strategic nature of the agricultural sector.
And most importantly, at European integration, so that from now on we will be able to talk about the remote dimension of the European Union.
For these reasons we congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, in particular Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez for his receptiveness, and we ask the Members and all the parliamentary groups to support these reports.
It will undoubtedly bring about a greater sense of European integration for the citizens concerned, and in our case, when we go back to the Islands we will be able to say 'mission accomplished.'
Finally, I must thank the authorities of the regional governments and of the Member States concerned: France, Spain and Portugal, as well as the Commission and the Swedish Presidency, for their interest in moving forward this package of regulations for the outermost regions, which are an example of solidarity between the peoples of the European Union.
I would also like to say on a personal level that I will not vote on the regulations referred to in Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez' s report that affect the Canary Islands, as I have agricultural interests on the Islands.
Mr President, Commissioner, I support the reports by Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez and I consider it essential that the Council should accept the proposals made in them.
I shall remind you of some aspects of the opinion approved in the Committee on Budgets:
1 - The revision of the POSEI programmes must comply with the Community' s pledges to increase support to the outermost regions;
2 - As the Commission proposals are based on the principle of budgetary neutrality, they reduce the spending level for the programmes in comparison with the early 1990s, when they were launched, which is unacceptable;
3 - The current revision must not threaten the livelihood of farmers operating under existing regulations.
Community support must be strengthened and not reduced;
4 - New agri-environmental measures and measures for the development and adaptation of rural areas must be launched, and, lastly, the Commission should present new proposals if any of the measures prove to be insufficient or expire before 2006.
Mr President, the extension of the specific programmes of support for agriculture in the outermost regions is a measure of basic need.
Distant as they are from the major markets, their normally small-scale agriculture is a mainstay of their economies and would be unable to survive without support in an increasingly globalised market.
The Commission proposal, however, errs on the side of meagreness, confining itself most of the time to prolonging the status quo, without addressing new market trends and the increasing difficulty for these regions to compete on international markets ever since the World Trade Organisation agreement was signed in 1999.
Despite this situation and the insufficiency of the Commission proposal, I should like to lay great emphasis on the role played by the rapporteur, Mr Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, who managed to work with all those involved in an atmosphere in which good dialogue could lead to compromise solutions, with a result that clearly improves on the Commission proposal.
In this context I should like to highlight some of the changes taken up by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development concerning the regions that I know best, the Azores and Madeira. For instance: the eligibility of traditional varieties for the purposes of vineyard restructuring, including premiums for the grubbing-up of those varieties; maintenance of the supplement to the special premium for the fattening of bovine animals, so as to encourage farmers who have no more milk quota to change over to beef and ensure that the added value of fattening does not leave the region in the form of very young cattle for export; the flexibility of granting aid for the marketing of plants and flowers without the need to draw up annual contracts with producers' organisations, which would be impossible in view of the inadequate organisation of agriculture in these regions; the extension of aid to the marketing of potatoes for human consumption; the increase in production rights and premiums for strategic productions, such as suckler cows, bovine animals for fattening, or sugar beet; improvement of the special supply arrangement with the inclusion of certain raw materials essential for the competitiveness of the compound feedingstuff production sector and consequently for the livestock sector.
In conclusion, Parliament has done its job, having made a real effort to hold a dialogue both among Members themselves and between Members and those politically responsible for the outermost regions of the European Union.
We now hope that the Council will also do its job by accepting the measures approved by the Committee on Agriculture and this Parliament.
In accordance with this analysis, the European People' s Party will vote in favour of this proposal, and I should like once again on behalf of my group to express our deepest thanks to the rapporteur for the great diligence and openness with which he drew up this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the outermost regions were fully acknowledged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are still awaiting the first far-reaching measures.
This is why I welcome today' s debate and the structural and agricultural packages proposed by the Commission, because they undeniably seek to take better account of the realities of the overseas territories.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs and particularly Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez and Mr Poignant on their excellent work.
Overall, the Commission' s proposals can be considered as a step in the right direction and they are a satisfactory response to local needs.
First of all, on the structural measures, we can only welcome the alignment of intervention levels to 85% for all outermost regions.
In practice, this means that we are giving the same opportunities to people who have to deal with basically identical constraints.
On the agricultural measures, since I am from RÃ©union, I welcome the measures to assist traditional farming and, in particular, transport aid for sugar cane, which our farmers have long been waiting for.
I have a few comments, however, to make with regard to some of the points.
First of all, I deplore the fact that the retroactivity of the measures has not been explicitly worded and I welcome the fact that many of Parliament' s amendments forcefully emphasise the importance of this point for all types of farming, as we must think of the thousands of farmers who are waiting for these measures.
Next, I am sorry that the Commission did not automatically retain Article 299(2) as a legal basis, which, in my view, runs absolutely counter to the spirit advocated by the Heads of State and Government.
I therefore welcome the fact that this omission was partially restored by the Council, because by limiting the scope of this article, we are undermining the very concept of what outermost regions are.
Lastly, I would like to end with a wish.
I would like the reforms that have been proposed here to lay solid foundations for an even more ambitious policy for our regions, so that equal opportunities and the acceptance of differences become a reality for all the citizens of the European Union.
Mr President, I wish to speak on the Poignant report.
In committee we tabled an amendment on the increasing problem of fishing vessels flying flags of convenience, which was very narrowly defeated.
More and more unscrupulous shipowners are transferring their vessels to countries such as Belize, Honduras or St Vincent and the Grenadines.
They know perfectly well that these countries will turn a blind eye to whatever these ships do: how they fish and what they catch.
Commissioner Fischler has quite rightly referred to this problem as the 'scourge of the oceans'.
At present, there is nothing to prevent a European shipowner from exporting his ship to one of these countries, receiving a very healthy subsidy of EUR 1 million or more and still keeping his ship.
We introduced an amendment to try and close this huge loophole, using criteria adopted by international fisheries management organisations.
I am glad to hear that the rapporteur supports our amendment, because it is scandalous that this loophole still exists.
I do not see how anyone in this House could actually support the use of EU funds - EU taxpayers' money, that is - to allow shipowners to escape controls and then fish in competition with law-abiding shipowners.
I urge everyone here today to support this amendment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the difficulties specific to the outermost regions are well known: distance, fragmentation and small markets, all of which raise costs, especially transport costs, and hinder their development.
Now, based on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recognises the specific character of these regions and the need to adopt appropriate Community measures, it is possible to take measures aimed at encouraging sustainable development and enhancing the productive sectors that generate employment.
It is therefore important to use this legal base, regardless of any reference to articles of the CAP, the Structural Funds or other Community policies.
This is the context in which we must analyse the Commission' s proposals, which may be positive but fall far short of the needs of these outermost regions, as I have been able to confirm directly with bodies in Madeira and the Azores.
Hence the importance of the work done by the rapporteur, Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, whom I congratulate on the report he has drawn up.
In general, the report responds to the questions that the Commission has not addressed sufficiently but which are important for those regions.
With regard to the first package of proposals, which aims at revision in the sense of increasing the rates of assistance under the Structural Funds, it is important to make a greater effort by slightly increasing the Community co-funding percentages, particularly as regards agri-environmental measures and public aid to the productive sector, given that these regions are among the poorest in the European Union and their production, processing and marketing structures need to be strengthened.
In relation to the second package of proposals, which aims at reviewing the machinery for aid to agricultural production in these regions, so that support for agriculture may have a positive effect on farmers' incomes and on lower prices for the consumer, the almost one hundred proposals contained in the report are important. Those that deserve special mention, for their importance to the Portuguese outermost regions of the Azores and Madeira, are the need to strengthen the specific support for the restructuring of vineyards and vine growing, potato production and marketing, the livestock sector, not forgetting the matter of milk quotas, and the measures for ensuring the viability of sugar refining in the Azores, as well as increased support for tea, in addition to specific changes for Madeira wines and support for wicker production.
I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will accept the proposals contained in the reports being debated jointly, also including the area of fisheries.
Mr President, the peripheral regions of the European Union are in a vulnerable situation.
After the collapse of negotiations with Morocco, which behaved in an incomprehensible way, it looks as if a portion of the fishing fleet will have to be rationalised.
In its Green Paper, the Commission announced that approximately forty per cent of the European fishing fleet will have to be scrapped if we still want to catch fish in European waters in ten to twenty years' time.
Rapporteur Poignant opposes the notion that peripheral regions should also give up fleet capacity.
Although I can fully understand his concern for the working population, such concern is short-sighted.
In the future we cannot continue supplementing poor catches with contributions from the Structural Fund.
One way or another fleet capacity must be reduced.
As regards that reduction of the fleet I should like suggest an idea to Mr Poignant : that is, days at sea.
