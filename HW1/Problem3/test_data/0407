Questions to Commissioner Bolkestein
Question No 30 by (H-0707/01):
Subject: Community trade mark courts When is action going to be taken against Member States which have not set up courts and tribunals to deal with matters relating to the Community trade mark?
Mr President, since the honourable Member, Mr Berenguer Fuster, raised a similar question last December, the Commission has addressed a letter of formal notice to Spain, France, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece in which it recalled the need to fulfil obligations regarding the designation of Community Trade mark courts.
The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the relevant regulation, which designates the courts of justice for Community Trade marks, was approved in September.
France has stated that a decree on this matter will be approved before 31 October 2001.
The Commission services are currently checking this information.
As regards the three remaining Member States, Spain, Luxembourg and Italy, the Commission does not yet have any information proving that these Member States have adopted the necessary provisions.
The Commission is, therefore, considering launching infringement proceedings for failure to comply with Community law according to Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
Thank you for your information, Commissioner.
I am obviously referring to the case of Spain, since I clearly do not have sufficient knowledge of the cases of Italy and Luxembourg.
On 13 December 2000 the Commissioner responded to me in saying that, in the case where there was no satisfactory response, the Commission would open an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.
Today you have told us that the Commission has no news of these three countries including Spain which, to make matters worse, is the location of the headquarters of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, having begun any procedure to create what they committed themselves to, and that they have been non-compliant since November 1996.
If this is the case, if it was already taking place a year ago, if there has been no satisfactory response for almost a year, why is the Commission waiting to begin the infringement procedure?
I can well imagine the impatience, or shall I say irritation, of Mr Berenguer Fuster with the fact that the government of his country has not yet taken the desired steps in order to set up this court.
Indeed, it is true that this is an infringement.
May I point out that the Commission does not hesitate to pursue infringement proceedings, but only, as the Latin expression goes, as an ultimum remedium; in other words, only when all the avenues and possibilities of settling matters in an amicable way have been exhausted does the Commission take that step.
I take Mr Berenguer Fuster's point that his own patience, like that of the Commission, is close to being exhausted.
We shall indeed do what he proposes, and what the Commission is also intending to do.
Let us make a last effort to convince the Spanish government - particularly in view of the upcoming presidency, when it would not do if the Commission were to open such proceedings - to do so now before the Commission takes that ultimate step.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 31 and 32 will be taken together.
Question No 31 by (H-0728/01):
Subject: Letter of notification concerning implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece In reply to my question E-1336/01 on the recognition of diplomas under Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece, the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bolkestein, stated, among other things that 'A Commission decision on the matter is expected in the coming months, and in any case in autumn, following some supplementary details that may need to be checked with the Greek authorities.'
In fact, the press reported on 9 August 2001 that the Commission had sent a letter of notification to Greece which identified a problem with the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC into Greek law.
What are the legal arguments on which the Commission bases its view that the failure to recognise diplomas awarded by educational establishments of another Member State under 'franchise' agreements in Greece is contrary to the Community Directive, and on which points is the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece inconsistent with that Directive?
Has the Greek government answered the points set out in the letter of notification or are there any indications as to what its legal arguments might be?
Question No 32 by (H-0750/01):
Subject: Implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece The Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled against Greece for its failure to implement Community Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration.
Will the Commission say whether Greece has complied with the judgment of the Court and, if not, what steps it intends to take to bring Greek law into line with Community legislation?
Mr President, in reply to the Oral Question by Mr Alavanos, the letter of formal notice sent to Greece to which the honourable Member refers, concerns a recently initiated infringement procedure regarding the failure of Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to comply with Directive 89/48 in certain areas.
On the other hand, the procedure referred to in question E-1336/01 earlier more specifically concerns problems surrounding the misapplication of Directive 89/48 to the psychology profession.
The Commission considers that diplomas awarded in Greece by another Member State and the refranchising agreements do not relate to training provided from or by Greece, but to training provided from or by the other Member State, since the Greek establishment in which the training in question has been provided is merely an intermediary without any autonomy.
In other words, it is not the Greek establishment that awards diplomas, but rather the university in the other Member State, and consequently, if those diplomas relate to professional training within the meaning of Directive 89/48, they are covered by that Directive.
The purpose of the letter of formal notice is to obtain the Member State's observations on specific questions.
Greece has not yet replied to that letter of formal notice and, therefore, no firm grounds for infringement procedings have been established as yet.
Consequently, the Commission is not able to reply to that part of the question from the honourable Member.
Given the similarity of the subject matter, I shall now continue, if I may, by answering the question by Mr Hatzidakis.
In the judgment to which the honourable Member refers, the Court of Justice of the European Communities condemned Greece for its failure to communicate measures taken to implement Directive 89/48 - the Directive I referred to in my reply to the previous question.
The Commission thus initiated a new infringement procedure against Greece with a request for the fixing of penalty payments.
This second procedure was closed when Greece complied.
It complied with the Court's judgment by forwarding Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to the Commission.
As I pointed out in my reply to the previous Oral Question put by Mr Alavanos, the Commission considers that certain provisions of Directive 89/48 have not been implemented correctly.
The Commission has also received complaints from individuals who, even since the implementation of the directive, have not seen their rights respected.
The Commission has, therefore, initiated a new infringement procedure, this time for incorrect implementation and application of the directive, and the letter of formal notice to which I referred just now has been sent to Greece.
We expect to receive the observations of the Greek authorities very soon.
A specific procedure for recognition of the psychology profession is currently being introduced, and that profession, together with a number of others, has been the subject of specific implementing legislation on problems concerning the application of Directive 89/48 that have also been drawn to the Commission's attention in that context.
That is my reply to the question put by Mr Hatzidakis.
I should like to make a point of thanking the Commissioner for what was a very detailed reply, including from the technical point of view.
All that remains to be seen is what the government's response will be to the Commission's move.
As the Commissioner knows, I have raised this matter on numerous occasions, I should just like to inform him that the Minister of Education's public response is that I am asking the wrong questions of the wrong Commissioner and obtaining the wrong replies.
So now I am waiting to see what the Greek government's response will be.
However, my question to the Commissioner is this: why confine ourselves solely to the psychology profession and, more to the point, to psychologists who have graduated from French universities when numerous complaints have been lodged with the Commission by other disciplines and by students studying in other faculties and graduating from foreign universities, even though they have taken part of their course in Greece?
I can assure Mr Alavanos that the Commission has looked at this whole issue in the broadest possible sense and has not confined itself to the matter of psychologists.
The basic issue is the question of whether a degree awarded by another Member State, following a course of studies which takes place physically in Greece, is or is not assimilated to a similar degree issued in Greece itself following studies at a Greek university.
So it is the equivalence between a purely Greek degree and a degree awarded by a university of another Member State, but where the study has been undertaken at a Greek establishment.
That assimilation, that equality is the purpose of Directive 89/48, to which I have referred at various times this afternoon.
The Commission is taking that into consideration and has asked Greece to explain why that directive has not been transposed and applied accordingly.
The directive does not confine itself to psychologists and, to that extent, I can assure Mr Alavanos that his fears are unfounded.
Commissioner, as I am sure you are aware, the question at issue is not a question which just concerns a few citizens in Greece, it concerns thousands of graduates from European universities whom the Greek State sends abroad to study, because we have what to me is a crazy educational system, and then refuses to recognise their qualifications.
This question in fact concerns several thousand young people who are denied a career because of the mindset of the Greek State.
This being the case, I should like to say that I welcome your finding that the Court's judgment is not being applied properly and, because the Greek public is listening to what we have to say, to ask you: if the Greek government continues to take this view, what are the legal implications?
What will the Commission's next move be?
Just so that our citizens know where they stand.
I am very conscious of the fact that the number of young people involved is large.
I must confess I have not counted them, but if Mr Hatzidakis says that thousands of young people are affected, then I am certain he is right.
That underlines the importance of this issue.
Whether the educational system is absurd is a qualification I must leave for Mr Hatzidakis.
I am sure he has political friends in his country who can raise this matter in the national parliament of Greece. But we are in the European Parliament.
It is quite right that Mr Hatzidakis draws our attention to this untoward state of affairs and I thank him for his contribution to our debate.
As regards the legal instruments, as I said earlier in my reply to Mr Alavanos, the Commission will use all the legal instruments at its disposal.
The Commission has no particular desire to take Member States to court but if European law is not respected then it has no alternative.
Therefore I say to both Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Alavanos that, if the Greek government does not apply the rules correctly, as should be the case, the Commission will, in a well-considered and very deliberate manner, make use of the instruments it has and start legal proceedings.
Question No 33 by (H-0738/01):
Subject: Illegal car taxation in Finland In 1998 the Commission asked Finland to amend its system of car and motorcycle taxation.
Commission officials have admitted that Finland has in fact failed to remove the discrimination to any significant degree.
Most recently, in September 2001, Parliament' s Committee on Petitions received a petition signed by me and 17 000 of my compatriots, demanding an overhaul of the illegal tax regime.
Finland has been an EU Member since 1995; when will the Commission take action to force it to toe the line and start implementing single market rules as interpreted by the European Court of Justice?
Will the Commission take independent legal action, because waiting for new rulings by the Court of Justice will hardly bring any additional clarity especially after the recent ruling on Portugal (C-393/98)?
The tax on removal vehicles also hinders people' s freedom to move within the Community.
Will the Commission see to it that this illegality is remedied in the near future?
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
Mr President, my answer is as follows.
The Commission is currently considering initiating a procedure against Finland under Article 226 of the Treaty, which will supplement the one initiated in 1998.
This case will be dealt with at a Commission meeting in the near future.
The new procedure is also likely to cover problems in implementing Directive 83/183, which deals with the tax exemptions granted when people move house.
At the same time, Commission staff have written to all Member States, drawing their attention to the judgment by the Court of Justice to which Mr Vatanen' s question refers, namely the Gomez-Valente Judgment of 22 February 2001, and the Commission shares the honourable Member' s opinion that the judgment in question will have implications outside the context of the dispute in question, and will open up the way to second-hand vehicles being treated in a manner which is more in line with the requirements of the European internal market.
However, the Commission wishes to point out that the procedure intended to ensure that the above-mentioned judgment is complied with must remain independent of any other procedure which it has initiated or is intending to initiate.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your efforts.
I feel reassured to hear your answer and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission officials for their work.
Commission officials have admitted that Finland is blatantly violating Community and single-market rules.
The Finns are desperately waiting for those EU rights that they are entitled to and which they were promised.
Mr Commissioner, I hope you do not find this too heavy, but their hopes are lying on your shoulders.
We know we can count on you.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Vatanen for his very kind remarks.
I feel the weight of all those motorists in Finland on my shoulders - a very heavy load indeed.
One complicating factor is that this is an area which has not yet been harmonised in the European Union.
The Commission's legal basis for its actions is Article 90 of the Treaty on the one hand, which prohibits tax discrimination, and on the other hand two directives adopted in 1983.
Article 90 gives the Court of Justice the opportunity for abundant jurisprudence.
Since interpretations of the judgments of the Court are not always unanimous, it is time to create a synthesis of all the various interpretations in order to determine clearly our future action.
That need for a synthesis is one of the reasons that led me to include in the Commission's working programme for this year a communication on motor vehicle taxation.
It is my intention that this communication, which I hope will appear around the end of this year or the beginning of next year, will cover all the problems in connection with vehicle taxation and vehicle pricing, so that we can take a broader approach to them and settle the problem in Finland to which Mr Vatanen has referred.
I hope that will be to his satisfaction.
Thank you very much for your great cooperation with Parliament, Mr Bolkestein.
Question No 34 by Mrs Anne E.M. Van Lancker (H-0765/01) will not be replied to since it is included in the agenda of this part-session.
Question No 35 by (H-0695/01):
Subject: Law on the use of minority languages in Slovakia From an official position paper of the Foreign Ministry of the Slovak Republic, sent to us by the Slovak ambassador in Brussels, we understand that the law of 1999 on the use of minority languages in Slovakia gives minorities certain rights.
When 20% or more of the inhabitants of a village speak another language, they can receive official communications in their own language.
We have personal experience of how this law operates in practice.
In villages where more than 20% of the population is made up Slovaks, the inhabitants can receive all official communications in Slovakian.
The law thus appears to work satisfactorily.
However, when it transpires that in the same village 75% of the population is Hungarian and they can obtain official documents concerning births, marriages and deaths only in Slovakian and the mayor of the village may not speak Hungarian during public or official functions, then we must have serious doubts about the implementation of a language law which appears satisfactory on paper.
In connection with Slovakia's accession to the EU, is the Commission investigating whether the law is being implemented, how this is being done and what progress is being made?
Mr President, the Commission is paying very careful attention to the use of minority languages in Slovakia.
It takes the view that Slovakia has made considerable progress in developing a positive policy on minorities and in drawing up the necessary legislation whilst putting in place and supporting the relevant institutions.
The enacting of the law on the use of minority languages for official business was, in this regard, an important step.
It brought domestic law into line with current international standards and complied with the specific recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commission.
A further important step was the ratification of the European Charter on regional or minority languages.
It should be noted in particular that Slovakia desires to concede the greatest possible freedom to the Hungarian minority in accordance with the flexibility that the Charter makes possible.
The Commission nevertheless observes that considerable efforts are still required for the practical enforcement of all the existing legislation.
In some areas, minorities do not avail themselves of the rights guaranteed them by the law on the use of minority languages for official business, above all, it seems, through ignorance of them.
This seems to be the case above all in communities with a large proportion of Roma among the population.
The Commission will continue in future to urge Slovakia to continue its efforts to implement the provisions of its laws, improve policy in this area and make the necessary budget funds available.
The observations which you, Mrs Maes, have made in person come as no surprise to me.
They prove only that the difficulties with implementation, which I have described, continue to prevail.
We will be discussing this topic further in the next progress report on Slovakia, which is due to appear in November.
I think you are right, some sections of the population will not be fully aware of the existence of new legal provisions.
But we must still ask ourselves whether there is always the necessary goodwill present in order to allow citizens to translate the legal provisions into practice.
From that point of view, it would probably be useful if we did not only draw the attention to the very sensitive nature of the subject matter in the reports but also in the contacts with the Slovak authorities.
In our opinion, a verdict on the minority policy cannot be a verdict on what has been set down on paper.
It should also concern rights and facts.
I cannot but agree, Mrs Maes, with what you have said, and can confirm that we address this issue in all our contacts with the Slovak government.
I have, myself, done so repeatedly in conversations with the head of the Slovak government and with the Slovak parliament and press and also on public occasions in Slovakia.
The message we are communicating in Slovakia is that we see the way the numerically stronger Slovaks interact with their minorities as an indicator of how strongly democracy and the rule of law have developed in that country.
Question No 36 by , which has been taken over by Mr Miller (H-0714/01):
Subject: Ignalina nuclear power station, Lithuania What is the Commission's current position with regard to the closure of reactor two of the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania?
Mr President, Mr Miller, the Commission's view on this issue is at one with that of the Council and - in so far as I can judge - with that of the European Parliament.
The Lithuanian Parliament adopted a national energy strategy in 1999.
As part of this, it has decided that Block 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is to be decommissioned by 2005 and that the final decision on the decommissioning date for Block 2 will be taken in 2004 in the context of the national energy strategy review.
The Commission stated at the time that it understood that Block 2 had to be shut down by 2009.
This is a matter of logic: if 2005 is the latest date for Block 1 to be shut down, it follows from the envisaged lifetime of the two nuclear power installation units that 2009 is the latest date for the decommissioning of Block 2.
As regards Block 1, the Commission took it into account that Lithuania had commenced extensive preparations for decommissioning and shutting down.
I am working on the assumption that the decommissioning is actually to take place before 2005.
As far as Block 2 is concerned, the Commission has stated - as I have already said - that the decommissioning is to take place by 2009 at the latest.
Over and above that, the Commission and the Member States believe that the timetable for the decision on decommissioning should be compatible with the timetable for Lithuania's accession to the European Union.
I spoke about this in depth only a few days ago with the new Lithuanian government in Vilna - it was actually the main topic of conversation in Vilnius - and I got the impression that the Lithuanian parliament and government had well understood the message that they now have to think about how the timetable for the decisions about Ignalina Block 2 has to be revised with a view to their own timetable for joining the European Union.
Let me take this opportunity to point out that it is precisely with regard to Ignalina that the Commission views compromises as impossible.
Ignalina is a nuclear power plant of the same type as Chernobyl, one that experts are generally convinced is not retrofittable and cannot be brought up to acceptable safety standards.
It is our firm conviction that this Chernobyl-type nuclear power plant is a source of real danger to human beings, and we will therefore be unable to withdraw our demand.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I especially liked what he said about there being no room for compromises.
Is the EU position absolutely fixed, with no likelihood of it being altered in the near future?
I should also like to raise the point about international funding for decommissioning.
Is that to come from the Commission's own budget?
What happens if there is insufficient money for that decommissioning?
Mr Miller, I can answer your first question with a definite 'no' , which seems to be what you desire.
The European Union's stance on this issue will not change.
The situation as regards the second question is as follows: an international fund for the decommissioning of Block 1 of the plant was created. The fund is managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and, to date, EUR 220 million have been made available for it.
These EUR 220 million I mentioned were the result of an international conference of donors which I convened jointly with the Lithuanian Prime Minister last year in Vilnius.
I must however add - and this clouds the picture a little - that EUR 165 million of this sum comes from our own budget, so that the amount that the international community was prepared to raise in addition looks modest in comparison.
Nonetheless, the funds available suffice to start on the shutting-down process as planned and to finance all the tasks connected with it.
I must draw it to your attention that the shutdown of such a nuclear power plant is a project lasting decades and the financial obligations resulting from it for us will last for the same period of time.
The situation with regard to the plant's Block II is rather more complicated because the Lithuanian parliament has not to date fixed a definite date for it to be shut down.
During the discussions I have mentioned, I have however informed the Lithuanian government that the Commission is of course prepared to provide the necessary help in this aspect too, and is moreover willing to organise international aid.
A country like Lithuania can quite clearly not manage the huge task of shutting down a power plant like this one by its own resources alone.
It would, by the way, also be quite unfair to demand that of them, for it was not Lithuania that wanted the plant.
On the contrary, the Lithuanians even resisted it at the time.
It was the former Soviet Union that built this plant on the spot where it stands today, and certainly not in order to provide Lithuania with electricity, but, in the main - we believe - for military purposes.
It is, then, part of the legacy of the former Soviet Union, burdening a poor country like Lithuania.
It is in our interest that this legacy should disappear.
Mr President, does the Commission intend to issue a common safety standard for nuclear power plants which will be binding on the EU's Member States and applicant States, or, alternatively, to start drafting lists of power plants in the area of the Union on the 'name and shame' principle?
Mrs Korhola, you will be aware that the Commission is not competent in matters of nuclear safety.
There are no EU norms for the safety of reactors, which I myself greatly regret, but it has not to date been possible to change this situation.
The Council has worked intensively on this issue, precisely because the Commission has no competence in reactor safety issues.
The Council's working party on nuclear issues has applied itself to the safety situation in Eastern European nuclear power plants and presented a report just before the summer recess, which is no doubt available to Parliament.
I recommend that you study this report, which does not of course state that we have laid down European norms, but from which it is clear that the European Union, as regards the safety of Eastern European nuclear power installations, makes demands that it believes to be justified.
A list of nuclear power stations, such as you have proposed, resulted from investigations carried out much earlier, at the beginning of the nineties to be precise. These installations, which in the view of the European Union are not capable of a retrofit - that is, they cannot be made safe - are situated in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
We have, as you know, made it a condition for the commencement of accession negotiations that the issue of the shutting-down of these nuclear power stations should be finalised.
Question No 37 by (H-0743/01):
Subject: Alleged statement According to media reports in June and July 2001, EU Commissioner Verheugen is alleged to have stated privately that if former Czech Prime Minister and current Chairman of the Czech Chamber of Deputies, Mr Vaclav Klaus, became premier again, the Czech Republic' s EU entry chances would be harmed.
Does the Commission stand by or does it repudiate this alleged statement and does it not consider that such statements are inappropriate and do little to build confidence between the EU and the applicant countries at a time when understanding and support is needed during the integration process?
Questions to Commissioner De Palacio
Mr Crowley, the event to which you refer is of purely domestic political significance in the Czech Republic; it is an expression of an internal political dispute between government and opposition.
In such instances, the Commission can do no other than refrain from taking up any position, because it strictly refuses to be drawn into internal political disputes, whether in Member States or in acceding countries.
Mr President, first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers.
The quote is directly from him.
It is not an internal matter, it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly, privately, that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again, the Czech Republic's EU entry chances would be harmed.
The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards, and I quote directly from what he said, 'I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly, nevertheless they have not been embargoed.'
Commissioner, do you deny that you made such a statement?
Also, on matters exclusively for the Czech people - electing their leader, what stance they should take with regard to negotiations with their accession to the European Union, and particularly at a time when confidence building is required both within the EU and within the accession countries - do you think it is right that you as an official and a Member of the College of Commissioners should be interfering with the democratic wishes of the Czech people, or indeed the people of any country?
We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs, but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold.
Therefore I would ask you, once again, to specifically either deny or admit that you made the statement and also to explain why you interfered in such a way?
Mr Crowley, I had always believed that a gentleman would not wish to know what two other gentlemen had discussed privately.
If you want to change that, then that's up to you.
I will neither confirm nor deny anything in this matter.
Stony silence is the only way the Commission can avoid being involved in internal political disputes.
I will, however, quite gladly say something about the actual substance of your question.
The president of the Czech parliament and I have for many years been able to talk intimately and in confidence with one another.
The most recent, and, I might add, entirely private, in-depth conversation took place only a few days ago.
The president of the Czech parliament did not mention in this conversation the event that you have taken as the basis for your question.
But it means much to me that Mr Klaus, in the many, many conversations we have had, has always made it clear that he, himself, and his political friends desire and support the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union.
That he occasionally expresses other views, views differing from those shared by the majority in Europe, is well known, but he is quite entitled to do so, and we, as democrats, must accept that.
My final point must be that it goes without saying that the European Union has the right to tell candidate countries what it accepts and what it does not; to point out that certain criteria are required to be met for accession negotiations to begin and to be concluded, and that the most important of them is the political criterion according to which a country must guarantee that it is a democracy under the rule of law, respecting human rights, protecting minorities and sharing the values and objectives of the European Union.
It has come about that a country seeking membership has been told, on the basis of this assessment: 'We cannot start negotiating with you about accession, because you do not meet these political requirements.'
The question you have asked, whether political intervention of this sort occurs, must therefore be answered very clearly in the affirmative.
It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr Crowley has the floor for a brief point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The Commissioner did not answer my question, because he said he would not reveal what took place between two gentlemen.
He went on afterwards to reveal what took place between two gentlemen - himself and Mr Klaus.
Therefore he has failed to honour and respect this House by giving a direct answer to a direct question.
It is a disgrace.
Question No 43 by (H-0710/01):
Subject: Alpine Convention - the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region In its sections on the environment and transport, the Alpine Convention provides a definition of the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region.
In the Commission's estimation, does that definition - and the transport policy objectives thereby pursued - also form part of EU transport policy for this environmentally sensitive region?
Mr President, the Commission is aware of the importance of a suitable definition of the concept of sensitive areas, especially in the case of the environmental integration of transport flows in the Alpine region.
At the moment, there is a series of definitions of sensitive areas created, in particular, by the United Nations and the Alpine Convention, and also by the Community legislation on the protection of the environment.
The Commission believes that sensitive mountain areas, especially the Alpine region, as they are normally classified, are clearly priority areas in terms of the application of Community measures intended to reduce the environmental effects of transport and remove the link between increases in transport flows and economic growth.
Therefore, the White Paper on the European transport policy with a view to 2010, approved on 12 September, pays particular attention to the sensitive areas, especially the mountain regions, within the framework of the policy on charging and funding for infrastructures and the policy on the trans-European transport network.
The approach largely conforms to the guidelines expressed in the Alpine Convention and its Protocol on transport.
Commissioner, I wish to put a short supplementary question.
I was not entirely satisfied with the reply.
Above all, I am concerned about what we are doing now.
Are we to wait for technological innovations, for example the fuel cell, to at least partially solve some of the problems we have with traffic across the Alps or should we not now use the truth about the cost as an instrument to force heavy traffic, in the Alps at least, off some of the roads and onto the railways?
Mr President, in accordance with what was said in the White Paper on transport policy for the coming years, the Commission hopes, possibly within a year, and perhaps even before next summer, to present to Parliament and the Council of Ministers a new system of charging, specifically a modification of the 'Euro-disc' Directive, which will deal with just this type of issue, in accordance with the Costa report approved by this House a few months ago.
It will include, in the charges, concepts such as external costs, including certain perfectly quantifiable environmental costs.
Also cross-subsidisation, that is to say that part of the toll currently charged for existing infrastructures may be used to create a fund to finance alternative infrastructures, especially in the region of the Alps, in projects such as the Brenner tunnel or the Lyon-Turin connection.
As the authors are not present, Question Nos 44, 45 and 46 lapse.
Question No 47 by (H-0746/01):
Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and operational guarantees The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months.
In the light of the disaster which led to its closure, what technical guarantees has the Commission obtained as regards the 'new' tunnel's compliance with the relevant European legislation, in terms of environmental standards and sustainable transport?
How does the Commission view the new Italian-French management arrangements for the tunnel?
Mr President, the Commission does not have the power to give the green light to the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel. This matter does not come within our competence.
The task of assessing whether the safety level is sufficient falls to the operators and the national authorities, in accordance with their competences in France.
On that basis, it is for them to decide whether all the safety conditions are met.
According to the information available to the Commission, tests should be carried out in October to check that the security elements are operating correctly, such as the ventilation system or the electronic control centre, and the degree of training of the staff in charge of operation and emergency services.
In this respect, one of the main measures to be implemented relates to the distance between vehicles when using the tunnel.
Furthermore, this measure will contribute to restricting the circulation of lorries via that route.
With regard to organisational aspects, an important element is the creation by the two original companies, the French ATMB and the Italian SITMB, of a single company to take charge of managing the tunnel.
With regard to sustainable mobility and the great number of operators who are impatiently awaiting the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, given the serious disruption caused by its closure and the saturation of the routes which have been used as diversions, it should be pointed out that, in the short term, the reopening of the tunnel is going to be very positive from the point of view of sustainable mobility, the environment and safety.
I insist, however, that the safety measures must be in place as a prior condition for its reopening.
In the longer term, the absolute priority is to maintain control of the flow of land transport in the Alpine region, without hindering freedom of movement and economic development and, specifically, access from the Italian Peninsula to the rest of Europe will be based on the elements which I mentioned a moment ago, that is, by providing the Alps with major rail crossings which will carry a large proportion of the rail transport burden.
Commissioner, I reiterate that European legislation does exist on this matter and it must be respected, that the specifications of the new tunnel are practically the same as those of the previous tunnel, that 97% of the community of Chamonix have declared that they are against the reopening of the tunnel - which will inevitably damage all the private businesses, polluting all the typical, customary economic activities of these communities now and in future - and that the Italian government is preparing to reduce the night-time toll, thus increasing the pollution.
What guarantees does the European legislation protecting the environment offer these communities?
Mr President, with regard to safety standards, I refer back to what I just said.
According to the information available to me, the conditions for ensuring the control and safety of the tunnel have improved and tests are being done, and when all the requirements are met and the reliability of the instruments and systems is verified, the tunnel will be opened.
This is what I can tell you in relation to safety regulations.
I must insist, however, that Italy and France are the competent administrations.
And no doubt within Italy and France, in accordance with their internal institutional organisation, there are probably certain other regional or local administrations which also have a role to play.
Having said that, I would like to say to the Member that the Community' s fundamental freedoms are the freedom of movement of goods and of persons.
We must guarantee the interconnection between Italy and the rest of the European continent; which clearly means a better distribution of traffic between the Alpine crossings and between the various modes of transport.
At this moment, thanks to the agreement with Switzerland, there are other types of possible access for North-south traffic and for traffic between Italy and the rest of the continent.
The Mont Blanc tunnel is one of the elements, but it is not the only one, and the traffic which has been diverted from the Mont Blanc tunnel is undoubtedly causing an overload in other areas - and I could mention other tunnels which you know even better than me.
In any event, the important thing is to carry out the work on the Lyon-Turin route and the Brenner tunnel, which are key and definitive elements, but which are going to take some time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand your arguments in favour of crossing the Alps.
However, I should like to tell you that at the present time, as I am sure you are aware, the public debate on the opening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel is in full swing, and the citizens of Europe, French and Italian, are appealing to us precisely in order to plead for a different cause, for a real sustainable transport system, which is not transport by road.
Do you really think - and I am asking because you have presented road transport to us as being a sustainable form of transport - do you really think, on the basis of the studies that have been carried out, that the opening of this Mont-Blanc tunnel will be strictly in line, first of all, with requirements, and secondly, with the obligations that we have entered into, in particular with regard to Kyoto?
Very briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that the people most directly affected address themselves to you, but I can talk about other people who are asking just the opposite; that the Mont Blanc tunnel be opened as soon as possible.
As on so many other occasions, there are sometimes contradictory interests.
With regard to the issue of safety, I will insist on what I said before.
It is not the Commission which has to make the assessment.
We have neither the competence nor the capacity to carry out that type of task.
Thirdly, sustainable mobility. That is the objective of the White Paper I have presented and which the Commission approved on 12 September.
However, that objective will clearly not be achieved through a statement of will and an approval by the Commission, but it must be approved by this House and by the Council of Ministers and then put into practice.
It will be efforts of all types over a number of years which will allow us to make progress.
But we must consider that transport sometimes resolves problems created by other types of decisions.
Decisions which relate to urban policy, to development policy, to forms of production, to a series of policies on territorial balance and other things, where transport simply offers facilities at a certain moment, resolves problems and makes its contribution.
In many cases the origins go beyond transport policy.
Question No 48 by (H-0747/01):
Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and 'piggyback traffic' The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months.
In the meantime, road traffic is causing local communities to incur extremely high public health, economic and environmental costs, especially in the mountains, where pollution levels are three to six times as high as in other environments.
What specific measures are being taken to obtain an accurate assessment of the road transport costs, including social, economic and environmental costs?
What steps have been taken to introduce a special tax (as has happened in Switzerland and Austria) aimed at protecting against and making good the social and environmental damage caused and making rail transport, which has considerable potential for further development, competitive in economic terms?
Mr President, in the Commission' s deliberations on the Alpine regions, stress is always placed on the high environmental cost of transport in those regions.
Considerable work has been done by means of a series of Commission studies and the Fourth and Fifth Framework Research Programmes, which have examined transport expenses in the Alpine regions and other regions, including the project relating to the information systems on Alpine transport and the European strategic multimodal model and the Alp-net project which is currently under way.
The problem was also dealt with in the reports of the high-level group, which Parliament approved by means of its resolution, contained in the Costa report on charging for the use of infrastructures, which I referred to earlier.
The new Commission White Paper on common policy not only offers current estimates of the costs of road transport, but also treats as a priority the resolution of the transport problems in the Alpine regions by means of a wide range of measures which I referred to earlier.
In that context, we are studying the possibility of creating a system for testing charging in sensitive mountain regions such as the Alps as soon as possible.
Those initiatives should not only have a possible effect on the current volume of traffic, but above all promote the use of less polluting vehicles and thereby contribute to reducing the negative effects of traffic, both on human health and on the flora and fauna of the regions in question and also allow for cross-subsidisation, which I also referred to a moment ago.
Mr President, as I have said repeatedly, we believe that the modal rebalancing of transport in Europe is a key element not only for the quality of life of our citizens, for the protection of the environment, but also for economic development because, without that modal rebalancing, we will face a situation of gridlock of our road networks and our transport routes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I imagine that the Member' s question has been answered.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 49 to 82 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Question Time.
Mr Staes has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I have here in front of me a magazine, or at least a newspaper article, which reads as follows : 'I do not approve of the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban.
It promotes the feeling of victimisation in people who already have the sense that they are victims.
I do not feel happy about the entire Conference in Durban, irrespective of the way in which the Middle East was presented there.
The fact that someone like Castro was cheered, is proof that this was an anti-Western meeting' .
These are not my words but the words of a Member of the European Commission.
In a moment, we will be listening to a statement by the European Commission and by the Council on Durban.
I would invite the Commission to tell us whether it backs the statements by Mr Bolkestein in the Volkskrant in the Netherlands or not, as the case may be.
We appreciate the Members' imagination in introducing their issues into the debate, but we are really obliged to follow the agenda.
Conclusions of the UN Conference on Racism
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on racism.
Mr Michel, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to let you have an initial account of the results achieved at the Third United Nations World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, a conference which was held in Durban from 31 August to 7 September.
The Durban Conference can be described as a success on several counts, despite the difficult political context in which the negotiations took place, and despite the fact that this conference had been described as a failure before it even began.
Firstly, in terms of practical results, this is the first United Nations conference devoted to the task of combating racism which has ended with the adoption, by consensus, of a policy declaration and a programme of action.
The Durban Conference was, above all, an opportunity to reinforce this essential task of combating racist tendencies, tendencies towards the discrimination and intolerance that constitute a feature of everyday life for millions of human beings, who are all too often the silent victims of outrages against their dignity.
Even if in the adopted texts, which form the very essence of what we are talking about, little progress was made, the theoretical contemplation of the fight against racism clearly shows a strong, political will to banish racism.
A call is also made for taking an impressive number of specific measures which aim to fight this scourge globally.
As such, the lion' s share of the 220 articles of the action programme consist of preventive, educational and protective measures which aim to eradicate racism at all levels, as well as strategies which endeavour to attain out-and-out equality of all people worldwide.
By way of example, I will list a few measures which should strengthen the national and regional institutions in their fight against racism, and which must encourage them to step up their mutual cooperation.
Other measures aim to educate people to respect human rights, change their mentality and to grant non-discriminating access to education.
Still other measures place the role of the political parties in the foreground, allowing them to develop internal codes of conduct which will prohibit their members from making public speeches which incite racism.
In addition, there are also measures which must help in the fight against racism in the workplace.
The action programme also contains a number of statutory, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures which must prevent racism and must offer protection against this plague.
The time was too short to bring all negotiations to a good end.
That is why it was impossible to complete the discussions on certain important points, such as the caste system or race discrimination in combination with the death penalty.
However, the European Union did manage to have important themes included in all definitive texts. These themes include the gender issue, better child protection and the fight against the trafficking in human beings, especially women and children.
Here too, I would like to emphasise the difficulties arising from the use of the concept of 'race' .
Today, it is a fact that each theory which supports the existence of different human races is scientifically flawed.
The European Union would like the use of language to follow this trend.
(NL) The EU is of the opinion that the use of terms which acknowledge the existence of different races needs to be avoided.
It is not our intention here to deny the diversity of the human race, but we do want to emphasise its unity, and, as such, fight the present forms of racism which are often based on these kinds of claims.
But due to strong opposition from certain States, we have been unable to make much progress in this field.
The European Union insisted on explaining its fundamental viewpoint on this matter in a last speech, which will also be included in the Conference' s report.
As far as the strategies are concerned, the States are urged to draft a policy and action plan to fight racism, and to implement the Durban action programme.
They are also urged to continue to cooperate in a statutory international framework, especially with the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which is responsible for the follow-up of the implementation of the texts that were adopted in Durban.
(FR) I think I can also safely say that the political scope of the compromise achieved on the causes and origins of racism is another important successful result of the Durban Conference.
Like you, I have read some of the comments.
I certainly do not want to start a controversial debate on this subject, but I will say, on the subject of the forgiveness and excuses which those who negotiated at Durban seem to have been accused of - I was there and I know I had quite a struggle to obtain this text - that of course people of our generation, like those of the previous generation, are not and were not involved in what was all too often misguided colonisation, or in slavery, but I would ask those people the following question. How can we be satisfied with such a banal, factual observation as that, at the same time refusing, by default, to give justice to those people who, even today, still bear the badly healed scars of colonisation and slavery?
I should like to reply to what I have been reading in the press by saying that we are not engaged, here, in sanctimoniously and naively cultivating a sentiment of injustice. On the contrary, we have to recognise, on behalf of our forebears, that the evil deeds that were committed were morally debatable, if not downright reprehensible.
We must also tell the victims, past and present, that we know that our history has not always been glorious and that by admitting as much, obviously on behalf of others, we are showing our intention of recognising their right to extenuating circumstances and, having said that, we must propose a true partnership, based on mutual respect, and far removed from the humiliating paternalism and miserly gestures of a self-satisfied and satiated lady of the manor.
I should therefore like, for a moment, to come back to the result.
I believe that the result obtained at Durban opens up positive prospects for the continuation of the dialogue between North and South.
The European Union has recognised and condemned the immense suffering caused by past and present forms of slavery and trafficking, wherever they took or take place, as well as the most blameworthy aspects of colonialism.
It has recognised that slavery and trafficking were crimes against humanity and should always have been crimes against humanity.
Durban was therefore an opportunity to look our common past in the face. Some people saw that as an act of regret, others as an act of remorse, and still others as an act of excuse.
The important thing, it seems to me, is, above all else, the willingness to close the darkest chapters of our common history so as to be able to construct a new relationship, based on mutual respect, solidarity and partnership.
An appeal has been launched so that more funds can be authorised for initiatives taken by developing countries, in particular the new African initiative.
There is another element which I would not like to pass over in silence.
In the final analysis, Durban was a success because, throughout this difficult negotiating process, the Member States of the European Union remained united.
Intensive coordination was implemented with the support of the Council Secretariat and the Associated States were kept constantly informed.
It was this close cooperation which enabled the Presidency, duly mandated by its European partners, to negotiate delicate compromises with the representatives of the geographical groups concerned, and with the President and Secretary-General of the Conference, Mrs Zuma and Mrs Robinson respectively.
Regular coordination with the Western Group has also borne fruit.
The European Union and its external and common security policy have emerged strengthened from the Durban Conference.
Durban was the proof that the European Union is capable of speaking with a single voice on the difficult question - but one that is vital to the future of humanity - of the fight against racism and for respect for human dignity.
The European Union asserted itself as an incorruptible negotiating partner and mediator.
It presented an image of unity and consistency, and it supported the use of firmness, depending on the circumstances.
As a result, its credibility was reinforced, as was its position at international level.
The proof of this lies in the extreme flexibility and spirit of openness that the European Union showed in the discussions on the Middle East.
The burden of those negotiations really did rest mainly on the European Union following the departure of the United States and Israel.
The re-launching of the Middle East peace process is one of the European Union' s priorities.
However, it believed that the Durban Conference, based as it was on the fight against racism, was not the appropriate forum for dealing with that question Since, however, the Arab and Moslem countries were insistent that the issue should be discussed at Durban, the European Union agreed to take an active role in formulating a draft consensus which was presented by the South African Presidency.
In that draft, the European Union was able to retain the principles which it believed to be essential, namely a balanced text with a strong call for negotiations to be resumed and for violence to be brought to an end, while at the same time expressing concern about the increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the world.
A reference to the Holocaust was retained, whereas the equation 'Zionism equals racism' disappeared, as these were among the conditions and prerequisites.
That was what was achieved at Durban.
We must now look to the future and put into practice those commitments to which we universally subscribed in South Africa.
I must emphasise that everyone should be informed of the positive coverage of this conference.
Each of us, and Member States in particular, must now redouble our efforts so as to ensure that we make the most of the exemplary success achieved by the European Union at the Durban Conference.
I believe, therefore, that we can be reasonably satisfied with the outcome.
I would simply like to say that you get an even better idea of how successful the conference was if you imagine for a moment what it would have represented, in terms of a message or a negative signal, if Durban had not been a success.
I believe that in the context that we are experiencing now, that would certainly not have helped.
I think, therefore, that we did our duty, we did exactly what we ought to have done, it seems to me, in extremely difficult conditions.
I am very pleased to have succeeded, on behalf of the European Union, with the support of the Commission, with the support of the Council, and with the support of the fifteen Member States, but also - which is very important - with the support of the thirteen candidate countries, to have succeeded, in fact, in saving this conference.
If we had not succeeded in saving this conference, I believe it would have had relatively damaging consequences in the longer term.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Durban Conference represents a major step forward in the endeavour to bring about global understanding, global political agreement on questions of racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and intolerance.
I must start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency and because, after all, they do all have names, by offering my special congratulations to the deputy prime minister, Mr Michel, who took centre stage at the Conference and managed to maintain internal cohesion between the Member States throughout and, at the same time, to shoulder the main burden of negotiations at global level.
I should like to thank the European Parliament and the mission for their extremely important contribution to the Conference and for the important part which they played throughout the negotiations and to say that the Commission is satisfied with its contribution and its efforts to support the presidency.
I should like to explain to Parliament and to apologise for being unable to appear in person one and three days before the Conference but health problems at home made it impossible for me to travel.
The Conference was exciting and difficult, with a heavy workload.
The early departure of the United States left the European Union in the position of main speaker and basically left it to shoulder the main burden of the negotiations.
I think that the European Union's profile at this Conference was upgraded to a global profile, given that it managed, in a totally hostile environment, to bring important negotiations to a conclusion while maintaining cohesion between the Member States and maintaining excellent relations and cooperation with the candidate countries.
Of course, we see this Conference as a success, especially if you compare it with previous attempts in 1978 and 1983.
A global message was sent out and specific, globally agreed proposals were tabled.
One comment which could be made is that, throughout consultations over the eight days of the Conference, the wrong agenda prevailed.
The main aim of the Conference was to find a modern definition for racism and to decide on measures to combat it at worldwide level and that would have been a huge success by helping us to deal with the problems of racism today.
These two issues were way down, if not off the bottom of the agenda.
On the contrary, the issues which dominated were the Middle East and past wrongdoings.
Of course, we cannot forget the past.
We need a thorough knowledge of the past if we are to learn from it and avoid repeating it.
However, when it poisons relations, cooperation, agreement and future progress, then it really is an enormous obstacle.
A hostile climate prevailed at the Conference, both at government level and at the level of non-government organisations.
And it must be said, texts appeared couched in terms of hatred which do absolutely nothing to foster reconciliation, build bridges between nations or build a bridge between the future and the past and should be avoided at all costs, especially at international conferences attended by every country in the world.
I should like to refer briefly to the question of non-governmental organisations.
The European Commission has consistently supported the participation of non-governmental organisations at the Conference.
We value their help in formulating and applying policy.
A large sum of money, EUR 3.7 million to be precise, has been earmarked to support the United Nations and, more specifically, the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to help fund the participation of non-governmental organisations, especially from countries which cannot meet their expenses.
We have to admit that there is some scepticism as to what their participation achieved and, I think, there was some disappointment about the final communiquÃ©, the final declaration by the forum of non-governmental organisations which Mary Robinson refused to present because it contained inflammatory remarks.
Of course, it is important not to put all our eggs in one basket.
I have to say that the main, important non-governmental organisations working on racism, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organisations failed to agree and publicly fell out in an exchange of inflammatory and awkward remarks.
Because, unfortunately, the forum was overpowered by very specific and special issues.
I already understand that certain Member States are re-examining how funding is provided and, of course, the Commission intends to undertake a similar re-examination.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that numerous countries, for reasons best known to themselves, were unable to make an in-depth and positive contribution to the Durban Conference, we have to say that an agreement was reached which lays the foundations for further cooperation at global level.
It sends out a clear message, as the Minister explained, about combating racism at worldwide level and, of course, every country made a commitment to national action plans, national action plans on legislation, the bases of political parties, education, employment and social and cultural life.
However, we must not rest on our laurels.
Recent events after 11 September have shown how easily and often how thoughtlessly racism and xenophobia can be revived.
If we learned anything from Durban, it was that we must avoid stigmatising groups, nationalities, societies or religious minorities.
We cannot ascribe collective crimes to collective people, but we can condemn specific political or other leaders responsible for political mistakes.
The Commission will continue to put its efforts into combating racism by cooperating with the Member States and by keeping its eye on a very ambitious agenda; that means all Member States implementing and incorporating the package against discrimination decided last year by 2003, it means implementing the special programme against discrimination, which is already under way, and it means mobilising and guaranteeing the efficient involvement in this issue of the Racism and Xenophobia Monitoring Centre in Vienna.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, there are many people who actually wondered about the usefulness of the Durban Conference.
Yet the international community must exist, and it must come together to discuss the issues, even if such discussions sometimes reveal contradictory interests, and I do not believe that walking out is necessarily a solution.
At least the Durban Conference had the advantage of bringing together the international community on an issue which is undeniably a subject of common concern to all countries, because racism is a scourge of worldwide proportions, and no country is free from racism or discrimination in one form or another.
This conference therefore provided an opportunity to take stock, to make a diagnosis, and what would be the point of such a diagnosis, if there were no treatment?
What could we expect from the Durban Conference?
I do not yet know, Mr Michel, whether it will constitute a success in the long term.
What we do know is how it failed, in other words the fact that there was no final declaration, no confirmation of a worldwide willingness to combat racism and to find adequate means of doing so.
The objective of the Durban Conference was to compile a whole series of worldwide instruments, to draw up a road map, to work out new strategies for combating racism, and action programmes - which you, Minister, have described - which states can exploit, subject to the subsidiarity which is the key to the issue of combating racism and discrimination.
What lessons can we learn from this?
It seems to me that we have been able to avoid falling into three traps.
The first, which you have already mentioned, is the issue of the Middle East.
Any reasonable person knows that the problems of the Middle East would never have been solved at Durban.
Attempts were made to turn this into a major issue, but I think that this trap was, fortunately, avoided.
The second trap is the issue of reparations.
Some people would have liked reparations to be the main subject of the debate.
This was sheer perverseness, if not perversion, because it meant that there was a risk that development aid would be reduced to a form of reparations.
As Mr Michel has quite rightly emphasised, we are all aware of the burden of history borne by certain parties.
We must work towards solidarity between human beings rather than perpetual culpability, which in financial terms would have to come to an end one day, because any reparations expressed in terms of money would, of course, be finally paid off sooner or later.
Finally, the third trap that was avoided was the victim list.
Some people wanted a list to be drawn up.
In our case that would have included the Roma, Sintis and Dalits.
If one draws up a list of victims, of course, there is a risk that the next thing that will be drawn up is a hierarchy of victims, and some may be regarded as being more victims than others, which seems to me to be completely unproductive as far as racism and discrimination are concerned.
In effect, therefore, the declaration is acceptable and I would like to thank Mr Michel, officially, for the essential role that he played as mediator, intercessor and - if I can risk a neologism - explainer. As you have emphasised so well, Mr Michel, Europe was able to make its full influence felt - and I do not believe that it did so only after the departure of the United States - because you showed great personal commitment, and because Europe consisted not only of fifteen countries, but of thirteen others as well.
In other words a large part of the human race was giving its mind to this subject.
As the Commissioner has said, some of the NGOs made themselves look ridiculous.
This raises the issue of how representative they actually are.
Fortunately, essential partners such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch disassociated themselves from the final declaration, but perhaps it will be necessary to sort out the assistance that we are able to give to the NGOs, many of which, over there, have lost all sense of responsibility to say the least.
We are very mindful, Minister, of the practical side.
The European Union is perhaps not at the bottom of the league table when it comes to combating racism and discrimination, but there is still a great deal to be done.
Let us therefore exploit those 225 articles to find means of action that we can put into practice.
Finally, and I should like to end on this point, I would simply draw attention to the inadequacy of our Parliament' s representation.
This point will feature in the joint resolution.
Briefly, the European Union is represented by the President-in-Office of the Council. The European Community is represented, as an observer, by both the Commission and Parliament.
That is undoubtedly something to think about if we want the European Parliament to play a better role at international conferences, a role other than that of joint observer together with the Commission.
Anyway, this point raises the issue of the renegotiation of the Institutional Agreement of 5 July 2000.
You will find this proposal again in the joint resolution which will very shortly be put to the vote in this House.
Mr President, at the heart of my political group's approach to the Durban conference is a renewed determination to tackle racism and to discover what was positive about this conference.
I say renewed because racism in its many forms has reared its head again, with the tragic events in New York and Washington.
We have now a danger that a renewed wave of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism will come if we do not tackle racism and its root causes.
That illustrated the tragedy of this conference, because I felt I attended two conferences.
One was a historic conference where delegations, like our own European Union delegation, were determined to register that racism is a major human rights issue.
We were determined to define for the first time racism in its many international forms, whether caste, a contemporary slavery, or whether discrimination against minorities within our own European Union and indeed the candidate countries.
We were determined to do something about racism, to show that with Article 13 we in the European Union had something to say to the rest of the world about how we were approaching our own problems.
Yet there was a second conference that I attended, full of confusion, of individual national agendas, a determination not to define racism in different countries because of an embarrassment as to what racism represented in those countries.
The confusion arose over the much misunderstood issue of reparations, and indeed the very destructive issue of Zionism and the problems in the Middle East, overshadowed our conference.
We have to be determined that the first conference, with the ideals we as a delegation defined for it, are renewed in this House today.
That requires a united front.
It requires us not to just say that Durban was chaotic, therefore we will leave it that way for history.
Instead, we as a European Union united, the Commission, the Belgian Presidency - which did an excellent job - those who attended the conference and all of us within this House who want to tackle racism must unite to go back to the original agenda.
That original agenda is one which may embarrass some individual countries, but the action programme is now there. It is there for us to exploit and it is there for us to do something about.
The issue is not whether this is a failure or not, it is about whether we can now make it a success by renewed determination within this House to get back to the action programme and make progress.
I agree with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that the conference can be described as a qualified success.
It did get a bad press - in some respects deservedly - but those who say an international conference on racism was not worth holding are wrong.
For the first time in 25 years of trying, international standards were set on the human rights of those vulnerable to racial discrimination.
That is something to celebrate.
We have a basis on which to build in order to tackle one of the great threats to freedom, justice and security in the world, including Europe.
Admittedly, however, the conference did start badly.
Firstly, there was the NGO forum.
Although many of the forum sessions were very worthwhile and indeed inspiring, the NGO voice was hijacked by the proponents of reparations for slavery and those pursuing the line that Zionism is racism.
These themes also dominated or sought to hijack the intergovernmental conference.
There was gross anti-Semitic abuse with, for example, cartoons circulating that could have figured in Julius Streicher's publications from the 1930s.
The document produced by the NGO forum was so bad that the Secretary-General, Mary Robinson, was unable to recommend it to the governments.
Some NGOs, including Amnesty International, had to disassociate themselves from it.
This was a great shame, because so many people had travelled to Durban with the serious intent to tell the world of real daily suffering.
I particularly remember a woman talking about the problems of internal migrants in China.
There were also individuals from many groups who suffer individual persecution such as Roma and Dalits, sometimes known as untouchables.
Admittedly there was a degree of cynical hypocrisy shown by some states in hiding behind the demonisation of Israel and America, including some African countries with appalling records of ethnic discrimination or human rights violations, and Arab countries unwilling to come clean about their own role in the slave trade.
This lack of honesty detracted from the conference.
Opinions can differ about whether the US and Israel did the right thing in staying away.
One can say that the position of Israel, at least, was impossible.
But certainly the absence of the US pushed the European Union into the front line.
One can ask if the EU was fully prepared for that.
But, admirably led by Mr Michel, as has been said, it rose to the challenge.
I have to give Mr Michel particular credit, even if he is my Liberal political colleague.
He came for two days and stayed for a week.
He displayed great personal commitment to ensure that the European Union spoke with one voice and a determination - even if sometimes a grim determination - to reach agreement.
That success was realised.
On the Middle East the language agreed was, on the whole, balanced.
I also believe personally that the language on slavery struck the right tone in speaking of it now as being a crime against humanity.
Clearly reparations were not the right means of redress to talk about.
The irony of the situation would be that African Americans would seek to claim, not Africans, who were not subject to slave trading.
Finally, one of my disappointments at Durban was that with the spotlight on international diplomacy rather than domestic records, the European Union struggled to find the space to highlight its own growing and increasingly solid record in tackling racism.
It is a pity that the EU as such is not represented in the UN system, so that the Commission and Parliament are only observers, although the President-in-Office did a very good job.
Clearly it was a pity that the Commissioner was prevented from attending for family reasons.
We have to find a way of strengthening the ability of all the European institutions to carry on taking a leading role in international human rights and anti-discrimination work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, participation in the World Conference in Durban was important, as a solemn proclamation of the renewal of an alliance against discrimination and the rejection of respect for human rights, and above all as an opportunity for reconciliation, the only way to reconstruct the future and future peace.
As the Minister has already said, the objective of this conference was obvious, its scope was complex, and it was necessary in order to construct the future.
At the same time, the NGO forum was held.
Although the final declaration appears to be excessive, it merely reveals, not a split, but a great deal of diversity among the NGOs.
Noticeable, in fact, is the absence of the worldwide NGOs, and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe.
The only NGOs featured in the declaration are the antiracist NGOs and the solidarity NGOs.
On the other hand, the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable, in the way they challenge power, assert principles, or, then again, consolidate a power already in place, hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs (Voluntary Government Organisations).
Yet within this diversity there is a certain amount of logic, the logic of powerful people. On the one hand there is the logic emanating from the rich, developed countries, the former colonisers, and then there is the logic of the poor countries, the ones who were formerly colonised, where power remains to this day hardly what one could call democratic, yet all too often still enjoys the North' s approval.
Words have meaning.
We have to find the right words to provide a solution.
The essential question is that of defining the terminology: slavery, colonialism, racism, genocide, apartheid or military occupation.
All these words tell of daily crises, the consequences, moreover, of discrimination.
We find that the final text talks of remorse and regrets, but refuses to give any excuses, and still less to envisage the prospect of reparations, or to reaffirm people' s right to live in peace and equality, without having to have recourse to international law.
Finally, it is perhaps regrettable that the final declaration is a minimalist declaration which seeks to satisfy everyone by preserving a certain amount of equilibrium.
This declaration not only calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of major international meetings, but also raises the question of direct democracy, because in effect it raises the issue of how representative the limits of participative democracy really are.
I should like to make one final reference to this so-called hijacking of the conference.
Who was hijacking whom?
Why?
For what purpose?
Remember that the United States did not want to take part in this meeting, and that they often threatened to withdraw.
The NGOs' declaration, however hard it might have been, was a good pretext for avoiding any issues with a bearing on the major interests which it was not thought desirable to offend, as well as the issue of reparations.
Several countries, including European countries, were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question, which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt.
Do not forget that the rich countries of the North built their prosperity on the negro slave trade and on colonial conquest, and they are not all willing to recognise this fully or to make reparation for their past crimes.
Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock.
Those powers are still, all too often, supported, and they too prefer to focus on an issue such as that of the Middle East, where they can make a good impression, rather than be called to account for the human rights situation in their own countries.
Finally, the essential objective of this conference was achieved, but we must now hope that there will be real follow-up action enabling projects, guidelines and action programmes to be set up and put into practice, with a view to preventing and abolishing those situations in which discrimination occurs, thereby ensuring that our fine words are finally translated into reality.
Commissioner, Mr President, the final declaration and action programme adopted in Durban was only possible due to the constructive and essential role played by the European Union. It was also due to the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Louis Michel' s diplomacy and ability to draw together many points of view, not to mention his natural gift for reconciling the views of all sides.
I sincerely believe that the European Union fulfilled its role perfectly, and we can only welcome the work that has been done.
I deplore the fact, however, despite Mrs De Palacio' s apologies, which I accept, that the European Commission was not present.
I think that at least one commissioner could have represented you at Durban.
I also regret the fact that few industrialised countries were represented, and I believe that many countries interpreted this as a lack of interest in the conference.
Had they been there, it might have prevented the American and Israeli delegations from leaving.
This is even more of a shame because racist violence and support for the populist and xenophobic vote have increased in Europe over recent years; the Freedom Party (FPÃ) led by JÃ¶rg Haider in Austria is only one illustration of this.
Other political forces masquerading as NGOs have rushed into the void that has been left.
Since, although the overwhelming majority of NGOs played a decisive role in preparing for the conference, and made several proposals formulating demands, I still do not agree with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who tries to play down what happened.
This is because a small number of NGOs have been busy trying to equate Zionism with racism, and, even worse, have distributed texts and writings, examples of which I have shown to Mr Michel, in which they patently extolled the merits of the Holocaust.
And this is something that Parliament cannot play down.
These NGOs, or so-called NGOs, these pseudo-NGOs, were not at Durban to defend the Palestinians, they were not there to defend the anti-racists, they were not even there in favour of peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
In my view, it is a positive sign that the final declaration acknowledges the right of Palestinians to their own land and that, at the same time, we reject any equation of Zionists with racists, in the same way as in Durban.
I must therefore ask, as you did, Commissioner, that we know exactly who these NGOs are, what their purpose is and how they are funded before we hold another conference.
The over-representation of some delegations leads me to question how they are funded.
But this conference provided, above all, an opportunity to weigh up the importance of some demands.
And in relation to this, I strongly challenge what my fellow Members, Mr Cornillet and Baroness Ludford said.
I think that acknowledging slavery and the slave trade as crimes against humanity was one of the key aims of the conference, and this is a good thing, and we are merely doing justice by acknowledging that 350 years of deprivation, raids, deportations and humiliations are crimes against humanity.
This is the least we could have done at this conference.
And I hope that all countries and former colonial powers follow the example of France acknowledge slavery and the slave trade, or are made to acknowledge it by their national parliaments, as a crime against humanity.
Personally speaking, I am still dubious about financial reparations, as Mr Michel said, I believe. Especially when we know that there are powerful lobbies of American lawyers hiding behind the African Americans' legitimate demand.
On the contrary, there is in fact a consensus that the continent that suffered most from slavery and colonisation, should be helped with the cancellation of its debt, and by urgently and proactively pursuing policies to combat AIDS and illiteracy.
We owe at least this to the African continent.
In addition, we have - and Mr Michel pointed this out - valuable counterparts in Africa, who are committed, through the New African Initiative, to good governance.
This is, therefore, the time to seize their demand to respond with practical measures and start talking.
Lastly, I regret that there was no mention of the death penalty in the United States, and part of the reason the United States delegation left was because it did not want to talk about racism in its own country.
I regret that discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was not discussed.
I regret that the concept of castes was not discussed, and I regret that the statement has no binding character.
The European Union' s task is, first of all, to carefully monitor the use of new technologies, such as the Internet, which can be used to incite racial hatred; to speed up the implementation of Article 13; to explain the annihilation of the American Indians, slavery, colonialism and the Holocaust in our textbooks and history books, and also the Sabra and Chatila massacres.
I believe that racism and anti-Semitism have one aspect in common with terrorism.
On the one hand, there are those who carry out the act itself and, on the other hand, there are those who supply them with the ideological weapons.
We must also combat the group made up of the Vlaams Blok, the National Front, the FPÃ and other parties, which supply ideological weapons to those carrying out the act itself and who themselves end up attacking the physical integrity of individuals.
We have a responsibility to do this as well.
Mr President, the resolution of the World Conference against Racism held in Durban is not exactly what many would have hoped for.
I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation.
This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country.
This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done, especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions.
Islam, I have said many times, has in many ways been demonised, mostly by people who know nothing about it.
Durban was not a failure, nor was it indeed a great success; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime, something I have called for many times in this House.
It helped refocus governments' attention on issues of racism, which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown.
European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities.
They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue.
We have a long way to go in the European Union, but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban.
Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit.
The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia, which I support without reservation.
I want to state yet again, here in this House, that I am a friend of Islam.
Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks.
We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union.
These terrorists acts were not carried out in the name of Islam.
They were plainly brutal terrorist acts of a premeditated and determined nature.
Just let me remind the House that no religion - or political movement for that matter - is without its fundamentalists.
Mr President, I too would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Michel, the President-in-Office of the Council, for I feel that the tenacity and determination with which it was attempted to avoid the shameful outcome towards which the Conference was headed are, above all, due to him.
I feel that the United States and Israeli delegations did well to withdraw from the work of the Conference, just as I feel that you did well, President-in-Office of the Council, to stay on to achieve a result, for, in actual fact, the two things are not incompatible.
The choice made by Israel and the United States served to show the world public what was in danger of happening, that a group of countries, mostly non-democratic with total contempt for their own people, was attempting to exploit the Conference in order to take sides in international politics.
This is why I support most of what has been asserted by my fellow Members, namely that, in present times, the most dangerous and widespread form of racism in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere is the conviction that democracy and the rule of law are institutions which are only beneficial for Europe, the West and the United States, and not for some of the other communities in our world, and that they must not be exported and strictly respected in other countries as well.
The image of dictatorships which oppress their own people, their own race and their own flesh and blood, of dictators and their representatives who have the gall to preach antiracist sermons at the United Nations, is an effective illustration of the obstacles facing the international community.
None of this can be tolerated, and I feel that the decision taken by the United States and Israeli delegations and the determination of Mr Michel, in particular, and the Council as a whole as well, have served to make this very clear.
I would like to end by associating myself with those who are calling for a detailed inquiry at this juncture into where, within the non-governmental organisations, responsibility for what happened lies - clearly, as always, we must avoid putting everything under the same umbrella - for there is no doubt that responsibility does lie somewhere and it must be ascertained where, not least in view of the generosity displayed by the European Union and the European Commission towards non-governmental organisations.
Mr President, the World Conference against Racism, in conjunction with the United Nations-sponsored International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, has been a unique opportunity to consider the challenges and dangers faced by these peoples and all Stateless nations.
Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the optimistic view expounded by Mr Michel, though I recognise willingly the very important role played by him.
I was in Durban on that special occasion, and so I can give evidence to this House of a very insidious threat to indigenous peoples running through the provisional agenda of the Durban Summit, paragraph 27 of which states: "The use of the term 'indigenous people' in the World Conference against Racism... cannot be construed as having any implications as to rights under international law".
Through that paragraph the United Nations Summit tried to exclude all these peoples from the right to self-determination recognised by the United Nations itself and international covenants.
In response to such inadmissible discrimination and intolerance, the NGO forum in Durban denounced very strongly the new expression of neo-colonialists that will, in the long run, provoke the decimation of the cultures and civilisations of these vulnerable peoples.
This insidious action was prepared at the Conference against Racism with a view to the future.
It looks to the future, not to the past.
As the NGO final declaration clearly suggests, structural racism in the past, current manifestations of neo-colonialism and the denial of the fundamental right to self-determination lie at the root of indigenous suffering.
Mr President, seldom has a UN Conference been so well-intended and so badly understood as Durban.
In my view, this is partly due to poor preparation.
Diplomats and officials should have made more of an effort to reach consensus before the Conference.
That would have saved the world community a great deal of money, time and embarrassing moments.
Particularly unfortunate was the fact that a number of delegations ran off, for however well-founded their reasons may have been, those who run away are always in the wrong.
Against this background, it was all the more surprising that, despite the obstinacy of Louis Michel, for that is how we have all come to know him in Belgium, and now also in the rest of the world, a sound final declaration was obtained after all.
This final declaration contains a number of important provisions which, if applied, could drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions of people.
Governments are encouraged to allow minorities to speak their own language, acknowledge their own culture and profess their own religion, to stand up to police services who display racist behaviour and are also encouraged to adjust their legal systems so that they do not discriminate against certain groups.
Roma and gypsy children must be given the same education as other children.
In the field of migration policy, race discrimination must be banished.
I also welcome the sound and balanced provisions on the Middle East, which emphasise the right to an independent State for the Palestinians as well as Israel' s safety.
And finally, two centuries after the events, Europe has apologised for the slave trade.
After all, we should not forget that at least ten million Africans were transported to America in what is known as forced migration on the largest-scale in the history of mankind.
Millions more lost their lives during the slave hunt or one of the infamous cargo ships.
The statements Commissioner Bolkestein made in a Dutch newspaper last weekend are therefore completely misplaced.
'I am not satisfied with the excuses of the UN Conference in Durban.'
He said: 'I myself have never had a slave, so why should I apologise?'
That kind of statement bears witness to a Western arrogance which overlooks the fact that American prosperity is partly built on the labour of slaves, and European prosperity is partly built on the raw materials from former colonies.
Can this serve as an excuse for governments in developing countries to shirk their responsibility and shift all the blame to the past?
No, certainly not.
But rather than giving other people lessons in civilisation, we should have the intellectual integrity to describe this chapter in our history as it was: A crime against humanity.
The United Nations Conference on Racism is of particular relevance in these turbulent times, when there is bloodthirsty talk and behaviour in the name of a confrontation between civilisations.
We are witnessing armed conflicts which originate in and are sustained by racial or ethnic conflicts and we are astonished to hear statements whose content and origin are unacceptable, on the superiority of certain civilisations over others.
I would therefore like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Michel, in particular, on his efforts which led to the final success of the Durban Conference, in which I participated on behalf of this Parliament.
His actions clearly demonstrated the European Union' s firm position in relation to racism and xenophobic attitudes.

Without ignoring the social, political and economic problems which lead to racial discrimination in Europe, I would like to focus on one aspect - the development perspective - which has been somewhat forgotten in the stagnation of recent events and also during the Conference, in relation to the Middle East conflict and the seriousness of the events taking place there, and to the recognition of the suffering caused by Europe' s history and the perversity of slavery and slave trading, the practice of which we today see as a crime against humanity.
The majority of ethnic conflicts which involve thousands of victims and regrettable human situations take place in developing countries, mainly in Africa.
I therefore believe that the success of this Conference will depend on whether we are today capable of realising everything that was contained in its final declaration.
In this resolution, we ask the Commission for financial support for the administrations of the developing countries for the implementation of national action plans to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, as was agreed at Durban.
Forums and observatories must be created, observatories in Africa, provincial observatories, regional observatories.
We also ask for support for the United Nations so that it can carry out the monitoring of the results of Durban, so that the fight against racism may remain on the international agenda until it is eradicated.
I believe that we must continue working so that the contents of the declaration may be implemented.
Of course, the United States should not have abandoned the Conference, but it was not the first time that they have abandoned it, since they had abandoned it on other occasions; this was therefore not important.
The important thing is that we in the European Parliament are able to clearly repeat our message with one voice, to journalists, to the media, against racism and in favour of equality and integration.
The President, acting President-in-Office of the Council, and the Commissioner will have to excuse me, for one minute of speaking time leaves one very little time to say much at all.
But great efforts do not necessarily lead to great results.
A lack of effort, however, can lead to disaster.
That is why I should like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council for his efforts in Durban.
Sometimes, it seems as if our Commissioners are looking at a different Conference from the one Mr Bolkestein is talking about, when he states that such a conference promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already have the feeling of being victims.
That is regrettable, of course.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, you state that there was actually a hostile atmosphere at that Conference.
It is all the more important then that we are very aware of the fact that we always carry a level of latent racism and latent hostility around with us, and that we are very careful that people keep track of their sense of identity - and I know what I am talking about, for that is a very important theme in our groups.
From the moment that identity leads to a sense of more worth than, and underestimation, of others, and that that sense is instilled in an entire group and transferred across to other groups, ethnic and racist tension ensues, which can lead to major conflicts.
It is unfortunate, but we cannot say that that is not true for Europe.
This is borne out by the success of racist parties in some of our countries, the conflicts in the Balkans, or the tension in the candidate countries.
We must employ a great deal of patience and determination to make a difference.
Durban may be a start.
It was certainly not the end, for the bulk of the work will need to be done in our own communities.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it a very positive indicator that this conference was held in Durban; that there were wide-ranging discussions; that a resolution was drafted; and that there has been a conclusion.
I find that this discussion, in some respects, looks too little to the future and considers too few definite and preventative measures to combat racism so that, if possible, it does not even come into being.
I would like to call at this point for the European Union itself to take the lead by good example, and I wish now to refer to two areas of current significance in which we can do something tangible, namely asylum policy and immigration policy.
If we succeed in what we have set ourselves, that is, in implementing a unified asylum policy with minimum standards and rapid and reliable decision-making, we will no longer have the situation that faces us now, with asylum seekers waiting for years in ghettos, constrained to work outside the law and becoming marginalised.
Rapid decisions lead to help being made available quickly and to recognised refugees being speedily integrated; it prevents the marginalisation that at present occurs.
This would amount to the prevention of racism!
I seek progress in immigration policy as well.
If Member States, as far as they are able and presupposing that work, accommodation and educational opportunities are available, accept citizens from outside States and offer help with integration, then that is another step taken against exclusion and discrimination and in favour of integration, and I believe we should grasp these practical tools in order to be really successful in preventing racism and discrimination.
This is an opportunity for our European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the World Conference on Racism in Durban was overshadowed from the outset by a political strategy of discrimination.
Arab States attempted to impute racism to Israel, with the intention of making the Arab world out to be victims of Israeli racism, which was then to be condemned by the conference.
This was a perfidious strategy.
They attempted to make use of this important conference for their own purposes.
Like the conference as a whole, any attempt to seriously get to grips with this strategy was sunk by the terrible events on 11 September.
We now have a situation in which the entire Arab world is in danger of itself being pilloried in a racist way.
All people of Arab origin or from an Islamic cultural background are in danger of having the deeds of a small terrorist group laid at their door.
There are, unfortunately, already examples of how this can happen openly and violently.
It can also, however, happen surreptitiously through concealed mistrust.
Either way, it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it.
This would represent a victory for the terrorists.
So let us not allow it to happen!
Let us not follow the bad example that cast a pall over the Durban Conference.
We Members of Europe's Parliament, above all people, must be wary of rashly pigeonholing people by nationality and religion.
Let us be an example.
Let us continue to be open and tolerant.
But the terrorists must be in no doubt: they will be pursued with rigour, with no regard to race and religion.
We here can do something against racism.
Let us act accordingly and give an example.
That will be worth more than all the conferences in the world, something that will be demonstrated when we take this debate to its post-Durban conclusion.
Mr President, the European Union bears a particular responsibility in the fight against racism and racial discrimination.
The action plan adopted on 8 September in Durban is an important message and a contribution to creating awareness in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The conference's eventual agreement on a joint declaration is to be welcomed.
Although many, but not all, NGO's and also many States strenuously attempted to convert the Conference into a unilateral forum of condemnation of Israel and to make the issue of slavery and colonialism an opportunity for demanding compensation payments, it can be counted a success that the Final Document did not take up extreme positions of this sort and that it came into being at all.
With hindsight, however, we must ask ourselves whether the European Union's generous support for the NGOs, which I consider justified in principle and which amounted to EUR 3.7 million, always found its way to the right destinations, all the more so as agitprop arguments to the effect that, for example, Zionism is equivalent to racism, are very much part of the political vocabulary of many States, Syria being one example.
The biggest terrorist attack to date against the civilised world took place three days after the Durban Conference.
None other than President Mubarak of Egypt has pointed out that human rights issues are often misused by terrorist organisations in order to build up their international networks.
Mark well, though, that human rights and the fight against racial discrimination and xenophobia are indivisible and of global significance.
Nobody is immune, as demonstrated by the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and the most recent tragic events in Northern Ireland.
The Durban Action Plan is an important document for every State, but also for the European Union as a whole, which bears great responsibility in this respect, above all in the framework of the United Nations.
I wish the EU's role were more visible there as well.
Mr President, the debate on the outcome of the UN Conference on Racism is particularly topical following the tragic events on 11 September.
Unfortunately, the global coalition against terrorism appears to exist alongside a xenophobic revival, as Mrs Diamantopoulou said earlier, and a tendency to demonise whole groups of people, mainly Muslims and Arabs.
According to the international press, the majority of the public in Holland, 62% to be precise, in a country with a long tradition of democracy, considers that the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington will seriously impede the social integration of Muslims in Holland.
At the same time, there is support in Germany for reviewing the legislative framework governing religious organisations.
A few days ago in Britain, a nineteen-year-old Muslim girl and a taxi driver were the victims of an unprovoked attack.
During this morning' s debate on asylum and immigration, several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views.
These developments are most worrying.
Europe' s experiences from the horrendous wars of the twentieth century highlight the danger to peace and democracy and to human dignity of racism, xenophobia and nationalism.
In the light of recent events, the European Union and the Member States need to strengthen their legal mechanisms for fighting racism and to take initiatives at global level to reduce the gap between countries and to ostracise violence as a means of resolving differences.
Fighting terrorism and dispensing justice should never call our democratic achievements and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights into question.
Finally, I should like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and the European delegation as a whole for helping to make the UN Conference in Durban a success.
Mr President, racism is one matter on which there exists a great cultural unanimity: that it is wrong.
Nobody wants to be accused of racism; it is one of those strong and highly-charged words which can easily be used not only to struggle against injustice but also to attack and to brand people.
The shadow declaration which preceded the NGO Conference on Racism, in which Israel was accused of racism - without any simultaneous condemnation of anti-semitism - created a distorted starting point for the UN conference.
We Members of the European Parliament, too, have seen with our own eyes how anti-semitism appears in the form of naked racism in Palestinian textbooks.
The tone of debate was unfair to Israel when account is taken of its past and the obvious desire of hostile States to deny Israel's very right to exist.
I certainly do not deny the problems of the Palestinians; these need to be rectified.
But no solution will be generated by obfuscating facts in one way or the other.
It is tragicomic that, while condemning discrimination, one is guilty of that very thing oneself.
This unfairness unfortunately harmed the credibility of the NGOs and damaged the prestige of the Conference on Racism.
As a friend of the civic society and of NGOs I particularly regret this: by its lack of consideration, this body has weakened its own credibility and future operating prospects.
I very much appreciate the way in which the most respected human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch immediately dissociated themselves from the text of the NGO conference.
Similarly, I wish to thank the representative of the presiding State, Belgium, whose intervention on behalf of the EU justifiably stressed that the conflict in the Middle East is a political one and should not be treated in a conference on racism at all.
What, then, should have been discussed?
What did all this political talk crowd out?
According to Amnesty International, many critical matters such as the treatment of refugees, human trafficking, persecution based on the caste system, and the rights of gypsies threatened to remain unnoticed.
And, unfortunately, this is what happened.
The Indian untouchables, for example, made strong efforts to bring up their own plight in the NGO forum on racism.
Discrimination against untouchables is, according to them, a hidden form of apartheid.
Mr President, the Durban Conference provided an important opportunity to condemn the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia, sending out a clear and powerful message, the need for and importance of which remain highly relevant today.
The twentieth century bore witness to the most horrendous crimes committed in the name of racist doctrines which, we should bear in mind, took place in Europe, whose civilisation was the birthplace of the great declarations on rights.
The Durban Conference, however, was much more than an exercise in the duty of remembrance.
Durban reminded us that the modern world has proved itself incapable of eradicating racism and xenophobia from its societies and these, even in Europe, continue to create victims and underlie violent conflicts.
Unfortunately, some people have succumbed to the Manichean philosophy, lacking in any historical rigour, that gives Europe a disproportionate and over-simplified responsibility for all the evils and oppression associated with racism, such as the use of slavery.
Europe does not reject its history, neither the enlightened times nor its darker moments, but nor must it allow it to be crassly manipulated.
Europe must not allow its history to become a mere settling of accounts, with the past being placed in the dock in order to exonerate the present time and conceal modern responsibilities for the persistence of the abject and anachronistic phenomenon of slavery and, more generally, of the systematic violation of fundamental rights.
Judging history with the eyes of the present is a pernicious exercise in populism that simplifies the complex and, consequently, offends the truth.
Manicheism seeks to segregate fanaticism and use the whole gamut of crusades that interpret history as an endless struggle between Good and Evil.
A fanatic, by definition, has no interlocutors, only enemies.
History is not merely the balancing of criminal offences and civil compensation laid down in current legislation.
We reject this pointless exercise.
The European Union' s political responsibility for affirming the universal values inherent to human dignity is both domestic and international because it is inherent to the most intimate raison d' Ãªtre of our common project.
Our collective European responsibility is expressed in the unreserved confirmation of our place in the front line of combat, by the universal affirmation of human rights and rights protecting against racism and xenophobia and in the determination to pursue and extend its constructive role on the international stage, by liberating humanity from all discrimination based on hatred, prejudice and ignorance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would nonetheless like to briefly respond to the speakers with some considerations, and perhaps with some more detailed information.
First of all, I agree to an extent, as Mr Van Hecke said, I agree to an extent with him in believing we must ensure that we prepare very thoroughly for a conference of this kind.
I think that, essentially, we have, to a certain degree, paid a heavy price for the fact that a number of shortfalls were perceived in the preparations for this conference.
I believe, to use a term that you are familiar with, that there were still far too many 'leftovers' at Durban, which obviously made the task at hand much more complicated.
I therefore think that this preparation is obviously extremely important.
My second comment in relation to this type of conference: I am not sure whether to want to draw up a document that provides a comprehensive list of every situation would not be a mistake, and whether or not, at the end of the day, this would adversely affect the substance of the final document.
By this I mean that, if we had a more concise text, with a specific number of principles that can be generally applied, I feel that we would probably be able to produce a stronger text.
And we can even question whether or not the European Union could perhaps at some point contemplate doing this, in other words, glean from the Durban Conference a basic framework, which would facilitate the roll-out of the Durban achievements in each Member State.
I have heard many people ask the question, 'So, that was Durban - what comes next?'
Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that what happens next depends in the main on the Member States.
I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go.
Secondly, I think that each State can very easily put the finishing touches to or devise its own specific action programme to combat racism, based on what was done at Durban, drawing its inspiration from these principles and from what was agreed at Durban.
I also listened earlier to the Commissioner very clearly saying that the Commission was also planning to take some very specific measures.
I think that the Commission has already been working on this matter for some time.
I therefore feel that there will be a follow-up, that there will be another conference after Durban if that is what we want.
In fact, this comes down to the usual question of political will.
Naturally, I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the speakers who have expressed their appreciation of my work, which is much too generous.
I believe that I had the support of some extremely competent people from the Commission, Council, and of course from my own delegation.
I was also able to count on all those representing the various European countries.
I feel that it was logical to do the work that we did.
I think that it was perfectly natural.
I would like to perhaps respond to a number of comments about what is lacking in the documents.
Yes, they naturally lack a number of points.
For example, why is there no mention at all of the caste system in the documents adopted at Durban?
This is a particularly important subject for the European Union, I am aware of this, and what is more, I share this concern.
As you know, the European Union is concerned about situations involving discrimination throughout the world; therefore it was natural that we also express this concern.
We closely followed developments regarding this problem and we supported a paragraph put forward by Switzerland, discussing this problem. The text makes references to discrimination based on ancestry and occupation, which clearly describes types of discrimination, the helpless victims of which live in several countries around the world.
Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the European Union and other countries, particularly South America, it was not possible to reach an agreement with India on this paragraph.
Since this conference was based on consensus, as you know, the text was therefore withdrawn, and this is something I regret.
However, we must also remain realistic and realise that we cannot achieve everything.
One speaker quite rightly mentioned the problem of the death penalty. This is a subject that is of particular personal concern to me.
As you know, the abolition of the death penalty is one of the European Union' s priorities.
I believe that we are right to reiterate this, and we are endeavouring to use every possible opportunity we are given at international level to push forward the debate on this issue.
This was the case at the Durban conference.
The European Union supported a paragraph of the action programme referring to racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty.
The United States strongly opposed this paragraph during the preparatory process, however, and several countries, particularly those in Asia, also rejected it and, without consensus, it was not possible to retain this text either.
I am obviously giving these examples in order to convince you that your concerns were relayed and were expressed in Durban, but unfortunately we could not achieve everything.
I would like to briefly mention the behaviour of the NGOs throughout the conference.
As stressed in the documents adopted at Durban, civil society, and NGOs therefore, have an important role to play in the fight against racism.
That is why the NGO forum organised prior to the Intergovernmental Conference was particularly important for the European Union.
In my view, this is also the reason why the European Commission funded most of those taking part in the forum.
Unfortunately, although the forum provoked some interesting debates, I, myself, took part in a debate that I found extremely interesting, the forum followed a process that was, at times, dubious and, at others, totally undemocratic.
Extremist organisations seem to have monopolised the discussion, which forced Member States to disregard the conclusions of the forum.
Some NGOs, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and FIDH, also disassociated themselves from the forum' s outcome.
Moreover, we must admit that the aggressive approach and disgraceful verbal abuse from some NGOs raises the question as to why the European Union and its Member States as well - my own country included - give their unconditional support to these organisations.
I think that we must also discuss with the NGOs such issues as their accountability, their representativeness and the confines of their responsibilities.
As I have already said, I enjoyed a very good relationship with most of the NGOs, and I also acknowledge that they have a specific role to play.
Earlier, I heard Mrs Boumediene-Thiery use a rather subversive term - which is a great credit to you, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery - but we could have a fundamental difference of opinions.
Personally speaking, as a democratically elected politician, I am not willing to give up my prerogative to assume political responsibility on behalf of the people.
I have been elected, the people can therefore reject me, which is what I call responsibility, and I must also be accountable to the people - these are, essentially, my two duties.
I am not therefore willing to let this prerogative be taken away from me because, when this system of political responsibility ceases to exist, we would no longer have a democracy, in other words.
And that is something that I cannot accept.
I did want to bring up one particular subject - which Mr Sylla mentioned, I believe - that of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, which is one of many forms of discrimination.
The European Union was in favour of highlighting the many forms of discrimination that affect some classes of people.
This concept is certainly present in the texts.
However, when it came to defining potential sources of these many forms of discrimination, it was not possible to include concepts that the European Union considers to be important, such as discrimination based on sexual orientation.
This idea was firmly opposed by some countries, as you suspected.
The only aspects that everyone found acceptable were the sources of discrimination listed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in other words, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political belief or any other belief, national or social origin, wealth, birth or any other situation.
What are we doing in terms of following up this conference?
I shall conclude by reiterating my earlier point that it would be the task of each Member State to follow up the Durban Conference, but it has already been decided that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights will primarily be responsible for providing this follow-up.
Several measures must be implemented, particularly the creation of an anti-discrimination unit within the Office of the High Commissioner and the appointment of five highly-regarded independent experts, who will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the provisions contained in the action programme and the political declaration.
These experts will be appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General.
Naturally, I wanted to provide you with this clarification, first of all because I was also keen to congratulate those speakers who made such relevant comments, and I wanted to tell them that their strong convictions have served as a significant driving force and support enabling us to defend the points of view that we expressed on your behalf in Durban.
In accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions to end the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Vehicles designed to carry more than eight passengers
The next item is the report (A5-0312/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver' s seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC (C5-0278/2001 - 1997/0176(COD)).
Madam President, I welcome everybody here again tonight.
I see a good number of familiar faces.
I wish to pay tribute to my shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour, who again is attending a late-night sitting with me.
We probably spend more nights together than we do with our respective wives.
I should also like to pay tribute to a number of people who have worked on this report, not just within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market but also within the Commission and the Council.
It was not a difficult conciliation but it was successful and I was very pleased at the outcome.
I should also like to give the thanks of probably about a third of the population of the European Union to Parliament, for I am anticipating that the vote tomorrow will go the right way.
There are something like 35 million registered disabled people within the European Union; we have 120 million elderly people.
The two groups are obviously not mutually exclusive, but they make up about a third of the population of the European Union.
The outcome of tomorrow's vote will very largely decide what their quality of life in the future will be.
For years now people with disabilities have not been able to get around the towns and cities of the European Union as they should; they have been trapped for too long in their own houses.
If this directive is adopted tomorrow, it will open up that door.
It will be one small step towards freeing a lot of people who, as I said earlier, have been trapped.
I would like to convey their thanks to Parliament.
I realise that some of my colleagues on the right of this House have had difficulties with this directive, mainly because of its technical nature.
I fully understand and appreciate that.
However, I would ask them at this late stage to consider what we are doing, because if this directive is adopted tomorrow, it is something that everybody in Parliament could be proud of, because we would be improving the lives of the citizens of the European Union.
For once we would be making a difference.
Too often we stand up in this Chamber and talk about various great plans, schemes and motions, etc. and they do not impact on people's lives.
Here is a small thing that does impact on the lives of the European citizen and it is something we should all be proud of.
I understand my colleagues on the right will be abstaining tomorrow.
That is unfortunate but it is, at least, an improvement on voting against in the second reading.
I would ask them, however, to look at this again and cast their votes in favour, because all along I have tried to leave out the technicalities and have concentrated purely on the policy and philosophy of getting people with disabilities mobile again.
That is an aim and objective I think we would all agree with.
In that respect, I have really not much more to say, because this has been discussed at length.
The Commissioner is well aware of the contents of the report and probably could recite them as well as I could.
Finally, I should like to thank very much all those who have helped draft this report and who tomorrow will help to adopt it.
Madam President, once again it is a genuine pleasure to be working with my friend Mr Miller.
I want to pay tribute to him for his persistence in working through this, and particularly for the masterly way in which he handled the conciliation process.
This is the first time I have been involved in a trialogue, so I have been able to study the process at work.
Indeed, as he says, we have reached a very satisfactory outcome.
I fully supported the final compromise and, indeed, the benefits that it will deliver.
It is important that we finally, after five long years, bring this to a close.
In a moment I shall refer to some of the issues involved.
However, it is important to add that, in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about, we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed.
The buses are only part of it.
That is something that we have not been able to tackle but that other committees will wish to look at.
What about the principles?
He quite rightly said - I tipped him off beforehand - that we will be abstaining on this.
It will go through tomorrow.
We certainly do not wish to obstruct it or vote against the conciliation procedure, but we feel, on this side of the House, that the principles that led us to vote against this last time - and my colleague, Mr RÃŒbig, who will speak later, is a veteran of the previous process - are entirely consistent.
So we will not be obstructing it.
It will go on its way with our qualified support.
Mr Miller has played the role of the man riding the last dinosaur, if I may put it that way.
Commissioner Liikanen told us at second reading in the debate that he does not envisage bringing a regulation of this complexity before Parliament again. That is absolutely the right approach.
I want to take the opportunity to say to the House tonight that I, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, have made a proposal to other committees and to the Commission on ways in which Parliament can exercise its political role in scrutinising and putting forward ideas for motor vehicle regulation.
We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation, specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and, indeed, covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about.
That will allow this Parliament, through all its various committees, to take a serious look at the political content of regulation and not ever again become immersed for five years in this sort of complex, technical regulation - a process that we finally sign off this evening.
Mr President, one of the objectives of the directive is to improve access to public transport for persons of reduced mobility.
The European Parliament and the Council seriously disagreed on this point.
The European Parliament' s insistence on provisions to facilitate access for persons of reduced mobility, especially wheelchair users, was vindicated, as was the rapporteur, Mr Miller.
The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with the position taken by the European Parliament, proves yet again how important issues such as the quality of life can only be promoted through courageous policies which are free from technocrats' reservations and financial considerations.
The proposed directive introduces a broader definition of the term 'persons of reduced mobility' , stipulating that it includes all people who experience some difficulty when using public transport, especially the elderly and the disabled.
Reduced mobility does not necessary depend on some form of medical complaint.
This is an important innovation which could be used as the starting point for similar adjustments to give substance to policy on the quality of life.
To be specific, disability may take different forms, including not just physical mobility but also intellectual and sensory impairment.
Therefore, it also includes people who merely have limb impairments, are of small stature, pregnant women etc. It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface.
It is also worth pointing out that it does not limit itself to vehicle specifications; in order to ensure passengers can board safely, it also makes provision for easier access through local infrastructure planning.
This should guarantee safe, pavement-level boarding by all persons of reduced mobility.
I would like to believe that the spirit of agreement achieved here will prevail over other similar endeavours.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about this directive is above all a dispute about principles, about whether we, in the European Union of the future, want the principle of harmonisation, that of mutual recognition or the 'third version' - where do we need the one and where the other?
We have achieved only a small partial success with this directive on the EC procedure for approving vehicle types because, of course, national procedures for type approval still apply concurrently with, and in addition to, the directive which is now being laid down.
What we want matters here, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr Miller for working so hard to ensure that what we want prevails.
This is, of course, not true of national procedures for type approval, which prevail at present and will continue to prevail in future.
The success is a very modest one, and we will therefore be abstaining tomorrow, because it does not go far enough for us, because we would actually have liked a general regulation for all buses.
I must also say that the Commission's proposal was a very, very good one in terms of content and from the points of view of engineering and technology, but must be rejected absolutely on the grounds of logic.
At first reading, we had 160 pages of detailed Commission proposals on the table, Members worked out another 110 amendments to them, and I think this House and, at the end of the day, Europe as a whole, is overburdened with this sort of detail.
The state of affairs we will be deciding on tomorrow is such that we have now even fixed the curvature of the rear panel of a bus at a normative maximum of 150 mm.
Even compared with the European standard cucumber, that is a sensational success!
Madam President, I wish to congratulate Parliament and, in particular, its Conciliation Committee and the rapporteur, Mr Miller, on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this very important directive.
I should like to stress that, with this directive, the European Community will be setting the pace and enabling the industry to compete under common rules to produce safe and more accessible buses and coaches for the benefit of all European public transport users.
This directive makes significant progress in three areas, namely the internal market, the transport policy and the social policy of the Community.
The access provisions for buses and coaches as regards boarding by persons with reduced mobility will ensure that a larger proportion of our citizens use public transport.
I should like to reply to the question by Mr Harbour.
I received the letter based on his proposal from the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, and I have sent him a detailed reply, which supports this initiative.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
GALILEO
The next item is the report (A5-0288/2001) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on GALILEO (COM(2000) 750 - C5-0110/2001 - 2001/2059(COS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, we are latecomers; time is running away from us and, above all, from the GALILEO project.
The longer the European Union hesitates in getting the European satellite navigation system underway, the more both industry and the people will react to it with apathy.
The ultimate danger is that GALILEO will one day be buried.
My anxieties increase when I recall some of the statements made to me over the years when I worked on the European satellite navigation project.
The position Parliament has taken with regard to the Commission's communication does not, admittedly, possess any legislative character, but points in an important direction.
I hope that it will be by a large majority that Parliament will adopt my report tomorrow and thus support the position that Europe urgently needs a satellite navigation system of its own, not least in view of the special situation in which Europe and the rest of the world find themselves since 11 September.
The Council also holds this fundamental view, as again confirmed by the final conclusions from Stockholm.
How, though, may we clear away the doubts that surface again and again, even in the amendments before us?
The fundamental issue is now as it was before: why do we need a European satellite navigation system of our own, when the Americans have already supplied a working model in the form of GPS?
Let me quote some of the main arguments.
The first is that the American system is conceived on military lines, with resultant disadvantages as regards continuity of availability, precision, and also legal certainty.
What concerns us here is reliability, which must be guaranteed even in a crisis.
It must be clear to all of us that Europe's sovereignty and security would be gravely imperilled if the navigation systems were to be taken out of European control.
We quite evidently need our own civilian system which, however, must be available to all - and I emphasise all - potential users.
I regret therefore that I am unable to support the amendments newly reintroduced by the GUE/NGL Group, which demand a purely civilian use.
Secondly: we are pressing for free competition not only within the EU, but also worldwide.
It can, then, be only a cause for amazement if we readily accept a monopoly from a foreign State and expose our users to the risk of provision being less than optimal.
We must commit ourselves to the best interests of our citizens and users.
Thirdly: if the European Union were to do without its own system, it would fall back massively in the high technology sector.
That can surely not be the intention.
On the contrary, we want to see Europe at the top, and for that we need GALILEO.
Fourthly: GALILEO creates employment in Europe.
The jobs created are for the highly qualified and in a sector with a future, namely high technology.
The building-up of the infrastructure and the many potential applications could create up to 100 000 jobs in the next few years and result in high earnings in the market.
Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe?
In my report, I have described at length the advantages and positive aspects for the various fields of application.
These advantages become all the more convincing if we succeed in involving other countries in the project.
For example, China expressed interest only recently, at the Brussels Summit.
Europe is capable of developing its own system.
We are not going to keep GALILEO, like a confection, for our own enjoyment, but will offer it to those of our partners who are willing to have it, and we will let those partners share in the great benefits.
As we want to offer the best service possible, we set great store on compatibility with other systems from the outset.
Industry is showing an interest, as demonstrated by the EUR 200 million pledged to the Commission as a statement of intent, but we must not make excessive demands on Europe's industry.
The wheels of industry will not start rolling without a clear and definite political signal, a green light given by us.
The preparatory work done by the Commission and the European Space Agency deserves high praise.
Now, though, I await expectantly the Commission's financial and administrative framework, as called for in the report.
This framework will be a further building block and a weight-bearing pillar for developing our own satellite navigation system.
GALILEO is a Community project - incidentally, the first in this field, which makes it a vision for the future!
Let us now, then, get to grips with it, instead of putting it off forever and a day, for GALILEO will revolutionise transport and mobility, just as the Internet has done.
Success stories - of which we in Europe can already claim a few - require careful thought, courage and decisiveness.
Let us make good use of this historic moment when we vote tomorrow!
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the Commission communication on GALILEO, I will confine myself in this speech to the financial side of the project.
At the current stage, GALILEO does not comply with the statement on financial programming, which was adopted by the three institutions on 20 July 2000. According to this statement, 'the budgetary authority must have accurate information about the financial consequences of each new proposal presented by the Commission, in order to be able to assess the impact of the proposal on the ceilings of the financial perspective (...)' .
Furthermore, at a meeting of EU transport ministers in April 2001, it became clear that the Union had major problems finding the extra EUR 1.5 billion required from private sources for the deployment phase (2006-2007) of GALILEO.
On the other hand, the Commission states that when it issued a call for an expression of interest in order to establish the conditions needed in order to set up a public-private partnership, several European industrial consortia responded to this, without reference to any further problems.
I would like to make it clear that I support the Commission' s approach in principle.
Nevertheless, I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected.
I consider that the budgetary authority should have a clear picture of GALILEO' s source of funding before it can commit appropriations to the project.
The identification of the sources and amounts of private funding should be concurrent with the identification of public funding.
Financing needs should be met by 2002.
Then, Parliament should demand prior consultation of the budgetary authority in the event that the expenditure to be financed from the general budget is to be revised.
This would ensure that no restrictions are placed on other activities financed under heading 3 if GALILEO does not attract the investments foreseen by the Commission.
However, following my approach, in a situation of crisis, the European Union would have the possibility to use the satellite navigation services provided by GALILEO without having to rely on other (primarily military) satellite systems operated by the United States and Russia such as GPS and GLONASS, although it would still be compatible with them.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to give our opinion on the GALILEO programme, taking into account the decisions made, namely by the Stockholm European Council on 23 March 2001.
At this Council meeting, great emphasis was placed on the need to launch this satellite navigation programme immediately.
Our Committee acknowledges the benefits of such a programme, the main feature of which is that it is European as well as civilian in nature, and is therefore independent of systems developed by the military, such as the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems, and that is reliable and has greater precision than these two existing systems.
We are proposing, however, that the following points be implemented during the development and validation phase from 2001 to 2005, the deployment phase from 2006 to 2007, and the operation phase, which begins in 2008, essentially under the aegis of the European Space Agency and the Commission.
First of all, we must accurately monitor the funding, initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion, as well as the partners chosen, particularly private industries, and their involvement. We must also carry out an in-depth analysis of the cost-effectiveness and the implications for the economy and employment.
We are demanding the greatest level of transparency in this matter and to receive regular information from Parliament.
Secondly, we stress the fact that the structures established during the development of the programme should be used solely for civilian purposes, and we point out that it is vital, in this case, to develop the use of space for purposes related to the general interest and public service.
Thirdly, the GALILEO programme must not be applied in such a way that will jeopardise the right to or the protection of privacy and it must not under any circumstances be used for the surveillance of citizens.
It must, in particular, be developed in order to protect and safeguard the environment, to protect the lives of citizens and natural resources, and ensure early detection and even prevention of natural or man-made disasters.
It must also contribute to progress in European research, when drawing up the future Sixth Framework Programme.
Lastly, we are proposing - and this is important - to set up an advisory ethics committee, whose task would be to ensure respect for the aforementioned requirements and which would assist the Commission and the European Space Agency in their decision-making duties.
I want to emphasise - and I call on Mrs De Palacio to give us her point of view - the fact that it will be civilian organisations that set up the system.
Of course, we cannot say that, 'we will not vote in favour of GALILEO if it is used by the military in the future' , because, when we set up transport and communication systems, for instance, anyone can use them.
What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US.
We believe that these various provisions are realistic conditions, which must accompany and justify GALILEO, and we would also hope to hear Mrs De Palacio' s point of view on setting up the ethics committee.
Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, competition stimulates business, as the example of the motor industry over the last 100 years has shown.
The fact that there were at least three major production centres, the USA, Europe and Asia, was extremely good for business all round.
Airbus is another good example of what can be achieved by exposure to international competition, if we are not simply content for other people to make a good product that we can buy or even use free of charge like the GPS.
It will be no different with what we are discussing today - the GALILEO satellite navigation system.
Of course it is no bad thing that GPS exists.
Of course it is no bad thing, it may even be a good thing, that in many cases it is available to users free of charge.
But that there is, to all intents and purposes, only an American system is not good at all.
The Russian GLONASS is probably not entirely in the same category.
We Europeans have no real rights of access.
The examples there have been in the past have shown that we are suddenly bereft of navigation in one case or another.
Almost more important and quite central from my point of view as a university teacher is that we have no real involvement in technological innovation if we are not engaged in development ourselves, if we do not carry out research ourselves and if we do not ourselves take research to the applications stage so that it can also go into industrial production.
We need both, we need access and we need technological development.
We cannot talk about a society of knowledge and learning without taking the next logical step.
Above all, too, we also need the many potential applications in transport.
I believe that requires no further explanation.
Admittedly there are also problems when it comes to GALILEO.
The problems of finance have still not really been resolved.
Industry is still biding its time, waiting for public funding, while the public authorities in turn plead Maastricht criteria, empty pockets and the like. Hopefully there will sooner or later be a genuine public and private partnership in this matter.
A last word on the tricky subject of double use or only civilian use.
I cannot understand the naivety of many of the tabled amendments.
There is not only good in the world.
The events of 11 September were a cruel demonstration of that.
Finally a word of thanks and appreciation to the two ladies who have made such a big contribution to this evening' s report, the rapporteur Brigitte Langenhagen and the Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio.
Neither of them lost their bearings in dealing with this topic.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen on her excellent work, which also received a notably favourable vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I hope that the same will happen tomorrow when the House votes on the report, since this is a particularly important, even historic text for the European Union.
The European Union is a major power.
Europe is a major player in the aviation and space industries, but the European Union does not have aviation and space power, since it has never had a policy in this area until now and, as Mrs Langenhagen said, GALILEO is a historic beginning for us, our first Community programme.
The GALILEO programme is all the more important because it guarantees that the high technology and the activity of our industries will be maintained in the future, since 150 000 jobs will be created.
GALILEO represents the political independence of the European Union, since, as you are aware, we had no frequency access during the Kosovo war due to the American GPS system, and as things stand at the moment, we cannot count on the American system being completely reliable in the coming years.
I therefore believe that it is crucial that we consider the success of GALILEO as vital in ensuring the EU' s credibility over the next few years in an area where competition in the aviation and space industries is increasingly marked, particularly when faced with new competition, for instance from China or Japan.
We are also concerned about how this operation is funded, about the delays in its implementation and that it has been postponed on numerous occasions.
Let us be clear about one thing - in the space industry, as in all the other transport industries, nothing can be achieved without State funding and without a boost from the government, whether this is direct State funding or so-called co-funding, along the lines of the American model, where the military sector funds the civilian.
We must be aware of this situation.
With regard to infrastructure, it is very difficult to find private sector investment, therefore we must be prepared, the Commission is not only responsible for this, Member States are responsible as well.
The Council must certainly be made aware of this.
This is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not want to increase the number of obstacles.
We shall not vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left or the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the funding method, whereby the GALILEO programme must be halted if private sector investment is not sufficient. This is because we believe GALILEO is a crucial programme for the future of the European Union and for the future of European space policy.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to Mrs Langenhagen for the huge amount of work she has carried out on this topic.
It has been a long haul, with obstacles and unruliness along the way, and the end is certainly not yet in sight.
However, we are taking an important decision tomorrow, which will bring us one step closer to our goal.
International developments underline the importance of having a system of our own, but at the same time, of establishing sound international cooperation, so that interoperability of the system can be achieved.
I should like to mention three other points which the ELDR Group considers important.
First of all, the management structure.
To the ELDR Group, it is important that the management is transparent, and we are already glad of a major step forward by the Council, namely the proposal to set up a single administrative structure in agreement with Article 171 of the Treaty.
The second point I should like to raise is the financial concern.
We are still not entirely convinced that that is going in the right direction.
We accept that at the beginning, public money must be invested, but industry must contribute too.
There must be a balance.
There is still no binding agreement with the private sector and there is still uncertainty in that area.
That is why we have tabled an amendment for which I should ask your support, so that the European Union does not become a safety net.
And given the high cost, we expect a contribution towards the cost of the use.
Improved geographical access and reliability must be factors in favour of which industry must choose and in which they must display willingness to invest.
That is exactly what makes the system first-rate.
Madam President, Commissioner, a great deal of work has been done. A report has been drawn up.
That too took up a lot of time.
However, a whole host of arguments are being put forward, with which - let there be no mistake - I entirely disagree.
The wrong arguments are being used in order to sell a project.
Let me start with the technology.
Some people claim that superior technology is being used here.
That is absolutely not the case.
GPS is a similar system.
Our system is slightly better because it uses ground stations.
As a result, it is slightly more reliable and communication is possible.
But the subsequent generations of GPS II - did you think the Americans were mad? - and GPS III are just as capable.
No problem whatsoever.
If we consider the levels concerned, the first level is an open access system, which is free.
It is similar to GPS with matching criteria: same height, same accuracy in terms of horizontality, etc. The subsequent systems CAS I and CAS II are commercial and intended for the government, while the latter system is also used for military purposes.
To quote another point on which people appear to be misinformed: it is also possible for CAS II to be switched off at regional level if it is used for military purposes.
You may not have been aware of this, but that is the case.
All in all: GALILEO is not more accurate, and it cannot be switched off.
In summary, all those technological features which have been listed, also for transport, are also very much part of the current system.
Where military use is concerned, we are agreed that we do not want this in any event.
I will not enter into the detail of the arguments, but at this moment in time, in the light of 11 September, I do not find it necessary to highlight the need of such a system once again.
It is somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion.
It is clear that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has agreed to the wording for civil use, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has not.
It will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings when the amendments are tabled.
As for the funding, the Council has launched an enquiry.
It appears that there are actually no business partners.
One and a half billion must be coughed up.
Two hundred million is being freed up indirectly and it is suggested that that funding is now available.
The problem in this connection is that it is the same people who have freed up tens of billions for UMTS.
