Is NATO to be a constituent part of European identity?
We can, emphatically, do better in terms of European ambition, the rehabilitation of politics and the promotion of responsibility on the part of individual citizens.
As you very rightly stated, never forget the citizens, Mr Giscard d'Estaing.
I await your reply.
Mr President, the text adopted by the Convention indisputably represents a step forward for European democracy.
Many of our demands have been complied with: the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the improvement of the legislative process, including the introduction of the citizens' right of legislative initiative; the inclusion among the Union's goals of a number of aims, and we will fight and enlist the citizens' support to see them achieved; full employment, fair trade, pluralism, the protection of human rights, conflict prevention, the sustainable development of the earth.
It is thanks to results such as these that we can now claim this text as our own too and undertake to defend it in the coming months.
Clearly, however, for us, this European constitutional process is not yet finished.
We do not share the opinion of those who believe that this was the best that the Convention could do.
In particular, it failed to bring instruments and policies into line with its most innovative objectives, it preserved the unanimity requirement and it further increased the Council's supremacy in key areas of the Union's competences.
While we acknowledge the high quality of its work, we feel that the way in which the Praesidium and you, yourself, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, conducted the Convention's work, the rules chosen to govern the process, must be carefully assessed and analysed, for they have had a definite effect on the quality of the text adopted.
It was a serious strategic error to agree right from the beginning to the Convention being polluted by the very intergovernmental method that it was trying to leave behind.
Clearly, this shifted the emphasis of the debate from what the Union should do and how to who wins and who loses under the new rules, which is typical of an Intergovernmental Conference and the basic cause of the regrettable failure of Nice.
We have two practical proposals for the future: the Chairman of the Convention must be elected by the Convention itself and its work must be conducted more explicitly according to the Parliamentary method, which, although based on the search for consensus, is also based on the rule of majority voting.
We have two extremely important challenges ahead, the first of which is certainly to prevent the positive results achieved by the Convention being nullified during the Intergovernmental Conference by the endeavours of those same governments which were opposed to the Convention and now want to challenge its work.
That would be unacceptable and, I would venture to say, unlawful.
Over and above the provisions of the Treaties, it is clear that the most important innovation of the Convention has been to take away the governments' monopoly on reform of the Union.
It is unthinkable that we should have to go back on this achievement, and it is not acceptable that essential parts of the text should be amended without the explicit agreement of Parliament, at least: this is clearly quite different from merely inviting a couple of observers to the meetings.
In this sense, it would appear to be particularly important to highlight Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposal to make the different phases of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference completely transparent and public.
Lastly, Mr President, it is absolutely essential to abolish the unanimity requirement for revision of the Constitution and to introduce power of ratification for the European Parliament.
If it is not possible to do this, if the unanimity safety mechanism is preserved, it is not difficult to predict what will happen in the future: the Union will be unable to move forward, unable to act, and, in the long term, it will become increasingly insignificant and divided.
The actual historic import of the Convention's work will depend, not least, on the Italian Presidency.
Mr Fini, Mr Frattini, you must defend the text adopted by the Convention from some of your impetuous colleagues. You must be open to improvements and endeavour to make it a text that can be developed and changed.
In this you will have our full support.
Mr President, please do not imagine, because of the brevity of some of what I have to say, that I am being in any way malicious. It is simply that I have a limited amount of time in which to speak.
I should like first of all to say that no midwife, be it in the field of obstetrics or politics, has the ability to get rid of congenital deformities.
Whatever the intellectual virtues of the Convention and of its President and of those of our eminent fellow MEPs who have taken part in this work - most notably the vice-presidents of my group, Mrs Muscardini and Mr QueirÃ³ - it was certainly very naÃ¯ve to believe, or to lead others to believe, that a European Constitution might in itself permit the transformation of a technocratic European structure into a democratic political body.
Everyone agrees in thinking of the European Union as a democracy.
If there is in fact to be a constitution, it can, therefore, only proceed from the constituent power, that is to say the sovereign people, and it can only be ratified by that same sovereign people.
Now, where is the constituent power?
No one in this Convention has been given the slightest popular mandate to devise a constitution, and I am also surprised to hear members of the Convention, including the most eminent among them, say that no modification whatsoever to the document that has been drawn up would be acceptable, either at the Intergovernmental Conference or, even, at European Council level.
That is an outrageous claim.
Given the importance in principle of a constitutional document, I would add that only a referendum would be able to legalise this great institutional change in the EU.
What referendum, however?
Of necessity, a European referendum, that is to say a consultation organised on the same day in each Member State.
Apart from the fact that the referendum procedure is not anticipated in all the Member States, how, in any case, would the outcome be assessed?
At European level as a whole?
At national level?
In that case, what would happen if the majority of people in a single Member State voted 'no'?
No satisfactory answer has been given to any of these questions.
A political impasse has been reached, since the two questions upon which success depends have not been asked.
How is the power of the populations to approve or reject the stages of this construction to be preserved?
Moreover, do the peoples of Europe want to construct an independent Europe capable of influencing the balance of world power?
That is what I wanted to say to you on behalf of a group united in its diversity.
Let us, therefore, keep our feet on the ground and stick with the principles forming the basis of genuine European integration: the peoples and the nations.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Convention, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having taken great pleasure in the excellent things Mr Pasqua had to say, I should like to remind you that, as history teaches us, it is better to design a constitution once the revolution has been carried out, rather than the other way around.
Sadly, that was not the case when it came to devising this would-be European Constitution which amounts in practice to what is, so far, a friendly game of musical chairs between old and new, small and large countries and within and between the European institutions themselves.
There were, however, Mr President, many revolutions we could have engaged in.
We could have effected an economic and social revolution, overturning what President Prodi called the stupid dogmas, established in Maastricht and reinforced in Amsterdam, that, increasingly with every day that passes, manifestly condemn Europe and, in particular, the euro zone to deflation and unemployment.
We could have effected a political revolution by declaring our independence, affirming our vision of a multipolar world and defending the central role of the United Nations in world affairs.
We could even have effected a cultural revolution by establishing, in opposition to the commercial organisation of the world, the right of peoples freely to choose their way of life and their own allegiances.
We might, above all, have effected a democratic revolution by turning Europe into an extension of our national democracies, instead of arranging the latter's demise, and by creating a genuine political space peculiar to Europe through the Congress you proposed and by having recourse to a referendum.
In order to do this, however, we ought no doubt to have been inspired more by Rousseau than by Montesquieu.
Everyone knows that you chose a tortoise as a symbol, no doubt, of punctiliousness and perseverance, but not really of revolution.
That is a pity.
That is why I doubt if the peoples and citizens of Europe - they amount, moreover, to more or less the same thing - would identify with this Constitution that there is a desire to impose upon them.
It remains to be seen, moreover, who will be courageous enough to organise a referendum.
I should like to add a small PS for the attention of the Intergovernmental Conference: 'Do not abandon Strasbourg'.
Mr President of the Convention, you once asked the Convention a question that was simultaneously pertinent and impertinent and to which we have never had a reply.
When the working party's report on legal personality was presented, you asked: 'To what exactly would you accord legal personality?
To a state or to an international organisation?'
It was an excellent question, but an inconvenient one.
The Convention never replied, preferring not to commit itself.
If, however, it was possible to say at the start that European integration had a character all of its own and that it was a question of a non-identified legal object, the object would now appear more and more easily identifiable as the treaties have come and gone and, above all, at the conclusion of the Convention.
In essence, it takes the form of a state, of a central and supranational decision-making power with its unique institutional framework, its law superseding the national constitutions, its common law majority decision-making procedure and even, now, its Constitution with its constitutional super-court.
Perhaps a number of these elements - in certain lights and considered in isolation - may suggest an international organisation.
They all obviously combine, however, to form the outline of a European state, given the strength, intensity and broad sweep with which they are being applied.
I should also like, in my turn, to ask you a question: do you think that this European superstate really is what our peoples want?
You who quoted surveys to us just now should know that the answer is 'no'.
Our peoples certainly want to see European cooperation. They even want to see more policies with cross-border implications dealt with at European level.
At the same time, however, they want their countries to retain their freedom to take decisions and the freedom to choose their national democracy, the only form of democracy in the full sense of the word to date.
In these conditions, do you not think that the European superstate is a very poor response to a good question?
Mr President, my reply will be brief, since I believe you now have other questions on the agenda.
Do not therefore accuse me subsequently of not expanding upon matters sufficiently.
Consider, rather, that it is a gesture of courtesy in view of the work done by your House.
Mr Fini, I should like to thank you for two things: first of all, your contribution to the work of the Convention, because you have been very much involved.
You are Vice-President of your government, you came to all the sessions, you remained in your seat, you listened, you took your turn to speak and you were - together with others, of course - a model participant in the Convention.
I would also thank you for having given your approval - on behalf, of course, of the Italian Presidency - to the project as a whole and for having emphasised that it was indeed a coherent project.
That is a crucial point.
In fact, we have just heard - and I shall return to this matter - proposals for partial changes.
The disadvantage of these partial changes, however, is that they disturb a balance that we have meticulously constructed together, with a view to ensuring that the project has a cohesion - to use your own expression - that must not be distorted.
Hence, balance must remain the reference point.
You have approved the idea - taken up by a number of members of the Convention, notably by your compatriot - of work that is open and transparent.
I hope that, in regard to the press and public opinion - and I am replying here to Mr Pasqua - this constitutional debate will indeed be an open one.
What I would ask you is, not to dismantle things, not to disappoint and, at the same time, not to be content to adopt a negative attitude, because that is naturally not enough. Rather, it is necessary to take the lead.
The great moments of political excitement are those of progress rather than of disintegration.
At the last session of our Convention, moreover - rather curiously, because no explosion of political emotion was expected - those from a variety of political backgrounds present on all the benches had come together because of the feeling there was that perhaps the new unified Europe had an opportunity to move forward.
Mr Frattini, you will of course have a lot of technical work to do at this Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe that your three principles are sound.
Stick, therefore, to your three principles: respect for the timetable and respect for what you have very properly called the store of wisdom accumulated by the Convention, namely the major legacy of our 1 800 speeches.
It is necessary to make use of these, and the task is therefore one of improving and supplementing.
Improving, yes; supplementing, yes; putting a question mark over, emphatically no.
Mr President of the Commission, we have had debates.
I came to visit you, on my own initiative moreover, in Brussels when our work was almost complete in order to take note of your personal reactions to what our document contained.
You stated that this compromise was incomplete.
We shall see what will be added because, if it is cut drastically, this compromise will be still more incomplete.
You are yourselves parliamentarians from all the Member States, old and new.
Now, it has to be emphasised that the fact that the Convention reached a compromise, with just six dissenters, signified that the compromise was almost complete.
You raised the issue of qualified majority voting.
First of all, whenever, throughout the work of the Convention, qualified majority voting was demanded, I would ask what type of qualified majority was meant.
This point has not been raised.
Now, there are in fact two systems of qualified majority voting.
There is the Nice system, based on a scale, and there is the draft Constitution system, based on a double majority: a majority of the Member States and a majority of the represented population, which we have set at 60%.
It has to be specified, therefore, what type of qualified majority is being talked about.
We are told we should have gone further in the difficult debate on the number of questions that are to be subject to qualified majority voting.
In fact, we have doubled the number, and we have not in fact been able to adopt the universal rule because of obstacles that were insurmountable for one group or another.
I would cite the case of taxation.
Six states participating in the Convention were making taxation an insurmountable obstacle.
We debated with them.
I visited London twice in order to see the British Prime Minister.
We talked about the matter with our other colleagues, since, as you know, other Member States had major reservations about the tax issue.
I hoped right until the end that we might introduce qualified majority voting for market taxation, since the latter is very much linked to the operation of the single market.
In the end, we were able to make a certain degree of progress, since we provided for qualified majority voting in the cases of administrative cooperation and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion.
We were not able to go any further on the basis of consensus.
Mr President of the Commission, we shall see if any further progress is made on the basis of unanimity.
I should like to remind you of a central innovation that has been little talked about: the content of our article on the transition from unanimity to qualified majority voting.
This point is very important because we have put in place an arrangement that, over time, will permit the transition to qualified majority voting.
I would refer you to Article 24(3), enabling us to do in the future - and I also say this with Mr BarÃ³n Crespo in mind - what we have tried to do as much as possible in the Constitution: the European Council will be able to decide unanimously, as specified by the Treaty, to transfer a certain number of framework or European laws to the sphere of qualified majority voting.
In other words, what you are seeking to obtain by negotiation, the European Council will be able to achieve through the exercise of its powers in application of Article 24, paragraphs 4 and 5.
I am not talking about the composition of the Commission.
I would simply say to you, Mr Prodi, that I have here the amendments that have been lodged.
The Convention is familiar with the proposals you have made just now.
They were the subject of debates within the Convention.
Moreover, the new Member States that, at the beginning, were understandably very keen that there should be as many Commissioners as Member States - leading to figures bearing no relation to the number of responsibilities to be exercised by the Commission - have accepted, as we proposed, that the reform should only apply as from 2009.
In other words, all the new countries will have Commissioners for the period 2005-2009.
They will be equally well placed when it comes to constituting a genuine European college whose composition will reflect the number of tasks to be exercised by the Commission and the number that, as President Jacques Delors said, will enable it to retain its collegiate character.
Finally, you talked about natural disasters.
On the initiative of a working party chaired by Commissioner Barnier, Article 42 introduces into the Constitution the opportunity of exercising European solidarity in relation to natural disasters.
Just a word on the problem of the revision procedure, taken up by other speakers.
A number of members of the Convention - even a large number of them - would have liked it to have been possible to deal with this subject, because the revision procedure is going to remain that laid down by the treaties.
Now, it is obvious that, within the framework of a Constitution, there is some sort of internal revision procedure that bypasses the general circuit of treaties and of the twenty-five or twenty-seven ratifications.
We had no mandate for dealing with this subject, but the problem remains unresolved, and I have a sense that, in the years to come - perhaps not within the next 30 years, but certainly in the years to come - the question of a possible future constitutional revision procedure will have to be addressed.
In Europe's current political state, I believe it would be unrealistic to imagine that the views of the Member States might be ignored. A time will come, however, when, just as the transition has been made from unanimity to qualified majority voting, a new procedure will be required in this regard.
I now turn to MEPs' speeches.
I would thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo both for his work within the Convention and for his vision of the role he wishes to see the European Parliament play, a role indeed that the Convention will not be able to perform but that Parliament is in a position to assume.
I shall turn to you, Mr HÃ€nsch, last.
I would say to Mr Poettering that he is from a country that has contributed a lot to music.
Whenever there is a concert - I had the opportunity in Brussels, during the Convention, of hearing the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra - the conductor of the orchestra asks for applause for the musicians.
He asks the musicians to stand so that the audience might applaud them.
That is why I would thank you for the compliments you have paid me, but I should like to share them with the members of the Convention.
The document with which I am presenting you today is a collective, rather than individual, work. It is the fruit of a joint effort.
We have been diligent, Mr Poettering, in dealing with the issues of competences, of the stability of competences and of the monitoring of subsidiarity.
The request that this issue be dealt with was particularly strong in those EU countries that have federal structures.
It was therefore given particular prominence by the German members of the Convention and also by our Spanish partners.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, who speaks all the languages of the EU - a factor that obviously simplifies the debates - was right in saying that ours is a first attempt at democratic construction going beyond the nation state.
It is therefore an original structure, and those who say it would be enough to copy the institutions of the nation state are mistaken because the nation state model would not enable us to deal with the problem of the double legitimacy of the Member States and of the populations.
You wanted to see an open IGC, or Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe that everyone here, particularly the representatives of the Presidency, concur in wishing to respond favourably to your wish.
By a twist of fate, Mr Watson is seated beside Mr Poettering.
My experience enables me to share both their cultures, and I thank Mr Watson for the contribution of his group, which included several influential members of the Convention, among them, incidentally, Mr Duff who has been one of the people most active in carrying our work forward.
Mr Wurtz, your quotations from our document were chosen specifically in order to show that, as you said, the document in a way constitutionalises the liberal economic system in Europe.
Now, if you take Article 3 on the objectives of the EU, which we have debated at length, what do we read?
We read first of all that the EU is an area of freedom for people, an area of freedom in the economic sense of the term with, indeed, the four freedoms laid down by the basic treaties.
We would, however, add to the objectives of the EU a social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress.
We foresee the EU combating social exclusion and discrimination, promoting equality between women and men - which is a crucial point in our documents - and protecting the rights of children.
Alongside economic freedom, which is a spatial freedom, the Constitution therefore carefully describes social objectives.
You talk about articles on EU policy and say that some of these are secret.
They are not secret, but they have to be translated.
At the end of the month, we shall present all of our documents translated into the EU's future 22 languages. That is the explanation for the fact that we have not been able to forward them very quickly.
Whatever the case, the articles in question have not been modified.
These are the articles from the treaties, since we had no mandate to modify them other than to take account of the changes: a new institutional system, changes of name, European laws, framework laws, voting procedures and the legal base for policies.
The actual description of the policies is, however, unchanged except where four of them are concerned: policy relating to economic and social governance, on which considerable progress has been made, even if more might have been wished for; common external policy; common defence policy; and policy relating to security and justice.
Mrs Frassoni, whom I had met in the course of our debates in the Convention, talks about intergovernmental methods.
We have done away with this term, which goes back to the beginning of the Convention.
On the contrary, we wanted to revive the institutional triangle.
There is no intergovernmental element. There are three institutions at work: Parliament, which expresses its opinion; the Commission, which proposes legislation and engages in administration; and the Council of Ministers, which takes the decisions entrusted to it by the Constitution.
That is not an intergovernmental procedure. It is a case of Community decisions being taken by one of the bodies of the EU.
You talk about having the President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament.
You will see that, next time, matters will still take place in accordance with the Treaty of Nice, that is to say that you will do nothing other than give your approval. Your sole power will be that of giving your approval.
With the Constitution, you would be able to vote in an election, and you could refuse the option proposed to you.
Mr Pasqua was wondering about the progression from technocratic structure to political body.
We have tried to progress down that road as far as we could.
He was wondering about our constituent power.
Where, however, are the constituents?
Mr Pasqua, how was the constitutional committee composed that, during the summer of 1958, drafted the constitution of the Fifth Republic?
It was composed of named people.
What is important in the constituent procedure is ratification.
The constituent is whoever ratifies.
In the event, the constituents will be, successively, the European Parliament, the referendums in all those countries able to have recourse to this procedure - as I hope France will - and the national parliaments in cases where this is required by constitutional procedure.
I shall finish, then, by turning to Mr Abitbol, who expressed himself fully within the Convention.
He was, therefore, able to observe that it was a place of free expression.
He was in favour of the congress. So was I, so we have both failed.
That being said, I believe that the question will arise again.
The absence of a 'European political constituency' is a mistake.
There needs to be an arena in which European politicians, both at European and national levels, can meet on an organised basis.
President BarÃ³n Crespo must remember the conference that he organised in Rome and that was very fruitful for having been constructed on that model.
Mr Abitbol is a revolutionary of the kind that every assembly needs.
He reproaches us for having devised the Constitution before having carried out the revolution.
Certainly, the two methods exist, but we ourselves prefer to carry out a revolution under the law.
Many of you will, I hope, take your places in the next European Parliament.
If things happen the way we want them to, your debates will be with a stable President of the European Council who will have to come and provide you with an account of the activities of the EU following each European Council.
You will have an EU Minister of Foreign Affairs to question and, when situations arise such as you have already experienced, there will be someone to whom you can put your questions about why one particular argument is to be defended and not another, or one action participated in and not another.
It will therefore be a revolution under the law and, to use Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's analogy, it will be a revolution Ã  la Montesquieu, but on a continental scale.
My last reply is to Mr HÃ€nsch.
I much appreciated your contributions during the Convention because you defended neither particular interests nor lobbies.
Rather, you were inspired by the common European good; and, although, on certain points, we did not always follow up your proposals because we were seeking balanced, compromise solutions, you have nonetheless inspired many of our advances, particularly in the area of social governance.
You drew attention to the fact that, if the debates we have already had were re-opened, there would be no chance at all of reaching a balanced compromise.
What would be the point of re-opening the debate in the case of each amendment already lodged and discussed, and either adopted in one form or another by the Convention or else ruled out by it?
You made this point in no uncertain terms, and I hope your voice will be heard because - and these are my final words, Mr President - in the present situation, which is one of knowing whether, in a few months' time, Europe will or will not have a Constitution, there are in fact two approaches: either Europe does not provide itself with a Constitution and goes on forever re-opening the same debates, or else it does provide itself with a Constitution, aware that it will be necessary to live with it.
That is why I do not want to see revolutionary fervour bursting forth from your Assembly but, rather, the momentum of a strong desire and a very great aspiration on the part of the peoples of Europe to make progress along the EU road.
(Loud applause)
We will continue our reflection on this matter in two weeks' time when we debate, in depth, the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I thank everyone who has taken part in the debate.
In particular I extend a special 'thank you' to President Giscard d'Estaing for leading and summing up the debate this morning.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
Mr President, the proposal for the 'Constitutional Treaty' has been produced by the most reactionary circles in the capitalist system.
The swaggering of Mr Giscard d'Estaing and those behind him and the rejoicing of the then Greek Presidency and the current Italian Presidency do not suffice to refute the above reality.
Those promoting the anti-grass roots policy have the nerve to call by the name of 'constitution' a text which not only fails to crystallise the democratic achievements of the people, but also reduces them to a text which establishes capitalism constitutionally, which redistributes power for the benefit of the strong, which hands over more national sovereignty to the imperialist, Euro-unifying centre and which dangerously extends the militarisation of the European Union.
The result does not surprise us.
It could not be otherwise, because it could not fail to reflect the nature of the ?U and its current political situation.
That is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the introduction of a European constitution, which strengthens the imperialist ?U to the detriment of the people and for the benefit of the exploiters.
Nor are we surprised at the lack of substantial information on the content of the 'constitution'.
Despite the propaganda campaign, the people must not be deceived.
They must strengthen their fight to defend and extend their achievements, to demolish the structure being built by the exploiters and to finally change society.
.
(FR) Mr Giscard d'Estaing emphasised that the core of the draft constitution drawn up by the Convention was the acknowledgement of the 'dual nature' of the European Union, which is thereby seen as proceeding from both the citizens and its States.
This specious distinction implies that the States exist without reference to the will of their citizens.
The reality, then, is that it is preparing a future alteration to the States' democratic legitimacy and changes the nature of the EU, which has up until now been a union of states representing their peoples.
An extremely pernicious bacillus has thus been introduced into the new 'constitutional treaty', which is itself founded upon a mythical being, the 'European citizen', reminiscent of the former 'proletariat', to which one can attribute whatever intentions one likes.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing was doing no other when he declared that 'European citizens' were awaiting with extreme impatience a European constitution, a European foreign policy, a European minister of foreign affairs, and so on.
Such a basis can be a hazardous one in all sorts of ways, all the more so in view of the character of the 'new man' that the 'European citizen' is, which is marked by oblivious barbarism, as demonstrated by the refusal of the members of the Convention to make reference in their text to the historic role played by the Christian faith in the real constitution of Europe.
I would like to ask you to make a change to the nominal list.
I would like Amendment No 42 to be put to the vote after Amendment No 55.
This may seem illogical but it is not, as Amendment No 55 replaces what is stated in Amendment No 42 under a different article.
The rapporteur is in agreement with this.
Mr President, paragraph 4 of the Spanish version of the motion for a resolution by Mr Koukiadis says the opposite of what it should say, because it says that '... an instrument based on Title VI of the EU Treaty can only be adopted when the EC Treaty provides the possibility of achieving the same objective'.
This is the opposite of what the rapporteur's original text says.
I would ask that the Spanish translation be changed.
Mr President, we are currently experiencing a particularly worrying economic and social situation and, despite all the declarations about the priority that should be given to social policy, the reality of the situation shows that unemployment and the standard of living are growing worse for a significant proportion of the population.
The situation is now being made even worse in some countries by the drought and the disaster of the forest fires, particularly in Portugal.
It should be noted that, in order to achieve the employment targets set by the Council in 2000, more than 15 million new high-quality jobs with rights will have to be created by 2010.
What we are seeing more of, however, is unemployment.
Poverty also remains at scandalous levels: more than 15% of the population, or around 56 million people, is now in danger of falling into poverty.
This situation should sound the alarm for changing Community and monetarist policies, in order to attach the greatest priority to public investment and to other measures for promoting employment and social inclusion.
This is why, in our proposals, we insist on the need for the Stability Pact to be revised.
I hope, moreover, that the investment and spending that have had to be made as a result of the disastrous forest fires and droughts are at least factored in when calculating the budget deficit.
Mr President, with regard to the next paragraph, I believe that a minor editorial error has crept into Amendment No 15, which was tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This amendment states namely the following: 'asks for the laying down of the appropriate legal basis on which the social dialogue can be developed' and then it continues.
As it happens, we already have an appropriate legal basis for the social dialogue.
I think this is a minor editorial error and that this legal basis was actually intended for the development of a societal dialogue.
If this is the case, my group can withdraw the request for a split vote.
Are you withdrawing the request for a split vote?
Mr President, my question was whether this concerns an editorial error and the word 'social' can be replaced by 'societal'.
If so, we can withdraw the attempt at a split vote.
So, we shall vote on Amendment No 15 with the word 'societal' replacing 'social'.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0270/2003) by Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission 'Towards a United Nations legally binding instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities' (COM(2003) 16 - 2003/2100(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
(PT) This draft budget seeks to incorporate the surplus from the 2002 financial year into the 2003 budget.
In this regard, I share the rapporteur's concern that the 2002 surplus totals EUR 7.4 billion, whilst acknowledging that this sum is lower than the surpluses for 2000 and 2001 (around EUR 12 billion and EUR 15 billion respectively).
This is due to budget under-implementation, particularly in the Structural Funds.
I deplore the fact that these sums are not being redistributed into the Community budget and are being returned to the coffers of the Member States.
We really cannot conclude that the tiny Community budget, which for 2004 could represent less than 1% of Community GNI, is more than enough, when the needs for economic and social cohesion will only increase with enlargement.
Commissioner Schreyer took the opportunity to state that this budget was 'good news' for finance ministers, given the problems they have had in complying with the Stability Pact, particularly in Germany and France.
This under-implementation is due, however, to the constraints imposed by the Stability Pact itself but, as a result of being inflated and associated with the instruments that have been created, in particular the 'n+2' rule, it is becoming a weapon with which the main cash contributors can bludgeon (and gradually renationalise the costs of) structural policy.
Some people say that I talk too much in this House, in my explanations of vote, but, as you know, Mr President, I represent the Italian Pensioners' Party, and pensioners do everything, including eat pan-fried fish.
They said to me: 'We love eating fish from Guinea, which you are debating, but we would like it to be caught by fishermen from Guinea, not by European fishermen who pay to enter Guinean waters and to be allowed to catch fish who speak 'Guinean' and make a profit out of them, leaving the fishermen of Guinea even poorer and more destitute'.
Therefore, while I voted for the motion, I would stress that I am opposed to fisheries agreements of this kind.
.
(PT) We are now examining the mid-term review of the fourth fisheries protocol between the EU and Greenland, which entered into force in January 2001.
This protocol provides for compensation of greater value than the fishing rights that have been allocated; these sums total around EUR 43 million and EUR 28 million respectively.
The protocol also puts forward a proposal for sustainable partnership taking account of the crisis facing the fisheries sector.
The issue that is most relevant to Portugal is still the loss of historical fishing rights in Greenlandic waters once it joined the EU and the existence of the so-called 'paper quotas' that were allocated according to the principle of relative stability, but which are not used by the fleets of the Member States that are signatories to the protocol.
In 2000, only 54% of acquired fishing possibilities were used, despite the Protocol's financial effort.
Consequently, without calling into question the principle of relative stability, we must ensure that these unused quotas can be used by the fleets of other Member States.
Particular attention must be paid, however, to the Portuguese fleet.
It is right to state that the financial assistance we give Greenland for the crisis it is currently facing cannot be included in the financial compensation for the fisheries agreement, because this would overload the relevant budget line, which already faces serious shortfalls.
Non-fisheries-related aspects must, therefore, be separated from this agreement.
. The Scottish National Party representatives in this Parliament today voted against the MiguÃ©lez Ramos report on the Greenland fisheries protocol.
This is not to deny the importance of fisheries agreements with neighbouring countries outwith the European Union. Rather, we are seeking to deny the Union the right to plunder external fisheries resources at the whim of those fleets who will fish anywhere - and will fish until there is nothing left to catch.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos' report calls for unused quotas to be reallocated between Member States.
This demand forms part of a concerted effort to break the link between fisheries resources and the fleets which have historically fished them.
Such a demand is unacceptable - and Parliament should not sanction the behaviour of those fleets who know no boundaries, and accept no limits.
The Union's management of its own fisheries resources has been an unmitigated disaster.
We ought to learn from it.
Those countries which have best managed their resources are those which have respected historical rights from the past - and give their fishermen hope for the future.
We must not export our problems to waters outwith the Union - and we must limit the ambitions of destructive armadas.
This morning, before I came to the European Parliament, I met Mr Fatuzzo as he was aged 18, who, many years ago, worked as a sailor on cruise ships sailing between New York and the Bahamas.
In order to be licensed to work as a sailor, I had to take professional examinations, like all the seafarers referred to in this document.
The tests included a swimming test and a rowing test, although I am afraid that it was customary to tip the man holding the oars so that he rowed instead of the aspiring sailor.
This is my question: does this document allow us to monitor how sailing qualifications are issued by third States applying to sign such agreements with Europe?
I hope so, given that I voted for the text.
. (EL) It is important to set criteria, preconditions and limits in the matter of the employment of seafarers from third countries on Community ships.
These often resemble Towers of Babel, leading to anarchy and accidents.
The recent shipwrecks of the Prestige and the Tricolore prove the importance of safety at sea.
The Poignant report on the proposal for a directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers is a move in the right direction because it raises the issue of the recognition of seafarers from third countries.
This imposes an evaluation of the training system of each country, so that certificates of competency can be issued - and not simply an approach on an individualised basis - which will be valid for five years.
A shortcoming, however, in the measures being taken is the absence of a provision to deal with the problems of unemployment and deteriorating competition among Community seafarers.
The sinking of the Tricolor and the Prestige are cruel reminders of how urgent and necessary it is to make maritime safety a major priority, and of how important it is to guarantee a high level of training for seafarers on European vessels, equally so when the sailors are nationals of third countries.
The European fleet has a genuine interest in the possibility of having seafarers from third countries come to the EU.
Of the approximately 140 000 sailors serving on vessels flying a European Union flag, around one third (that is 47 000) come from third countries.
Furthermore, in many Member States, shipowners have difficulty in finding crew trained at national level.
This proposal, which aims - with the help of the European Maritime Safety Agency- to replace the current procedure for recognition of certificates of competency according to Member State with a recognition procedure at Commission level is therefore an important step in the right direction for guaranteeing the highest level of safety possible.
During the vote, I will pay particular attention to the amendments insisting on the competency of seafarers, access to training, the evaluation report and the fight against fraudulent practices.
.
(FR) I voted in favour of this directive and welcome this proposal.
Unfortunately, we need to deal today with the lack of personnel within the European Union, and in particular in France, in all nautical occupations.
We are, therefore, forced to call on third-country nationals and, consequently, we need to ensure that these people have received high-quality training.
The level of training does in fact have a significant impact on maritime safety.
Wear and tear on vessels is not the only factor responsible for the disasters that we have experienced.
Human error, a lack of experience, a lack of communication between crew members all increase the risks at sea.
In light of this situation, the rules for recognising training need to be harmonised and the use of a single language implemented aboard ships.
We also need to look to the future.
At a time when the European economy is stagnating, when unemployment is no longer falling, we need to enhance the status of the various occupations in this sector, in particular for young Europeans, to stimulate the desire to work in this field.
In this way, European businesses would then be able to employ EU nationals working in these nautical occupations.
. (EL) The Commission proposal promotes the legalisation of the unacceptable and dangerous deterioration in maritime training, satisfying the decision by big shipping business to increase its profits at the expense of the safety of the very lives of seafarers, shipping and the environment.
This deterioration has also been identified by experts in international organisations, who consider the basic cause to be the agreements drawn up on the instructions of shipowners, which form the basis for the proposed directive.
Separating diplomas from work permits in a bid to exploit cheap and basically unskilled labour is just one of the typical elements of the deliberate demotion of maritime education to simple training.
We consider that training for seafarers needs to be upgraded so that their knowledge reflects current requirements.
However, this requires a total break with big shipping business, a break that the EU cannot and does not want.
Seafarers themselves and other workers need to fight for a different policy of radical change, not only to the system and to the safeguarding of free state education, but also to international agreements and conventions, so that they lay down minimum education levels, introduce strict provisions for determining ships' crews and fully safeguard the employment and insurance rights of seafarers.
Thus, in conjunction with the renewal of ships, we shall have safe shipping.
.
(PT) As this wide-ranging study has revealed, Europe is suffering from a shortfall in qualified national seafarers, given the scale of Europe's maritime transport.
Hence the European Union's need to recruit sailors from third countries.
The current proposal seeks to establish a framework for training requirements for the performance of third-country seafarers' duties, a framework that would be overseen by the European Maritime Safety Agency.
This initiative, therefore, reinforces the concept of the importance of maritime safety, once again clearly and tragically highlighted by the recent shipwreck of the Prestige.
To this end, the entire proposal seeking to ensure a level of qualification for seafarers that is as high as possible is to be welcomed, as are the proposals to introduce a standard working language and to simplify the recognition procedure, which is excessively complicated, according to those working in the sector.
Lastly, I reiterate the warning issued by the draftsman of the opinion, reminding the Commission and the Council that Parliament has repeatedly called for an action programme to promote the maritime professions.
If, as has been suggested on many occasions, we need to promote and improve maritime transport, replacing in particular long-distance and heavy goods transport by road, an action programme to promote the maritime profession must be implemented.
.
(PT) The minimum training of maritime workers should, in my opinion, fall within the exclusive competence of the fishermen's unions, in line with their respective regulations.
Fishing is enormously important for coastal communities, both in terms of employment and family income, and so making training mandatory must not obstruct access to seas and rivers but instead be a requirement for the process of sustainable local development, and for participation in a process of recovering marine flora and fauna.
I support all the articles of this regulation and I voted for the motion, but I must express my great disappointment, as representative of pensioners throughout Europe, at the fact that, with Amendment No 55, which we adopted, we are preserving the total ban on people with disabilities throughout Europe travelling in Europe, travelling outside the borders of their own State and taking up residence in another European State, because, in so doing, they would lose a large part of the allowances on which they depend to live.
Some progress has been made, some of the pensions which were not transferable between countries have been abolished, but the majority are still in existence, with the result that, when people with disabilities travel in Europe, they have to leave their pension for their government, which certainly does not need it.
. I voted in favour of Mrs Lambert's report on social security to signal my support for rationalising, simplifying and making the existing texts on Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 more accessible to the citizens of Europe and to those who are dealing with it on a daily basis.
Without Community provisions on social security, millions of European citizens would be without sufficient protection.
We need to ensure that EU citizens working, residing or staying in another Member State are properly protected.
Coordinating social security measures at EU level remains the way forward.
We are not seeking nor should we attempt to harmonise social security measures.
Attempts to include taxation issues are outside the scope of this regulation and I voted against such proposals to day.
The definition of the family in the Lambert report is unacceptable and this was why I requested a separate vote on this amendment.
Such issues are also outside the scope of the regulation.
The definition of 'family' is a matter for the national legislation of the Member States.
Everyone is agreed on the desirability of reaching a final agreement on the regulation.
I hope this will be possible at second reading stage.
.
(NL) This report is a welcome improvement on the existing situations of the different social security systems, particularly for border regions that experience a great deal of cross-frontier working, and the rapporteur has done a great job in this respect.
With regard to Amendment No 20 about the definition of the household/the family, a majority of the ELDR Group has voted in favour of this amendment and despite this, has not requested a roll-call vote, as we think it would be very undesirable to risk the whole report being voted out.
This would also be the reason for the rapporteur agreeing to reject Amendment No 20.
I need to get something off my chest.
This Parliament spends many session hours every month on fundamental human rights in countries outside of Europe.
We get involved in virtually every incident of what is unacceptable according to European standards.
However, when we discuss human rights within Europe, such as sexual orientation, we refuse to nail our colours to the mast.
It is a disgrace, in my view, for Parliament to want to retain the option of placing citizens outside of the law on account of their sexual orientation.
There are, of course, various arguments that can be used to support this view; you could, of course, say that this is a case of subsidiarity, or that it is more important to adopt the report than the principled choice in Amendment No 20.
To do so nevertheless infringes another right, namely the right of every European to be able to work within the European Union.
By rejecting Amendment No 20, the labour mobility of a number of citizens is curtailed quite severely, and this in a progressive Europe, no less.
Fortunately, this selfsame Parliament has, probably unwittingly, recently adopted a similar amendment in the Santini report.
As a Liberal, I hope that this approval will offer sufficient guarantees for all European citizens.
. The EPLP will be voting for the Lambert report on social security because it seeks to coordinate social security systems for the benefit or ordinary Europeans who seek to work across the EU.
This report coordinates but does not seek to harmonise either social security or taxation systems, which are the responsibility of Member States.
The EPLP has not supported Amendment No 48 because it is outside the scope of Article 42, which deals with social security systems, and introduces the idea of double taxation.
Similarly, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 43 and 45 seek to go beyond social security coordination and therefore could not be supported by the EPLP.
.
(PT) I regret the fact that some Members of this Parliament are still proving unable to resist the temptation of using Parliament texts, in flagrant breach of the EU's competences, and counter to the principle of subsidiarity, to encroach on the sphere reserved for Member States, getting involved in all sorts of issues, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, in the service of plain ideological sectarianism, even in matters of the utmost political and social sensitivity.
This was the case, in particular, with the deplorable Amendment No 20, by means of which it was sought, quite mistakenly, to enshrine a new definition of the concept of 'the family'.
Fortunately, common sense prevailed and the plenary rejected this utterly inappropriate and abusive amendment by an overwhelming majority.
The report did, however, contain other, albeit less serious, examples of attempts to use and abuse a subject of such relevance and interest to all citizens - social security systems - in order to impose visions that lack consensus and challenge the distribution of powers and competences within the EU.
Although I did not vote against the report - due to the fact that Amendment No 20 has been rejected - I could only abstain in the final vote.
I voted for the GrÃ¶ner report, whose laudable intention is to combat violence against women and children.
I must, however, confess that, at Rome airport, whence I travelled to Strasbourg, a pensioner from Rome approached me and said: 'It is right for you in Europe to concern yourselves with combating violence against children, young people and women, but I would like you, Mr Fatuzzo, to point out that, in some institutions to which elderly people and non-self-sufficient people are admitted, I am afraid that, because there is absolutely no government monitoring whatsoever, these non-self-sufficient elderly people are also often subject to violence and oppression.
There should be a decision and European Parliament funding for their cause too, so that these kinds of violence can be combated as well.'
. (FR) The recent news has reminded us of the importance of this issue and of the extent and seriousness of the violence, hidden or otherwise, suffered by children and women in all social spheres.
In the case of men's violence against women the cause of the violence is machismo-inspired and in the case of violence perpetrated by parents against their children the cause is an unthinking, even pathological, outburst.
Hence the need for a generously financed programme accompanied by a stepping up of preventive and punitive legislation in this area.
. (FR) As it aims to ensure that the current programme of action to combat violence against children, young people and women will continue after its expiry at the end of 2003, it must be possible to implement this second phase of the Daphne programme without delay.
This programme cannot, however, be implemented in the most effective way possible with the level of funding provided for by the Commission.
The amount in question - EUR 40 million - strikes me in fact as quite insufficient if we really want to allow a larger number of non-governmental organisations to benefit from the programme and if the idea is to meet the needs of the new Member States.
It follows that funds commensurate with the issues at stake must be made available to enable the programme to be continued with and extended to the new Member States.
It also appears to me that it would be a desirable development in dealing with violence as a violation of human rights if the programme were on a more appropriate legal basis than Article 152 of the EC Treaty.
The justification of Amendment No 1 in the report mentions the concept of 'forced prostitution'.
We are opposed to the use of this term because we think that prostitution is never a person's free choice but always has to do with compulsion and dependency.
. The British Conservatives deplore violence of any kind and welcome measures to combat this, including some of those initiatives within the Daphne Programme.
Violence, especially against women or children, is completely unjustifiable and cannot be accepted.
However, some of the measures in this report encroach on areas better dealt with at Member State level.
There is no evidence that taxpayers' money spent on projects at EU level is more effective than when it is spent on national programmes, although the sharing of experience and best practice may make a positive contribution to the reduction of violence of this type.
Whilst accepting the good work carried out by the Daphne Programme, the British Conservatives, for the reasons outlined above, have voted against further budgetary appropriations and abstained on the final vote.
.
(DE) Today, I have taken a firm stand in favour of extending the EU's Action Programme to prevent violence against children, young people and women (Daphne II) from 2003 to 2008.
Our main objective must now be to make the necessary funding available in good time for 1 January 2004 and to avoid a long drawn-out conciliation procedure.
The financial framework needs to be extended to EUR 50 million, as demanded by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in order thereby to be able to fully meet the requirements and needs in the candidate countries.
I hope that this measure will be adopted without delay in order to avoid a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council and so that a realistic financial perspective can be put in place.
The proposal for legislation also envisages the development of filters to prevent the dissemination of paedophile material, and provides for the situation of street children, especially in major cities, to be ameliorated.
As a whole, then, Daphne II is on the right track, but it will be crucial that the available resources be put together in the most appropriate and effective way possible, so that both funds and actions may have a direct effect on those for whom they are intended, rather than petering out in various channels.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mrs GrÃ¶ner on the excellent report she has drawn up on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a second phase of a Community action programme to prevent violence against children, adolescents and women, and to protect victims and at-risk groups (the Daphne II programme, 2004-2008), which I fully support, in particular with regard to the need to provide the programme with greater funding.
I also wish to emphasise that the programme's implementation must enable its reach to be extended, to encompass the accession and candidate countries or any other countries that enjoy privileged relations with the Union.
.
(IT) It is the moral duty of all citizens of all societies to combat child abuse and child pornography.
It is with pleasure and satisfaction that I welcome the Community programme, Daphne II, on the prevention of violence against children, young people and women, supported by the delegation of which I am head and by the entire UEN Group.
Indeed, the GrÃ¶ner report has incorporated two proposals adopted unanimously today by the House here in Strasbourg, which advocate two further measures that the Community programme will have to develop: promoting awareness campaigns condemning violence and facilitating the provision of psychological, moral and practical support for victims, and, above all, exploring the possibility of creating filters banning the dissemination of information consisting of child pornography on the Internet.
This extraordinary means of communication and information provision, the Internet, can, indeed, be an inexhaustible, unregulated source of messages of violence and brutality aimed at minors and of which minors are often the instigators.
It would therefore appear necessary, in the name of the freedom of which society boasts and which is not true freedom if it is not respected by all and does not serve to protect all, to regulate the kind of information available on the Internet and to enable families, adults and minors to recognise the nature of the sites they are accessing.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of this report. I share the rapporteur's concern about the need to address the various forms of violence perpetrated against the weakest members of society, and I believe that continuing and extending the Daphne II programme is entirely desirable and justified.
I fully support establishing a European Year against Violence, and reiterate its appropriateness and the need for such a Year.
Without ignoring or discounting the evidence of those who are most vulnerable to the various forms of violence, I deplore the rapporteur's indulgence in feminist and somewhat lopsided rhetoric.
I am unhappy about the facile demagogy of this absurd form of sexism, which is reductive and demonises masculinity.
It even goes so far as to advocate a form of 're-education' which is, if not offensive, then just plain ridiculous.
In conclusion, I welcome the adoption of the amendments to which I put my name, as did Mrs Muscardini and Mrs Angelilli, on encouraging the adoption of filters and techniques for registering and tracing activity, to prevent the dissemination of paedophile material on the Internet.
Like many people, Mr President, I love the country.
I am delighted that agriculture is to receive so much funding and aid from the European Community and that there is a concern to ensure accurate news, accurate statistics and uniform procedures for presenting Community agricultural expenditure in the 15 States.
If only the European governments were as diligent and if only the European Union were as willing to take the same interest and ensure the same accuracy in the statistics which relate to us, poor common mortals!
As you know, Mr President, the pensions deficit throughout Europe - so the Heads of Government say - is due to the fact that the average life expectancy of men and women has unexpectedly increased by at least 10 years.
Could they not have seen it coming?
.
(PT) This proposal for a regulation consolidates a long-established practice which, according to the specialists, works extremely well.
In fact, the Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) form an essential instrument for monitoring and assessing the CAP.
As we all know, these have traditionally been compiled by the Member States on the basis of a common methodology and supplied to the Commission (Eurostat) under a gentlemen's agreement.
I therefore agree with the Commission's vision of upholding and improving the quality of data and of establishing a framework for data transmission, which will provide economic actors with greater transparency and better access to information.
I believe that, in this area, as in many other spheres of Community action, the coordinated compilation of data and the sharing of such data as well as comparisons and exchanges of experience constitute an enormous advantage for the efficiency and economy of action, both of the European Union and of the Member States.
I voted for Mr Koukiadis' report, Mr President, because what it asks and calls for is one of my long-standing dreams, when I manage to dream - which is not very often nowadays, given the approach of 13 June - for I sleep well.
Why is that?
Because I would genuinely like European law to be genuinely a primary source of law.
It appears, for example, that Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam is being breached in Italy.
There is discrimination against elderly people and people with disabilities, who are given - or not given - financial support just because they are over, or under, 65 years old.
I therefore welcome this report and I look forward to when European law is made a primary source of law.
. (EL) Behind the ostensibly neutral title 'on legal bases and compliance with Community law', the own-initiative report by the Committee on Legal Affairs hides the complete subjugation of national law to Community law.
Fully aligned with the philosophy of the ?U, the report maintains that the Community should have the facility to force the Member States to impose specific criminal sanctions in the event of infringements of Community law.
The term 'criminal sanctions' carries a great deal of weight, which distinguishes it from the administrative or financial sanctions which the rulers of the ?U already impose.
The report also proposes that the Commission should be able to appear in national criminal courts in order to bring civil actions and even to force the Member States to impose prison sentences decided by the Community.
All we need now are Community gaols to carry out Community sentences!
This is yet another infringement of national sovereignty and the so-called 'rule of law' of the bourgeoisie, in that a supranational body is being instructed to exercise criminal jurisdiction and to decide on the type and level of sanctions.
Of course, the anxious search for legal bases hides the ambition to serve the interests of the unifying monopolies in all sectors and the sweeping away of democratic achievements.
. (FR) The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market takes as its starting point the principle that its proposals are not intended to 'lay down criminal-law rules or achieve criminal-law harmonisation'.
This - which we believe to be the right place to start - is the fruit of preparatory work and serious reflection by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has placed especial reliance on hearings of experts in the criminal law, who confirmed that such harmonisation would give rise to upheavals and major problems.
Unfortunately, the rest of the report takes us in precisely the opposite direction by relying on the extensive interpretations of the Court of Justice, by calling on the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, to lodge complaints and by asking the Intergovernmental Conference to define Community competence in criminal law.
The Members belonging to the 'Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition' delegation within the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have therefore voted against this report, which, using a technique familiar to us in this area, ends up requiring us to do what we have said we do not want to do.
. As is explained in the report, there are a few instances in which criminal sanctions are imposed via Community law.
They are the exception rather than the rule, and it is most important that the Community, in responding to paragraph 10 of the report, does not acquire any general competence in criminal matters which should be left to the Member States.
.
(PT) The scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda must be a useful instrument and one that serves social policy, providing practical information on progress that is made and solutions to problems.
We are currently going through a period of economic slowdown, which could cause levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion to rise even further.
Particular attention must be paid to persistent social problems, such as high-school drop-out rates, the lack of childcare facilities and illiteracy.
Furthermore, we must invest in education, training and lifelong learning, in making it easier to reconcile work and family life, and in encouraging active ageing and improving health and safety at work.
Given the prospect of enlargement, efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion must be stepped up, bearing in mind the social conditions in the 10 new Member States.
The Member States, the social partners and other parties involved must commit to implementing the political initiatives set out in the social agenda and the guidelines on employment.
For its part, the Commission must establish measures that answer the requests made by the European Parliament.
This is an extremely important report for the implementation of social policy in the Union.
I have therefore voted in favour of it.
. Despite a number of reservations about some of the proposals in Mrs Figueiredo's report on the social policy agenda, I voted in favour in the final vote as there are many issues in the social agenda which rightly need to be highlighted.
The report was amended earlier in committee and several difficulties which arose at that stage of the procedure were overcome.
Issues such as continuing high levels of unemployment in some of the Member States, tackling poverty, combating discrimination on grounds of disability, promoting active ageing and providing childcare facilities are all important and need to be dealt with as priorities.
I voted against amendments calling for yet more directives and proposals that would hold back industry.
Building a social Europe requires consensus-building between the social partners, not creating new impediments.
I also welcome the focus on behalf of the applicant countries.
They will have much to offer to the development of our social policy agenda.
.
(PT) I am sorry that our proposals seeking to clarify aspects of the report have been rejected.
As a result of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, these proposals were watered down, specifically those that:
note the adverse consequences that the Stability Pact's implementation has had on employment and social expenditure, which would justify revising the Pact, taking account of changes in the economic situation as well as employment and training criteria;
call for economic and social policies to be redrafted so that they are focused on meeting social needs and not on company profits;
consider that economic development, high-quality public investment and public services, specifically in education and vocational training, promoting the creation of high-quality jobs with rights and reducing the working day are means of combating unemployment and social exclusion and of ensuring the welfare of all.
. The EPLP will be voting for the Figueiredo report, which seeks to make progress on the yearly scoreboard on the implementation of the Social Policy Agenda by keeping track of achievements and warning of delays.
The report highlights for example the continuing high levels of unemployment and poverty in some Member States and rightly calls for solutions to these problems to be treated as a priority in Community policies, not least in the forthcoming mid-term review of the CAP, the Structural Funds and the Stability Pact.
The EPLP will abstain on Amendments Nos 2, 6 and 17, as they are unclear on the Europe-wide right to take collective action, including the right to strike.
The EPLP supports long-term solutions on the management of collective actions across the EU, which will provide a fair solution to both EU workers and consumers.
In an ?U created at the demand of the big multinationals and which serves their interests, there can be no social prosperity for the working classes and no safeguarding of the rights of workers, women, young people, the disabled or the elderly.
The proof is that approximately one quarter of the population in the ?U is living below the poverty line.
The interest in wiping out poverty is hypocritical.
The objective is to conceal the barbarity of capitalist exploitation behind 'charity' programmes and to avoid acute social outbursts.
The so-called social agenda is being implemented by extending flexibility and temporary work, by prolonging active working life, with lifelong learning, by reducing wages and linking them to productivity and by cutting back on the welfare state and social protection and on public spending on health and education.
Capitalism needs hoards of unemployed, which is why the objective of full employment is a total misnomer.
Especially today, under conditions of unbridled competition and company restructurings and relocations, which lead to mass job losses.
An attempt is being made to untie this Gordian knot with part-time and temporary employment and by sharing jobs between several workers.
We therefore call on the workers, the working classes and the progressive radical forces in the countries of the ?U to fight against the choices being made by the monopolies and to claim a different, pro-grass roots policy.
Mr President, on Mrs Lynne's report, the European Union can present a great model to the rest of the world, in particular with regard to how best we treat those who are most vulnerable within our society.
Across the world today there are an estimated 600 million people with disabilities.
A lot of those people come from deprived backgrounds and a lot of them are resident in the developing world where many of the services that we take for granted are not available.
It is essential, therefore, that there are international rules and regulations with regard to the treatment, respect and promotion of people with disabilities.
One of the most important elements of our work here today, and the vote in favour of the Lynne report, has been that it sends out a clear message, not just from the 15 countries of the European Union but also from the 10 accession countries, that we want to establish common standards and rules.
I leave you with a short quotation by George Bernard Shaw, the Irish author, that I used on my first day in this Chamber: 'The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity.'
In today's world we have too much indifference towards the plight of those who are most in need of our support - not our sympathy, not our charity, not our patronising - to allow them to live full and independent lives and to be treated as equals in the 21st Century.
I am sorry that I am having the last word on this document, which has been dealt with so admirably by Mr Crowley in his explanation of vote, but I have to say, Mr President, that I am deeply saddened - although I did vote for the document - by the fact that, in Italy, my beautiful country which has so much beautiful sun, there is, regrettably, still today, a law according to which those who become severely disabled and unfit for work, despite having worked and paid social security contributions, are to have an allowance of no more than EUR40-50 per month on which to live between the age of 30, say, and the age of 65 or maybe 70.
Would the government, which is currently the Presidency of the Council, kindly read what I am saying and remedy the situation.
. (EL) UN resolution 56/168 lays down equal opportunities in order to provide a binding framework for the protection and dignity of the disabled.
That is why it is important:
for there to be an effective monitoring mechanism, as with the other six conventions on human rights in the USA,
for the convention to be based on promoting the various rights of the disabled, as stated in the Lynne report,
for provision to be made for the participation of the disabled themselves and the organisations that represent them in setting up national and international bodies, always bearing in mind, of course, that bureaucratic distortions need to be addressed,
for discrimination to be abolished,
for there to be an urgent timetable for a Community directive.
. (FR) Who could vote against a document so replete with declarations of good intent?
It is indeed obvious that we must assess the situation of disabled people 'from the perspective of human rights and not from one of charity'!
We must indeed 'facilitate the fulfilment of the aspirations of disabled people'!
The simple fact is, though, that the necessity of reaffirming such elementary truths as that the disabled are human beings itself demonstrates how far this is from being obvious in this inhumane society.
And, despite the title, 'Towards a United Nations legally binding instrument to (?) protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities', there is nothing whatever binding about the document, and how, in any case, could matters be otherwise?
How does one ensure, for example, that persons with disabilities have 'access to work' when such access is denied to 30 million people, with and without disabilities, in the European Union?
How is one to ensure that they have 'the right to live independently and with dignity in the community' or even 'the right to accessible housing'?
How is one to ensure this at a time when all governments are cutting back on social security benefits and when the minimal allowances paid to the disabled allow them to do little more than feed themselves as best they can?
. (FR) I have always said that the fullest possible integration of persons with disabilities into our society is not merely something demanded by justice and solidarity, but also a tremendous source of human richness for our society and for every one of us.
So much is this self-evident that we ought not to need to legislate.
Experience proves, though, that legislation is needed and that it has to be binding.
This House has therefore proposed that the Convention, when it eventually comes into being, should be required to include certain categories of rights.
I am in favour of this and support the demand that the Commission should draw up a precise and rigorous timetable for this.
.
(PT) Despite the fact that this is the European Year of People with Disabilities, little real progress has been made in promoting and protecting the disabled.
It is particularly regrettable that the European Union still has no specific directive covering disability, taking Article 13 of the Treaty as its basis, and that the Commission has not submitted a proposal this year to remedy the situation, despite repeated calls by Parliament.
This is certainly curious, particularly since the Commission is calling for a UN Convention to be drafted on this matter.
Since the one initiative does not preclude the other, we support the EP report's argument for both legislative instruments.
Nevertheless, I reiterate that we must guarantee the disabled full protection in the field of human rights, eliminating obstacles preventing them from fully enjoying their rights, making it easier for them to fulfil their ambitions and to achieve their potential, giving persons with disabilities priority treatment on the political agendas of the various Member States.
Although the decision to draw up a Convention is to be welcomed, genuine added value must be guaranteed in order to ensure that the human rights of persons with disabilities are genuinely respected.
. The 'European Year of People with Disabilities' raises awareness of the concerns of over 40 million people in the EU with disabilities.
Without being complacent, we have established some protection for EU citizens.
It is also important that the EU leads the way in establishing fundamental rights for the approximately 660 million people world-wide who have some form of disability - almost 10% of the planet's population.
Many people with disabilities face discrimination, maltreatment and institutional confinement.
Europe should be sending a message beyond its borders that inhuman or degrading treatment of people with disabilities is utterly unacceptable.
10 years ago the UN adopted its Standard Rules for people with disabilities.
This is not a legally-binding document.
It is now clear that the rights of people with disabilities internationally should now be protected by a legally enforceable UN Convention.
This must cover the right to quality of life, to access to employment, education and training, the right to inclusion, civil and political rights, to financial support, to healthcare, to culture and leisure and the right to equal treatment before the law.
The EU must take the lead in the UN and must pursue these goals through EU development cooperation.
. (FR) We have had no hesitation in voting for this document in view of the manifest urgency, both in Europe and worldwide, of developing a policy of non-discrimination towards persons with disabilities, a proactive policy reaffirming their rights to employment, education, and to all that makes up social life, including sexuality.
It has to be emphasised, though, that such a concern is largely at odds with current trends in the European Union and in the principal international economic organisations.
In real terms, these trends favour the dismantling of the public services, their privatisation and reductions in social protection and social budgets.
The integration of people with disabilities into society, including into the world of work, is required by a solidarity which it is difficult to reconcile with the profit motive.
The commitment to leave behind the separated structures, which only very inadequately prepare people with disabilities for integration and independence, in order to enable them to participate fully in society and to combat prejudice, has its price.
The fight against prejudice inevitably brings us up against the rapacity of private interests, masked by the high level of competitiveness which is, to currently prevalent thinking, the be-all and end-all.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mrs Lynne on the report she has presented, which addresses an issue that I believe to be extremely important: protecting the rights of people with disabilities.
I must express my complete support for the proposal to adopt a legally binding convention that would protect the rights of the disabled and that would ensure that these rights are respected at world level.
Adopting a convention of this type will make a further contribution to the war on the exclusion and discrimination of the disabled.
I therefore believe we should all show solidarity and support this report.
.
As a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I have voted for the Lynne report, because I believe that it is important for the European Parliament to support the UN initiative and signal the view that a comprehensive EU directive on disabled people's rights should be progressed by the Commission.
Real progress should also be made in mainstreaming disabled people's rights within our development cooperation policy.
MEPs in the committee have stressed that the outcome of the UN process must be a legally binding convention with an effective monitoring mechanism.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of this report in the knowledge that, in this European Year of People with Disabilities, a great deal needs to be done to eliminate the physical, technical and social barriers facing the disabled in their daily lives.
I would highlight the appropriateness of Mr Crowley's initiative, and share his view that the disabled and the organisations representing them should be given the option of taking part in negotiations on these matters, as should their families and guardians.
Although I agree in principle with the report currently before us, I must express my unhappiness at the fact that, whilst going into considerable detail about the right to quality of life being the most important right pertaining to the disabled, the rapporteur implicitly devalues what really is the most fundamental right of all: the right to life itself.
Similarly, I deplore the report's abuse of the word 'charity', which is reviled and taken out of context, ignoring its real theological and semantic meanings and replacing them with a populist clichÃ© that is incorrect and unhelpful.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Iraq.
. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the lack of security and the serious attacks staining Iraq with blood are cause for very great concern.
I regret to say that they detract attention not only from the reconstruction work in progress and the necessary measures for a speedy return to normality but also from the many indications of a genuine renewal: exchanges of opinions, freedom of religious practice, institutions representing an initial, albeit hesitant, stage of democracy, and the attempt to re-establish equal opportunities and rights.
The most recent tragic events confirm how the fight against terrorism and efforts to establish security and stability in Iraq must continue to be a priority for all countries and for the international community.
Our enemies are those who are targeting the advocates of moderation and the decision to take up a new and difficult challenge; those who targeted SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello because he was doing good, because he was toiling with his forces to set the country back on its feet: those who targeted him are the enemies of us all, the enemies of the project to build a democratic Iraq.
The task of rebuilding Iraq and restoring it to normality is therefore the concern of the international community; the European Union cannot and must not shirk its responsibilities.
There must therefore be increasing support for this objective.
The reestablishment of law and order is putting great pressure on the coalition forces, but this is the time when it is necessary to draw in the threads of solidarity so that an increasing number of countries can work together to re-establish security.
After the cowardly terrorist attack on the United Nations in Baghdad on 19 August that claimed innocent victims from among those who served the cause of peace, including SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello, whom I have just mentioned, and after the bloody attack in Najaf on 29 August, it is the duty of us all to further increase our efforts to bring about the political, civil, social and economic reconstruction of Iraq.
In particular, we feel that the United Nations should play an increasingly central role, further consolidating its mandate in this difficult, post-combat phase.
The Presidency therefore hopes that, in the coming weeks, a broad majority in favour of a greater UN undertaking in Iraq will develop in the Security Council, and it is making every effort - I, personally, am making every effort - working closely with the principal players of the international community, to achieve this important goal.
Attempts to divide the international community or to destroy its cohesion are bound to fail since it is in everyone's interest for the reconstruction of Iraq to succeed.
We must promote the development of multilateralism, of a multilateral approach to crisis resolution which is effective, capable of generating solutions.
The Presidency is making every endeavour to this effect.
We welcomed the Security Council's adoption of Resolution 1500 and consider it to be a particularly important step forward in that it acknowledges the key role of the Iraqi Governing Council in the formation of new institutions in Iraq.
The Resolution gives the UN a specific mandate, entrusting it with the task of assisting reconstruction.
We - and I, personally - have great faith in the role of the United Nations, and that has been confirmed by the experience demonstrated in recent weeks by the UN staff, who have acted with the highest professionalism and skill, and that skill can be increasingly deployed to manage the reconstruction of Iraq.
The Presidency is therefore convinced that, to achieve the objective of establishing a free, democratic Iraq, it is necessary for the entire international community to combine its efforts to give the Iraqi people a future of peace and hope.
The Donors' Conference, scheduled for 24 October in Madrid, will be a good opportunity to consolidate this international cohesion, provided - and I appeal urgently to the countries taking part - that as many countries as possible are generous and willing to help. Heaven help Iraq if the Donors' Conference should be a failure.
It is important that the international bodies are assured a clear role in the economic and social reconstruction of Iraq.
Reconstruction should be carried out within a clear framework that establishes the forms of participation by the countries and international organisations, but it is equally desirable that, pending the emergence of the conditions for this shared framework, there should be no lack of contributions from a large number of countries willing to take part in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must therefore endeavour to ensure that the Donors' Conference will enable us to establish a general framework to do whatever is necessary to contribute to the reconstruction of the country; the Presidency considers that, for Europe, which has already clearly indicated its desire to take part in the reconstruction of Iraq, this is a valuable opportunity to make use of its resources and experience.
Indeed, our commitment to the reconstruction of Iraq should not be limited to security but should extend to humanitarian aid, social services, all the Iraqi people's needs and, last but not least, culture.
We therefore need to rebuild the country's infrastructure and transport network, providing all the aid necessary but also - or rather, first and foremost - establishing the institutional framework for the future democratic Iraq, rebuilding the education and school systems and the academic world.
Reconstruction cannot and must not simply involve technical engineering of the social order: reconstruction must be the driving force for peaceful coexistence, and we must therefore promote, alongside the restoration of order, the spread of a liberal culture.
Once conditions of full security are re-established, it will be possible to start laying the foundations for a civil society based on freedom and mutual tolerance, with which Europe will be able to build relationships of cooperation and solidarity.
These are the major unresolved questions on which Europe must show that it is capable of making a political contribution and taking practical steps as a single entity, capable of taking direct responsibility for achieving security, capable of placing the emphasis on a culture of increasingly widespread democracy and focusing on its relationship with issues of security. A culture of democracy capable of dialogue with the worlds and traditions of the various ethnic and religious groups.
The reconstruction of Iraq can and must be achieved.
It is an obligation which we must not fail to fulfil, not only in the name of the great European tradition of undertakings in the field of peace, solidarity and aid to peoples in need, but also - not least, I would add - because Europe can and must do its part, calling for a substantial mandate to be given to the United Nations and making every endeavour to this end, in order to restore stability to Iraq and hope to the Iraqi people.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my agreement with the statements by Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, to the effect that we now need to make a joint effort to bring peace to Iraq and thereby stabilise the region as a whole.
Not only many European governments, but also Members of this House, have had differences of opinion on the war in Iraq.
The situation being what it is, these should now be set aside; we will make no progress by looking for culprits, and our concern must now rather be the development of a common strategy that will help us to resolve today's problem in a sensible way.
We must also see that what the increasing number of terrorist acts in Iraq demonstrates is that the end of the war has brought Iraq no real peace, and that the establishment of a legitimate and acceptable government there is still a long way off.
For a variety of reasons - about which there is discussion everywhere - the USA cannot achieve this objective using the means it has employed so far.
I believe that President Bush is right to call for a UN resolution on this subject now.
It is at this point that I would like to introduce a figure into the proceedings.
The USA reckons its monthly commitments in Iraq to be USD 4 billion, which amounts to almost USD 50 billion per annum, a fantastic sum when set against its budget deficit, which is in any case enormous.
That alone can scarcely fail to make it clear the need for cooperation in this area.
If Europeans can now speak with one voice, then the time is also ripe for us to sit down together and try to work out a new policy objective. This will make it possible to clarify where we go from here, to decide who does what in the civil, military and humanitarian spheres, and thus to divide up tasks in a sensible way.
If Europe and the Americans can do this together on an equal footing and work together with the UN in doing so, then I am sure that Parliament would be prepared to accept the Commission's budgetary proposals and forward them, together with its mandate, to the Donors' Conference.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of ECHO in Iraq for the fine work they have done, which, I believe, gives us a real opportunity to contribute to peace in the region.
There is no doubt that this is in our own interests, as there will be disastrous consequences in store for us too, in both the medium and long term, if it proves impossible to pacify the region as a whole.
Considerations such as these should also, however, apply to Afghanistan, and I believe that we should therefore attempt, by means of a new Petersberg conference, to bring about a truly fair balance of power and the equitable distribution of aid, including to the Pathans, in order to establish peace there as well.
I get the impression that in neither Iraq nor Afghanistan has such a strategy been in place before now.
So now is the time for us to take a deep breath and make a new start together, doing our best in the region's interests and in our own.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would also like to express our most heartfelt and sincere condolences at the death of the United Nations special envoy, SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello, as well as the deaths, as the President said yesterday, of this Parliament's collaborators and members of families of our officials, and also to the families of all those who have lost their lives.
We are facing a situation in which the devastating fire which destroyed the UN headquarters in Baghdad and also the murder by means of car bombs of the Shi'ite religious leader, Mohamed Baquer al Hakim, are part of a terrorist fight, but also of something which could be compared to a resistance and, at a time when everything that happened before the war is being reconsidered, we must be aware that what is required in Iraq is not more besieged troops, but to seek a timetable for the country to be reconstructed, and reconstructed, furthermore, with the involvement of the Iraqis.
It is true that we do not have to return to the past, but there are certain principles that we believe still to be valid, and the first is the defence of multilateralism above all else in today's world, and also our commitment.
In this regard, what is becoming increasingly clear is that the doctrine of pre-emptive attack is a doctrine which we questioned and which has been shown to be entirely useless in terms of resolving the problems of Saddam Hussein's tyranny.
The Bush administration's lack of preparation for dealing with the post-war situation is surprising.
Where is Secretary of State Powell's exit strategy?
Our question in the European Union, and I say this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the eve of the informal meeting to be held next weekend, should be how we can act jointly as the European Union, not by means of generic appeals, but of commitments.
There is an initial point which has been clear from the outset and which has yet to be fulfilled, and that is that the four European states on the Security Council must act jointly, and that must be achieved.
Until that happens we will be divided and it is important that we take that step because, as well as our international commitments, we have much at stake in the resolution of this crisis.
Like Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the humanitarian efforts being made by ECHO.
It is very important for the Iraqis and also to demonstrate our commitment, but, in any event, what is being considered - and what we Europeans must resolve - is the approach to the future.
This problem of the so-called chain of command, particularly in a situation in which the Budget Office of the United States Congress says that they cannot run to the presence of troops beyond March 2004, and also at a time when the US administration is presenting a new resolution to the Security Council.
The issue is very clear: we cannot ask for supplementary efforts while maintaining the current situation of occupying forces with a chain of command essentially led by one country.
If we believe in multilateralism, if we believe in a serious commitment on the part of the European Union to the United Nations and the international community, we must propose sharing responsibilities, replacing the occupation approach with one of returning sovereignty to the Iraqis.
And this requires a very clear and precise timetable and also requires a joint effort involving us Europeans and, also in a very direct way, the Arab countries, in order to achieve something which erases the image of an unacceptable form of neocolonialism.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that it is positive that we are going to the conference of donors - we must change the current thinking according to which the booty is being distributed amongst the friends of the occupiers - and we must be able to respond as the European Union.
I hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will prepare a recommendation which we can vote for unanimously, or at least by a majority, during the second September part-session.
Mr President, Liberal Democrats in this House join the tributes which have been paid to Sergio Vieira de Mello and all the other victims of the callous attacks on the United Nations in Baghdad.
The unstable and violent situation in Iraq shows that while a coalition of the willing may be able to win a military conflict, winning the peace without the legitimacy of the United Nations is a much more difficult matter.
My Group, therefore, welcomes the tentative moves towards a UN resolution which would place the coalition forces in Iraq within a multilateral framework.
Liberals have always favoured a multilateral resolution to the problems posed by Iraq, and if the coalition is belatedly coming round to that view, then it is better late than never.
The so-called 'coalition of the willing' was a curiously outdated 19th century balance of power concept, which always carried with it the danger of leaving at least one nation feeling aggrieved.
What we seek is a multilateral, rules-based framework for crisis management within which there is space for the hurts of nations to heal.
There is no reason why the United States should not retain command of a multinational UN force in Iraq, but it must be based on a UN resolution and give the UN and contributing nations the central role in decision-making.
Failure thus far to find weapons of mass destruction is leading to searching questions at hearings in London, Washington and Canberra and raising doubts about the legitimacy of the enterprise.
The way to give the international presence in Iraq a sense of legitimacy and regain the trust of the Iraqi people is to mount a UN-backed drive to restore security, to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis and to move towards government by popular mandate.
The swearing-in of Iraq's first post-Saddam cabinet today is a tremendous step forward in that respect.
We hope that the timetable for elections by the end of next year can be maintained.
My Group welcomes the Commission's initiative in convening a preparatory meeting today in Brussels for the important conference of international donors next month in Madrid.
Mr President, I can well appreciate that there are many people who have no desire to look back. Nor, in a way, do I myself think it is much fun looking back.
We have here one of those situations in which it has to be said that, as time goes on, it becomes less and less pleasant to have been right.
When representatives of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities visited Baghdad in February of this year, we talked with the weapons inspectors, and it was our extremely clear impression that the inspection was working and that, if no weapons of mass destruction had then been found, it was first and foremost because they probably did not exist.
Six months on, it may also be seen that this view was probably correct and that the weapons inspection was, therefore, working as intended, with the UN on the right lines in this matter.
The second thing we discussed at that time was how such an attack would be taken in Iraq.
Would it be seen as a liberation or as an occupation?
Our message was: probably as both.
Naturally, there is a desire to be free from a despot and dictator like Saddam Hussein. Is there, however, a wish to see one's country occupied by foreign troops in the process?
I think it can probably now be stated that our fears at that time were justified and that the attacks that are now being made upon, for example, civilian targets, the UN building and the Iraqi police are a sign that the Iraqi people are experiencing the current situation as an occupation.
Another thing we wanted to be considered before an attack was made was the internal tensions that would be triggered in Iraq.
Recently, we saw the killing of the Shia Muslim leader, Mohammed Baquer Hakim.
Not that I think he was a hero.
Far from it.
This is, however, an example of how strong the tensions between the population groups in Iraq are, and it shows the enormity of the task involved in the headlong plunge into an attack on Iraq.
The demonstrations at his funeral were a mixture of protests against both Saddam Hussein and George Bush, meaning that, even among people who must have felt they were perhaps free of a dictator, there were very strong reactions against the American occupation.
Another thing we feared was that, with this attack, the UN would be fundamentally weakened.
That, it also has to be said, has unfortunately happened.
With a weakened UN, it can also be seen how much we in actual fact need the UN.
The United States must now recognise that even 180 000 soldiers are not enough to restore peace and order in Iraq. More is required.
The UN must become involved. We therefore now see it as a very important task to rebuild and strengthen the UN.
That is one of the reasons why my group proposes that we give this year's Sakharov Prize to Hans Blix, Doctor El Baradei and Mr de Mello.
The idea is for Parliament to send a signal that what we wish to strengthen is international law.
We wish to strengthen the UN system, and we believe that this is the prerequisite for success in that rebuilding of Iraq that we all wish to see.
Mr President, before speaking on the subject of Iraq, I would like to honour the memory not only of Mr Vieira de Mello, but also of that of one of his fellow-workers, Mr Jean-SÃ©lim Kanaan.
Mr Kanaan had worked for the European Parliament as an assistant to Pierre Pradier, and for the Commission, particularly in Burundi.
Let me now turn to Iraq, where I believe there are great dangers.
There are those who say that the United States should admit their mistakes.
Where is that going to get us?
Personally, I do not want to be in the right and tell the Americans that they were wrong, because there was, at the time, one question to which we had no answer, and it was this: 'How do we rid ourselves of Saddam Hussein?'
We may have been right to oppose the war, but we did not come up with any alternative way of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.
In this respect, then, Commissioner Patten is right: the Iraqi people have the right to live in peace without Saddam Hussein.
Today, Saddam Hussein is no longer in power, but the Iraqi people are not yet living in peace.
In such a situation, what matters is not whether or not we are satisfied with what the Americans are doing, but that we help them and the British to emerge from their isolation.
Whether or not we were right beforehand, it is for us to take the most intelligent approach now.
That, alas, is too expensive, which is why Great Britain is currently reviewing its position.
This is the devil of a business, being more about money than about principles, but that is life.
Even if the UN were to adopt a resolution tomorrow, and the United States were to hand over operational command to it, it would not find it a simple matter to pacify Iraq.
The UN is not God, and nor, for that matter, is Europe.
What do you do in a situation like that, when a society that once knew such power has now completely fallen to pieces?
There are those who say we have no right to occupy a country.
To them I would reply that the Allies had the right to occupy Germany.
If the United Nations had decided that Iraq had to be occupied, that would have been legitimate.
The problem is that the UN has come to no such decision.
There are times, unfortunately, when you have to occupy a country if you want to overturn a dictatorship.
I would welcome it if, today, the European Union were to put forward proposals by, for example, organising a conference on stability and peace in the region, which would involve Iran and other nearby countries. This would allow the United States and Great Britain to slowly find their way back to the UN.
By concentrating the debate on the rights and wrongs of a UN resolution, we are in fact in a deadlock, as neither side is at present able to overcome yesterday's divisions.
What this means is that we have to work towards a solution by taking a different route, that of a conference on stability and peace in the region, and then hand over to the UN, which will take charge of rebuilding democracy in Iraq.
I do not, unfortunately, believe that next year's elections will bring us any closer to solving the problem of how to stabilise that country.
Mr President, it is a matter of very great concern that the security situation in Iraq has deteriorated very badly in recent weeks.
The US forces in Iraq are simply not able to ensure the security of either Iraqis or foreign nationals.
Sadly, not for the first time in history, a war has been won, but the peace lost.
The forces based in Iraq are sadly contending with daily acts of sabotage and loss of life.
Banditry is rife in Baghdad and on all major transport routes leading to the capital.
The Governing Council does not appear to command the support of the Iraqi people.
Most Iraqis do not see the Council as being responsible for the country's administration and continue to blame the coalition for the many hardships they endure.
I strongly believe that the United Nations must be called upon to play the central role in the political, economic and military transition in Iraq.
We must all seek to restore Iraq to the international community under an indigenous and representative government.
But the bottom line is that the US and British forces are simply unable to cope with what is a rapidly deteriorating security situation.
I am convinced that the difficult political problems in Iraq can only be effectively addressed in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations.
There is growing political support for this position.
Security issues are always best addressed collectively.
The United Nations is the body that commands the support and goodwill of the broader international community.
I do not believe that the troops in Iraq can oversee the peacekeeping efforts in that country.
The forces there cannot responsibly administer day-to-day activities in the country.
We should not seek to reopen the debate as to the merits or demerits of what happened in Iraq earlier this year.
I do not believe that this would serve any constructive purpose.
We need to come together to ensure that the citizens of Iraq are protected.
The only way in which this can be achieved is if the United Nations is centrally involved.
The situation in Iraq is a dispiriting one, to say the least.
But there is no way out of this impasse unless the United Nations takes the leading role across a range of political activities.
Mr President, how can the European institutions help the much-troubled Iraqi people?
The Council can considerably enhance the internal and external legitimacy of the newly formed Iraqi transitional government by recognising this policy and giving assistance in any way possible.
The Commission can, in consultation with the Council and Parliament, offer bankrupt Mesopotamia generous financial and humanitarian aid.
This House can invite the newly-appointed Iraqi Foreign Minister, Hushyar Zibari, to Brussels or Strasbourg, to give us first-hand information about the situation in his country.
Such initiatives at European level would show our commitment to a better political future for the peoples of Iraq.
They would promote the stabilisation of a troubled region, contribute to the mutual settlement of the transatlantic discord over Iraq, and, all in all, would make a big difference.
This would, at the same time, be Europe's response to the murderous forces of the old Saddam regime and the so-called jihadists.
They should not prolong the suffering of the Iraqi people.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Bendit has, I am glad to say, made a number of valid statements, and one of them is that - whether the US policy is right or wrong, and our US friends often make serious mistakes - the point is that we Europeans have no policy at all.
This is the basic situation which, I fear, despite the Convention which you all applauded this morning, will not, alas, change in the coming years: we Europeans have not established a policy, neither in the past nor, I regret to say, now.
I believe that the reconstruction effort and our financial generosity are more than appreciable, but that is not enough to constitute a policy.
I cannot see what we are proposing other than recourse to the United Nations, but the United Nations is no greater than its component member states.
For the moment, the Arab countries - many of which stand to benefit if things deteriorate for, indeed, it would mean going home for many of them if Iraq were to start functioning properly - are keeping a close eye on things and many countries of the European establishment are also standing by, maybe waiting for the Americans to fail.
It disturbs me when I hear terrorist attacks described as legitimate resistance.
I am concerned by these ambiguities at which, quite frankly, I am amazed, to say the least, even just hearing the terms used.
Tell the Iraqis who have died that this is legitimate resistance.
It may well be that we too continue to be undecided, even at a time when success in Iraq is in everyone's interests, first and foremost the interests of the Iraqi people, who have suffered 20 years of martyrdom at the hands of Saddam Hussein.
They, like all of us, have the right to a different kind of life and a different kind of development.
Our cowardly actions will not help them; our cowardly actions will certainly not take us even half a step forwards along the road to democracy.
I wish you luck, Commissioner.
Reconstruction is necessary, but Europe has yet to conceive a policy for the region.
Mr President, the prophets of doom, such as myself, you, Mrs Frahm, and many others, unfortunately seem, at present, to have been right during the debate on possible intervention.
Following the attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad and the attack on the sacred Shiite sites in Najaf, the faint hopes of a lull that would make it possible to gradually legitimise the authorities established by the coalition are disappearing, and with them the prospect of a more or less short-term transfer of the coalition's current responsibilities.
I do not believe that it is sufficient to catch Saddam Hussein, which needs to happen soon, in order to put an end to the chaos that the dictator on the run is so keen to maintain, but that many others with him and, if need be, after him have decided to magnify further.
I am thinking, of course, of the religious extremists who are prepared to die in order to fight the United States under the banner of Al Qaeda and other fundamentalist organisations.
I am also thinking of its large neighbour, Iran, which cannot remain unaffected by the situation in Iraq.
I am thinking, above all, of the Iraqi people themselves who, rightly or wrongly - as many have said here - consider the occupation of their country to be unacceptable, regardless of the justification.
In this latter, mainly psychological field, in my view the international community, which quite rightly hopes to end this chaos as soon as possible, has no option but to legitimise its action by voting on a new Security Council resolution that entrusts the United Nations with the task of restoring order in the country and preparing the necessary transition to a legitimate Iraqi Government.
This was your objective, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I welcome the fact that the latest known US proposals seem to be moving in that direction.
Mr President, Mr Frattini, Commissioner Patten, I was one of those who, like Mr Morillon, warned of what could happen after such a war.
I wish I had been wrong in my predictions, and take no pleasure in having been proved right.
This is not about establishing who was right, who was to blame, or anything else of the sort, but about finding a way to resolve this situation.
Most of us, I believe, take the view that an international solution is the only way out, but that requires international legitimacy, and that must first be established.
It is because of the absence of such legitimacy in the past that the UN and the occupying powers must determine who does what, when, and where, and must clearly mark out their areas of responsibility.
I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqis themselves must be involved at the earliest possible stage if, instead of concentrating on security and waiting until it is established, we consider as a whole the reconstruction measures that will be necessary - by which I mean the process of democratisation, the re-establishment of government, the creation of order, and of course the safety of all the people in Iraq, along with the rebuilding of infrastructure such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as hospitals and schools.
The sooner the people of Iraq themselves take on responsibility for the rebuilding of their country - its political system and democracy, not forgetting of course the technological, social and cultural dimension - the sooner we can expect the situation to return to normal.
If they are to do that, I believe, they will have to have a definite prospect of taking their destiny into their own hands in the very near future; that is why we have to set very tight deadlines in the expectation that a constituent assembly will be elected in Iraq, perhaps by the end of this year, giving the Iraqis a sense of working together with us on these matters.
I think that if international legitimacy is established and the Iraqis are enabled to share responsibility for what happens to them, we in the European Union will be able, by means of common action, to make what is in fact an important contribution; today's debate has shown that the great political and national differences of the past are no more, and that we all agree, in principle, on the same objective, that of seeing this country rebuilt.
Mr President, Iraq today belongs to the Iraqi people.
Freedom from the yoke of a terrible tyranny has been achieved.
30 years of vicious oppression, marked only by a few bloodied milestones of failed invasions abroad and genocidal assaults at home lie in the past.
Yet guilty men and women are still at large.
Trials are essential, but Iraqi judges cannot carry the burden alone.
Their vulnerability is too acute to act in isolation of an international judicial framework and a freer Iraq lies vulnerable to gangs of organised criminals as well as to terrorist incursions.
Securing her borders as well as the provision of increased protection for the Iraqi people are both imperatives today.
Surely the time has come for Nato to join with the Coalition forces.
These already number many nations, but lack the benefits of Nato's longstanding expertise and close coordination.
The Nato umbrella could properly protect the UN's essential guiding hand in an advisory, humanitarian and developmental role.
Without that protection the UN agencies simply cannot function.
The keynote themes of the late and much mourned Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim included the demand for the full establishment of the rule of law and of the entrenchment of human rights in a federal constitution.
Inward investment, the development of civil society, small businesses and citizens' rights and freedoms, are also part of the democratic process that is starting to come together.
We in the European Union have decades of confidence and experience in all these fields.
Let us now take up the challenge and join, in every way we can, in the restoration of Iraq's rich culture and human diversity and her return into the family of nations, through the establishment of a free and democratic state.
Mr President, it is too late now to discuss whether the war in Iraq was right or necessary.
If anything, it is the responsibility of the United States of America to think about whether mistakes were made in this context.
Unfortunately, what has happened is what we feared.
The dictator Saddam Hussein has been ousted, but the country is not at peace, conditions are chaotic, and aggression on the ground is increasing, not only in Iraq.
That is why it is important to play our part, together with the USA, in bringing peace, order and hope to the people of Iraq.
As Europeans, with our experience, our culture of peace and our economic opportunities, we too are called upon to make our contribution towards a better future for Iraq.
A retaliatory or 'I told you so' attitude is counterproductive now.
I say this as someone who visited Iraq shortly before the war and warned about precisely the outcomes that we are witnessing today.
Our duty, our responsibility now is to rebuild the country, and it is probable that we Europeans will be judged by whether we can now find a solution to the problems in Iraq, and that means policies.
We must find a solution if we are to regain any credibility in this context.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history often needs time to judge the pertinence and effectiveness of a political decision.
In the case in point, it has scarcely need of time to judge the decision taken by President Bush and his henchman, the British Prime Minister, to destroy Iraq, for that was indeed the aim.
In reality, history will recall that this sad affair is based on a double lie.
I am not going to dwell on the first lie as it has been mentioned many times: it is the famous pretext that one has to destroy a country in order to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction.
There were none, as we said, as the inspectors said, and that was confirmed.
We must, however, look closely at the second lie, which is just as, if not more, serious.
Do President Bush and Tony Blair really want to eradicate Islamicism or, on the contrary, did they want to promote it and establish it in Iraq?
As I have already said in this House, a year ago Iraq was the only Arab country that was totally free of any trace of Islamic fundamentalism.
Today, it is very much in evidence and plays there as in a playground.
Will the empire continue for a long time to play with Islamic fundamentalism and will it continue to receive the backing of those who support it unconditionally?
This is an extremely sad situation.
There are many Members who supported that policy in this Parliament.
I regret this on behalf of Europe for in actual fact all they have done is encourage a sad, short-sighted policy.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will no doubt have noticed that French politicians are constantly talking about sovereignty and independence at the moment, but the federalist activists can set their minds at rest, they are not talking about France, they are talking about Iraq.
They are talking about an Iraq where the automatic effects of the initial strategic error are all too evident.
The continued military occupation is turning the country into a special theatre of operations for the terrorists, who are even forming another coalition, improbable though it may be, bringing together Islamists returned from exile, all kinds of Jihadists and survivors of the Ba'ath apparatus.
You certainly do not need to be a geopolitical genius to see that as long as the foreign military occupation continues, there will be insecurity.
The solution is thus not to seek a broader coalition or UN backing for the coalition.
We know what that does.
If we want to stop terrorism developing in Iraq, there is no option but to return sovereignty to the Iraqis.
We must urgently draw up a timetable for a political transition led by the Iraqis themselves with the assistance, Mr President, of the international community as a whole.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the developments we are currently witnessing in Iraq are, in some ways, reminiscent of what happened in the former Yugoslavia.
Once the totalitarian regime that had suppressed them had been toppled, all internal forces were unleashed, sometimes violently.
It is the same with Iraq.
Under these circumstances, an 'I told you so' attitude or gloating is inappropriate and unwarranted; rather, the situation is something for us to be concerned about.
A regime of criminals has been ousted and that is a good thing, and it was necessary, but we are certainly not on a direct road to peace, stability and the rule of law.
That is why the Europeans need to play a part.
In my view, it is not enough to point out to the Americans the obvious fact that they are incapable of restoring peace by military means alone.
That is why Europe's hour has come.
We must provide help.
It is our responsibility, and it is also in our interests to do so.
I therefore want to say this to Commissioner Patten: he can count on the support of the CDU/CSU delegation in this House, both for his commitment and for the fact that we must put our money where our mouths are - for it will cost money.
We will have to justify why we are spending the money.
So let me say again: it is in our interests to make an effective contribution, together with the United Nations and, of course, with the United States of America and Great Britain, to support the road towards peace, stability and the rule of law in Iraq.
Mr President, as we discuss the war in Iraq we should realise immediately that never in the history of the world has there been a war in which the vast majority of victims have not been innocent civilians.
For that reason, it should be our primary objective now, as we enter the new century and the new millennium, to do all in our power to ensure that Iraq is the last war in the history of the world.
The way to do that for the European Union should be as follows: instead of sending armies to areas of conflict, we should be sending the philosophy and principles of peace, plus a large team of officials to promote dialogue.
I know what I am talking about in this regard.
The European Union is in a very powerful position to do this.
Look at the century we have just left.
The first half was the worst in the history of the world: two world wars and 50 million human beings slaughtered.
Who could have forecast that in the second half of that century all those countries would be together or that we would be all together as we are today?
Therefore, we should study how that was done and how the philosophy behind it was sent to every area of conflict.
Principle number one of the European Union is respect for difference.
What is all conflict about?
Difference in religion, nationality and race.
The answer to difference is to respect it.
Principle number two is to have institutions to do that.
Principle number three creates the circumstances in which they can then all work together in their common interests and break down the barriers of the past.
Those are the three principles we have in our peace process in Northern Ireland.
The European Union and all the world's major countries should come together to create that kind of world and to take the necessary steps to prevent war.
The European Union itself, as I have said before - given that it is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution - might begin by creating a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation, backed up by a department of peace and reconciliation, which could be sent to areas of conflict with the principles of conflict resolution that are the heart of the European Union.
In doing that, let us build a world for the new century and the new millennium in which there will no longer be any war or any conflict but total respect for diversity.
Because when you look at humanity no two human beings are the same.
Difference is the essence of humanity, and it should therefore be totally respected and never fought over.
Mr President, I am pleased that Mrs Frahm and Mr Messner drew attention to the warnings given by those of us who were in Iraq in February.
I am glad that they did so because they must form part of our reflections upon how the future is to look.
Now that the United States has realised that it will require far more money and forces to maintain the occupation of Iraq than there is the grass-roots and political will to provide, the possibility is in fact emerging of a multinational force, which the United States wishes to command.
That is, of course, completely and utterly unacceptable, however, just as it is that the coalition should continue, with a larger number of countries helping out.
No, the task in question must be continued by the UN.
It must be carried out under the auspices of the UN, just as it is the UN that must now go in and support the holding of democratic elections in Iraq so that Iraq might, as soon as is humanly possible, assume responsibility for its own future.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has led a number of telling tributes to Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello and the UN team whose lives were taken by that appalling bombing incident.
Today, I want to pay tribute to one of my own constituents, Mr Dewi Pritchard, a man from Bridgend in South Wales, 35 years of age, the father of two children aged six and just 12 months.
He was killed just a week ago, the first UK reservist to be killed in this conflict.
His role, as a military policeman, was to play a part in the training of the 35 000 Iraqi police officers out of the ultimate target of 65 000.
He had worked for nine years for the German-owned Bosch company in South Wales and yet when the call came in June in the post-conflict situation to play his part in reconstruction he willingly went to Iraq and paid for that with his life.
His memory is one that we should treasure as well.
No one who has witnessed the deaths of coalition troops, the bombing of the UN headquarters building in Baghdad and last week's attack on the mosque in Najaf, could fail to agree that security and stability are now the paramount concerns in Iraq.
The coalition forces and the Iraqi Governing Council must have our full support in putting in place the rebuilding of Iraq and the process of transition to democracy.
Clearly the United Nations has an important role to play in this process and it is endeavouring to do so.
However, calls for the UN to take immediate control of the situation, or even Mr Souchet's suggestion of a withdrawal and leaving it to the Iraqis, only play into the hands of the remnants of the old regime and some other outside forces which are clearly engaged in a campaign of destabilisation.
European and UN responsibility should be fully engaged in supporting the process of reconstruction which is currently being taken forward by the coalition forces in Iraq, and the courageous men and women who are taking it forward on our behalf.
Mr President, I believe that Commissioner Patten has focused the debate perfectly.
We have the choice of either indulging in sterile argument, accusing each other of being irresponsible - which reminds me of the old medieval arguments about how many angels fit on the point of a needle - or of the international community, in general, and the European Union, in particular, mobilising the best of its efforts in order to restore security, stability and democracy in Iraq.
And let there be no mistake, the democratisation of Iraq is not the exclusive competence of the United States: it is a responsibility which falls to the international community and as such is a worldwide need.
I believe - like Mrs Bonino - that it is essential that we are very careful about what we say.
The cowardly terrorist attack which killed the United Nations representative, Mr Vieira de Mello, the Spanish naval captain, Mr MartÃ­n Oar, and other people, can in no way be compared to an act of resistance.
It is an act of terrorism pure and simple.
Since when, Mr President, has radical Islamic terrorism required a pretext for committing its horrendous attacks?
I believe that Mr Patten has made a statement loaded with pragmatism and good sense and I, if I had to consider any aspect as urgent - apart from security - would place the emphasis on infrastructures because, being an inert system, it makes accumulated backlogs irrecoverable.
Water, electricity and telecommunications services and spare parts are a great challenge for the international community, and I am sure that what the European Union must do is demonstrate at the Madrid meeting the financial commitment which lives up to the ambitions, Mr President, which were expressed to us this morning in this House by Mr Giscard d'Estaing in a style befitting a world leader when he presented us with the draft European Constitution.
. (IT) Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken and, in particular, Commissioner Patten and many of the speakers for their undertaking to further the success of the Donors' Conference to be held in Madrid, and I would like to thank the House for the many comments made, which I will not repeat.
I would like to say, however, that the instability and the attacks on the US and UK forces are a problem for everyone - they have been right from the start, right from the first attack - and not just for the coalition forces.
It needs to be made quite clear - I do not think anyone has any doubts on this matter - that terrorism is never justified, that retaliatory action carried out using bombs, using suicide bombers, is never legitimate: this is one of our fundamental principles.
Clearly, however, in addition to tanks and weapons, now we have to take to Iraq a roadmap for democracy, a roadmap for political and institutional reconstruction and for a new Iraqi Government.
That is why the Presidency has said and continues to say that we need a UN mandate; that is why, because Europe currently feels the need to reinvigorate UN action but, at the same time, wants the United Nations to be more effective, more capable of taking decisions and shouldering responsibilities than it was during the eventful weeks preceding military action.
I believe we must look to the future, to when Europe will be able, for instance - as someone has said - to express in the Security Council opinions which have been discussed beforehand and agreed upon by the 25 European countries.
I feel this is a necessary experiment.
We must make every effort to this end, so that we may come closer to realising the dream - for that is what it is - of having a European seat in the United Nations.
That is why the Presidency will report, next Friday at the General Affairs Council, on the positions - which I hope will converge and coincide - of the UN, Russia and the United States on a new resolution, giving the UN a central role, and then attempt to set out alongside these evaluations and opinions the unified position of Europe.
It would, I believe, be an excellent, exemplary way of boosting Euro-Atlantic cohesion, to which the Presidency is committed, doing so precisely on the matter of Iraq, an issue which has damaged the relationship between us Europeans and our US friends in recent months.
The Presidency therefore confirms that it will make every endeavour to this effect.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy expects to prepare a resolution to be voted at the September II part-session.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
Mr President, the present situation in Iraq and all that has preceded over the last 12 years are not only the result of the world-domination policy of the USA and its closest allies.
A great deal of responsibility and complicity also lies with the EU which, despite many proclamations by its members about respect for international law, has legalised the above crimes and is continuing, as today has made clear, to legalise the barbaric occupation of Iraq, hoping to secure a share of the spoils.
For the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, this unacceptable situation goes against the feelings of our peoples, as expressed - including in the European Union - in the past and present mass demonstrations.
It will only change with the immediate withdrawal of the occupying armies, so that the Iraqi people can take their fate in their own hands, and on payment by the invaders of the compensation needed in order to reconstruct Iraq.
This should have been the stand of the ?U if it wanted to respect international law instead of helping to flout it.
Everything else is a 'pretext for evil'.
Any attempt to continue to use the UN to get the USA 'out of a fix' and to continue the occupation is bound to fail.
It is certain that the resistance of the Iraqi people against the conquerors, under any guise, will continue with increasing international solidarity.
The next item is the joint debate on the Annual Report (A5-0274/2003), by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on human rights in the world in 2002 and the European Union's human rights policy (2002/2011(INI)).
. (NL) Where human rights in the world are concerned, the European Union should play a leading role.
We are, after all, a community of values and a major economic power, but we are unfortunately leaving something to be desired.
The European Union is not lacking in good intentions or policy resolutions.
There is, however, a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality.
The criticism is mainly aimed at the Member States and concerns incoherence and a lack of decisiveness.
The Council recognises the shortcomings and has expressly promised improvements, so far with little noticeable result.
Political dialogue with third countries is still optional.
As long as economic or strategic interests are paramount to human rights for us, one can continue to enter into dialogue until the cows come home, but obviously little will change.
Specific goals must be developed and the governments involved must be called to account.
Not only sanctions, but also positive incentives, in particular, can help progress on its way.
What are the options for improving the dialogues according to the Council and the Commission?
The Council is required to consult Parliament and take its opinions on foreign policy into consideration.
Unfortunately, though, this is hardly ever done in practice, something that we in this House, of course, find unacceptable.
The European Union's role in the world concerns the European citizens and therefore their representatives.
Success or failure outside of the European Union has repercussions for many sectors within the EU.
According to my research, there was only one single occasion last year when the Council discussed a human rights resolution from this House.
Of all our written questions, not one was answered in time.
I welcome the fact that the Council is present in this debate, in the person of Mr Antonione.
Let this be the start of a new, constructive and intense relationship.
I should like to ask the Commission for a schedule for the long term and a systematic impact assessment of the projects.
I should also like to ask the Commission to finalise the internal reforms, intensify staff training and finance in a balanced manner the fight against torture and the rehabilitation of its victims.
On our part, we as a parliament may be very active in condemning many human rights violations across the world, but we do not give enough consideration to what comes next.
We must organise our work in such a way that we continue to monitor the human rights situations discussed and, if necessary, sound the alarm again.
My report also asks for particular attention to be given to freedom of religion and conscience, and to the abuse of religions for political ends.
Religions are still being suppressed across the globe.
Half of the world's population lives in countries where freedom of religion is restricted.
Moreover, it is particularly disturbing that human rights should be violated on a massive scale in the name of religion.
Almost half of the violent conflicts in the period under scrutiny have a religious dimension.
Over the past decade, religions have been experienced more intensely, but not, unfortunately, only in a peaceful manner.
In all major world religions, radicalism is on the rise, something mainly attributable to globalisation.
The revolution of global contacts does not immediately lead to more understanding and respect between communities of faith.
On the contrary, people feel threatened by what they experience as an encroachment on their own standards and values.
Radicalism, too, is the result of dissatisfaction among the masses of young people.
Irresponsible leaders exploit these feelings of unrest, sometimes with the help of major financial sources and terrorist networks.
Clashes among, and within, religions represent a very serious threat to human rights and world peace, with, moreover, the risk that religious confrontations outside of Europe will have repercussions on our own multi-religious societies.
Given the seriousness of the threat, it is of the utmost importance for the European Union to chart the problem and to design a strategy.
The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has already set the tone for this.
What is the opinion of the Commission and the Council?
What do they think of the specific recommendations I have made in this respect in my report?
Finally, two topics that are also very close to my heart.
The objectionable caste system.
Worldwide, more than 260 million people suffer discrimination, violence and exploitation on a daily basis, purely by reason of their origin.
The European Union should make it policy to promote the abolition of these immoral practices.
Children.
All over the world, children are being exploited, neglected or exposed to violence.
More than 300 000 young people are currently taking active part in armed conflicts.
Every three seconds, a child dies of malnutrition.
In a fully-fledged EU development policy, the child should occupy centre stage.
Finally, modesty does not become the European Union as a community of values and economic power where human rights are concerned.
We in Europe should have the nerve to stick our necks out; the victims are eagerly waiting for this.
. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this great opportunity to address you as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, and I am particularly happy that it has come in the context of a debate on human rights.
Before I proceed, I must offer my condolences and the condolences of the Italian Presidency for the death of SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello, who, in his capacity as United Nations High Commissioner, had already established himself as a valiant champion of the promotion and defence of human rights at international level.
The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union's foreign policy and it is a constant reference point for its activities on the world stage.
The Union adheres to the fundamental principle of the universal nature of human rights, which cannot be challenged or distorted by any cultural influence.
Human rights are one of the key factors in addressing the major challenges of our time: I do not need to mention the close connection between peace, security and stability, on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other.
Similarly, there is a close connection between the fight against extreme poverty and underdevelopment and measures seeking to secure fundamental human rights, starting with the right of every human being to life, integrity and dignity.
In this context, we therefore believe that it is of key importance during this six-month term to set the north-south dialogue on a more constructive basis, for it has deteriorated considerably in recent months, particularly as regards the subject of human rights, which must continue to be an essential part of the dialogue.
The Italian Presidency's human rights programme has been made public and so I do not need to illustrate it at length. I will confine myself to mentioning a few key points.
They include mainstreaming human rights into the widest possible external projection of the Union and taking concentrated measures worldwide to promote a moratorium on and the abolition of the death penalty.
They also include a range of constructive political initiatives to eliminate the use of torture and to promote an agreement on the human rights of people with disabilities.
A particular boost needs to be given to the structured dialogue with Iran and China, and a thorough debate needs to be launched on the work of the Commission on Human Rights.
Then the Italian Presidency attaches great importance to the tragic phenomenon of child soldiers.
I would mention, lastly, the initiatives that the Union is going to take in the General Assembly third committee and the provision of the European Union's annual report on human rights, as well as the annual meeting with non-governmental organisations, which we want to make more constructive this year.
I would now like to congratulate Mr Bob van den Bos on drafting the European Parliament's annual report, which is full of ideas, analyses, proposals and recommendations.
It is a document that warrants extremely thorough analysis, which, of course, is impossible to achieve in this sitting.
However, it will be analysed in a careful assessment by the other elements and bodies of the European Union.
On this occasion, therefore, I will, if I may, focus on just a few of the report's ideas which I feel deserve particular attention.
I will start with a general point made in the report with which I, personally, agree: despite the prodigious efforts of the Union and other countries, the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the world is, still today, marked by serious abuses and violations.
The causes of this can be traced back to a number of factors.
The report focuses on some of them, such as the prevailing of political and economic interests over human rights and the need to achieve compromise positions in international fora to the detriment of positions of principle.
Indeed, if we are now convinced that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms lie at the very heart of democracy and civilised coexistence, we cannot, at the same time, fail to be of the opinion that the pursuit of legitimate political and economic goals demands the consolidation of democratic institutions and the principles of freedom and justice.
It is well known that dictatorships, which are based on terror and violence, reject the democratic ideal, denying fundamental rights and freedoms, seeking to abuse their power with regard to other peoples and, ultimately, proving to be unreliable consultative partners.
What strategy should the European Union pursue in relations with these regimes?
The report states: 'The ? political ? dialogues which the EU undertakes with third countries have so far not led to many results.'
Should we, therefore, see them as an instrument which is not effective, admit that the policy of human rights dialogue with third countries has not, in many cases, led to appreciable results and give up on them?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr van den Bos's report contains the answers to this question, and I endorse them.
We have a duty to condemn publicly the unacceptable practices perpetrated by certain regimes, for, in this way, the perpetrators are placed in a position where they are forced to justify themselves at the very least, to face the judgment of the international community.
With regard to the approach of structured human rights dialogue with third countries, the line proposed in the report is precisely that which the Council intended to take on this instrument.
In my view, this is not permissive dialogue which is an alternative to forms of political condemnation, but it fully involves civil society, including NGOs and figures from the academic world who are active in the field of human rights, and it is based on the pursuit of precise goals whose implementation is monitored carefully and regularly.
I also endorse the point contained in the report on the need for political dialogue and condemnation to go hand in hand with proactive programmes and measures in the field of combating poverty, support for institution building and education.
Monitoring, resolutions, dialogues, human rights clauses and cooperation and technical assistance programmes in the field are all instruments for achieving a single objective - the unceasing defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the world.
The Union's human rights dialogue underway with China and Iran does not mean that it cannot condemn violations and abuse through ad hoc resolutions too, where it considers that to be necessary, in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly, nor does it mean that it cannot provide them with technical assistance in the field intended to consolidate respect for human rights.
The same applies to the part of the report which levels severe criticism at the Council for failing to publicly condemn the regimes responsible for repeated, serious human rights abuses in its work.
I would not presume to reject these criticisms point blank, but I do, however, feel that some clarification is necessary.
It is certainly limiting to assess the Union's activity on the basis of the number of resolutions per country that it presents to the Commission on Human Rights or to the General Assembly, or even on the basis of the resolutions which achieve sufficient consensus.
In any case, the part played by the European Union in the field of human rights within international fora is fully recognised.
In actual fact, as has already been pointed out, the Union's activity in this field covers a very wide range of different initiatives, from the measures contained in the reports of the Heads of Mission to public statements.
This European activity targets a large number of countries.
There is another aspect I would like to focus on which is dealt with in particular depth in the report: intercultural and inter-faith dialogue.
The report specifically highlights the key nature of this issue for the wider framework of the protection of human rights.
I represent a country which, because of its location, culture and traditions, has always been particularly sensitive to this issue and which has now acquired influence and importance which it has never known in the past.
What might at one time have been considered an opportunity to be seized has now become absolutely vital.
Ideological opposition to and political exploitation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are, I am afraid, a fact, however much we might condemn them.
The atmosphere of antagonism that increasingly marks dialogue in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is also dealt with at length in the report, is an issue on which the Greek Presidency has already launched a debate, which we intend to pursue and develop.
The action of the Union and the western countries, in general, in the field of human rights is clearly perceived by part of the international community, particularly the southern hemisphere, it would appear, as a manipulative attempt to pursue political and cultural abuses of power.
The very principle of the universality of human rights and the conviction that they cannot be constrained or limited by any social, economic or cultural group are challenged.
Fundamentalism, whatever its origin or nature, is, in part, the result of an inability to communicate, to search for common values based on mutual respect and tolerance.
I do not believe it is enough, in this regard, for the Union to limit itself to firmly rejecting the accusations of using double standards which are often levelled at it.
Rather, there needs to be a discussion on these matters, to which the European Parliament could contribute.
In this connection, I would inform you that, at the initiative of Italy, a convention on the universality of human rights and intercultural dialogue is to be held in March 2004 in Milan.
In drawing up the guidelines for our six-month term of office in the field of human rights, one of the essential points we considered it necessary to highlight, as I said before, is mainstreaming.
It must be our objective to integrate, harmoniously and coherently, the issue of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms into all the Union's policies on third countries.
I am therefore particularly pleased to note that this concept is expressed clearly and forcibly by Parliament in the report.
In this connection, I fully support the idea that the human rights clause contained in association and cooperation agreements should be implemented unfailingly whenever the conditions for its application arise.
I also feel that a relationship of cooperation with a country at all levels - political, economic, scientific and cultural - must, of necessity, include open, constructive dialogue on matters of protecting fundamental rights and freedoms.
The report contains interesting, practical proposals on which I have already ordered studies and technical analyses to be carried out.
I would, moreover, like to say that there may be different ways of achieving the same goals and objectives.
Experience has taught us that setting up committees or working groups may often be the most immediate, obvious solution but it sometimes proves not to be the most effective way of proceeding in practice.
Another theme of the report which is worthy of mention is transparency.
It is right to pay tribute to the Danish Presidency for encouraging and promoting the practice of regular, unfailing consultation with civil society, which has undoubtedly contributed to raising the profile of the European Union's work.
This practice was taken up by the Greek Presidency and will continue to be a firm reference point for the Italian Presidency in its work.
I feel that, ultimately, it represents proper, appropriate recognition of the essential, indispensable role played in this field by NGOs, which are and will continue to be the European Union's necessary, privileged consultative partners.
Lastly, I would like to focus on a criticism made in the document, relating to institutional relations between the Council and the European Parliament in the area of human rights.
We will analyse in more depth the opinion expressed by the rapporteur to the effect that there needs to be an improvement in relations between the Council and Parliament, and I hereby commit the Italian Presidency to continuing the work started by the Greek Presidency in this area.
The invitation extended by the Greek Presidency to the rapporteur to take part in a meeting of the Human Rights Committee is representative of an approach which seeks to involve the European Parliament more closely in the Council's work.
The Italian Presidency is fully in favour of this, and I confirm that we intend to continue along the path already marked out, identifying appropriate solutions to the problems and inadequacies highlighted in the report.
In this sense, I hope that I will be able to report to the House at the end of the six months on the measures taken by the Council in the area of human rights.
The governments of the Member States of the Union now recognise the imperative need to guarantee the European Parliament's role as a driving force in the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and to foster forms of closer cooperation.
There will therefore have to be a proper debate on the constructive proposals put forward by the rapporteur.
I am happy to end by noting - and this is the point of most political significance - that the Council and Parliament agree on the importance and central nature of the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Union's policy and external relations.
It is an important fact which reflects our constantly-evolving approach to these issues, which are no longer confined to ethical statements and declarations of principle but are increasingly going to influence political decisions in relations with third countries.
The statement that international peace, security and stability are founded on full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms is not just empty rhetoric but reflects the reality that human rights are increasingly going to influence governments' decisions in the area of foreign policy and the strategies of international organisations at all levels.
. Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to Mr van den Bos for his excellent report.
The engagement of the European Parliament on human rights issues serves as a critical stimulus to EU policy, and there is much food for thought in this latest publication.
The Commission will, as usual, respond in writing to all the recommendations addressed to it in this report.
First, some remarks on the principal themes of the report - freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
We tried to work on these issues in several different ways.
First, through efforts in international fora.
With EU support, Ireland tabled the resolution on the Elimination of All Forms of Religious Intolerance at the UN Commission on Human Rights and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which urges states to guarantee freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief, facilitate worship and combat intolerance.
The EU's statement on human rights in the world at the last CHR highlighted concerns relating to religious freedom or freedom of expression in 12 countries, including China and Iran.
Second, thorough dialogue with third countries.
Dedicated human rights dialogues offer a particularly valuable opportunity to address the issue.
In evaluating the dialogue with Iran, for example, the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 March 2003 underscored its concern at discrimination against religious minorities - particularly Baha'is - and the need for more progress as regards freedom of opinion and expression.
Corporal punishment and the abhorrent condemnation to stoning, pronounced in the name of Sharia, have also been the cause of in-depth debates with representatives of the Iranian Government, judiciary and clergy.
Thus far, the EU has noted with satisfaction that the de facto moratorium on stoning is still a reality.
I hope further results will be achieved with our Iranian partners.
Freedom of expression will form the main subject for discussion at the next round-table under the human rights dialogue on 15 and 16 September 2003.
Thirdly, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights offers concrete support to projects in this field.
It has supported campaigns to promote freedom of expression - for example, a continuing project in the ASEAN countries, - and freedom of expression has been identified as a priority for 11 EIDHR focus countries in 2002 and 2003.
The Commission is also making significant efforts to establish a solid basis for effective intercultural dialogue, not least in the Mediterranean - a focus for the new neighbourhood policy - with the imminent report of the High-level Advisory Group and the proposal for a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation.
I noted the rapporteur's reference to the Cotonou Agreement.
This is a good, relevant reference.
The Cotonou Agreement shows that a comprehensive system can be negotiated with as many as 77 countries, but it also illustrates that there are some challenges and real problems to be dealt with.
However, the system is interesting.
I agree with Mr van den Bos.
Turning now to the human rights clause, I am pleased that Parliament's report emphasises the potential for the clause to induce positive change in the human rights situation in third countries.
