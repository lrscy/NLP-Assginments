Iran has exceeded many limits with regard to its uranium enrichment activities, its systematic violations of the dignity of women, men and, above all, children, and its support for what we rightly define as terrorist organisations.
Nevertheless, there is still an opportunity for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution.
As many Members have said â and I recall MrÂ Schulzâs remarks â Iran and Islam are not the same thing.
What is needed, therefore, is a regional dialogue aimed at securing stability and peace, one that primarily involves Iran, but also all the other actors in the region that are interested in a serious dialogue with the international community.
Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same, either.
Many Members have said so, the last of whom being MrsÂ BÄnovÃ¡.
It is clear that Europe can carry out political action through dialogue with civil society and the moderate forces in Iran that are fighting for freedom, that want to think for themselves and be free to choose their own destiny, and that do not trust the remarks of their President, which are designed to incite hatred and violence.
What are the options for the future?
I believe that the Security Council must now show evidence of its credibility and authority.
Those in this Chamber who questioned the role played by the Security Council are indirectly questioning the role that we all assign to it.
The Security Council represents the home of international legitimacy.
No one should be afraid that the Security Council will hold an extensive and in-depth debate on the Iranian crisis, since it is precisely the forum to which such a matter must be brought.
We have appealed to the Security Council on many occasions.
The time has now come to give the Security Council the opportunity to really play its due role.
MrÂ President, Europe is faced with the choice between, on the one hand, working to achieve peace and regional stability â as I believe is our duty â and, on the other, pretending that nothing is going on, with the danger of an aggressive nuclear power arising in the region.
Europe has a great opportunity to exercise diplomacy and to show determination.
Before we talk even only vaguely about any non-peaceful option, I believe that it is better that we emphasise democracy, determination and diplomacy as instruments for resolving the conflicts and the potential violence that we must do everything possible to avoid.
It is not a conflict that is under way, but a different approach to rights, values and democracy.
If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, six motions for resolutions(1) have been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â What should we do with the ânuclearâ mullahs?
What initiatives should we adopt in connection with the Tehran regime, which is forging ahead with the construction of nuclear weapons?
The European Union must adopt determined positions in order to avoid creating an explosive situation in the Middle East and in Eurasia.
The ayatollahsâ atomic bomb is a powerful weapon with which to blackmail the Iranian people.
It is a weapon used to silence the freest, most broad-minded opinions.
Iranian society seems to be drowned in silence.
An initiative is therefore needed to help those in Iran who fight for freedom, human rights and respect for all religious faiths and beliefs.
The silence of the Iranian people does not mean that they have given in of their own accord.
It will fall to them â to the men and women of Iran who have their countryâs best interests at heart â to defuse the mullahsâ bomb.
Iran and Islam are not the same; Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same.
Therefore, the dialogue must continue and must be tightened up.
We are not faced with a clash of civilisations, but rather with a different attitude towards human rights, freedom and democracy.
We must encourage a more careful and respectful attitude towards every fragment of humankind, because only in that way will it be possible to triumph over hatred and violence.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should just like to protest against the fact that this motion for a resolution is only available in English, since all the other language versions had to be pulped on account of errors.
In theory, one could refrain from voting altogether.
I do not wish to block the vote â this is an important issue and we have to vote â but, in my view, it is unacceptable to work in such a slipshod manner here when there are as few resolutions on the agenda as there are today.
Â Â  I take note of your objection â which I share â even though the services responsible for these matters inform me that other language versions were available.
We nevertheless give priority to the need to vote.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .The report on the air traffic controller licence on which we are about to vote is extremely important within the context of the creation of the Single European Sky.
The European harmonisation of national licences will allow controllers to work throughout the territory covered by the Single Sky.
Furthermore, this licence will lead in particular to improvements in terms of the safety of air traffic management and ensure that the training of future controllers is harmonised at a high level of competence.
This report advocates the approval of the Councilâs common position, which takes up the agreement reached a few months ago by our two institutions.
The compromise that we have reached with the Council takes account both of the legitimate concerns about increasing safety and the free movement requirements of air traffic controllers.
At a time when Europe is sometimes misunderstood by our fellow citizens, it is important that we look to projects such as this to restore their confidence in European integration.
I shall end by thanking the European Commissionâs services for their cooperation.
Â Â  .Just this once, we can be pleased with this text for several reasons.
The introduction of a common air traffic controller licence cannot fail to make a great contribution to the objective of safety that we all want to see for this sector, a sector in which we have unfortunately seen too many examples of tragic aviation incidents.
To this end, I am also pleased that the supplementary system of black lists of airlines considered to be dangerous has been established and can be applied to all of the States of the European Union.
Furthermore, I believe that it should be noted that Europe is moving in the right direction in terms of the harmonisation of the professional training and competences of air traffic controllers.
They are not in fact being harmonised downwards; quite the opposite.
With regard to the conditions for entry into the profession, the qualifications required and the content of initial training, relatively high social, technical, linguistic and professional standards are provided for.
This is particularly essential since, all too often unfortunately, air traffic controllers have to manage extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of an aircraft or an air crisis.
We must therefore protect this profession, because the safety of the passengers of an entire sector depends on it.
Â Â  . I welcome this Directive, the objective of which is to increase safety standards and to improve the operation of the Community air traffic control system.
I am glad that the Council and Parliament were able to reach a satisfactory compromise on the amendments that we adopted at first reading.
Â Â  The June List wholeheartedly supports the IAEAâs efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the confrontation between Iran and the international community and believes that it is the UN Security Council that is ultimately responsible for deciding on the measures that should be taken.
Because Iran is not within the immediate vicinity of the EU, this is not an issue for the EU if the Member States cannot achieve unanimous agreement in the Council on a common position.
It is in the Council that Sweden should make efforts to ensure that Iran does not develop into a nuclear power.
The issue is not, however, one for the European Parliament to deal with.
We have therefore chosen to refrain from trying to change the resolution and have voted against it in its entirety.
Â Â  . The title of the resolution before us, adopted by the majority in Parliament, is indicative of its underlying purpose: to fan the flames of the dispute over Iranâs nuclear programme.
It is no coincidence that the majority in Parliament rejected the proposed amendment tabled by our group, which urged âa peaceful political solution to the dispute over Iranâs nuclear programmesâ, reiterated âits opposition to any military action or threat of the use of forceâ, and stressed that âan escalation of the dispute would exacerbate the crisis in the regionâ.
The same is true of other proposed amendments, calling upon âall countries to avoid any threat to Iranâs territorial integrity and to condemn unequivocally any pre-emptive actionâ.
Instead of supporting measures aimed at diffusing international tensions, the majority in Parliament supports the idea of the UN Security Council taking control of the situation.
This measure meets the wishes of the United States, which has long sought Iranâs international isolation, and an excuse for fresh interference and dangerous military adventures aimed at imposing its dominance in the region and at protecting its economic interests.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the resolution on Iran, its condemnation of various remarks made by the President of Iran, and itsÂ serious concern regarding the present attitude of the Iranian authorities to the nuclear programme.
The EPLP also gives its strong support to theÂ involvement and initiatives of the EU-3, the IAEAÂ andÂ theÂ UN Security Council, confirming the need to pursue peaceful and diplomatic meansÂ to solve the crisis.Â The British Government's position is that militaryÂ action remains inconceivable and is not on the agenda.
Â Â  . Since the unexpected victory of the new Iranian President, MrÂ Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an increasingly tense situation has emerged between Iran and the international community, leading to a series of negotiations amongst Member States over Iran's desires for the development of nuclear energy.
I welcome the development of nuclear power when it is for civil use.
It is for this reason that all possible diplomatic pressures should be applied to the government of Iran to get it to conform to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so that any suspicions can be ruled out.
I must emphasise that the people of Iran should not be demonised or blamed in any way; our dispute is solely with its leadership and I regret the recent comments by President Ahmadinejad on Israel.
Â Â  . The people of Iran have no prospect of democracy, human rights or guarantees for minorities of the kind with which we in Europe are familiar.
The state is run by a bunch of people who are absolutely convinced that God is on their side.
They think they are entitled to decide how their people should live.
Many people have fled the country and among those who have stayed on, it is mainly women and young people who are desperate for change.
That is why it is short-sighted to see Iran only as a closed bloc constituting a threat to the outside world.
Even more so than in Iraq and Afghanistan, a military invasion, as is apparently being considered by the American President, is not the solution.
The threat to use nuclear bombs, as is being publicly considered by the French President, is even more dangerous.
Both threats would have the inevitable consequence that the people in Iran would look to their oppressing regime for protection, which would then be the lesser of two evils for them.
This completely removes any prospect of real change, human rights or democracy.
Europe would do better to ensure that various organisations of Iranians in exile, who advocate domestic change, could operate within the law.
Â Â  . â Î€he joint motion for a resolution on Iran by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is firing up tension and endeavouring to prepare public opinion to accept the new war being prepared by the imperialists on the pretext of the nuclear threat.
Despite the lip-service pronouncements against war, despite the lip-service assurances that the ÎU does not contest Iran's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is obvious that a programmed, aggressive plan by the imperialists is being implemented in order to control energy sources and the area as a whole by any means.
Any differentiations expressed relate to antagonisms between imperialist countries about their share of the booty.
At the same time, they are trying to obstruct other countries as well from developing technology and not being dependent on major imperialist countries.
Within this framework, a new version of the war plan against Iraq is being constructed.
Irrespective of the responsibilities of the government of Iran, the peoples must not and will not accept the imperialist plans against Iran and other countries in the area.
Any intervention with or without the consent of the Security Council will come up against a global outcry and demonstrations by the pacifist and grass-roots movement.
The people of Iran alone have the jurisdiction to resolve any serious political issues which exist in Iran.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Republic of Austria, it is a great honour for me to welcome you to our Parliament.
We are all pleased to have you here amongst us as President of the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the Union.
Before you took on the Presidency of your country, many Members of this Parliament including myself, and some who have greeted you in the aisles had the opportunity to meet you during your long career as a distinguished parliamentarian and President of the Austrian Parliament.
In all of your duties you have demonstrated your undeniable commitment to Europe, to European values, to Austriaâs cause in Europe and to Europeâs cause in the world.
Your visit to the European Parliament today offers us the opportunity to express the great respect we feel for you and pay homage to your considerable personal achievements, and those of your country, and its special place in the history and culture of Europe, as well as Austriaâs contribution to the recent development of the Union and the debate on its future.
You are taking up your post, Mr President, during what is unquestionably a complex stage in Europeâs history, during which we must face significant challenges.
We are dealing with some of them here in our Chamber during this part-session.
In a short space of time, the Austrian Presidency has shown that it is perfectly aware of the circumstances in which it is taking up the Presidency of the Council of the Union and of the need to restore the citizensâ faith in the European project, promoting integration and consolidating enlargement, and more specifically, ensuring that we make optimum use of the period of reflection we are in so that, at the end of it, we can revitalise the process of creating a constitution.
Few countries are in as good a position as Austria to confront these challenges.
Austria was on the periphery of the Union of 15, but now it is at the heart of the Europe of 25, which will soon be a Europe of 27 or more.
You are increasingly at the heart of the greater Europe.
For Austria and the Austrians, therefore, the free movement of goods, workers and services is not merely a formal provision of the Treaty that does not affect them.
On the contrary, it is a genuine everyday reality.
You are at the meeting point of all of Europeâs roads.
We are therefore looking to you and your government, because we hope that over the coming months you will contribute to moving the Union forward in a spirit of integration based on our founding values and objectives.
Mr President, we consider ourselves fortunate to have you here amongst us and we hope that you will play a decisive role in determining the direction that the future of Europe is to take.
You may rest assured you and the Austrian Government that the European Parliament will work to defend and promote the common European objective, while at all times taking account of the European citizensâ perception of it.
Mr President, it is now a great honour for me to ask you to take the floor before the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let me first express my thanks for the very kind introduction.
I hope you have not awakened extravagant expectations, but we will do our best.
A few days ago, a Member of your House with whom I am well-acquainted â she is herself from Austria â advised me, in my speech before your House today, not to spend too much time on introductory commonplaces, for you often welcome to this rostrum Heads of State or Government from the widest variety of countries as guest speakers, and you are more interested in politics than in being paid compliments.
In that case, I shall act on her advice, and hope that she was right.
I am sure you will not mind me saying that I regard myself, in a sense, as an old parliamentary warhorse who is happy to breathe parliamentary air, having been â as your President has just mentioned â for more than thirty years a member of the Austrian parliament.
That is a considerable period of time, and for a large part of it the division of Europe into East and West by the Iron Curtain seemed to be an unalterable fact.
The Russian intellectual Andrej Amalrik had, admittedly, written a fascinating book entitled âWill the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?â, in which he prophesied the collapse of the Soviet system, but this seemed to be out of touch with the political reality at the time.
For me, then â and I assume for most of us â the year 1989 and the months before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall were something of a political miracle.
Ever since then, I have believed in the possibility of political miracles, or at least in the possibility of that what at first sight appears to be a difficult or even hopeless endeavour being, in fact, accomplished.
At all events, the enthusiasm for the European project received an enormous boost at that time and took an additional dimension.
Alongside the principles underlying the European project as conceived by its founding fathers, namely the idea of peace and the ideal of personal and economic freedom of movement in the largest possible European area, for millions of people who had to live with all of four decades of Communist dictatorship after the end of the Second World War, it opened up the prospect of being able to lead a life in democracy and freedom after all.
It was therefore inevitable that, after the collapse of Communism and the enlargement of the European Union from 12 to 15 Member States â which was indeed to Austriaâs benefit â the topic of another, new round of enlargement, which was also seen as a kind of reunification of Europe, would appear on the agenda.
It was not easy, but we have, in the meantime â in 2004 â achieved that, and Bulgaria and Romania may be expected to join soon.
The name of Croatia may also be mentioned in this context.
In the wake of this development the issues of the borders of Europe and the European identity are increasingly being raised.
Much has been said and written about the borders of Europe, but sometimes the answers to complex issues are relatively straightforward.
Being uncontested, Europeâs geographical borders to the West, North and South are easily defined.
To the East, the geographic borders of Europe neither correspond to the cultural and historical borders nor are they identical with the existing national borders.
For the European project of the future we are therefore obliged to draw meaningful political borders â which do not have to be eternal â and, across these borders and through intensive cooperation with the neighbouring countries, to develop partnerships â something that can be summed up under the heading of âwider Europeâ.
At all events, both the fulfilment of the accession criteria and the European Unionâs ability to admit new members are decisive factors in the definition of the political borders of the European project.
It is my firm conviction that the Western Balkan states, too, deserve to be offered the prospect of membership, provided that they fulfil the accession criteria when the time comes, but it would be unrealistic at the present time to give binding deadlines or dates.
The perspective that I have just tried to outline makes an improved set of rules urgently necessary.
It is to be hoped that everybody now realises that an EU of 25 plus cannot work ideally, or perhaps not even satisfactorily, with the structures of the EU of 12.
It was, after all, with the purpose of resolving that problem that the European Convention was established, and I believe it did an impressive job of drawing up the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
It was a willingness to compromise that eventually made it possible for all governments and your Parliament, too, to reach agreement on a text which, while not doing all we would wish it to do, is or would be important and useful for the European project as a whole.
The negative outcome of the referendums held in two EU Member States has not only brought matters to a halt for the moment but has also put a huge damper on the pro-Europe mood â and moods do play an essential role in politics.
We are now in a phase of reflection, but this reflection must be made visible and audible in order to give people the opportunity to agree with or oppose the ideas presented.
My personal reflection leads me to the conviction that it would be a mistake to meekly allow the project of a Constitutional Treaty to perish and, in effect, to escort it to the cemetery.
I also realise that there are powerful arguments against starting the entire procedure all over again, and that leads me to share the view of all those who believe that once this pause for reflection has come to an end, it would be useful to refocus in a mature manner and with fresh energy on the objectives of the Constitutional Treaty, which will also contribute to strengthening the EUâs democratic parliamentarian system.
The Austrian EU Council Presidency is committed to making an effective contribution and to preparing the ground for this.
I mentioned the term âreferendumâ before.
Frankly, I am not a supporter of plebiscitary democracy and in Austria we make sparing use of referendums, and rightly so, but, if we make use, or want to make use, of referendums in EU Member States on major European decisions, I consider the current practice of holding a referendum in some Member States and not in others, thereby creating a sort of âpatchwork of referendumsâ across Europe, to be rather unsatisfactory.
I think it preferable that an EU-wide referendum be staged on specific matters of particular importance to Europe and that the system of double majority should apply.
If this idea were generally welcomed in Europe it would of course also be necessary to reach agreement on the technicalities involved, for example, on how the decision to mount an EU-wide referendum of this kind might be taken.
One topic of vital importance â and, from an Austrian standpoint, perhaps the most vital of all â that I should like to discuss is the issue of the social dimension, that is to say, the role played by the social component in European politics.
Although it is not a matter of doubt that the market economy has become generally accepted in Europe, such acceptance, when coupled with acceptance of the process of European integration, requires that that market economy should possess an adequate social component, that is to say, that it should be a social market economy that does not regard the individual as a mere cost factor and that is committed to the principle of sustainability.
The term âhuman capitaâ has always struck me as a rather dubious one.
I do not hesitate to affirm that, and I do not think that many will disagree with me when I say that it is quite simply unacceptable that 19 million people should be without jobs.
Unemployment is a millstone around Europeâs neck, diminishing its prestige, and reducing it must be a priority at both the national and the European level if we do not want to jeopardise the acceptance of the European model.
The two legs that Europe needs in order to stand upright are a sound economy and a sound social symmetry.
In this spirit I would welcome it if you were indeed to succeed tomorrow in adopting, on the issue of the Services Directive, a compromise that also takes account of the concerns and unease of employees and many businesspeople.
I also believe â and find this reflected in your Houseâs debate â that it is important to find viable answers to the question of opportunities for control and enforcement capabilities.
At the beginning of Austriaâs Presidency Salzburg hosted a large discussion on Europe entitled âSound of Europeâ, also alluding to the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with the stage occupied first by politicians, and then by the performers.
The artists, naturally, made use of their right to hold up a mirror to politicians and to point to the imperfections of politics.
Whilst I was not actually persuaded by everything that was stated in this context, it remains true that the cultural dimension of the European project contains many buried treasures and still has a lot of untold reserves.
It has been pointed out time and again that Europe is more and more able to keep pace with the United States in economic terms but that in military terms â as they say â it is a dwarf, although I find the latter less irritating that its social inequalities.
Should we not, though, give closer consideration to how we compare with them on the cultural front?
The consistency and volume of Europeâs cultural output, from the Iliad to present day works of art, represent an incredible wealth of treasures, and one in which we can count ourselves second to none.
Let us then use this wealth to reinforce our European identity, to remind ourselves of what we hold in common, and, while we are about it, let us not forget that modern art, the creativity of todayâs artists, will be the cultural heritage of generations yet to be born.
What holds true for art also applies to science and education.
Just under two weeks ago, the German Federal President, Horst KÃ¶hler, who will himself soon have the honour of speaking to you as I am doing now, welcomed seven presidents of European states to a dialogue in Dresden, which was followed by a discussion with students from over a dozen countries.
These students had prepared themselves very thoroughly for this meeting and presented us with a âDresden Manifestoâ containing very concrete demands regarding Europe.
One of these demands â and to this I ask you to pay close attention â was for an increase in expenditure on research and development of not merely three per cent of gross national product, but to five per cent of it; a very bold target indeed, but one that is well worth striving for if we are to make Europe a knowledge-based society.
The Dresden Manifesto prepared by young students from a large number of European countries also included another demand: it called for the establishment of a common house for European contemporary history that would report objectively on the history of the 20th century and on Europe today and to give a detailed account of the European project.
I am sharing â albeit briefly â the content of this manifesto with you today not only to demonstrate to these young people that their requests and concerns are taken seriously by being presented to this highest European forum but also because education and research â as you are all aware â are factors of production of very special quality.
Martin Walser once wrote that all that was needed for utopia to stop being a utopia was for it to actually exist.
The very real utopia of European peace and the utopia of a sustainable and ecologically responsible economic order need to be supplemented by a cultural utopia and an educational utopia with the elaboration of very specific goals and their implementation as a priority consideration.
Austria has held the presidency of the EU Council for exactly one and a half months now and will hand it over at the end of June to the reliable hands of Finland with whom we are cooperating excellently.
It is exactly four weeks since Federal Chancellor Wolfgang SchÃŒssel addressed the European Parliament and presented the objectives of the Austrian EU Presidency.
I do not intend to repeat what was said then but would only like to add that there have been a lot of activities and developments in these four weeks.
This relates for instance to the Balkan priority set by the Austrian Presidency, but also to the progress made with respect to the preparations for the EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit which will be held in Vienna in the middle of May 2006.
It has to be said, though, that we were particularly hard hit by the enormous tensions and the acts of violence allegedly triggered by the so-called âMohammed cartoonsâ, which seem to involve a collision between two mutually-irreconcilable positions: the fundamental principle of the freedom of the press and of expression of opinion on the one hand, and the strong need for the protection of religious sentiment and values on the other.
I regard respect for religious feelings and for what people regard as holy in the truest sense of the word, as an important factor in the coexistence of people and peoples, rather than as an intolerable restriction on a fundamental right.
If what one might term a ban on pictorial representation constitutes an integral part of a religion, then one ought not and must not offend against this principle twice â not only by disrespecting this ban, but also by reinforcing this hurtful violation of a taboo in the form of a caricature.
The inalienable freedom of art â for the inclusion of which in the Austrian constitution, let me add, I myself spoke up in the Austrian parliament âÂ is subject to legal reservations and demands consideration and respect, and the same applies in the case of the freedom enjoyed by journalists.
If billions of people are to live together in peace on one planet, then respect for the values of others and mutual consideration are not luxury items to be discarded at will.
This, I might add, holds true in all directions.
However, violence and the systematic incitement to violence and taking the law into oneâs own hands are certainly not an appropriate response.
I respect and hold in high regard those Muslims, in particular, who, in Austria and elsewhere, have made their protest in a clear but peaceful manner.
I strongly and unreservedly condemn the attitude of governments who allow diplomatic missions, embassies and innocent people to be attacked and exposed to danger.
The willingness and the honest intention to further intensify dialogue between cultures, religions, civilisations and people remains a priority in this context.
It is in those terms that I appeal to all concerned.
Let me conclude by saying that the European project, being based on the many things we have in common, will be a success.
It is for that reason that we have the right and the duty to strengthen the confidence that we will succeed in our endeavour of shaping both the âoldâ and the ânewâ Europe into the Europe of the future.
I am very grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to speak up for this before Europeâs highest parliamentary forum and to offer you Austriaâs services, and my own, in this cause.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like briefly to thank you for what you have said.
You have taken note of the advice given to you by the honourable Member. You have followed her advice and got to the point: you have dealt with the issues that are currently controversial today and you have spoken very clearly about certain guidelines that are necessary in order to carry on constructing Europe.
I am sure that the applause you have received is a good indication of the interest with which Parliament has listened to you.
I would like to thank you once again, Mr President, for being here with us and I wish you the greatest possible success in your country's Presidency.
Â Â  â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outlook for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, since the Dayton peace accord, there has been great progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the creation of a multi-ethnic democracy, and this is something that we should welcome, and in which we should rejoice.
Speaking, indeed, as an Austrian, and therefore as someone who saw this going on so to speak over his own back fence, I can say that it seems to me of the essence that we who, ten years ago, watched in horrified fascination the incredible savagery and warfare and the peopleâs suffering, can today say with some satisfaction that there is only slight likelihood of an armed conflict there.
The international community, but most of all the European Union, can chalk that up as a great success.
The beginning of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and Bosnia-Herzegovina testifies to what has been successfully achieved over the past ten years, one important example of which was evident at the end of 2005, when the and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation merged their defence ministries, transferring all defence functions and staff to a single defence ministry for the whole state, which was without doubt a milestone in the countryâs development.
The European EUFOR Mission, âAltheaâ, works closely together with these new joint structures and continues to move defence reform forwards.
There are yet more examples of how this state is moving forward in terms of its integrity and acceptance of responsibility for itself, one of which I shall mention being the introduction of VAT throughout the state with effect from 1 January this year.
One quite fundamental step forward in reform was the agreement on the reform of the police, which is now in the process of being implemented, and anyone who has observed and followed these negotiations will know how difficult they were and just how much internal resistance remained between the stateâs ethnicities.
Overcoming these obstacles is without doubt a major achievement, and one on which Bosnia and Herzegovina are very much to be congratulated.
The EUâs police mission â the EUPM â in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a major part to play in this reform process.
It was as recently as 1 January this year that its mandate was extended for another two years, after the original mandate had expired.
It is tasked with providing even more proactive support to the police in their contribution to the fight against organised crime, and that is of relevance to our own Member States in view of the fact that organised crime in our neighbourhood does, of course, have an impact on us.
EUPM, EUFOR and the High Representative/EU Special Representative cooperate closely in this area, with the aim of guaranteeing the executive authorities coordinated, consistent and effective support.
Recent months have also seen efforts being made towards the possible reform of the Dayton constitution.
Whilst this constitution is constantly criticised for being over-complicated, it should not be forgotten that â as I mentioned at the beginning â it has made it possible for peace to be established in the land, so that there is no longer a risk of hostilities breaking out.
Although the negotiations that were started last year and resumed at the beginning of this one have now been adjourned , with the leaders of the parties unable, for the present, to agree on a complete package, it has to be said that progress has been achieved, and we can expect it to bear tangible fruit in the future.
In particular, I would remind your House of the progress made as regards human rights and the reinforcement of the position of the Chairman of the Stateâs Council of Ministers, which does give cause for a certain optimism.
This reform process, which includes reform of the constitution, is a process rather than an event at a single point in time, and we must all take a realistic view of it; after all, there are many things that are difficult to do in a democracy in an election year, particularly if the desired objective is fundamental reform.
In its conclusions in January, the Council affirmed that it welcomed the discussions on constitutional reform and the progress achieved thus far.
The theme running through all these efforts, and also the role played by the international community and the European Union, is the need for the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to accept more responsibility, and one can sum that up in the word âownershipâ.
Another important issue that will occupy us in 2006 is the future of the High Representative and the presence of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That this state will continue to need international aid for the foreseeable future is not a matter of doubt, but the aim must be to replace the international communityâs âpushâ â embodied above all in the High Representativeâs all-embracing prerogatives, the so-called âBonn Powersâ, by a âpullâ exercised from Brussels.
As part of the transition from having the office of a High Representative as it is today to having an EU Special Representative, the international actorsâ prerogatives and capacities for intervention will need to be reduced in line with the concept of âownershipâ, which involves the transfer of additional powers and responsibilities to the institutions of the State.
We should be glad that this is in line with the declared objectives of the new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who took over from Lord Ashdown at the end of January, and who has said that, as High Representative, he wants to adopt more the role of a âfacilitatorâ and make the country more European, and make less use of the powers possessed by the High Representative as such, which he will have to use less and less as the reform process goes on.
We welcome, then, his statement that he intends to have recourse to his powers of intervention only under exceptional circumstances.
As with the other Balkan countries, it is the stabilisation and association process that provides the framework within which Bosnia and Herzegovina will be prepared for incorporation into the European structures.
The initiation of these negotiations, and with them of the negotiations on treaty relationships with the European Union, constitutes an important step in the Bosnia-Herzegovinaâs movement closer to the European Union.
The first round of negotiations, held on 25 January under the joint chairmanship of the Commission and the Bosnian negotiator Mr Davidovic, was completed successfully, and further progress, which it is to be hoped will be achieved soon, will of course depend on how far this reform process can be moved forward.
The President of Austria has today already referred to the Western Balkans as a priority for Austriaâs Presidency, and it is one, along with holding out to these countries the prospect of membership of the EU, because such a prospect is the driving force behind the reforms that these countries need and which we want to â and must â promote.
It is vital that such reforms should involve progress being made in the most diverse areas, that is to say in combating corruption, in reinforcing public administration, in full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia â the last being particularly important for all the countries in the region affected by it.
That same progress will be needed in many other areas where the reforms necessary in order that Bosnia, Herzegovina and all the other states in the region may become modern and democratic, are implemented.
So what is the prognosis now?
The outcome of the EU-West Balkans summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003 was that the European Union reiterated its commitment to a European perspective for all the states in the Western Balkans.
This fundamental affirmation that the future for these countries lies within the European Union was reinforced and confirmed by the June 2005 European Council.
Progress in this pre-accession stage will of course be dependent on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and of the conditions included in the stabilisation and association process.
The communication on the future pattern of relations between the EU and the states of the Western Balkans as presented by the Commission at the end of January this year and warmly welcomed by the Council, maps out the pre-accession steps over and above the Thessaloniki Agenda, and I am sure that Commissioner Rehn will give your House an extensive report on them.
It is intended that the EUâs objectives in this respect should be reaffirmed on the occasion of the forthcoming informal meeting of EU and Western Balkans foreign ministers in Salzburg on 10/11 March, when agreement should also be reached on how and by what means the EU can deepen its involvement in the region.
This meeting should provide a good opportunity to agree on practical measures to promote stability, security and prosperity in the Western Balkans through the regionâs progressive incorporation into the European structures, with the Commission communication to which I referred earlier serving as the principal basis for this.
I will conclude by saying what I have said before, namely that this is an important priority for the Austrian Presidency.
This âhigh-level eventâ with the Western Balkans as its theme will, we hope, further motivate and encourage these countries in proceeding with their reforms and with their integration into the European structures.
We take a confident view of Bosnia-Herzegovinaâs future, to which the European Union can make a considerable contribution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly welcoming the focus of Austria, as the Presidency, on the western Balkans.
I very much look forward to working together with the Presidency, the Council and Parliament to achieve the next important steps to bring the western Balkans closer to the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is genuinely at a crossroads today.
Last November the country started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union.
A new High Representative/EU Special Representative, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, has succeeded Lord Ashdown in Sarajevo.
Mr Schwarz-Schilling will make less use of the executive powers and leave more tasks in the hands of BiH politicians.
We are now in an era of increasing Bosnian ownership and responsibility.
Before I outline some recent developments and our policy goals, let me apologise in advance if I have to leave the House before the end of the debate today.
I am scheduled to leave at 4 p.m. this afternoon with President Barroso on a three-day round trip of six cities in the western Balkans, ending in Sarajevo on Saturday.
So I hope we will be finished by 4 p.m.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is making its way through the stabilisation and association process.
Last November in Sarajevo we officially opened the negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement.
The first real negotiating round took place at the end of January 2006.
It went very well and our Bosnian partners had prepared themselves thoroughly.
The Commissionâs working hypothesis is that negotiations will take about one year.
However, meeting this target date will entail Bosnia and Herzegovina being able to respond to all the EU reform requirements.
In this respect, it is essential for Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
In order to avoid any misconceptions, let me make it clear that there is no short cut: full cooperation is a necessary condition to conclude a stabilisation and association agreement and to make progress in negotiations.
It is also essential to implement the agreement on the restructuring of the police forces, to adopt and implement all necessary public broadcasting legislation and, not least, to ensure sufficient legislative and administrative capacity to implement the agreement.
We thus have a very clear message: Bosnia and Herzegovina should seize the opportunity that it has at hand.
For this, reforms need to continue with the utmost determination.
It is fair to say that the international community has played an important role in supporting the reforms in the country.
But credit is also due to the local authorities, which have been able to achieve significant progress in what, to say the least, is a rather complex environment.
We hope that progress will continue and that local political ownership will increase further.
We are ready to support this process fully.
The international community will adapt its role to these evolving circumstances of more local ownership.
The more the country is able to demonstrate maturity and political ownership, the less the international community will need to intervene.
I met recently with the new HR/EUSR, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who shares this view on a new role for the international community and the use of the Bonn powers.
The reform of the âDayton Constitutionâ is another important challenge before the Bosnian political leaders.
The country needs a constitution that ensures full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; allows effective decision-making and efficient governance; and makes the government structure less costly for ordinary citizens and taxpayers.
In other words, it is necessary for the country to develop a democratic, functional and affordable multi-ethnic state in order better to serve all its citizens and to support the reforms that EU integration entails and necessitates.
Therefore, I welcome the recent efforts by the leading political parties and political leaders to find practical and workable solutions to these very important challenges.
I encourage political leaders to continue their dialogue so as to achieve more ambitious results.
We do not expect a constitutional revolution but rather an evolution.
Constitutional evolution has to be a consensus-driven process with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly in the driverâs seat.
The international community can act as facilitator; we can offer encouragement and support; but the Bosnian politicians must take the lead.
The constitutional evolution is not as such a condition for concluding the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement.
But we need to underline that the European Union clearly has a big stake in this process.
In other words, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make sure that its constitutional provisions guarantee full and effective implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement and thus pave the way for the countryâs road towards Europe.
I look forward to engaging with the European Parliament again on a future occasion on the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, over ten years on from Dayton, it is in particular the Bosnian politicians who have to ask themselves whether they have done everything they possibly can to ensure a good future for their countryâs children, so please exercise your mandate responsibly.
That having been said, I would like to follow the President-in-Office in stressing just how considerable their achievement has been.
They now have a home affairs minister and a minister of defence; they have a single system for Value Added Tax and have â on paper at any rate â embarked on the reform of the police.
Contrary to what is widely believed by our own countrymen, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not a hotbed of criminality.
The countryâs clear-up rate for crimes is higher than would be expected in the EU, and the incidence of ordinary crime is lower there than it is in our own countries.
We have not just cooked that up; it is evident from the statistics, and it is something for which I think Bosnia-Herzegovina deserves all credit.
The new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, has intimate knowledge of Bosnia-Herzegovina and will, I am sure, be pro-active and very understanding in supporting local politicians, and will not have recourse to coercive methods, in the shape of his âBonn powersâ.
The President-in-Office spoke of acceptance of responsibility, and that will be increasingly in evidence.
I have to say, though â and I am addressing the Commissioner when I say this â that he will need support from the Commission, particularly involving it helping with the creation of jobs, setting in motion the real agriculture policy that the region has long been waiting for, and real attention on its part to the development of rural areas, for a free trade zone is of no use to the country unless it can produce its own food.
That will also entail refugees being at last permitted to return to regions such as Posavina in order to repopulate them and make the fertile soil reusable again.
The Bosnian politicians, too, must at last get started on the institutional reforms that will make ethnic division a thing of the past and build a functioning state for which accession to the EU will be a real possibility.
Their cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague is an indispensable requirement; there has indeed been progress, but I cannot imagine there being real and complete reconciliation unless KaradÅŸiÄ appears before it.
Negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement are progressing well, and in that we rejoice; a delegation from the European Parliament will be travelling to Banja Luka this summer to discuss progress with our opposite numbers there.
We wish the Council Presidency and the Commissioner every success in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Â Â  . Bosnia and Herzegovina has finally started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement and these negotiations are making successful progress.
This is a good thing. It is encouraging and deserves our total respect and admiration.
It is difficult to find a country anywhere in the world with as complicated and demanding a state structure as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina and this makes their achievements and their progress all the greater.
I am truly delighted with this and we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the efforts of the politicians and the impetus of the citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina and we salute their determination to make even more rapid progress.
Ten years after the massacre in Srebrenica and the cessation of hostilities with the signing of the Dayton Accord, it is high time that the constitution of the country was modified and that the kind of state, cantonal and local administrative structures were restored that will help rather than hinder Bosnia in the adoption and implementation of the laws and practices that we are familiar with in the European Union.
They should be building more on the rights of individuals, of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (and tomorrow citizens of the European Union), and less on affiliation to religious and ethnic groups.
In this respect Bosnia and Herzegovina can expect a demanding transition period and we all have to help the country during this time â the Commission, the Council and, at this time in particular, the incoming High Representative, who should use his own powers less while encouraging the state agencies of Bosnia to take on more responsibility and jurisdiction.
The reduction in the military presence in Bosnia and the transfer of the control of the mission from NATO to the EU is clear and convincing evidence of progress in this direction.
However, without full cooperation with the Hague tribunal we cannot move forward.
Just as Serbia and Montenegro has until the end of the month to find and extradite MladiÄ, so Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Republika Srbska to be precise, must extradite KaradÅŸiÄ â this is a prerequisite for forgiveness and reconciliation.
We must be aware that the road to the European Union will demand more than anything else improved multilateral relations and respect between all neighbours.
Christian, orthodox and islamic civilisations lived in peaceful coexistence in Bosnia and Hercegovina.
They spoke the same language and understood each other without difficulty.
Now three different languages are spoken there but they can still understand each other and there is now increased and better communication between them.
With the recent problems with the cartoons it is right and proper that we remember the painful history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Perhaps this will bring us down to earth and perhaps we will then amend the visa regime more easily and with greater urgency.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is indeed a good thing that this House is so determined and consistent in giving its attention to the problems and concerns of the Western Balkans.
That testifies to wisdom and reliability, and, as we have heard again today, the Council and the Commission are also standing by their own commitments, but â and this is something that we all, repeatedly, join in emphasising â progressive integration into Europe will depend, above all else, on progress in the individual countries themselves.
Ten years on from the Dayton Accord, there is a desperate need for change in the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the countryâs status, and so we are glad to hear that the newly-appointed High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, believes that his most important task is to make his own role redundant.
It is possible for democracy to put down roots and develop in the long term only â and Mr Winkler emphasised this today â if it is underpinned by being owned by those who live in a given place.
This has a lot to do with acceptance of oneâs own responsibility, not only for the past, but also for a shared future.
External support on the way to this goal is a good thing and may well continue to be needed for some time, and the EU must be aware of that, not least in its financial and structural decision-making.
What we do not want, though, is for constitutional changes and administrative reforms â urgently needed though they are â to be forced through by bilateral agreements entered into at haste.
The risk then is of a second Dayton, or rather of what would be a Washington Accord, under which local people would take on no responsibilities whatever.
As Bosnia-Herzegovina draws closer to Europe, its civil society, which still too often faces hostility from every side, will need to be reinforced.
There is a need for dialogue between the three ethnic groups as equals, and discrimination in access to education, employment and housing needs to be done away with.
It is the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina themselves who will need to work towards these goals, but they will need our support in doing so, and todayâs resolution is intended to help make sure that they get it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Bosnia and Herzegovina is Yugoslavia in miniature: a state that is home to different peoples, each forming a minority.
The Bosnians in the middle and North-West, the Serbs in the North and East and the Croats in the South-West all need a model of government that protects their own identities.
Moreover, the Serbs and Croats, which together form a majority of the population, need open borders with Serbia and Croatia, the neighbouring countries with which they have historical ties.
The best solution for sustainable peace and conciliation between the three nations is probably a federal structure such as that in Belgium or Switzerland.
That is why my group argues in favour of solutions from the bottom up, in which the outside world does not try to know better, but helps in the reconstruction, conciliation and transfer of knowledge of good administrative practice.
What Mr Winkler and Mr Rehn have said fills me with confidence that this viewpoint is being taken into consideration.
We feel, though, that the emphasis in the proposed resolution is too much on a different type of approach which fits in with the regrettably widespread opinion in Europe that, since the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia-Herzegovina has remained a violent and intolerant chaos for which an external solution must be found with military means and administrative interventions until such time as a strong leader appears.
That is not the solution.
We fear that in a possibly unitary state, we would see a permanent struggle for power with regard to the question which ethnic group would take control and who would assume a subordinate role.
In the past, Muslims, Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs have taken it in turn to rule over the others.
Strong national leadership leads to ethnic politics and discrimination, neither of which is desirable.
That is why my group makes its vote for the compromise resolution conditional on the approval of our two amendments in which we speak out in favour of the ability of the nations in question to decide for themselves and against continuing external military interference.
Â Â  â Mr President, the day will come when Bosnia and Herzegovina will be in the European Union.
It is hard to imagine when this might happen, but it is equally hard to imagine a Union without Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Similarly, we ought to be joined one day by such countries as Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Georgia.
These countries will be integrated easily because they are built on a foundation of Christian civilisation like the whole of the Union, something that cannot be said about Turkey.
For now, let us by all means offer Bosnia and Herzegovina a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, without any guarantee of membership.
I would propose that after Bulgaria and Romania, countries should be admitted with the agreement of EU citizens, subject to their near-100% backing.
Â Â  . â Mr President, thank you for making it possible for my intervention to be delayed until now; my apologies to the presidency of the Council, and to the Commissioner, but I have come straight from a meeting of the Conference of Presidents with the President of Austria.
The situation in south-eastern Europe is a precarious one: negotiations have begun with Croatia; Macedonia is a candidate, although negotiations have not yet started, and Kosovo remains a problem.
That being so, it is indeed important that we should not close our eyes to the problems that remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or forget that they are there.
If we are to solve these problems, we can only do so together, and âtogetherâ means the ethnic groups, the people, the political authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international community, represented in particular by the European Union.
As has already been said several times over, the existing constitutional â or rather institutional â framework is not up to the job.
Not only is it not up to the job of getting Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union, but it is also not up to the job of solving the present problems in the country itself, for spending some 50% of the countryâs money on maintaining its institutions cannot be described as making any real contribution to its political and economic development.
Simply changing the institutional framework, though, is no use at all, of course.
We must also, and particularly, insist on cooperation with the International Criminal Court reaching its ultimate goal, which is that those who are responsible for war crimes or are suspected of committing them should end up being put on trial.
People cannot think about other important current problems until that is done.
One pressing problem is, of course, the overall state of the countryâs economic development, with its lack of jobs and of investment, one of the consequences of which is that many young and educated people leave, so that its future elite, its future leaders, irrespective of their ethnic origin, are not there.
This makes it an absolute necessity that this cooperation by all the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and involving the international community, should result in a new constitution and in institutional reform, so that ethnicity should be replaced as a criterion by the personal qualities and professional expertise of the persons who are to be elected to shoulder political responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in order to understand why the situation in Bosnia is so complicated today and why we need constitutional reform in Bosnia, we must understand the background.
Everyone who experienced the war in Bosnia or who followed the events in the Balkans during the Nineties knows that the Dayton Agreement had one task, namely that of bringing the war to an end.
It was incredibly important immediately to terminate the conflicts and prevent the country from being forced to experience another winter of war.
Moreover, no one believed that the solution offered by the Dayton Agreement was perfect.
On the contrary, there were many who believed that it was not good at all.
The Dayton Agreement should probably be regarded more as a result of international efforts than as a desired compromise between Bosniaâs various political leaders.
Since then, the peace agreement has, it is true, led to Bosnia retaining its territorial integrity.
At the same time, however, AnnexÂ 4 to the agreement stated that the country should consist of two parts: a federation between Bosnians and Croats, and a Serbian part called Republica Srpska.
Ten years later, we note that the consequences of the Dayton Agreement are such that it is difficult for Bosnia to operate as a normal European country.
There is therefore no point in our even talking about the hundreds of ministers or the cumbersome state apparatus.
In my opinion, the main problem is that the Dayton Agreement has led to a situation in which ethnic interests, rather than those of the individual citizens, take priority.
In that way, the Dayton Agreement has concluded the work begun by the nationalist parties during the first post-Communist election in 1990.
These parties still wield more or less absolute political power and share a more or less pronounced ambition to rule over a certain territory populated by a particular ethnic group. Therein lies the difficulty of agreeing on an economic or political future for all citizens.
Therein too lies the difficulty of agreeing on a president or on systems of education or customs duties. The ethnic dimension has become, and remains, more important than the civic dimension.
I was born, and grew up, in Bosnia and I experienced the war in that country.
I am absolutely convinced that, just as when the Dayton Agreement was concluded, Bosnia must receive the practical help it needs from the international community.
This excellent resolution may be the first step in the EUâs strong commitment to this work.
Â Â  I believe that Bosnia is currently at a very sensitive point, which could be described as a transition from a period when its main aspiration was peace to a period when its main aspiration is development.
Since this is clearly understood in the wording of the resolution as the two opening speakers most eloquently told us, I lend my support to the wording of the resolution.
I would however like to point out that in my opinion the strengthening of central authority in Bosnia is crucially important to its future.
I personally do not believe that Bosnia can become a developed and secure state in the future if the decision-making processes in that country are not simplified.
These highly complex decision-making processes have been and still are to a large extent geared to preserving peace and to fostering cooperation between the three national communities.
But if Bosnia wants to make genuine progress, its political decision-making must be simplified root and branch and must be made more transparent and, of course, more democratic, with greater power for the central authorities and a reduced presence on the part of the representatives of the international community.
I believe that all of this is required if the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are to feel more self-confident, more than you may feel today on the streets of their country if you visit it.
Â Â  Mr President, I strongly welcome the trip by President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn as a visible demonstration of our commitment to the western Balkansâ EU future.
Let us hope that Mr KaradÅŸiÄ and Mr MladiÄ will be found while they are there.
Bosniaâs constitutional reform is vital, not as an interesting intellectual exercise, but in order that the state can put in place efficiently the regulations and policies necessary for economic success, including EU trade opportunities.
I strongly support the recent Commission Green Paper.
I particularly hoped for visa facilitation to come before too long, as a practical demonstration of the freedom that Europe means for Bosnians, alongside the hard work it entails.
I hope you will not find me too partisan if I say that, while Lord Ashdownâs tenure has not been without controversy, he has demonstrated enormous dedication to the cause of Bosniaâs European future, helping it on the road from Dayton to Brussels.
The door is open, and we want Bosnia to come through.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to reiterate, for the Houseâs benefit, the reasons why my group initiated this debate.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has at last embarked on the task of amending its constitution, because that is necessary in order that it might draw nearer to the European Union.
In January of this year, there was a very serious situation when, this very stage having been reached, an American think-tank tried to push this change through suddenly without European involvement.
This was at a time when Paddy Ashdownâs mandate had already ended and MrÂ Schwarz-Schillingâs had not yet begun.
That sort of thing must not happen again.
I am optimistic that MrÂ Schwarz-Schilling, as High Representative, will have the interests of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina at heart and will take their own responsibility seriously in ensuring that our political objective has a chance of being achieved.
By that I mean that, ten years on from Dayton, ten years on from the European Unionâs military intervention, he will see to it that ethnic division is brought to an end and Bosnia and Herzegovina are enabled to face the future together.
Â Â  â Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina is deeply divided along ethnic and religious lines, and long-term peacemaking there is dependent on these realities â which the elections, for example, strongly reflect â not being ignored, but rather respected and integrated towards the reasonable purpose set out in the Austrian Presidentâs speech.
We cannot do other than rejoice at the end of Lord Ashdownâs liberal dictatorship, which marginalised religious leaders among others, and look forward to Mr Schwarz-Schilling taking a more sensitive approach to arranging the countryâs affairs.
There are two main issues with which we in this House will have to get to grips.
The first, to which reference has already been made, is the process of reshaping the constitution.
The country is at present an unequal federation, and unworkable in the long term, with the Bosnian/Croat Federation dominated by the Bosnians, the Serbs and their , and the Croats of Herzegovina, who keep themselves to themselves, but the ones who really are marginalised are those Bosnian Croats who can scarcely find a place for themselves in this scheme of things.
That is why this structure will not work, even with the excessively bureaucratic addition of cantons.
What is urgently needed is for the reform of the constitution to bring about a symmetrical federation of all three ethnic groups, and it must at the same time prune the cantons and the bureaucratic superstructures that make it impossible for the country to be run efficiently.
The second significant aspect is one that I have already mentioned, namely the faith communities and the absolutely fundamental part that they play in the country.
A lot has been said here about Islam.
When Bosnia became Austrian, the Austrians set up a public body for Muslims, and it is worth noting that it still exists in Austria today, making Austria the only EU country in which there is a representative organisation for Muslims that Muslims themselves accept as such.
That is all tied up with Bosnia.
There is also the Reis-ul-Ulema in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, which, along with other institutions, is important as a manifestation of a European Islam, and the Christian faith communities in this country, represented by such outstanding personalities as Bishop Komarica, should also be actively involved in the peace process and accepted as legal entities.
Â Â  â If Europe's most complicated ethnic and political knots are to be found in the Balkans, then the most intricately entangled one is in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In no other part of Europe are there so many fresh graves, so many parks and stadiums which are now cemeteries.
That is why this resolution, which I wholeheartedly support, is so necessary and relevant.
A year ago I became convinced myself that the prospect of European Union membership is making this ill-fated country calmer and better.
This is a path, which Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must follow even more resolutely, to return to peaceful co-existence under new conditions and to consolidate this institutionally.
EU support along this path has been and will continue to be particularly significant.
Twenty years ago the inhabitants of this country were able to travel freely to both the East and the West.
Now the citizens of small Bosnia and Herzegovina are fenced in by visa barriers.
These must be torn down by both Sarajevo and Brussels.
In particular, I would urge the Commission to make sure that young people are able to study at universities in EU countries, to become acquainted with Europe, its experience in reconciling nations, which were once deadly enemies, and the multi-faceted nature of European culture.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to object to Mr Posseltâs description of LordÂ Ashdownâs delegation as a liberal dictatorship.
Whilst Lord Ashdownâs leadership was certainly energetic, I take exception to both the noun âdictatorshipâ and the adjective âliberalâ.
I would now like to turn to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been a guinea pig for 15 years, and this is something of which the Bosnian, Croat and Serbian nations have been well aware.
First, it was the guinea pig of a Communist state that was breaking up.
Then it became a guinea pig for an EU which at the time, more than ten years ago, did not have real foreign or security policy.
It was also a guinea pig for a NATO in search of a new mission and sadly also one for all those who feed off violence and war.
In recent years, it has been a modern protectorate.
I hope that both the EU and the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina will seize the prospect of a stability and association agreement to turn their country into a grown-up state, on the road to EU membership.
Â Â  Mr President, the 10 years that have passed since the Dayton peace accords were signed have brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina but have not resolved major political and social problems.
A complex institutional structure means that the political decision-making process is not transparent, while expenditure on administration at all levels is a considerable burden on public finance.
Positive factors, such as relatively good economic growth and reforms in police, defence and taxation matters, should not obscure the fact that without fundamental constitutional reforms, it is difficult to be positive about the future for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The European Union bears a special responsibility in this regard.
The negotiation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement that began in January is an effective step in the right direction, since the prospect of integration with European structures will reinforce the move towards essential political, institutional and economic reform.
I am quite certain of this.
At this point I would like to say that I am strongly in favour of progress in the negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement not being made conditional on progress in the constitutional reform process.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are counting on a better future with close relations with the European Union.
We cannot allow this prospect to be threatened by internal political or ethnic strife.
I would like to thank the initiators of this debate and the authors of this motion which needs no amendment.
I have in mind AmendmentÂ 2 in particular.
I would also like to wish the Austrian Presidency every success in resolving the complex problems of the Balkans.
That would benefit Europe as whole, not only the countries concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, the civil war in Spain ended in 1939.
Today, more than sixty years later, the wounds of that civil war are still healing in certain towns and corners of Spain, a war which, from an ethnic point of view, cannot be compared to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and was very much easier to explain.
I say this so that some people may have a slightly better understanding of the enormous difficulties involved in true reconciliation, the reconciliation that is needed between people, between families, in the streets and towns, particularly given that the peace is purely military, or at the beginning was a purely military peace, an enforced peace.
The Bosnia process is therefore exemplary.
It is absolutely exemplary given that in such a short space of time we should have a country in peace and with a project for the future, one that is unstable, but a project nonetheless.
But it is clear that Dayton cannot be the definitive solution and we must therefore clearly support the constitutional transformation in order to resolve all of the loose ends that Dayton left outstanding, which may have made sense at the time as a temporary solution, but which clearly do not contribute to creating a common political project.
That is what we must support: the creation of a genuine common political project amongst everybody which must include â and in this regard I agree with something that was said a moment ago â young people, and the young people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their relations with Europe, and we must therefore make the flow of students between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union very much easier.
Â Â  I would like to begin by welcoming the clear ambition shown by Austria as regards the western Balkans, an area which remains crucially important for our collective security and for foreign and defence policy within Europe itself.
Likewise I welcome the progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina towards a European perspective.
As we followed the tragic events in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the years we longed to see more of Europe.
Now we have more of Europe there in a political and military sense.
Ten years after Dayton we now also want to see more of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The European Union has offered Bosnia and Herzegovina the credible prospect of full membership and real progress but this is increasingly dependent on political will and the quality of decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself.
Tragic experience has shown that progress cannot be guaranteed if any of the constituent elements of Bosnia and Herzegovina are excluded or disempowered, but can only take place on the basis of respect for the dignity of all identities and all entities.
Progress will be all the more rapid if European standards of respect for diversity and a readiness to find common denominators are enforced at the earliest possible opportunity.
Without doubt one of these is the new constitutional arrangement as the Dayton Accord seems to have run its course.
I expect future states holding the Presidency to continue to give their utmost attention to the countries of the western Balkans. ().
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to you for this debate and for what has been said in it.
I find myself unable to disagree with any of the interventions that have been made; the opinions you have expressed show that the Council and the Commission are on the right track, and we appreciate your support.
I can do no other than agree with what Baroness Ludford had to say.
When we today criticise the structures set up by Dayton, we should not forget that Dayton was the starting point for peace, and for that we must be grateful, that we must acknowledge â even if, of course, we must now admit that those structures are not ideal.
Almost everyone who has spoken has referred to one of Bosnia-Herzegovinaâs current problems being its bureaucratic superstructures, but, while there is no doubt about that being so, let us not forget what motivated their creation.
They were put in place in response to the mistrust that had prevailed between ethnic groups, which did not trust each other and wanted â and had â to keep tabs on what the other was up to.
Further to what the honourable gentleman from Spain said about his own countryâs civil war, the same was true in this case: we must not forget that these ethnic groups had done terrible things to each other.
To the degree to which we are able to reduce this mistrust and promote the mutual understanding to which Mr Peterle referred, we will succeed in changing structures, for I do not believe that it would be right to attempt to do that from the top downwards while such mutual trust is absent.
We in the European Union must ensure that this mistrust is diminished and we must do what we can to help that happen.
We must do something practical to help European values prevail in this country, and I do of course endorse what has been said about its young people.
We must do something to support them, such as making it easier for them to travel abroad, and part of the package that the European Union will put together for them will of course consist in making it easier to obtain visas.
Many thanks, again, for your interventions.
Together with the Commission, the Council will continue to work for the realisation of all the things that have, today, been set out as goals.
Â Â  . Mr President, I note the broad agreement in this debate on the need for increased ownership for Bosnian politicians and a new role for the international community.
I would also like to thank you for this excellent debate, which shows the commitment of the European Parliament and the Presidency to our common policy in the western Balkans and its European perspective.
We should all be satisfied with the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement, which has got off to a very good start with Bosnia and Herzegovina, although we have to recognise that there are still many challenges for the country to tackle.
It is about implementation, implementation, implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Moreover, we all agree that Dayton put an end to the war, but it is certainly a less suitable framework for a properly functioning state and therefore we have to see ourselves as partners in the constitutional evolution in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Many of you have stressed the need for economic development and I fully share that view.
That is why we put forward several proposals in the Salzburg Communication concerning economic development, trade and investment.
In our pre-accession assistance we are already moving from reconstruction to economic development.
In the communication we are proposing the setting-up of a regional free trade agreement to replace the current 31Â bilateral free trade agreements, in order to encourage trade and investment and thus production and job creation in the area.
Finally, I fully agree with those who underlined the need to work towards European accession in the present or next generation, which is why the Salzburg Communication includes proposals concerning visa facilitation and scholarship schemes.
To show my personal commitment and that of the Commission and President Barroso, this week I shall be flying to Zagreb and later to Sarajevo.
Â Â  â I have received six motions for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Belarus in the run-up to the presidential elections on 19 March.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will come as no surprise to you that I should say that the Council is gravely concerned about the adverse developments in Belarus, particularly as regards the elections that are scheduled for 19 March.
The Council has recently again had cause to consider the issue of Belarus, and we noted with concern that President Lukashenkoâs regime is acting in an ever more repressive manner, becoming more and more isolated, not least of its own volition.
We did of course note with satisfaction its invitation to the OSCE and ODIHR to observe the elections, which is without doubt a positive step, and one that we certainly welcome, but we are still concerned about the worsening situation in Belarus, and have justifiable cause for concern as to whether these elections will be conducted in a democratic manner.
The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council last discussed Belarus on 30 January, and the ministers agreed on new conclusions, which carry the clear message that the OSCEâs ability to perform its electoral observation mission everywhere and without hindrance must be ensured.
The Council also warned of the possibility of further restrictive measures being taken against persons in positions of responsibility if the presidential election did not meet accepted international standards.
The European Unionâs policy towards Belarus was last reviewed in the conclusions of the Council on 7Â November last year, which struck a balance between commitment to the people and to civil society on the one hand and, on the other, a tougher line in respect of the regime itself.
They also referred to the intention of the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, to appoint a close collaborator as his point of contact for Belarus.
We are all aware of the need to take a longer view of our work with Belarus.
There is nothing bold about predicting that the elections on 19 March will bring no real change in their wake, or working on that assumption.
Considerable efforts have been made to get our message across in the run-up to the elections and to ensure that it is heard clearly.
It was in fact planned that there should be, at the beginning of February a high-level joint dÃ©marche involving representatives of the European Union and of the United States, namely the Councilâs Director-General for external relations and political-military affairs, Robert Cooper, and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, Dan Fried, but the authorities in Belarus refused to issue these two dignitaries with the visas that would enable them to visit the country both at the same time, and that has made such a dÃ©marche impossible.
In making it clear that the authorities in Belarus have failed to seize an opportunity for frank and free dialogue with the international community, we have not concealed our disappointment at this turn of events.
Still on this subject, I would also like to mention that, on 30Â January, the day of the last Council meeting, Alexander Milinkevich, the united opposition candidate in Belarus, who was visiting Brussels, had an informal meeting with representatives of the Member States, among them very many ministers, with over half the Member States represented at ministerial level.
He also met with Mr Solana, with Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
There is no doubt about the fact that this was a clear and unambiguous expression of the European Unionâs support for the democratic process in Belarus, even though the EU cannot, of course, endorse individual candidates.
Whatever criticism Belarus deserves â and must indeed get some from us â I would like to stress that the policy of the European Union is not aimed at isolating that country.
What we would like to see is a democratic, stable and economically successful Belarus â and it is our intention that it should be all those things, not least a country that is capable of becoming a member of the Council of Europe and that maintains proper, good and strong relations with the international community in general and with the European Union in particular.
It is for this reason that we have made it clear that, given sustained development in the right direction, Belarus could of course benefit from the European Neighbourhood Policy.
We want to make clear our willingness to reach out to the people of Belarus and to help that country to become integrated into European structures.
Although we wish to maintain normal and friendly relations with it, that is not possible under present circumstances.
The Council will not turn a blind eye to the continuing violations of human rights and civil liberties, and it will continue to give voice to its concerns about the deteriorating conditions in Belarus.
With the promotion of democracy in Belarus in mind, the Council is still willing to make a serious commitment to it and to cooperation with international partners; at the meeting with MrÂ Milinkevich that I mentioned earlier, we discussed the ways in which we might help the civil society there in its campaign for democracy, and what options are open to us as regards exerting direct influence on those elements in Belarus that are campaigning for democracy.
Even though the election result is probably a foregone conclusion, we must make a joint effort to maintain the European Unionâs presence and influence in Belarus.
As I have already said, the project to which the European Union is committed is a long-term one, and the present difficulties must not be allowed to discourage us or cause us to lose sight of our objective.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss Belarus.
She has been intensely engaged in developing the Commissionâs activities on Belarus since we took office and I am convinced she will not miss the opportunity to discuss Belarus with the Russian Foreign Minister at their meeting that is being held in Vienna today.
On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus in the run-up to the 19Â March presidential election and on the Commissionâs work to support democratisation and to support civil society.
Let me start by saying a few words on the overall situation in Belarus.
The Commission is still deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus.
This situation has further deteriorated as the election date is nearing and has resulted in a severe quashing of the voice of the opposition and the stifling of the independent press over the last few months.
The fact that an OSCE mission has been invited to observe the presidential election and that a number of contenders to President Lukashenko are likely to be allowed to contest the presidential race is a welcome move, but not sufficient evidence of a functioning democracy.
At this juncture, when the OSCE observers have started their work on the ground, it is important that the European Union and the Commission contribute to the smooth functioning of the mission.
The European Unionâs opinion and reaction will be based on this missionâs report.
In terms of the European Unionâs response, you are well aware of the unequivocal message that the European Union conveyed to Belarus and reiterated in the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 30Â January: the European Union has stressed the importance it attaches to a democratic election process and has also clearly voiced its resolve to issue targeted sanctions in the event that these elections prove to be fraudulent.
To balance this message with a positive note, the European Union has repeated its offer to have closer relations with Belarus, provided that we see convincing progress towards democracy.
Let me now turn to the Commissionâs specific action and underline that the Commission has made good on its pledge to raise its role in Belarus.
Faced with growing repression and restrictions by the Government of Belarus on foreign assistance to non-governmental bodies, the Commission has stepped up and speeded up such assistance to Belarus.
In 2005 alone, up to EURÂ 8.9Â million have been dedicated to democracy and civil society projects.
Creative tools have been developed to overcome the hurdles to assistance delivery.
We have thus shifted part of our support to NGOs located outside Belarus.
The EURÂ 2.2Â million we granted last December to the European Humanitarian University in exile, as well as our support to independent media, are vibrant examples of this novel approach.
In the field of independent media, I am delighted to say that the Commission has been at the forefront of donorsâ action.
We have started with support to the radio broadcasting of daily news reports to Belarus in both Russian and Belarusian.
However, our main achievement is a EURÂ 2Â million media project which is now being launched.
It includes radio and television broadcasting, internet activities, support to the Belarusian independent press, and the training of Belarusian journalists.
The project will allow the broadcasting of specific TV and radio programmes as from February, well ahead of the elections.
We believe this high-quality project, which is supported by a Europe-wide team and sharply factors in Belarusian sensitivities â that is, no propaganda, straight news and sheer entertainment â will rightly reach out to large segments of the population.
In addition, the Commission has decided to open a delegation in Minsk but unfortunately the Belarusian authorities have not yet given their agreement.
Pending progress on this front, we will post a chargÃ© dâaffaires to Kiev who will travel frequently to Minsk.
Finally, last Monday the Commission brought together all international donors to Belarus in order to plan ahead.
This meeting has set in motion a common reflection on assistance beyond the election date. This meeting was a signal that assistance and coordination will not dwindle after the election date.
In conclusion, let me emphasise that the democratic process in Belarus is likely to be a long process that will eventually succeed only with the support of the population.
This is why we must continue our efforts to raise awareness among the Belarusian population at large through support to civil society and facilitation of contacts between the people.
As Belarus stands at the crossroads, it is more crucial than ever that we all pool our efforts to implement a common strategy and be ready to react to developments in Belarus as they take place.
The Commission remains committed to doing its part.
Â Â  . â Mr President, 19Â March marks the Belarus presidential election, in which there is still a chance that the country will assume its rightful place in the European family of democracies and conduct a free and fair election.
However, in reality, the chances are very small, as President Lukashenko, since his election in 1994, has turned his country into a self-isolated police state and a sham democracy.
The already poor human rights situation has deteriorated further since the passing of the anti-revolutionary law, aimed at suppressing protests, and many opposition leaders are jailed on spurious offences of corruption or, in some cases, simply made to disappear, presumably murdered.
Mr Lukashenko preaches a curious pan-Slavic, anti-Western nationalism, with an added cult of personality.
Independent polls give him around 55% support.
It is believed that he will do whatever is necessary to achieve the magic figure of 77%.
Registration for candidates is due by 21Â February, and I salute the courage of the United Opposition candidate, Alexander Milinkevich, who will be restricted in his campaign to two 30-minute TV and radio interviews, whereas Mr Lukashenko will spend what he likes and appear as Head of State on the media daily, accusing his opponents of being thugs or Western mercenaries.
I call on Belarus to allow for the right for independent exit polls to be conducted to help verify the results, but this request is unlikely to be heeded.
Not surprisingly, this Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections, but the Conference of Presidents should authorise a budget for MEPs to attend via the OSCE.
Russia also needs to be reminded that, as it bankrolls the regime with very cheap gas at USDÂ 50 per 1Â 000Â m3, it should support democracy there, being a full member of the Council of Europe.
Lastly, I welcome, as Commissioner Borg mentioned, the TACIS EURÂ 2Â million dedicated to free broadcasting in Belarus and supporting civil society.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 16 December last year, the parliament in Minsk â which is not a democratically elected body â agreed to Lukashenkoâs proposal that the presidential elections be brought forward to 19 March.
This is an illustration of the wholly high-handed way in which Mr Lukashenko operates, and also a demonstration of the absence of any intention on his part to hand over power by way of the election process.
That is why we once again have to fear an extremely fraudulent course of the democratic process in Belarus.
The opposition bears the brunt of the decision.
How can it launch a campaign if its candidates end up in gaol, like the Social Democrat Mr Statkevich, and if all mass media are controlled by the regime?
The authorities are trying their level best to make life for the opposition as difficult as possible and they also have more than halved the election campaign period.
We must continue to draw attention to these blatant violations of our democratic values in one of the EUâs neighbouring countries.
Whilst we must underline once again that Lukashenkoâs policy is unacceptable, we must also emphasise once more that in the event of a change in direction, the road to a closer relationship with the EU is open.
What more can we do?
It is regrettable that the relationship between Lukashenko and the European Parliament has deteriorated to the extent that we have not â unlike the OSCE â been invited to take part in the observation mission.
Whilst that is, on the one hand, a good sign, in that it is the consequence of our consistently critical stance towards the regime in Belarus, we must also, on the other, ask ourselves why the European Parliament could not simply take part in the OSCE mission as the EUâs official representation.
We are pleased with the invitation to the OSCE, but we also want to stress that more than lip service is needed in respect of the international standards to which Belarus, as a member of the OSCE, has committed itself.
We therefore hope that the OSCE mission can go about their normal business and urge the Belarusian Government to lend them a hand.
Finally, despite the deteriorated circumstances â four years ago, I took part in the observation and I think the situation now is even worse than it was then â we must make every effort, and above all, not refrain from doing anything, to support the opposition which managed to put forward a joint candidate this time round.
I hope that Parliament, with todayâs statement, will in any event give the opposition and candidate Alexander Milinkevich a moral boost.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I agree with what previous speakers have said.
Hope that the presidential elections will lead to a new beginning and eventually to democracy is ebbing by the day, and, every day, President Lukashenko devises new ways of oppressing the opposition and those among his countryâs people who claim the right to think differently.
That is why there needs to be more aid from outside the country.
Nor must we allow ourselves to be discouraged by the way in which democratic involvement there is being nipped in the bud, for the people want freedom, and we know how difficult it is to be committed to that when elections â such as this one â are being interfered with, so we must not lose sight of the fact that this election day does not mark some sort of deadline â on the contrary, we are dealing here with an ongoing process.
We should keep a careful eye on what the people of Belarus do in a small way to express their desire for freedom and democracy.
It is because there is real potential for serious democracy there that I would also point out that what the Commission and the Council are doing to build up that potential is quite utterly inadequate â it is too slow, too inflexible, it is ineffective!
I would ask the Council to really get down to doing the task it has been given and adapt the rules on external aid to this special situation, and do so as soon as possible, to stop simply talking and put effective means in place, or else we will bear the blame for this problematic situation.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the delegation to Belarus on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I do not agree with the draft resolution, and I shall explain why.
One might be forgiven for thinking, from the debate in Parliament, that the opposition candidate could win the election in Belarus, but we know that Lukashenko will continue in office.
What will happen next?
What sort of relations will we have with Belarus?
We must remember that Belarus is not just Lukashenko and the people in positions of privilege, but a nation that has not had an entirely negative experience with the regime, as it undeniably enjoys certain social benefits, for example free education and health care.
We are well aware of how close relations are between Belarus and Moscow, and the importance of the development of this small country for its large neighbour.
It is no secret that both countries are preparing to draw closer than they have been before.
The European Unionâs strategy towards Belarus is therefore, in the final analysis, also a strategy towards Russia.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as usual, I only have a few words in which to express my disagreement with what the Council and the Commission have just said.
I find it rather facile, as in other cases, to reproach a sovereign country for not conforming in every way to the models we have prescribed in order to recognise one government or another, in reality according to whether or not it suits us for any other reason.
After the fall of the Soviet Empire, Belarus was left to the mercy of certain gangs of predators which were no more legitimate because they served the interest of some multinational or other, to the point that we saw ministers selling off public assets piecemeal for their own benefit, and often to European companies.
That was known as liberalisation.
We all saw Belarus being exploited by certain Western powers, which are only too pleased to turn it, and with it the resources that it offers, against its great sister nation, Russia.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not be fooled by rather facile propaganda.
If we are being asked today to condemn the Minsk authorities, it is not for the good of the Belarusian people, but simply so that we can blindly act as an accomplice in a United States strategy aimed at restricting Russian power as much as possible, by depriving it of its most natural historical and geographical alliances.
That is playing God, as we saw a year ago in Ukraine, and it does not benefit Europe, the real Europe, which must include Russia and all of its allies within its sphere, and it will do so sooner or later.
Â Â  . Mr President, Belarus represents a major challenge for the European Union, since the pressure we have brought to bear on it so far has been ineffective.
We must now take action in support of democracy in Belarus. This will call for a number of organisational measures.
Our monitoring of human rights in Belarus should be based on Parliamentâs annual Report on Human Rights in the World and on information provided by the special Commission and Council representative for Belarusian affairs.
Parliamentary resolutions should be reserved for new and critical situations.
Our actions should be based on the Neighbourhood Policy instrument, or on a separate human rights instrument where the political and legal environment is hostile.
In particular, EU commitments to finance independent media must be developed, in conjunction with reliable partners.
The latest Commission competition has raised the doubts that are set out in the most recent question to the Commission tabled today.
Â Â  â Mr President, Belarus is a special country, the last dictatorship in Europe.
It is an impoverished country.
It is also impoverished in the sense that never in its history has it experienced freedom, unlike many, if not all, of its neighbours.
How can it now aspire to a freedom it has never known?
It does not know to what it should aspire.
Belarusians do not ask for much and they are very patient.
If the elections on 19 March turn out to be rigged, the people will wait until they can have free elections at some future date.
Nonetheless, we should spare no effort right now to ensure that the elections on 19 March are free.
It is not good for one person to be in power for a long time.
Let Belarus choose freely between its incumbent president and Alexander Milinkevich.
Â Â  In Slovakia, for forty years after what became known as the Victorious February of 1948, we experienced a regime similar to the current one in Belarus.
The state machinery controlled by the communist party not only suppressed every manifestation of resistance, but also all expressions and signs of a free democratic society and the rule of law.
People who have not experienced dictatorship can only with difficulty imagine its consequences.
We note with concern that the Belarus authorities are stepping up repressive measures against civil society.
Violent dismantling of the independent press and non-governmental organisations continues.
On 6 February 2006, the Supreme Court of Belarus moved to disband yet another non-governmental organisation, the Belarus Union of Youth and Childrenâs Associations.
It is appropriate that the European Union is bringing increased pressure to bear on Belarus.
I am thankful for the fact that we did not confine ourselves to expressions of concern over the crackdown on the independent media, non-governmental and religious organisations, and some educational institutions in that country.
IÂ welcome, in particular, the Commissionâs decision to sponsor independent radio broadcasting to Belarus.
The radio station also deserves our praise IÂ hope that the original decision to broadcast in the Russian language has been changed and that the people of Belarus are tuning in to listen to their mother tongue, which is particularly important in these days leading up to the elections.
According to my contacts with representatives of Belarus democratic forces, broadcasts in the Russian language might have a negative effect.
Now, before the elections, the objective of European institutions should be to take joint action towards the achievement of concrete democratic changes in that country.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
I think that, in spite of being a day too late, the European Parliament wants to send a message today, stating its affection for the people of Belarus.
It is a message addressed to a people who, as the facts make clear, is being denied the freedom to choose its leaders.
So far, it is of elections that we have spoken in this House.
I think that, for the sake of correctness, we have, rather, to refer to the forthcoming event as a vicious process of confirmation.
It should be noted that, during the last few months, the European Union has made huge progress in taking practical steps to benefit the people of Belarus.
On behalf of the Bureau of the Delegation for Relations with Belarus, I would thank the Council and the Commission, but there is more still to be done.
We now have to show strong support for the people of Belarus, especially its young people.
The authorities who want to curtail freedom know that young people are the main protagonists of change.
The authorities have even closed down RADA, which represents youngsters from Belarus in the European Youth Forum.
This is a most deplorable act.
We again extend our support to the people, and in particular the young people, of Belarus, and we promise to be with them at their moment of trial.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are surely not very many people who believe that the presidential elections in Belarus on 19Â March will live up to even the most elementary democratic ground rules.
We have every reason to expect the opposite to be the case.
President Lukashenko will do everything to defend his position and consolidate his dictatorship.
The opposition has been deprived of equal opportunities to send out its political messages, and the election campaign by the candidate for the united opposition, MrÂ Milinkevich, is shaping up to be a very difficult one.
We must do everything to support the democratic forces in Belarus in the run-up to the election.
I want, however, to make a special plea for Belarus not to be forgotten after the election.
I agree with MrÂ Winkler that long-term efforts will be required in order to bring about democracy in Belarus, and we must persist with those efforts after the election.
I would thank Commissioner Borg for his undertaking to pursue just such a strategy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I belong to that section of my group that believes that the group should have signed the joint motion for a resolution.
I regret that it did not do so.
The situation in Belarus is becoming worse and worse.
The conditions for a democratic election are unfortunately very poor.
The opposition â both the political opposition and the free trade union movement â is systematically persecuted.
Critical, independent media have very little room for manoeuvre.
In this situation, we must do everything we can to support the forces of democracy and make efforts to bring about both a fair election and extensive election monitoring.
There is only one way of showing solidarity with Belarus, and that is to demand that the Belorussians themselves be allowed to decide their own future.
For that to happen, democracy is required.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, a free flow of information from Europe is vital in supporting democracy in Belarus.
I would like to emphasise that, firstly, the resources we have allocated to radio broadcasts to Belarus have to date not had the desired effect.
The decision by the European Commission to award a EURÂ 2 million contract to the German/Russian consortium for broadcasting to Belarus, knowing that the Russian television station already has generous contracts with the Belarus Government, and also that broadcasts take place in Russian, is in my opinion an unacceptable waste of money.
At the end of the day it may provide support to the Lukashenko regime.
Secondly, the European Union must support the democratic press of Belarus.
Thirdly, we should consider making it easier for ordinary Belarus citizens, scientists and cultural workers to obtain European Union visas, while at the same time boosting the restrictions on visas for representatives of the ruling regime and their families.
Finally, I would also like to urge the European Commission and the Council to call more insistently for the immediate release of Mikhail Marinich, the opposition leader being detained on political grounds.
Â Â  â The situation in Belarus, with just over a month remaining until the elections, leaves little hope that the Presidential Elections in this country will be democratic, free or fair.
As yet, not one single candidate is registered officially, and only one future candidate (the current President Alexander Lukashenko) is the subject of an intense propaganda campaign, which is being carried out by the entire state media.
Press analysis shows that an opinion is being formed nationwide that there is no alternative to the current President, and that an absolute majority of citizens will vote for him because only Alexander Lukashenko can guarantee stability in a country whose achievements are unquestionable.
Apparently, the President's opponents are useless scoundrels, while the West does not understand the situation in Belarus and seeks to destabilise the country, but will be unable to do so because Belarus has President Lukashenko.
Repression of the non-state media continues to intensify.
Within this context European Union support is a vital necessity, but it is insufficient, late and therefore has little effect.
Is this really all the European Union can do to defend freedom of thought and the press in a neighbouring country?!
Â Â  Mr President, on 19Â March the presidential election will take place in Belarus.
We all agree that it is about time to support the activities of the democratic force in Belarus.
It should be our top priority to facilitate a free and democratic ballot.
Full transparency of every process involved in this election, including the counting of votes and equal conditions for all candidates, must be secured.
The policies of Lukashenko have raised far too many serious concerns.
The presence of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe during the presidential election is of the highest importance.
We should insist on the Belarus authorities extending an invitation to both institutions as soon as possible.
The situation of citizens of Belarus concerning the independence of the media and freedom of expression is gradually getting worse, which is why we strongly support the establishment of radio network broadcasting from Poland, Lithuania and possibly Ukraine.
Furthermore, the actions taken by the Government of Belarus against the Union of Poles in Belarus and the Roma minority, as well as the decision to ban the reformed evangelical church, are examples of the lack of respect for minority rights, as well as freedom of association and belief.
Â Â  â Besides bad news from Minsk, there is also good news from Vilnius.
Today, the Lithuanian Government registered the European Humanities University, which was recently exiled from Minsk and has renewed its activities in Vilnius.
This is the result of huge efforts by some Members of the European Parliament, together with representatives of the European Commission and Lithuanian diplomats.
The students of this university doubtless give real hope for the revival of Belarus.
At the same time we have received some bad news from Minsk.
The dictatorship is intensifying its repression of democratic civil youth organisations opposed to the regime.
The work of the Belarusian Union of Youth and Children's Public associations âRADAâ has been banned by a decision of the regime.
This youth organisation had already won international recognition and was developing relations between young people in Belarus and many European youth organisations.
I would, therefore, like to appeal to all of my colleagues and trust that they will endorse the demand for an end to the repression directed against the youth of Belarus and their organisations.
Â Â  . I shall now speak on the Councilâs behalf to conclude this debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making it quite plain â since this point was raised during the debate â that any state is entitled to raise concerns about human rights anywhere in the world, and that criticism of human rights abuses is not the same thing as interference in a countryâs internal affairs.
That truth was established at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, which was held as recently as 1993.
It follows that the European Union is perfectly entitled â as is any other state â to make human rights in another state its business.
That is what the European Union is doing, and I am grateful to your House for its commitment to this and for the clear affirmations that have emerged from this debate.
In making them, you are making the work of the Council and the Commission easier, for it is vital, where such matters are concerned, that the European institutions should speak with one voice.
Perhaps I might be permitted to say, in response to MrsÂ Schroedterâs intervention, that it certainly is arguable that the instruments available have not, to date, been used in an effective way.
This is something we are endeavouring to improve, and with that in mind, I would like to say that the creation of the European Neighbourhood Policy as a new foreign aid instrument will improve matters; that is what we want to work towards, so that the more efficient use of resources may be guaranteed.
Something else I would like to highlight, since several speakers in this debate referred to it, is the fact that it is today that the troika meeting of foreign ministers with the Russian foreign minister is being held in Vienna â this was announced by Commissioner Borg, since Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is also a participant in it.
It goes without saying that the order of business for this important meeting includes Belarus, for it is indeed important that Russia should spell out where it stands on this matter, and we all know that Russia does, of course, have a certain influence on what goes on there.
Something else that has been mentioned in this debate and that we want to take very seriously is the very real need, when promoting links between academics, between young people, and between members of civil society, for such persons to be given the opportunity to travel abroad, and this is indeed something at which we will have to take a closer look.
These people are staking their freedom on the campaign for democracy, and it would not be right if we were not to enable them to work together with our institutions for the democratisation of Belarus.
Reference has been made to the presidential elections, which would in themselves present Belarus with an opportunity to take the right road forward.
As most speakers have said, its chances of doing that are not very considerable, and the Commission and the Council will have to give some thought to how they will respond in the event of irregularities in the elections.
While we are, of course, prepared to consider taking action in that event, we must, whatever happens, ensure that we do not hit the wrong target â as sanctions so often do.
We do not want whatever we do to affect civil society â on the contrary, we want to promote its wellbeing, and we want to do everything possible to bring about change in Belarus, in the long term, and from the ground up.
That is what we want to do, that is what the Council is working towards.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank honourable Members of Parliament for all their comments, which, in general, reinforce the commitment of this House to seek democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus.
As I stated in my opening remarks, the Commission, for its part, has played an active role in Belarus through its support for NGOs and media organisations and action to help raise awareness among the Belarusian population in the hope that this may bring about democratic change.
The European Union has stressed the importance it attaches to a democratic election process, and we are ready to offer closer relations if and when we see convincing progress towards genuine democracy and respect for human rights.
In response to what Mr Wiersma and other Members said concerning the presidential election scheduled for 19Â March, the Commission regrets that the European Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections.
This is indeed disappointing, but not a surprising decision, given the situation in the country.
We will be following closely what the OSCE/ODIHR mission will be reporting on the elections.
MEPs could possibly form part of the national allocations from Member States to the OSCE/ODIHR mission.
Regarding the point raised by Ms Schroedter and other MEPs, I should like to repeat that the Commission is seeking to address the situation in a novel way through support for the European Humanitarian University in exile and for independent media.
Regarding what Ms ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ said, I would again emphasise that a good part of the Commission strategy is to support independent media in both the Russian and Belarusian languages â in particular â to ensure that they can truly act as a catalyst for change.
Concerning the emphasis placed by Mr Muscat on youth, I thank him for his comments and assure him that the Commission is indeed focusing its efforts on civil society, including the youth of Belarus, who are the hope for a better future.
On the point raise by Ms Vaidere, I should like to state that discussions are under way at Council working group-level with a view to finding some practical solutions to the common approach on visa facilitation.
With regard to Mr Pavilionisâs point, I cannot agree more that we need to support any action in favour of the youth of Belarus and, in particular, in favour of the European Humanitarian University in exile.
The EURÂ 2Â million media project involves not only partners from Germany and Russia, but also a Polish radio station, a Lithuanian radio station, German and Dutch NGOs and Belarusian journalists.
It is therefore a Europe-wide project.
The Russian television partner, RTVI, has demonstrated its fully independent stance from the Russian Government.
As a matter of fact, RTVI is made up of journalists who have escaped government-controlled media outlets.
All television and radio programmes will be in both Russian and Belarusian.
Television programmes aired in Russian will systematically be subtitled in Belarusian.
Â Â  â I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  Before we proceed to Question Time, I have an announcement to make. I can inform that House that Written Statement No 69/2005, on the combating of racism in football(1), has been signed by a majority of Members of this House.
Â Â  Madam President, let me give you the score. It is EPÂ United 1, Racism 0.
More than half of our Members have signed Written DeclarationÂ 69 on combating racism in football.
I thank all Members who have signed.
This is a historic moment.
Â Â  Mrs Bozkurt, you will be aware that that was not a point of order, but this House has, of course, sent out an important message with this statement.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0002/2006).
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Following the introduction of the toll for heavy goods vehicles in Germany, plans to introduce a toll for cars in the near future are also under consideration.
As this would lead to higher costs for German car drivers, the introduction of a car toll would have to be accompanied by a compensatory reduction in vehicle tax.
Does the Commission consider that the introduction of the car toll in Germany, conditional to a decision being made to reduce vehicle tax at the same time, is compatible with the ban on discrimination laid down in Article 12 of the EC Treaty?
Â Â  . I should like to inform the honourable Member of Parliament that currently, with the sole exception of heavy goods vehicles, there is no harmonisation in the field of vehicle taxes at Community level.
While Directive 1999/62/EC established minimum annual vehicle tax rates for heavy goods vehicles, Member States are free to lay down national provisions for car taxation as they see fit.
A similar situation exists in the field of tolls and charges for road vehicles, the imposition of which is often related to, and justified by, the costs incurred by national authorities for the construction and upkeep of the road infrastructure.
Directive 1999/62/EC provides the framework for levying tolls and charges for heavy goods vehicles in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner.
There is no such Community legislation for private vehicles.
However, national provisions introducing car taxes, tolls or charges have to be in line with the general principle of the EC Treaty and, in particular, should not give rise to border-crossing formalities in trade between Member States and should respect the non-discrimination principle.
The Commission is of the opinion that, if the imposition of toll charges for road vehicles is not conditional on a decision to reduce car taxes simultaneously, and if these measures do not include any direct or indirect discrimination based on the nationality of the road vehicle, they are not contrary to ArticleÂ 12 of the EC treaty.
I would like to recall that the Commission gave a similar reply to an oral question during Question Time at Parliamentâs December 2005 part-session.
According to the information available to the Commission, Germany is currently not pursuing the idea of introducing a toll for passenger cars.
If Germany were to introduce a toll, as referred to in the oral question, the Commission would of course examine those provisions in depth.
Â Â  Madam President, on the subject of the infrastructure costs directive, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission is considering doing in order to further advance the principle of the internalisation of external costs.
Although we have now adopted the infrastructure costs directive, what is the Commission contemplating doing, particularly by way of studies and expert assessments, to more clearly elucidate the link between pollution of the environment and heavy goods traffic and, on that basis, to present a new and final proposal for an improved Eurovignette directive with less of an impact on the environment?
Â Â  . The White Paper on transport policy for 2010 concluded that one of the principal reasons for the imbalance in the transport system is that the modes of transport do not, in every case, pay the costs for which they are responsible.
The European Parliament confirmed the need for infrastructure charging when it adopted the report of the conclusions of the White Paper on 12Â January 2003.
Distance-based road tolls and charges based on the duration of the use of the road have historically been levied on motorways or other main roads to help finance the construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure.
Increasingly, as technology advances, such instruments could also be used to manage traffic: congestion charges, emissions-related charges and so on.
Most Member States levy tolls or charges on at least part of their motorway network.
The Commission policy on road charges and tolls is that they are an important instrument for financing investment in infrastructure, managing traffic and encouraging private-sector investment in infrastructure management.
So Commission legislation is currently limited to heavy goods vehicles, as I have already mentioned, but it is a part of our policy.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Commission attaches great importance to the effects that advertising might have on childrenâs behaviour.
This is particularly the case with the advertising of food products, given the potential relationship with childrenâs diets and health.
On the general basis, the European Union is equipped with a number of horizontal norms that touch upon this field and regulate those advertising activities that can influence childrenâs behaviour, and which also cover food products.
First, in respect of television advertising, since 1989 the Television Without Frontiers directive has provided that such advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors.
In particular, television advertising shall not directly exhort minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity, directly encourage them to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or the services being advertised, or exploit the special trust that minors usually have in parents, teachers and in others close to them.
A proposal for an amendment to this directive, adopted by the Commission on 13Â December 2005, would extend these provisions to other types of audio-visual content.
In addition, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which was adopted in 2005, includes similar provisions.
This will enhance the protection of vulnerable groups of consumers, banning directly exhortations to children to buy advertised products or persuade their parents or other adults to buy advertised products for them.
At this stage, the Commission does not intend to take any other legislative initiative.
The Commission now expects self-regulation by the industry to step in and complement in an effective and precise way the provisions of law which are in place.
It has initiated a far-reaching process to that end.
The European platform on diet, physical activity and health, for example, is meant to bring about non-regulatory measures and firm commitments by the industry.
The Commission expects that these commitments will include a number that relate to advertising to children.
In parallel, the Commission has also reinforced its dialogue with industry and others to assess how to further improve advertising self-regulatory measures.
In December 2005 the Commission adopted a Green Paper on the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity.
One of the questions, for which the Green Paper specifically invites responses, is: âAre voluntary codes (âself-regulationâ) an adequate tool for limiting the advertising and marketing of energy-dense and micronutrient-poor foods?
What would be the alternatives to be considered if this self-regulation fails?â
The Commission hopes that this approach will produce meaningful commitments to the benefit of all actors concerned and to society at large.
Should this not be the case â and this is important â the Commission will not hesitate to propose appropriate legislative measures.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Can I push you a bit further on that last point you made, because up until then I was a little disappointed with what you were saying in implying that the legislation was already there.
I could give you any number of examples about which I am concerned, but I shall give you just one.
NestlÃ© âCheeriosâ is a breakfast cereal which has 21% sugar and a great deal of salt.
They produce their own colouring book and encourage children to eat more and more of this product according to how much they are colouring in.
The EU already legislates, as you outlined in your remarks, but you also implied that this legislation was the basis that could be used.
If no new legislation is necessary, can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation â which I am not at all certain is accurate â and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening?
Â Â  . It is quite obvious that the nutrition and health of young people is very important, and not only to the Commission.
I think we can all agree on that.
It is also quite clear that we do not want to see a situation where young people might become overweight, causing severe problems later in life, not only for their own health but also for society.
Therefore we will look into how this works at present.
That is why, if â and I stress, â it does not seem to be working, the Commission will be ready to take further steps.
Â Â  Unlike my colleague, I am delighted that you are not proposing any further legislation today.
Your view is absolutely right.
I thank you also for reminding us that this is an issue about diet, physical activity and health.
It is very easy to carry on bashing the food industry, but would you not agree that it is time for people to recognise that individuals have responsibility for their own lives and that exercise plays a huge part in what is clearly an important issue?
Â Â  . As I said previously, we all have a responsibility to try to ensure that youngsters do not find themselves in a situation where they are more likely to fall ill later on in their lives.
Clearly, society cannot take responsibility for everybody.
Therefore, parents and other adults who are around young people during the day have a responsibility in this area.
We need to have a discussion in the Member States about how much exercise young people do throughout the week at school.
There is a clear link between exercise and health, in terms of the diseases you might get if you do not move properly.
Now, I am old enough to say that, when I was young, we did not have all these video games that exist today â we did not just sit in front of computer screens and enjoy ourselves like that â so we need to encourage young people to get out and get some exercise in order to try to prevent a situation from arising later on in life that none of us would want.
Â Â  . In July 2004 the Commission presented a proposal to amend the regulation concerning trans-European networks â TENs â under the 2007-2013 financial perspective, which, among other things, provided for a higher rate of support up to 50% for a cross-border section of priority projects.
The total allocation amounts to EURÂ 20.35Â billion for these TENs transport projects.
The agreement on the 2007-2013 perspective reached at the December 2005 European Council implies a significant reduction of around 40% of the overall amount of appropriations allocated to Heading 1a which, in addition to the transport sector, covers areas such as research, education, competitiveness and new technologies.
The breakdown of appropriations between the various components of Heading 1a has not yet been decided.
The Commission is therefore unable to give a precise reply to the honourable Member regarding the consequences of the reduction of the amounts contained in its original proposal for a financial perspective until the figures have been finally decided upon by interinstitutional agreements.
Those discussions are ongoing.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply and your honesty, but you have not convinced me that the Commission is addressing the issue with the necessary seriousness for a sector which is so important to the completion of the internal market and the competitiveness of the European Union.
It would appear to be clear that we shall have a reduction â and a significant reduction â from the Commission proposal.
Solutions in this sector take time.
Planning takes time and resources.
Have you not already thought about better partnerships with the private sector, for a larger share on the part of the Member States, about greater involvement by the European Investment Bank?
I am surprised that you are not preparing yourselves in that direction.
Â Â  . Of course it is not unimportant for me to underline that the Commission is not underestimating the importance of these trans-European networks.
However, I am really not in a position today to give any signals at all on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspectives for the period up to 2013.
As I said in my initial response, it is a discussion that is going to take place in the interinstitutional areas that are always in these negotiations at this crucial time.
Â Â  I would like to ask how the reduction in funding for âTrans-European Networksâ projects will affect the new European Union countries, whose transport infrastructure, in particular rail transport, lags considerably behind the level of the countries of Old Europe.
And more precisely, how will the vitally important project to the Baltic countries âRail Balticaâ, connecting the capitals of the Baltic countries with Warsaw and Berlin, be implemented?
Â Â  . I did not hear a question, I heard only a statement.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to point out that the Commission has not answered the substance of my original question, and to put a related supplementary question.
It is understandable that the Commission cannot tell us today how it intends to divide up a budget that has not yet even been adopted, but I do believe that it certainly should be giving consideration to how to go about providing these trans-European networks with the funding that they will need.
As we all know, the various transport operators are perfectly willing to pay tolls, and the new infrastructure costs directive established a very narrow base on which these charges were to be levied, so let me follow up the previous question by asking whether it might not be possible to come up with a proposal for extending that and making cross-financing possible?
Â Â  . Madam President, I am sorry but I am not in a position to give any specific answers.
Even if I wanted to, it is simply not in my hands at this stage. It is in the hands of the European Parliament, amongst others, and I ask for your understanding of the situation.
There are many important areas in these negotiations that certain Members of Parliament want to support, which is understandable, but at this stage it is impossible.
I am sorry.
Â Â  . The Commission would like to give the following reply to the honourable Memberâs question.
First, regarding the total budget for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the Commission proposal will need to be revised in the light of the developments in the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
Secondly, regarding cooperation between research organisations and enterprises, in particular SMEs, the Commission agrees that this is of crucial importance.
Participation by SMEs is, and will remain, one of the key objectives of the framework programmes.
In Framework Programme 6, a variety of measures has been taken in order to promote SME participation in the thematic areas where they collaborate with other firms and research organisations.
These measures include: support to networks of intermediaries in specific sectors of technological fields to help SMEs with proposals, preparations, partner searches etc.; targeted calls in areas of particular interest for SMEs, as well as funding schemes dedicated to SME support, the outsourcing of research by SMEs and SME associations.
Given their success, we propose that they should continue in Framework Programme 7.
The framework programmes are thus already promoting participation by SMEs and their cooperation with research organisations very actively.
With specific reference to the honourable Memberâs suggestion to set a quantified target for SME participation, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Council has introduced a target of 15% SME participation as part of the partial general agreement on FP7.
Such a target already exists in FP6, but the Commission has doubts about maintaining such an overall minimum budgetary target for SME participation for the following reasons.
Firstly, potential participation by SMEs varies very much from one thematic area to another, from approximately 5% to 20%.
It is therefore practically impossible to define a realistic overall target and it could even be misleading.
Secondly, targets for SMEs may be perceived as compromising the objective of supporting only research of the highest quality and would go against the principles of equal access and excellence that are fundamental to the Framework Programme.
Thirdly, support to SMEs should focus on real measures that make FP7 genuinely attractive and beneficial for SMEs, through the identification of research topics, simplification of administrative aspects and so on.
So the Commission believes that SME involvement is best achieved by removing barriers to SME participation and that is what we want to do.
It is also achieved by simplification and improvement of administrative and financial procedures, shorter time to contract, reduced reporting requirements and increased flexibility for SMEs to promote projects of a scope and size that best fit their needs.
More account must also be taken of SME needs and potential in developing the content of the theme in the specific programme and especially in the work programme.
In addition, it is very important to underline that for SMEs the Community financial contribution may reach 75% of the eligible costs instead of the usual rate of 50%.
This is the proposal which was included in the Rules for Participation.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner, for a convincing answer.
In any case, very considerable amounts of money will be allocated under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development.
How does the Commission intend to distribute these funds between the Member States?
Preference will probably be given to large and significant projects.
Could it also happen that the bulk of financial assistance will be allocated to countries that are already advanced in the field of research and that those which are not will get only crumbs?
Â Â  . Madam President, the Framework Programme is only one of the tools being used at the European Union level; it is approximately 4% or 5% of the European Union budget.
I agree with the honourable Member that it is a large sum of money, because there are important challenges which are ahead of us if we are to deal with questions such as how to sustain our quality of life and remain globally competitive.
That is the major question which is included in the Lisbon Agenda and the Partnership for Growth and Jobs which is a follow-up to that.
I believe it is crucial that, on the one hand, we try to stimulate the potential of Member States which are less developed, smaller and maybe do not have the potential to compete on an equal basis today.
There are a number of action centres; specific action is proposed in Framework ProgrammeÂ 7 to boost that ability to compete.
On the other hand, we have to be aware that the European Union should be aiming for the top.
We should stimulate excellence and the possibility that we can truly compete with the changing and challenging world of today.
So we care very much about what you have said, but we also believe that the various types of sources should be combined to address both questions which I underlined, one being the question of aiming for the top, of having the best for Europe; and the second, the question of how to deal with the others which may not be in the best position today.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, quite a few countries have stated that the European Investment Bank could provide loans of up to EURÂ 10Â billion for research purposes or for research and innovation.
What thought has the Commission given to having the EIB develop new funding instruments in support of innovation?
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
You are right to say that it was mentioned in the debate.
However, even before it was mentioned in the debate, the Commission, in its original proposal and together with the European Investment Bank, tried to develop an instrument called a ârisk-sharing facilityâ.
One of the major problems we have to deal with at European Union level is that we do not all have the same ways of addressing risk. It varies from culture to culture.
That is why it is crucial that we create instruments to address that problem.
It is not allowing us to be totally in line with the major competitors, especially when we talk about the percentage of GDP invested in research and development.
It is crucial that that we stimulate that.
That was the idea behind introducing the risk-sharing facility with the EIB.
It would increase potential, because with each unit of the grant which we would somehow give to the EIB, we would get something like four to five units of credit back.
It would also give us the opportunity to address some of the more risky businesses which the EIB â in line with banking logic â is not addressing.
I am sure that this is not a magical answer which will solve our problems, but I sincerely hope that it will be followed by some other financial institutions across Europe.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner precisely how he envisages this reduction in bureaucracy operating in practical terms, since we keep hearing small and medium-sized enterprises complaining that the bureaucratic hurdles â unlike those of national research support programmes â are insurmountable.
Secondly, how will commercial confidentiality be safeguarded?
Â Â  . You have touched on one of the most difficult issues with which we are dealing.
As you rightly stated, probably the best way of stimulating SME participation is to cut down on red tape.
Bigger companies do not have to expend the same proportion of their energy on this as smaller companies, and the same is true of the proportion of finances.
We are trying to approach this question in a consistent manner: from the financial regulation, to the rules of participation, to the next steps of how we will deal with that in-house, we are trying to cut red tape.
It is one of the most difficult exercises we are conducting.
However, I am firmly convinced that, with goodwill, we can take a major step towards at least reversing the negative trend.
On the same day as we adopted the framework programme, we also adopted the special paper dealing with questions of simplification.
In addition, we established a kind of simplification board, consisting of a number of small actors who have been advising us on the preparation of the rules of participation and who will continue to advise us on further in-house simplification processes.
I see simplification as a process that we need to address in all phases and which has to be consistently applied throughout the entire period.
I hope that, in this major endeavour, I will also obtain the support of the European Parliament and the Council, because it is to a certain extent a problem we all share.
Â Â  . The proposal for the seventh Framework Programme includes an extended regional dimension under the capacity-specific programme, with a number of new initiatives that provide European regions with new opportunities for involvement in research and technological development.
First of all, a new scheme on regions of knowledge provides support to research-and-development-intensive regional clusters.
This follows on from two rounds of experimental activities that have created a lot of interest among our regional stakeholders.
Members will recall that the first was actually stimulated by the European Parliament.
The proposal for the seventh Framework Programme recognises the role of regional actors in developing the research capacity of their region and supports projects focused on regional research-driven clusters.
Another important new initiative under the capacities-specific programme is the one on unlocking research potential, which aims to develop the research potential in the EUâs convergence regions by supporting secondments of research staff, the acquisition of equipment or the organisation of conferences for technology transfer.
Activities will also be undertaken on the coherent development of policies, part of the capacity-specific programme that will enable the exchange of experience between policy-makers at regional level.
Activities are provided for under the strand of research infrastructure that would have important implications for some regions in Europe, and, last but not least, the Eranet and the Eranet+ activities that will also involve research players at regional level.
Regions have always been partners to the framework programme.
The fact that this is now taking one step further, including schemes targeted specifically at regions, must not allow us to forget that the framework programme has contributed to research and development in the regions in many more ways and will continue to do so.
Framework programme projects help fight regional insularity and technological preventionism.
Through European research projects, innovative companies in convergence regions will continue to link the major technology networks and to regenerate their profile and capacity, and remote universities will continue to have access to innovative ways of adopting their research models and become, in some cases, real development drivers for the region.
SME networks participating in the framework programme will continue to improve their technological competence.
Marie Curie fellowships will maintain support for research and development human resources, with a direct impact on regional research capacities.
New features in the framework programme enhance its commitment to improving synergies with European regional policy so as to reinforce the support of the structural funds for research in the regions.
Through our actions in the framework programme, the Commission will try to provide useful models that will enable European regions to become more efficient in designing and implementing research policy and thus be more able to support their research players.
In addition, they will become more efficient in using structural funds resources for research investment.
This presents a real opportunity to make progress towards the Barcelona objective of 3% of GDP investment in research and development in the context of the Lisbon strategy.
It is obvious that we must address the issue of catching up at European, national and regional levels, and that is clearly acknowledged in the proposal for the framework programme.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply.
I would like to ask him what monitoring system has the Commission in mind to ensure that there is a balance and an equal share-out of the funding across the regions?
As the Commissioner knows, there are regions which are not capable of taking down this funding, and obviously that imbalance will create uneven European development.
Can the Commissioner tell me what the Commission intends to do about that?
Â Â  . The honourable Member rightly pointed to a question which also concerns us.
The intention of the framework programme in the first place is not balance but excellence.
Being aware that we have to develop the potential of the regions, the Commissionâs approach in the proposal is and always has been synergetic.
It is crucial that one reads carefully the cohesion guidelines prepared by the Commission, which try to give a clear message that the Member States, in addressing their problems in the regions, need to take into account the structural and cohesion funds which are important in this respect for catching up with the Lisbon goals.
As I said before, we also try to do that through our programmes.
However, even if we have specific programmes â such as the one concerning the potential of the cohesion regions â we have to go on with an open course of proposals where we choose the most stimulating ones.
It is crucial to have incentives to give those that are not on top today a lift upwards.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for having drawn attention to the fact that research can be supported via structural funds resources.
I am very interested to know how this is to be managed and how coherence is to be ensured between various research efforts: those using structural funds resources, those made at national level and those made in the EU generally.
How can matters be managed in such a way that sensible projects take place?
A second question concerns the amounts from the structural funds that one might imagine being set aside for research, compared with the amounts available under the Seventh Framework Programme?
The Council talks in terms of 60% of structural funds resources going to the Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  . If I may start at the end, that was also the Commissionâs proposal in the letter which President Barroso sent to Parliament and the Council.
It is important that we recognise the need for the right balance between physical infrastructure on the one hand and intellectual infrastructure and other steps on the other, to stimulate innovation in regions which are today cohesion regions and less developed than the average in the European Union.
That is crucial.
I recently attended a conference in Poland with my colleague MrsÂ HÃŒbner.
It was a good conference, in which we were both able to explain to the audience how important it is to approach matters from both sides.
At the end of the day, we have to be aware that if these recommendations are taken on board, it is in the hands of the Member States.
We have to understand how crucial it is that we balance this kind of support in practice.
I am also fully aware that, in terms of differing levels of development, countriesâ needs are not identical.
So it is crucially important that this aspect is seriously taken into account and that this shift in attention is also taken into account.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question is prompted by the recurrent need, in regional policy, for people to be shown new examples of how to do it.
Since there are many methods of âbest practiceâ, and since there is such a thing as the âinnovation scoreboardâ, would it not be possible for you, Commissioner, and your fellow-Commissioners Mrs HÃŒbner, Mr PotoÄnik and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to put your heads together and consider how these tried and tested practices may be better got across to the European public, so that they may have incentives to step us this sort of cooperation in future?
Â Â  . I can only say that I fully agree with the honourable Memberâs remarks.
It is crucial in all areas that we simply understand that we are working towards the same goal and only by pooling all financial resources together in a practical way can we truly achieve the changes.
Â Â  . Regarding the revision of the Seventh European Union Research and Development Framework Programme, it is the Commissionâs intention to maintain the structure and essential philosophy of the initial proposal following the broad consensus that has already emerged in the discussions in Parliament and the Council.
The principles in the approach to the revision were outlined at a meeting of Parliamentâs Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on 26Â January 2006.
Smaller activity actions cannot be reduced as much as bigger ones, otherwise they lose their .
Some lines have a budget that depends, for instance, on international commitments entered into by the European Union or some other bodies.
Prioritisation within the themes and a high level of flexibility are also necessary.
The cooperation part should remain the core of the programme.
Alongside the cooperation part, many other activities, such as infrastructure, SMEs and the mobility of researchers will be given due consideration in the revised proposal.
In the context of the reduced budget, not only the breakdown but also the timing for the introduction of new initiatives may have to be considered.
The framework programme aims to make European research more attractive and to create more mobility for researchers.
That is to be boosted by the People Programme, dedicated to structuring the mobility, training and career development of researchers throughout Europe.
This is essential to help create a single labour market of researchers, but it is not the only programme to create an attractive European research area.
Â Â  Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your explanations.
The purpose of my question was to communicate to you the concerns of our scientific community at the cuts planned in the funding for European science and technology.
Though it is true that we must wait until the end of the negotiations, in practice it is essential to know as soon as possible what ideas you are considering in order to adapt the Framework Programme to the smaller amount of resources and we are therefore grateful for your explanations.
It is fundamental both in order to continue our parliamentary work and in order to be able to inform our researchers, who want an end to this situation of uncertainty about the future of their research projects, which has gone on for too long already.
I also wanted to ask you, in particular, whether making the European Union a genuinely attractive area for researchers is going to continue to be a priority.
This issue is of immense concern to us and I wanted to ask you whether you can tell us anything more about this issue.
Â Â  . We are all trying to attain one of the goals which the Member States agreed in Barcelona in 2002, i.e. to provide 3% of GDP for investment in research and development.
Pulling the strands together practically is crucial.
It is obvious that cooperation at EU level could show the best ways of using and investing the money.
That is happening with or without our investment.
This is the trend that is going on, because this is the only way in which we can truly deal with the challenges ahead of us.
By stimulating that at European Union level, however, we help this process go faster.
That is why I agree with you totally that our common endeavours are very important for Europe to benefit.
Today, approximately 5% of public money is spent through the Framework Programme at European Union level.
The rest is invested from the budgets of the Member States.
Private funding is even more important than public funding.
In the European Union, approximately 55% of private money is invested, compared to 45% of public money.
It is crucial that we try to stimulate not only the public but also the private sector.
It is crucial that companies work and invest in Europe.
That is why it is crucially important that these companies are stimulated via the creation of proper conditions, i.e. that tax incentives are there, state aid is supporting that, intellectual property rights are in place, public procurement goes in this direction, risk venture capital is provided, and we stimulate brain circulation and so on.
All these things matter.
Three per cent is a kind of indicator of whether we are doing things correctly.
Our horizontal policies which we are using across all our sectors are consistent and are those which are truly up to the challenges which we have to face today.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of todayâs newspapers quotes Mr Jean-Claude Juncker as saying that the Financial Perspective, the Councilâs offer should not be the last word.
He suggests that it would be possible to put forward some EURÂ 875 billion.
Do you believe that it is still possible to top up the seventh research framework programme?
Â Â  . It should not be seen as the final word.
We have the interinstitutional talks going on and we all know the position of Parliament, which was quite definite.
I always welcomed the support from Parliament in our joint endeavours to stimulate education, research and development and innovation, the whole âknowledge triangleâ.
This is something which would need to be decided in the next stage of the process.
I can simply say that investing at European Union level in areas connected with research and development has paid off and it really matters.
I very much appreciate your support.
Â Â  Commissioner, in order for scientific research programmes to succeed, it is very important that businesses participate in them, both by using scientific research inventions and by funding them.
Yesterday, in the European Economic and Social Committee, MrÂ Verheugen, who is a Member of the Commission for another area, presented his programmes to us as programmes to stimulate innovation.
My question would be as follows: do you cooperate and in general coordinate activities between two Members of the Commission and two types of programmes?
Â Â  . âYes, we doâ â that would be the shortest answer.
Under the competitiveness and innovation framework programme, one phase addresses the issue at hand, and the other phases are addressed through the framework programme.
From the very beginning, we have coordinated our activities, which are having a similar effect on innovation as the structural funds have on the regions.
Furthermore, when we talk about involving business in the work we are doing, it is crucial to underline that we have a new tool that did not exist in the past: I refer to the technology platforms, which were established at the beginning of this century and which are developing very fast.
The whole idea of technology platforms â I believe we currently have 28 of them â is that they are bottom-up initiatives, starting with the businessâs point of view.
In these platforms, the points of view of practically all stakeholders are taken on board.
So, while these platforms stem from a business initiative, they also include researchers, politicians, NGOs, financial institutions, regulatory authorities and the others on board.
They create what are known as âstrategic research agendasâ for the next 20 years â or more, depending on various factors.
This is the first time that this kind of tool and this kind of logic have been developed at European Union level.
I meet daily with industrialists and with others, who are clearly very enthusiastic about what is going on.
Even if we were now to remove the incentives, which were, at the outset â if we are frank â financed through the framework programme, this is now a process with its own story.
It will definitely make a change at European Union level.
I believe that we are part of a process that will produce hugely important benefits.
On the basis of their views for the long-term future, where you have an idea of what research should be undertaken, to the final product and the business sectorâs ideas on how to evaluate it in their work, we take this input on board when we create our cooperation activities.
In practice, that is in the major part of our programmes.
Moreover, in some areas, where we believe that this long-term, strong partnership exists, and where there is strong commitment from the companies and other actors, such as Member States, for instance, we are ready to develop what are known as âjoint technological initiativesâ, which are a new long-term tool with clear cofinancing, as a new tool, from the European Commission.
We have never had such a clear overview of the intentions, strategies and points of view of the business sector as we have today when we create the framework programme, and, of course, in the final phase, the specific work programmes.
Â Â  . MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m is in bed with the flu.
That is the reason.
As a complement to the Commissionâs reply to Written Question E-4200/05, asked previously by the honourable Member, on the issue of the goodwill ambassadors, the Commission can reassure the honourable Member that its intention during the period of reflection is to listen to citizensâ views on a range of EU issues and to draw conclusions from the debates held at all levels.
The issues discussed will be very varied and they may or may not include recommendations on the desirable level of integration at EU level, but the role of the Union will certainly be tackled and in any case the content of the database of debates will be reflected in the feedback process.
This process will start with an initial synthesis report that will be presented by the Commission to the European Council under the Austrian Presidency in order to prepare the stocktaking exercise at the June 2006 European Council.
The Commission would like to take this opportunity to remind the honourable Member that the declaration calling for a period of reflection was adopted by the Heads of State and Government themselves, therefore it is for the Council to take stock of the exercise as well.
Moreover, in the organisation of national debates the European institutions have an important role to play, but the primary responsibility rests with the Member States.
What the Commission has recommended in PlanÂ D is that the national debates need to be structured to ensure that the feedback can have a direct impact on the policy agenda of the European Union.
Concerning the second part of the honourable Memberâs question, the Commission would like to stress that the different initiatives suggested by PlanÂ D at European level are part of a long-term plan and are being implemented at a different pace in the 25 Member States.
The European goodwill ambassador plan is one of the measures that need to be further developed in most of the countries of the EU and in cooperation with the Member States, depending on the creativity and the proposals identified by those involved in the process.
There is no single model for every country, just as there is no standard model for the organisation of the debates in the Member States.
In any case, the Commission thinks that it is important to reiterate that the ambassadors would always act on a volunteer basis and the views that they would convey would be their own views.
The Commission has no intention of imposing a particular line on them.
Â Â  I should like to know whether Commissioner PotoÄnik does not think that the project involving goodwill ambassadors might appear ridiculous.
Should it not be elected, representative parliamentarians who are ambassadors for the EU?
Â Â  . There is no doubt that we have confidence that Members of Parliament will act as ambassadors for the European Union.
It is up to all of us to do that.
I believe that Europe is simply too big and there are so many misunderstandings in Europe today that none of us, even if we tried wholeheartedly, can address them properly.
I believe that any action we can take to raise awareness of what the European Union really is might bring us better results.
I agree with the honourable Member that it is up to all of us, Members of Parliament and the Commission, but the action we are proposing is also important.
Â Â  .
The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that EURÂ 7.6Â million will be allocated to the Prince budget line for the 2006 budget, which is intended to finance actions as foreseen under Plan D to highlight the debate during the period of reflection decided by the June 2005 European Council.
This budget will be managed as follows: a call for a proposal of EURÂ 2Â million will be launched in the following weeks to give support to pan-European projects aimed at creating the conditions for citizensâ debates on EU issues.
It will be aimed at supporting EU citizensâ networking and participation in the debate on Europe.
It will be aimed at collecting citizensâ opinions, especially through qualitative means and extensive scale and it will be aimed at providing analyses of citizensâ contributions as feedback for decision-makers.
In addition, EURÂ 850Â 000 will be allocated for setting up specific information products.
On a complementary basis, in order to stimulate the implementation of PlanÂ D at a local level, EURÂ 4.5Â million will be decentralised to the Commissionâs representations in order to develop debates at regional and local levels and to improve synergy and coordination between national, regional and EU levels for the implementation of PlanÂ D. This EURÂ 4.5Â million will be executed either by calls for proposals or by procurement.
Finally, EURÂ 250Â 000 will be requested to develop a website especially devoted to the debate about Europe.
On a broader scale, the Commission has already expressed its disappointment about the recent agreement of the European Council to cut the global appropriations of the next Financial Perspective, Heading 3, in a situation where the debate on Europe is becoming truly crucial.
Â Â  I welcome the Commissionâs answer.
I am glad that the focus of this is towards civil society and NGOs and towards listening to their views, rather than just listening to tabloid newspapers and other protagonists of the debate.
May I also say that while the focus has up to now in this period of reflection been more on the context rather than on the text of the Constitution, does the Commission accept that we will in due course have to bring the debate forward to discuss what we are actually going to do about this text, maybe not this year, but certainly next year?
Â Â  . Of course I think that attention should also be paid to the substance and questions which you underlined.
As you said, maybe not this year, maybe next year, but attention should be given to that also.
Â Â  Commissioner, given the Commissionâs desire to control its own propaganda â as evidenced by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs announcement recently of her proposal for a politically-controlled European news outlet, the EBS â what confidence can exist that any attempt will be made at striking a balance in terms of the distribution of funding between organisations and individuals promoting a pro-Constitution stance and those who promote an anti-Constitution stance?
