There is all too little transparency, and it is too hard for committed citizens to participate in the decision-making process, as the previous speaker so eloquently described.
The Aarhus Convention, governing the conditions for participation by NGOs in the environmental legislation process, has addressed this issue.
This splendid Convention has been ratified by all the Member States, but clearly has not been implemented as it properly should have been.
Now it is the EU that is to ensure that this legislation is implemented.
There have been many problems achieving this state of affairs on a basis that is merely more or less consistent, but so numerous have been the improvements introduced as a result of the second reading that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support the proposal, even though it is far indeed from being as good as it could have been if the EU had lived up to its own fine words about being there for the people.
It is, however, a pity that the Commissionâs clear text on access for NGOs to the European Court of Justice has been watered down by the Council and by Parliament.
It is now not at all clear whether this access actually exists.
We hope, however, that future cases will work out in favour of the NGOs, and thus of the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, in my constituency in Ireland there is a battle being fought.
Men, women and children are standing guard everyday in Pallaskenry, County Limerick, blocking their county council from cutting off the pipes which supply them with the clean, spring-fed lake water that they and their ancestors have been using for thousands of years and from forcing them instead to take a supply of water from the River Deal, one of Irelandâs most polluted rivers.
In another stand-off in Bantry, County Cork, people are camping out at strategic positions, blocking workers sent to run unnecessary over-the-ground high-voltage power lines across their farms.
These groups are not only in the blockades but they are in the High Court, at great personal expense, and are being threatened by our justice system with prison.
With Aarhus these situations should not be happening in Ireland.
Is there anything you can do to help us?
Our government has signed the Aarhus Convention, which makes our government look good among its nation peers, but our government is one of the few signatories that refuse to ratify it and to give it effect.
The Aarhus Convention demands that we the people contribute information and have access to it, that the people are part of every decision taken about the environment and that we have affordable and ready access to justice when it is necessary to protect the environment and the families in it.
By not ratifying Aarhus, the Irish Government thinks it can continue its practice of riding roughshod over its people, whilst kowtowing to any and every wealthy investor, regardless of the damage it will do to peopleâs lives, health and environment.
This report seeks to urge a better application of Aarhus, but we in Ireland have no application.
Please put pressure on the Irish Government to finally ratify Aarhus, even at this late date, and see the people as an ally rather than an enemy in the effort to protect the environment.
Â Â  Over the past years we have heard at various European forums about how important it is for the European Union to be close to its citizens and to make the operation of its institutions more transparent.
The adoption of the Aarhus Convention by the European Union is a significant step in this direction.
Environmental protection is the area in which the general public probably shows the highest level of interest in the performance of our institutions, and apart from having access to information, it also wants to participate in decision-making.
Finding the balance between the ever-increasing publicity and maintaining the institutions' ability to operate is not an easy task.
It would not be right to create a situation that would lead to the proliferation of court cases.
I believe that we can expect civil organisations wishing to exercise their rights to operate in a law-abiding manner themselves, and in exchange, we should not infringe their rights with unjustified exceptions.
This is why I am disappointed that the final version of the proposal does not include access rights to projects financed by European institutions.
We can hardly expect citizens to identify with a Europe that accepts certain fundamental principles, but at the same time is ready to provide financial assistance to objectives that they oppose.
Moreover, Europe should also provide an example to Member States in this respect, as we have heard earlier.
Overall, I am convinced of the advantages of social control.
I am aware that the affected bodies may often view social control as an inconvenience, and it may seem unnecessarily complicated to them.
Still, at an overall social level, it does lead to decisions that are better than those made without the participation of citizens and their organisations.
After all, this is the basis of democracy, is it not?
Thank you very much, and congratulations to my colleague Mrs Korhola for her excellent work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0231/2006) by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC [PE-CONS 3615/2006 â C6â0154/2006 â 2003/0282(COD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, finally, the moment had arrived.
On 3Â May 2006, more than two and a half years after the Commission had presented a proposal for the review of the Batteries Directive, the Council and Parliament, through conciliation, reached agreement on the final text.
First of all, I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for the constructive way in which this dossier was brought to a favourable conclusion.
In the 23 amendments that were adopted at second reading, the presidency, and by extension also the Council, did more than meet this House halfway.
I should also like to thank all Members of this House, especially those who were in the delegation and the conciliation secretariat, for their commitment and support.
It is partly thanks to them that we have a good result.
In addition, I am indebted to the Commission for its input in the compromises and the drafting of new text proposals.
This has proved invaluable in terms of the process whereby agreement was reached.
What have we now achieved?
I should like to single out a few key points.
First of all, the directive enables consumers to choose a cost-effective battery more easily.
After all, the cheapest battery is not always the most cost-effective.
Since the directive makes it compulsory for producers to specify the capacity on batteries, consumers can assess the price/quality ratio themselves and select the most cost-effective battery for each purpose.
Secondly, the agreement also stipulates that it must be straight-forward to remove batteries from appliances.
By replacing the battery, we can prevent consumers from having to dispose of perfectly good appliances because the battery is flat.
Thirdly, the producer must take back batteries after use and handle the recycling of them.
This also applies to those supplied in the past.
Fourthly, the directive requires all Member States to set up an effective collection system.
This is a considerable improvement for at the moment, only six Member States have a national collection system for batteries.
Moreover, the differences in collection percentages are still very high, ranging from 59% in Belgium to 16% in France.
Fifthly, all producers of batteries in the European Union will be registered, so that all producers will be responsible for funding the collection and processing of spent batteries.
Finally, I should like to mention the keystone of the directive on which we had already reached agreement at first reading, namely the ban on cadmium in portable batteries, which enters into effect in 2008.
As a result, this harmful metal will, in time, disappear from household waste, with a consequent benefit to the environment and to public health.
Moreover, the alternatives to nickel cadmium batteries appear to be far superior.
Given the positive negotiation result, I warmly recommend this House to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the new Batteries Directive, and should like to ask the Council to do likewise as soon as possible, so that the new legislation can be published.
In addition, the importance of what the Member States have to do in implementing and enforcing the Batteries Directive should not be underestimated.
I would express the wish and expectation that a start be made straight away, so that we do not need to do the impossible in the closing stages.
In my view, a review will be needed in future with regard to the applications to which an exemption from the cadmium ban applies.
I take it as read that the Commission will be attentive in this respect and will present a proposal to Parliament in due course.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the representatives of the European Parliament on the discussions held in the conciliation committee last May.
In particular, I wish to thank Vice-President Roth-Behrendt, who chaired the conciliation committee, and Parliament's rapporteur, MrÂ Johannes Blokland, who truly made a very important contribution to the positive results achieved.
The discussions in the conciliation committee were constructive and moved in the right direction, thanks also to the efforts of the Austrian Presidency, and agreement was reached on numerous important matters, as MrÂ Blokland mentioned: the possibility of removing accumulators from appliances, the exemption for very small battery producers, capacity labelling on batteries and other important matters to which positive solutions were found.
The European Commission supports the outcome of the procedure and we recommend that Parliament vote in favour of the excellent results achieved by its negotiating team.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to the rapporteur, MrÂ Blokland, for his committed work.
Of course, his original proposals were rather more ambitious than the outcome of the Conciliation Committee we have ended up with, and so it could be said that this is not an unqualified success for the environment.
What was decided does, however, represent a clear improvement in the protection of human beings and the environment against the hazardous chemicals that can escape from batteries.
That is why a vast majority in the House should support this outcome tomorrow.
I agreed with MrÂ Blokland on most points but, even from the start of the procedure, I disagreed with the extension of the cadmium ban to industrial batteries.
I am pleased that we have managed to find a solution in committee at second reading.
A cadmium ban relating to industrial batteries â unlike such a ban relating to portable batteries â would have put too great a strain on industry whilst having little effect on the environment, as we have an effective recycling system for industrial batteries.
The German Federal Environment Agency has informed me that even operators of certain plants in the Libyan desert are looking into how to dispose of their industrial batteries, as these batteries are so large that they cannot just be put into the household waste.
Even in the Libyan desert, therefore, recycling is a real consideration, and that is why I advocated a derogation for these from the outset â which has in fact been laid down in the final resolution.
I agree with all the other proposals MrÂ Blokland has presented, however, and am glad that agreement has been reached between all three institutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to begin by thanking MrÂ Blokland.
It has been a long process, and you have worked hard.
You have seen eye to eye with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for a large part of the way.
It is also for this reason that we are able to support the compromise even if, like the preceding speaker, we are not entirely satisfied.
There are certain areas where this piece of legislation could have been better.
We do not agree that cordless power tools, specifically, should be excepted.
They account for a large proportion of the cadmium batteries in use today.
There are alternatives, which may be reusable.
It may also be possible not to let some of these batteries slip through the system, and for the environmental damage therefore not to be as large â if, that is, the system works.
We must simply point out, however, that there are alternatives, and since there are alternatives, why should we not use them?
Why should we not, then, ban these hazardous batteries?
It is, of course, the progress, indeed great progress, made that ensures that we are supporting this legislation despite everything.
The capacity labelling is a good thing, particularly for consumers.
We are, of course, aware of all the advertisements for batteries â I shall not specify any product names, but there is definitely something to do with a rabbit â and the manufacturers clearly wish to give the impression that these batteries last much longer than those of their competitors.
It is also possible that they do just that, but now we will have proof of the matter, because it will now state on the packaging how much energy such a battery contains.
This is clearly a good thing.
A further positive is that we are obliging the manufacturers to ensure that if there is a battery in an appliance it must be easy to remove.
Another positive is the fact that we in Europe will now have a high overall percentage of recycling.
Again, we could well have wished for an even higher figure, but we are happy to have Community rules in this area.
All in all we have to say that it is an important area that we are now legislating for at Community level.
Our ambitions were higher than what has been achieved, but we nonetheless support the legislation, overall, on the basis of the improvements that have been achieved.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the aims of this directive, which forms part of European environmental policy.
As a member of Parliamentâs delegation to the Conciliation Committee, I advocated a degree of flexibility, especially for accumulators that allow safety requirements to be met.
The wording proposed by the Conciliation Committee not only allows ambitious rules and targets to be retained â especially in terms of collection and recycling â but also allows account to be taken of reality and of the efforts being made by the manufacturers of accumulators, especially for industrial use.
Distributor take-back is in fact adopted as the default method of collection, but schemes that are already working can be retained, provided an assessment, which must be made public, shows that they are at least as effective as distributor take-back.
This guarantee of equivalent effectiveness in terms of collection seems to me to be crucial for a flexible but non-permissive system.
Moreover, appliances must be designed in such a way that used batteries and accumulators are easy to remove and they must be accompanied by instructions containing information for consumers.
However, these provisions will not apply where, for safety, performance, medical or data integrity reasons, continuity of power supply is necessary and a permanent connection between the appliance and the battery is required.
Once again, flexibility is closely circumscribed.
I nevertheless remain sceptical about capacity labelling of portable and automotive batteries and accumulators; and while I understand this concern for consumer information, I think that too many variables, such as conditions of use and usage, affect the life of such batteries and accumulators.
Finally, the joint text that is being put to the vote seems to me to bring balanced responses to the different institutionsâ demands.
I therefore invite you to vote in favour of this text, and I thank our rapporteur for the quality of his work.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you, MrÂ Blokland, for a long fight that eventually led to an acceptable result.
The Council was pulled this way and that by the industryâs lobbyists and fought against the best interests of consumers and the environment.
I wonder what EU citizens would say if they knew that a majority of their governments were fighting against the consumersâ right to know the capacity of the batteries they buy.
The Council wants us to buy a pig in a poke.
What would voters say if they knew that the Council did not want batteries to be easily removable so that they might be recycled easily or have their lifetime extended?
What would voters say if they knew that their governments were fighting tooth and nail to obtain the lowest possible level of liability in respect of extremely poisonous heavy metals?
As luck would have it, Parliament succeeded in putting most things right, but, scandalously enough, cadmium batteries in hand tools are still permitted.
On this issue, the industry lobby unfortunately won, both in the Council and in Parliament.
Thank you, MrÂ Blokland.
You have done a good job, and I shall vote in favour of the report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The first item on the agenda will be a statement by myself; 70 years after General Franco's coup d'Ã©tat in Spain, on 18 July 1936.
As you know, a group of 200 Members signed a request for an oral question to the Commission and the Council explicitly calling for a debate on condemning the Franco regime on the 70th anniversary of General Francoâs coup dâÃ©tat.
The Conference of Presidents did not accept that request and thought it more appropriate for the President to make a statement and for the various political groups then to express their opinions about the significance of this date.
That is what we are doing now.
We are talking about a date that is now way back in history: 70 years have passed since 18 July 1936.
That is almost the life expectancy of the generation of Spaniards who took part in the transition to democracy, a transition that is seen as a model, but whose success required selective forgetfulness and suspension of memory, which is now emerging in a process of recovery which is filling the book shops and even being enshrined in laws.
As I told you two years ago, I belong to that generation â like many of the Spanish Members here â and my personal relationship with the past inevitably determines my memory.
This is an institutional statement, however, that I am making as President of the House, and what I say today must be a political act that goes beyond the personal.
To bring our past to bear upon the present is an act of will which relates, above all, to the future that we want to build, and we want to build it not just upon the fragile and perishable memory of each of us, but upon History, which is not remembered, but rather learnt, and for that very reason can be shared.
History tells us that on that day part of the Spanish army â just a part of it â rose up against the Government of the Second Republic, democratically elected by the Spanish people in 1931.
That put an end to a great hope, because that republic had come with the intention of promoting democracy and carrying out necessary wide-ranging reforms: agricultural reforms, military reforms, the separation of Church and State, the establishment of social security, Statutes of Autonomy for the regions, rights such as votes for women and divorce, within a profoundly patriarchal society.
Those reforms became a reference point for many European countries.
They were a reference for democracy in Europe, the new frontier of democracy in Europe, a democracy that was facing difficult times at that point, having fallen in Italy, in Greece, in Poland, in Hungary and in Germany.
That coup dâÃ©tat did not just lead to a long and cruel civil war in Spain, therefore, but it also put an end to that hope for Europe that AndrÃ© Malraux had spoken of.
The war in Spain was not just a war and it was not just Spanish.
It was a confrontation between two great views of the world.
Yes, the two Spains of Larra and Machado were returning, and one of the two Spains froze the heart of each Spaniard.
A war between Spaniards would not have lasted so long, however, simply because our own forces would not have allowed it.
The war was a decisive moment in the history of the world.
It was of immense significance internationally.
From 1936, Europeâs future participants in the Second World War came into direct or indirect conflict with each other during the Spanish civil war.
Spain was the first great battle of the Second World War, the test bench for a war to come that would devastate Europe.
For the first time in history civil populations were bombed.
We all remember Guernica, but there were many Guernicas in Spain.
Europeans lost their lives on both sides and their names populate the cemeteries of Madrid, of Jarama, of Belchite, of Teruel, of Guadalajara, of the EbroÂ âŠ, mythical names, where so many Europeans lie.
Their fellow Europeans then went on to fight across the whole of Europe in order to liberate it For some people that war was the last great cause, for others it was a crusade.

I remember the crusade, the bishops saluting in the fascist style, surrounding generals at the entrances to the churches.
I also remember the cemeteries full of people shot by one side or the other.
It was the most passionate war, in which the ideologies of the 20th century confronted each other for the first time: democracy, fascism and communism. It was a religious war, but at the same time a class war, a revolution faced with a reaction.
It was a conflict that would continue in Europe and which also continued in Spain after the war had finished, because it was not just a war.


There was also a long and hard post-war period, during which it was no longer a question of beating the enemy, since the war had been won, but rather of eradicating it, in order to maintain a system that lasted for a long time and kept Spain out of the process of democratisation and also the process of reconstruction experienced by Europe as a result of the Marshall Plan.
Many of our colleagues from the countries of the East remember the isolation they suffered as a result of Yalta and the iron curtain that separated them from the free, democratic and prosperous Europe, and that is what it was like.
What people remember less, however, is that there were countries in the South of Europe â Spain and Portugal â that were also isolated from this movement and which remained under military dictatorships for a long time.
I remember that a US congressman once complained to me that the Europeans were not grateful for the efforts the United States had made to liberate Europe.
I had to remind him that, as far as Spain was concerned, that effort was conspicuous by its absence, since they forgot to liberate us, because the military regime was useful to them during the Cold War.
Today I would like to use the words of Salvador de Madariaga, whose name appears on one of our buildings. âBefore 1936â, he said, âall of the Spaniards lived in Spain and in freedom.
âTodayâ, he said in 1954, âhundreds of thousands live in freedom exiled from Spain and the rest live in Spain exiled from freedomâ.
Freedom returned in 1975.
We began to build the foundations of a community based on democracy, freedom and the prospect of joining Europe.
New generations have brought new political demands regarding the future and regarding the past.
They have been faced with a war and a dictatorship that have been placed at one remove from them and, when we talk in Spain today about moral reparation for the victims, what we want to do is to discuss the active memory of our country, of our society, in order to accept our past fully, in order to honour all of the dead and in order to face the obvious truths, not to forget those events that are uncomfortable for us and not to allow ourselves to be consoled by untruths.


These are painful wounds that have begun to heal in Europe, but which remain in many peopleâs memories, because at the time it was not possible to exorcise them.




That is the purpose of the event we are holding today here in the European Parliament: to face a past that lives on in part of our continentâs memory in order not to repeat yesterdayâs mistakes, in order clear-sightedly to condemn those responsible for them, in order to pay tribute to those peopleâs victims and in order to acknowledge all those who fought for democracy, suffered persecution and promoted Spainâs return to Europe, as our common heritage.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats following this statement on the recent history of Spain.
I would like to stress that our position is essentially based on full support for the values of reconciliation and of overcoming a past tragedy, which were the values that inspired the transition to democracy and which led to the 1978 Constitution.
On a day like tomorrow, a 5th of July 30 years ago, the President of the Spanish Government, Adolfo SuÃ¡rez, took on his job of taking our democratic transition forward.
For those of us who had the honour and opportunity to assist in that project and to belong to the Union of the Democratic Centre - that party which, in government, was responsible for the material execution of the transition, aided by other political formations and supported unequivocally by Spanish society and His Majesty the King - our values of freedom and reconciliation enshrined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and our call for an end to the two irreconcilable Spains arose from our very deepest convictions.
The mistake, the stupidity, the tragedy of the last century of Spanish history, was the ease with which the two opposing Spains have been able to re-emerge â an excessive phenomenon that has always existed in our country â the ease with which those two Spains were able to convince themselves that they could not live together democratically.
We are all aware of the origin and the raison dâÃªtre of the European Union, which is founded upon the same moral strength as that Spanish Constitution, the moral strength of people joining together, the moral strength of unity, so that our recent past will not repeat itself, so that no more world wars will emerge on European soil, no more wars, no more dictatorships, no more communist regimes and no more civil wars like the one we suffered in Spain.
The new nations of Europe may make mistakes when dealing with our present and future problems, but there is one mistake that we cannot make, that we do not have the right to make: to repeat historical mistakes, not to learn from the mistakes of our history.
For all of these reasons, we must not become tired of reconciliation and harmony.
We must not change our attitude, and many Spaniards believe it to be an historical mistake to try to promote a second transition today, as if the first one had grown old and obsolete; it is an historical mistake to unilaterally destroy the essence of our Constitution of harmony; it is historically foolish to introduce the debate on the right to self-determination in Spain, the creation within Spain of new nations that have never existed; it is an historical mistake because it moves us away from the harmony we have created.
On this thirtieth anniversary of the Spanish democratic transition, therefore, Mr President, which began on 5 July 1976, and on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, please allow me to end with a 'viva' for reconciliation, a âvivaâ. for freedom and a âvivaâ for the Spanish Constitution of 1978.
Â Â  Mr President, having listened to your speech, I would like to ask what was the spirit behind Franco and his regime?
We all know that spirit.
It is the spirit of intolerance, of contempt for mankind, it is the spirit that smashes democratic institutions, the spirit that hates everything that is not how it would like it to be.
Behind Franco and his regime was contempt for mankind and deadly propensity for violence.
Unconditional subjection to its own ideology or death â that was the message of the Franco regime.
It was not a Spanish message, however, because when Franco seized power 70 years ago my country had already been suffering under the Hitler dictatorship for three years and Mussolini had already been ruling for 14 years in Italy.
At that time, the fascist movement of which Franco was a â primarily militaristic â part already existed all over Europe.
The civil war was not just a Spanish civil war.
Spain was its main territory and the Spanish people its main victims, but the Spanish people were also its hostages in a trial run for a greater war.
Guernica and the Condor Legion are and remain a blot on my countryâs history.
The youth of the 1930s were a glorious page in European and world history, travelling to Spain to defend democracy of their own accord.
Ernest Hemingway created an unforgettable literary monument to that generation.
The famous American writer Arthur Miller once said that in the 30s the word Spain was an explosion.
It was about overcoming clerical feudalism and setting the spirit of freedom and tolerance against the demon of intolerance.
If we think of Spain today, we on Europeâs left think of the countless victims that civil war claimed from among our ranks â but not only from ours.
There were also Christian Democrats, Liberals and Republicans who stood against that intolerance.
Franco was opposed worldwide by the whole community of thinkers and nations, who opposed that totalitarian desire for subjugation that was associated with Franco.
Franco lost.
If we can take stock of the situation here in this House 70 years later, then I would draw your attention to the fact that since direct elections were introduced three Presidents of the European Parliament have been Spaniards: one conservative Christian Democrat and two Social Democrats.
If today, 70 years later, a Spanish President of Catalan origin is able to say, on behalf of the elected representatives of 25 nations of Europe, that European integration is a victory over intolerance and bondage, then, 70 years on, we can say that freedom has won and Franco has lost.
Nothing better could happen to Europe!
Â Â  . Mr President, Europe is rich in history and, even if the European Parliament must not seek to play the role of the sole keeper of the truth about the past, it is nevertheless important for the future of European integration that Parliament should feel responsible for Europeâs collective memory, which is the principal factor constituting European unity.
We are now in 2006. This is the anniversary of the workersâ uprising in Poznan in June 1956 and of the Hungarian revolution in October 1956: dramatic events in the struggle for bread and freedom.
This is 2006: seventy years ago, General Franco imposed a dictatorial regime opposed to freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
Spain, which should have been one of the founder nations of the European Union, found itself against the will of its people separated from the rest of Europe for half a century.
In contemplating these events, it would not be proper to tot up all the instances of injustice, hatred, conflict and human suffering from the periods of the Civil War and the dictatorship. So that such events might never happen again, we shall need, rather, to recall that Spainâs experience is also Europeâs, and one that led to the foundation and construction of the European Union.

Europe should make a point of remembering that, if Spain has been able to close this dramatic chapter in its history by consensus, then it is through reconciliation and peaceful dialogue.
Let us pay homage to the courage and wisdom of the Spanish people.
In this anniversary year this Parliament and Europe as a whole should rejoice in knowing the freedom upon which they are based. Beyond all political divisions, Europe should feel united and wake up to the fact that now we know why Europe exists.
In doing so, we also honour the dramatic experience that we commemorate with sadness today. Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Spain in 1936 is above all a lesson for us Europeans or, rather, four lessons.
The first lesson has to do with the courage, self-sacrifice and extraordinary imagination of a people, the Spanish people, in striving towards freedom and democracy.
Who could forget the extraordinary social inventions of free Catalonia?
Who could forget everything that the Spanish people attempted during this amazing period?
The second lesson concerns the barbarity of fascism, and, as we have just heard, one of its symbols is Guernica: the symbol of murder, assassination, incarceration; the symbol too of an international Fascist project, since it is clear that Spanish Fascism would never have been able to triumph without the help of National Socialism.
In 1936, the Fascist project of European domination was already evident.
The third lesson is harder to take on board because it is the lesson of cowardice: the cowardice of Europeans, the cowardice of the French â even if it was difficult for LÃ©onÂ BlumÂ âÂ the cowardice of the British, the cowardice of all those who thought that if the Spanish people paid the price, then they would not have to.
As in Munich in 1938, this attitude turned out to be one of the great errors of that period, affording one of the great lessons that we need to learn from it.
As history has shown, anyone who thinks that they can keep a low profile while the storm passes by on the other side is often mistaken.
This is an important lesson which, for a very long time, has been very difficult for many Europeans to accept.
Sometimes, pacifism paves the way for horror.
Sometimes, it is a sign of courage.
It is always very difficult to know whether pacifism or its alternative is the right course of action.
If, however, it is necessary to speak of cowardice, then the courage shown should also be emphasised: that, for example, of PierreÂ Cot, a minister under LÃ©onÂ Blum who, as a minister, had arms sent to Spain.
Let us recall that PierreÂ Cot, whose actions in this difficult period were heroic, is the father of one of our fellow Members, Jean-PierreÂ Cot, whom I thank for having reminded me of his fatherâs actions.
The fourth lesson, finally, concerns the horrible intolerance of Communist totalitarianism, because we must not forget that there are two great images from the Spanish Civil War.
The first is that of the international brigades who wanted to save the Spanish people, but at the same time there is that of the intolerant Communist brigades which murdered Trotskyist members of POUM, as well as anarchists, because they did not have the same political orientation.
That, too, is a lesson of the Spanish Civil War.
It shows us that liberation does not mean dismissing everybody elseâs opinion; rather, it means accepting diversity and democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must profit fully from all of these four lessons.
We must recall them when there is barbarity in Bosnia or when there is a duty to show solidarity with oppressed peoples.
If these lessons are learned well, then I believe that the future could be a little brighter.
Â Â  . Mr President, Parliament is acting as it should by organising this political act to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of Francoâs unleashing of the Spanish Civil War.
Indeed, the destruction of that young Republic is, in more than one respect, relevant to the whole of Europe.
First of all, the forces of the 1936 Putsch only managed to overcome the Popular Front with the decisive assistance of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.
It was, too, in Spain that the latter experimented with a view to its future against France, and Guernica was the first example in world history of the massacre of a civilian population by massive aerial bombardments which was to become a terrifying model for what took place throughout the Second World War.
Those dark years, 1936 - 1939, demand the attention of Europe for yet another reason: the way in which the republicans were betrayed by neighbouring democracies.
The non-intervention of 1936 paved the way for Munich in 1938, which led to continent-wide disaster from 1939. What, moreover, is to be said about the smug indifference of Western and European leaders in general to the Francoist regime after the war, as soon as its leader had joined the forces for good against the evil empire.
In conclusion, there is one final reason why the Spanish tragedy has a European dimension: this is the unparalleled surge of international solidarity to which it gave rise among the workers and the common people, as well as among the most eminent European intellectuals; a solidarity strikingly illustrated by the International Brigades, composed of 40Â 000 volunteers from around fifty countries.
Conversely, a number of Spanish republicans went on to be members of the French Resistance.
Some of them would take part in the Paris insurrection of August 1944 under the leadership of my late lamented comrade HenriÂ Rol-Tanguy.
Others took part in the liberation of Strasbourg in November of the same year in the army of General Leclerc.
Without doubt, the European consciousness would not be the same without the unspeakable suffering of the victims of Francoism, without the intrepid courage of those Spaniards who offered resistance and without the tide of solidarity on which the young Republic was borne.
May todayâs commemorative act on our part pay to all the women and men concerned the tribute that they deserve.
Â Â  . Mr President, in many ways I find it very difficult to know what to say today, because I, unlike many of my colleagues, am from a generation that does not have a living memory of the tragedy that was the very foundation of the European Union.
However, I read history and I have some knowledge and understanding of it.
We are speaking today about the 70th anniversary of Francoâs coup.
An atrocity or a tragedy on the European continent is commemorated in the history books for every single day going back over 227 years.
I suppose, then, what we really should be focusing on is that fascism, communism, imperialism and the totalitarian regimes we have experienced on our continent have a common thread: a lack of respect for human difference and different ideas and an intolerance towards those who want to chart a different path.
Whether we are talking about Potsdam, Hungary, GdaÅsk, Siberia, Spain, Portugal or Ireland, those who have tried to impose their will on others have always failed, because the very essence of our humanity is the desire to be free to ensure that we can live and interact with others.
That is why it is most important that we not only learn from the mistakes of the past but also ensure that we never repeat them.
Rather than criticising or pointing the finger and saying that this tragedy was more dramatic, more damaging or more influential in European politics than others, let us agree that it happened and use it as an example.
In Europe today, we have been able to overcome those differences; we have found a forum and a way forward in which people from different countries, with different ideologies, different histories and different interpretations of the same history can come together and find common ground and a common cause.
The best thing that we can do today in the European Parliament is to encourage Prime Minister Zapatero in his efforts to bring together what were previously irreconcilable peoples to find a common way forward in the Basque region.
That is not to forgive the atrocities that were committed or to say that the wrongs did not take place; it is to say that you cannot go on living in the past, you cannot remain bitter.
When the opportunity for peace arises, we must seize it as it passes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, âThey must be stopped!â
So exclaimed the great young poet of my youth, Gustaf Munch-Petersen, when, as a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War, he stood alone at the front while his comrades withdrew, confronted as they were by superior forces.
Gustaf left his wife, child and family at home in Denmark.
His action was neither defensible nor responsible and was unable to keep the plague of Fascism away from Europe.
His lonely protest had no rationale behind it, but imagine if everyone had acted with the same courage.
To die fearlessly was the last poetic offering of his life.
Most people remained passive when democracy was threatened and, in many places, displaced, until other courageous people put a stop to Nazism and Fascism.
For many here in this House, the liberation became a new occupation, involving the Iron Curtain and the Gulag.
Today, let us remember the many people â courageous and otherwise - who died.
Let us pay homage to those who, as volunteer soldiers in the Spanish Civil War, offered resistance, took part in the defence of democracy and displayed both courage and foolhardiness in underground armies established to oppose governmentsâ policy of appeasing the enemies of democracy.
Many people active in resistance movements found their way into the political parties and also the movements that I have represented in this House for 27 years.
They are almost all dead.
As he was dying, my courageous neighbour, Hans â a blacksmith by trade â talked wildly about British bombs raining down on a French school instead of on the Gestapoâs headquarters.
As an agent working for the British, Hans had supplied the illegal drawings.
The mistake was not his, but the thought of the dead schoolchildren haunted him until the end.
I also wish to remember a young academic who travelled all around the country in order to create the first Danish resistance movement, while the government cooperated with the German occupying power.
Frode Jakobsen subsequently became leader of the successful underground government, the Danish Freedom Association.
After the war he became a government minister and took part in the European Movementâs great congress in The Hague in 1948, when the Council of Europe and European integration were got under way.
For many years he was President of the European Movement and a Social Democratic member of the Danish Parliament.
That being said, he voted ânoâ in all the votes on EC and EU Treaties and initiated criticism of the EU on democratic grounds back in 1972.
We have named a prize after him.
It is awarded each year to those who have shown unusual political courage and done something for people other than themselves at a time when to do so was not expedient or profitable or likely to further their careers.
We have never had difficulty finding candidates.
There are always people who show unusual political courage, and some of them have sought inspiration in the half a million volunteers and citizens of the world who travelled to Spain to say âNo pasarÃ¡nâ.
I would say thank you to those who displayed personal courage and died for our freedom. âEl pueblo unido jamÃ¡s serÃ¡ vencidoâ.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that today, throughout Central and Western Europe, we have democracy, civil liberties, private ownership and tolerance is due to the fact that Communism did not take hold on our continent, although it could have.
In Eastern Europe, a dam against Communism was created by the victorious battle of the Poles against the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the decisive resistance of Catholic Poland against enforced Soviet dominance.
The fact that Communism did not take root in the West is largely thanks to the victorious civil war fought by traditional Spain against Communist governments.
Although it came to power democratically, the Spanish left behaved in a similar manner to the left in Bolshevik Russia, where the main target of attacks was the Church.
Almost 7Â 000 priests were murdered.
Churches were desecrated, roadside crosses and holy statues were shot at.
Traditional forces immediately responded to this attack on Catholic Spain.
The International Brigades, organised by Bolshevik Russia, came to the aid of Communist Spain.
In accordance with Communist custom, these brigades were entirely controlled by Communist party cells and their secret services, as was the whole republican regime.
Thanks to the Spanish right, the Spanish army, its leaders and thanks to General Francisco Franco in particular, the Communist attack on Catholic Spain was thwarted.
By the same token, attempts to spread the Communist plague to other countries were also halted.
The presence of figures such as Franco, Salazar or De Valera in European politics ensured that Europe maintained its traditional values.
We lack such statesmen today.
It is with some regret that we observe today the phenomenon of historical revisionism, which portrays all that is traditional and Catholic in an unfavourable light and everything that is secular and socialist in a favourable light.
Let us remember that Nazism in Germany and fascism in Italy also had socialist and atheist roots.
The power wielded by the socialist and anti-Catholic bloc in this House is cause for great concern.
We saw clear examples of this power during the voting last month on the texts on tolerance and the Seventh Framework Programme.
Christian Europe is losing the battle against a socialist and atheist Europe.
This has to change!
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to avail myself of the option of making personal statements at the end of debates.
I cannot now remember which precise Rule of the Rules of Procedure it is, but I would ask you to allow me this personal statement.
I have listened carefully to everything the previous speaker said.
I will not go into it in detail, but I want to say one thing on behalf of myself and my group: what we have just heard is the spirit of MrÂ Franco.
It was a fascist speech and it has no place in the European Parliament!
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to take advantage, as MrÂ Schulz has done, of my right as a Member of Parliament and to take the floor briefly.
I regret that you and the Conference of Presidents decided to dedicate so much time to the debate on Francisco Franco but did not permit even a minute to be spent discussing another terrible massacre which took place in KatyÅ.
It was something I asked for on behalf of Poles and all those who died there.
I very much regret the decision not to grant my request.
Â Â  Mr President, as a Catholic I would like to say that we stand for human dignity, human rights, the rule of law, democracy and freedom.
We do not consider dictators and supporters of totalitarian regimes â be it fascism, national socialism or communism â the right people to defend our ideals.
We defend our ideals with our own convictions.
Â Â  I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in this debate and I would like to thank the Members who have attended it, in particular those who are not Spanish, for the interest they have shown in this historic event, which was undoubtedly a tragedy.
I would also like to point out that we have been accompanied in the public gallery by people whose historical memory has brought them here.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a Greek I am, I think, entitled to say that today we are at the end of a marathon run of debates and negotiations which started not in 2004, when the Commission submitted its proposal for the draft general regulation, but much earlier, in 2001, when we started the first debates on the future of the Structural Funds for the period 2007-2013.
Parliament was present throughout this procedure and set its seal on the debates and negotiations: on the initially unofficial consultations we had with the European Commission, on the third cohesion report which followed and on the interim report on the regulation voted through last summer.
Parliament sent out a double message in all these debates: firstly, that the European Union needed a credible cohesion budget; I think we were one of the powers that overturned efforts by certain parties to limit the budget for the new programming period.
The second message was that we needed an effective regulation without unnecessary red tape and, on the other hand, a regulation which would help to put the money of European citizens to good use.
In January, we started negotiations in order to influence the final outcome, following decisions by the European Council, and to incorporate some of our basic positions.
I would like to highlight the constructive attitude both of the European Commission and of Commissioner HÃŒbner and of the Austrian Presidency in these negotiations and to thank both sides for cooperating with the European Parliament.
Today we are being called upon to say yes or no to the text negotiated.
As rapporteur for the general regulation, I call on my honourable friends here today to accept this text and to say yes for the following basic reasons:
Parliament, during the course of negotiations on the financial perspective, secured an additional EUR 300Â million for transnational and interregional cooperation.
In addition, Parliament managed to link financing for projects to access for people with disabilities.
For the first time, it is stipulated that projects will not be financed unless accessibility to them for people with disabilities is secured first.
We were also successful in getting civil society involved.
Despite the Council's initial resistance, monitoring committees will also be attended by environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and other bodies which represent civil society.
In addition, thanks to lobbying by Parliament, infrastructure in regions which are no longer Objective 1 convergence regions may also be financed with the Commission's approval.
This is something that all these regions have asked for.
We also managed to ensure there is a special article on sustainable development and the environment.
In other words, we achieved what we have for years referred to as the 'greening' of the Structural Funds.
There is a strong legal basis for not causing any further environmental damage via the Structural Funds.
At the same time, we strengthened urban policy.
The Member States are obliged to have more specific forecasts for towns.
This obligation includes submitting a special list of the towns selected in order to address the relevant problems.
We also signed a joint declaration with the Commission on an interim examination of the consequences of decommitting funds on the grounds of the Î+2 or Î+3 rule, because problems may arise as a result of this rule.
Does this mean that we are absolutely satisfied?
To be honest, it does not.
I would refer by way of example to the British Presidency's bonuses, which have somewhat altered the cohesive logic of the regulation.
I would also refer to the fact that we did not manage to get our views across on the so-called performance reserve, with the recycling of appropriations decommitted on the basis of the Î+2 or Î+3 rule.
However, further delay would also mean a delay in starting programmes, which would be a bad thing for the regions and the poorer Member States.
This too is therefore a compelling reason for us to say yes today to this regulation.
Today we are moving from theory to practice.
Even the best regulation, let us be frank, may have problems if it is not applied correctly.
Consequently, the major challenge which we all face, especially the Commission, the Member States and the regions, is to ensure the regulation is now applied correctly.
There are challenges both for the old Member States, which must not repeat past mistakes, and for the new Member States, which must not repeat the mistakes of certain old Member States in connection with the take-up and use of funds.
Parliament will be present throughout this procedure in order to monitor and to call for structural movements for the benefit always of the poorer Member States and regions of the European Union.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, after more than a year, we are coming to the end of an intense piece of work carried out in close cooperation with many of my fellow Members and with representatives from the Council and the Commission, whom I should to thank.
I should also like to thank the Austrian Presidency and I extend my special, heartfelt thanks to Commissioner HÃŒbner, who has always shown herself to be sensitive to Parliamentâs requests and willing to debate and to enter into constructive dialogue, which is the real driving force behind exchanges of opinions between the two institutions.
The European Parliament spoke with one voice at the negotiating table with the Council and the Commission, going beyond political affiliations and countries of origin, and thus succeeded in having a greater impact on the results of the negotiation, helping to significantly improve the initial structure of the provisions.
Although the Council rejected some important suggestions put forward by Parliament, I personally believe that the texts adequately meet the needs of an enlarged Union.
Thanks to the combined efforts of the three institutions, this morningâs vote will mean that Europe has access to new legal instruments that are vital for strengthening solidarity and economic and social cohesion.
With regard to the regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund, for which I am the lead rapporteur, I should like to highlight the importance of the increase in the budget, for which Parliament fought, from EURÂ 18Â billion for the 2000-2006 period to slightly more than EURÂ 61.5Â billionÂ for the next programming period.
This is in response to the recipient Member Statesâ great financial needs in the environmental and transport sectors, with special attention paid to sustainable development, through a form of balanced yet flexible distribution, that is to say, one that is capable of adapting the way in which the Fund is used to meet the needs of each Member State.
Aside from the trans-European networks, it will be possible to use the Cohesion Fund for projects in the transport field, including urban, rail, inland waterway and maritime transport, multimodal programmes and measures that promote sustainable development and that enhance the environmental dimension, with a special focus on the key sectors of energy efficiency and renewable sources.
Parliamentâs incisive work has produced positive results on several points.
I should like to mention just a few of them that concern both the regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund and the general regulation, for which MrÂ Hatzidakis is the rapporteur and I am the shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group.
ArticleÂ 14 of the general regulation includes a specific reference to access for the disabled, which from now on must characterise all of the work financed with Community funds.
We have succeeded in gaining more recognition for environmental protection and sustainable development, as MrÂ Hatzidakis just highlighted.
I am satisfied regarding these two points, although I would have liked a precise reference to have been made in the main body of the regulation on the Cohesion Fund too.
In any case, the reference has been included in the general regulation, and that is already a significant and important result.
Next, with regard to the so-called partnership, there will be greater involvement of bodies representing civil society, non-governmental organisations and associations that campaign for equal rights between women and men, including in terms of cohesion policy.
Finally, as regards the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, for which MrÂ Fava is the rapporteur and I am a shadow rapporteur, I look very positively on the inclusion of the reference to the issue of public security in the context of the convergence objective, as a guarantee against Structural Fund-related expenditure processes being infiltrated by organised crime.
Furthermore, Parliamentâs intervention has meant greater attention being paid to the urban dimension â a topic that MrÂ Beaupuy, myself and so many others among us hold dear â and has emphasised the way in which a sound programme of investment and management of the funds intended for cities can drive the economic and socio-cultural revival of the suburbs and surrounding rural areas, which are the real agents of sustainable and lasting development in the regions.
To conclude, I should like to add to what MrÂ Hatzidakis has said and call on Parliament to support the entire package of regulations under discussion today by voting in favour of it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process leading to the adoption of the new regulation on the European Social Fund is worthy of Parliamentâs support.
At first reading, we tabled 84 amendments to the Commissionâs original proposal.
Of these amendments I should like to highlight one point: the Commissionâs original version established a range of measures that were the target of funding but whose actions varied as to whether the region benefiting from the funding was a convergence objective region or one that came under the competitiveness and employment objective.
I oppose this regional difference in principle, on the grounds that, when it is put into practice, it will lead to the creation of a two-speed European Social Fund, and will enshrine a form of indirect discrimination of workers benefiting from the Fund depending on the region in which they work.
Both the Commission and the Council have accepted my argument.
Other significant amendments on which the Council and the Commission ultimately accepted our proposals concerned the use of money from the European Social Fund to fund the activities of the social partners.
I have always opposed the Commissionâs original proposal and suggested a more flexible yet tighter alternative solution that would earmark a suitable amount of resources from the European Social Fund for measures to strengthen the capacities of the social partners, albeit specifying that these activities must relate to training, network integration measures and stepping up social dialogue.
On this point too, both the Commission and the Council have accepted our point of view.
Following the normal procedure for a second reading of this new regulation, we ran the serious risk of the essential legal bases that would enable the Member States to use the European Social Fund appropriation from 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 not being in place in time.
Realising the importance of this, the Austrian Presidency contacted me to start talks aimed at reducing the time normally taken by the legislative process.
With the invaluable help of the shadow rapporteurs, I was able to analyse the amendments that had not been addressed by the Council, and to table five points that the Council had not accepted at first reading but that we feel are of major importance.
These points were as follows: strengthening the role of social integration, commitment on the part of the Member States to support priority actions, commitment on the part of the Member States to promote measures in the area of innovation, commitment on the part of the Member States to support transnational and inter-regional actions, and making an appropriate amount of money available for the training and networking of the social partners.
I was very gratified to see that the Council agreed with our proposals.
Accordingly, Mr President, and given that the commitment to the Austrian Presidency has been honoured, I wish to recommend the adoption of the common position without any amendment.
Mr President, globalisation and technological and demographic evolution have led to far reaching changes to a number of areas of life in our societies.
The most important political issue going forward is how to decide the direction of these changes and, in this regard, I admit that much of what is contained in this report is the result not only of hard work but also of detailed reflection on values that largely sum up my view of politics as a public service.
When it comes to values, I am among those who believe that the free functioning of the market alone will never be able to promote the essence of the European project, of which I am a staunch advocate, which is based on the values of peace, social justice, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.
I should therefore like you to know that this was a further source of inspiration for the new European Social Fund regulation.
Lastly, I should like to express my gratitude for the excellent spirit of cooperation shown throughout the process and to MrÂ Å pidla, who is in the Chamber today.
I must also express my thanks to the Commissionâs services for their willingness to find solutions that were included in the final version but were not laid down originally.
Finally, I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, MrsÂ Schroedter and MrsÂ Figueiredo, and to express publicly my appreciation for the help of the Vice-President, MrÂ Cocilovo, on this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a journey that began in JulyÂ 2004 with the presentation of the Commission proposals on the new Structural Funds, which, I should like to point out, Parliament has always supported, has sought to improve and has, at any rate, defended by emphasising certain aspects that we regard as important, relating to quality, spending, sustainable development, environmental protection, equal opportunities, access for the disabled, public security and cross-border cooperation.
We have worked alongside the Commission and the Council to ensure that this journey is swiftly concluded, but also, I repeat, to improve some sensitive points that we regard as important in the way in which our regions and our local authorities will use the Structural Funds.
I should like to quickly point out our contribution on some specific points.
Firstly, the consultation procedure: we fought to have the procedure extended and supported and to have it include, alongside institutional and administrative topics, new topics that are of importance on the ground: I am referring to non-governmental organisations and to civil society.
We believe that the consultation procedure is a great school for democracy and, above all, a great resource in terms of responsibility: extending the scope of responsibility in the management of the Structural Funds is one of the major political challenges facing the European Union.
We have focused on equity, that is to say, on the need to prevent a two-speed Europe, which would pave the way for geographically discriminatory measures.
We know that the European cohesion challenge is a difficult one.
Enlargement has widened the gap that exists between various geographical areas of Europe, and we felt it important to bridge that gap and to strike an economic and social balance among all of the countries of the European Union, preventing the risk of a two-speed Europe.
We have concentrated on a number of priorities, adopting the Commissionâs proposal to avoid turning the Structural Funds and the Regional Development Fund, for which I am responsible, into a kind of 'shopping list' that anyone can access on the basis of the most varied of needs.
Instead, we have concentrated on the quality of a few objectives and made sure that quality comes before quantity, and we have done so, too, on the basis of the experience that each of us has committed to memory.
We have held on to the principle of additionality: the Structural Funds are a form of added value, they must not substitute for the current, normal expenditure of the Member States, of the State.
In that sense, we must focus more on quality issues regarding this expenditure, as a form of added value.
Finally, Lisbon: MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon does not only represent a competitive Europe, which is capable of getting its own economy off the ground and of pursuing the objective of full and good-quality employment, but it also represents a Europe that is capable at last of investing in knowledge, in intangible infrastructure, in know-how, in processes and technological innovation, and in everything that is today at the heart of the Structural Funds.
The European Parliamentâs contribution has been a practical one, including on a number of specific points, insofar as it has paid particular attention to environmental issues, to sustainable development, to urban policy, to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy, and to security, too.
We are pleased that a statement has been proposed that includes our request for special attention to be paid to security, aimed at making our European expenditure impenetrable to organised crime.
We are only partly satisfied, MrÂ President, because, as you and all of my fellow Members will know, we do not believe that the budgetary resources are sufficient for the challenge we are facing, in spite of the enlargement and in spite of the proposal by the previous Commission, a proposal that is perhaps more generous and more in keeping with the needs of this enlarged Europe of 25.
I feel it is worth stressing the European Parliament's sense of responsibility yet again, as other Members have done.
It has always tried to cooperate fully and effectively with the other European institutions, has avoided the conciliation procedure and has avoided jeopardising the next programming period.
I should like to thank the European Commission, CommissionerÂ HÃŒbner and the Austrian Presidency.
They have acted in the same spirit of cooperation as we have.
It is now down to our countries to act; we have the appropriate instruments, we ought to be able to make good use of them.
Â Â  . Mr President, the legislative work on the package of regulations on cohesion policy for the years 2007-2013 comes to an end today.
We all remember the heated debate on the role and significance of cohesion policy in the European Union for achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, as well as the attempts to limit cohesion policy gradually, and even to renationalise it.
Today we are discussing these matters as if they were in the past, but it is useful for us at the European Parliament to remember that implementing the principle of solidarity through cohesion policy, amongst others, is an integral part of the functioning of the European Union.
Its form may change, it may be adapted to new objectives, but to undermine it is to negate the basis on which the Community operates.
Implementing cohesion policy, therefore, does not simply imply defining the structure of certain funds and the ways in which they are to be used.
Most of all, it requires a definition of its current goals. This then needs to be followed by steps to adapt the policy methodology and implementation strategies, as well as by practical measures.
In line with the terms of the Treaties, social and economic cohesion policy can be implemented with the aid of common financial resources.
However, it can also be implemented without them, by means of joint activities in various Member States aimed at achieving similar goals.
During the current programming period, joint cross-border activities form part of the Community initiative Interreg.
This initiative encourages border-region, transnational and interregional cooperation.
Experience of Interreg activities shows that cross-border initiatives undertaken jointly by local and regional authorities in several Member States are of great importance to them, as they create cooperation networks and build mutual trust.
We can conclude that these activities, which use up few financial resources, deliver considerable added value.
The new programming period should take advantage of this positive experience.
Initiatives typically associated with Interreg have therefore been included in the main stream of cohesion policy, within the framework of Objective III.
There is also a need to create new legal and organisational opportunities for cooperation partners.
That is also the source of the innovative idea of creating a new legal instrument that would support all border-region, transnational and interregional activities.
The core of this initiative lies in giving cooperation partners, who do not always use EU funds, an instrument which will make it easier for them to organise different activities, including cross-border public services.
In line with the proposed regulation, and once the objectives and principles of cooperation have been established, public authorities and the public bodies created with their assistance within the European Union, in other words regional, local and national authorities, will be able to sign a suitable agreement which is referred to in the regulation as a convention.
They will then be able to register the new institution as European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation.
It will have a legal personality which will be recognised throughout the whole European Union, once all the Member States have been informed.
The new regulation will introduce a new legal precedent.
It deals with system-related issues and has therefore been met with many expressions of alarm, reservations and even protests.
Work on the regulation has been an example of consistent progress towards compromise solutions requiring many concessions and difficult decisions.
It is worth emphasising that the proposed solution guarantees Member States full control over the creation and operation of the EGTC.
The compromise that has been achieved has not changed the essence of the new solution nor its innovative form.
Todayâs vote concludes the legislative work and creates new opportunities.
Most of all, it is a way of expressing our appreciation to all those who have, for many years, been building a truly European, decentralised form of international cooperation.
As a rapporteur from a Member State that joined the European Union during the recent enlargement, I had the opportunity to get to grips with the complexity of the legislative process.
That is why I would particularly like to thank, for their extremely constructive and positive cooperation, Commissioner Danuta HÃŒbner, the representatives of DG REGIO, the representatives of the successive presidencies, especially the Austrian Presidency, the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development, the political advisors and also my collaborators and experts from Poland.
Â Â  It gives me great pleasure to be able to welcome for the first time to this House the Finnish Presidencyâin-Office, represented by MrÂ Manninen, the Finnish Government's Minister for Regional and Municipal Affairs.
Â Â  . Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, it is a great honour to be able to speak here in your Parliament as a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The importance of the occasion is highlighted by the opportunity to participate in the final draft of the package of regulations, which is crucial to the Unionâs coherence and regional development.
The objectives of the Finnish Presidency will be set out by Prime Minster Vanhanen tomorrow.
First, I wish to thank the European Parliament for the very high levels of cooperation it has shown with the Council.
Talks on the cohesion policy regulations have taken two years of hard work on the part of the various institutions.
If Parliamentâs plenary today votes on the package of regulations in accordance with the recommendations of the committees, the reform of the cohesion policy and the implementation of the new programming period can go ahead as planned at the start of 2007.
The European Parliament has had a key part to play in deciding the content of the Unionâs new cohesion policy.
In the various ways in which it has approached the issue, Parliament has particularly stressed the importance of matters which are crucial for the public and civil society, such as partnership, paying attention to environmental values and the participation of disabled people in the implementation of programmes.
It was a precondition for Parliament that the Member States should adhere to consistent practices with regard to the criteria for calculating cofinancing in the Community and management of VAT.
Parliament was also active in establishing the regulations pertaining to European grouping of territorial cooperation.
I have mentioned here only a few examples of matters that Parliament has worked to promote.
Most of the amendments that Parliament has proposed have been taken into consideration in todayâs debate on the regulation proposals.
Besides the adoption of the regulations, we also need Community strategic guidelines on cohesion policy before the legal basis for implementing the programmes is finalised.
The Member States will establish their national strategic frame of reference on the basis of such guidelines, and this will guide the drafting of regional development programmes.
We have proposed an ambitious timetable for the adoption of the guidelines on cohesion policy.
I trust in the willingness of the various parties to cooperate, and I hope that the fruitful patterns of cooperation with the European Parliament will continue.
Parliamentâs Committee on Regional Development completed its report on the strategic guidelines back in May.
Our objective is to establish the Councilâs position some time in July, so that the European Parliament is able to discuss the document right at the start of the autumn parliamentary session.
If all parties commit to a speedy schedule, there is every possibility that the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy will be ready by October.
In such a case, the Commission can adopt the Single Programming Documents so that they can start to be implemented in early 2007.
Having the Community strategic guidelines on the regulations and cohesion come into force will be the most important regional development goal during the Finnish presidency.
The European Parliament has worked with great determination and flexibility in the reform of cohesion policy.
At the same time it has been possible to hold negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement, the regulations and the strategic guidelines.
I would like to thank you for your constructive cooperation.
I wish to say a special thank you to the Committee on Regional Development for its expert approach.
I also wish to thank the preceding presidencies and the Commission and Commissioners for their valuable work in carrying out the cohesion policy reforms.
The Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee are also to be praised in the way they have advanced the cause by raising issues that were close to the regions and the people.
I am certain that the proposed legal basis will provide an excellent starting point for implementing a European cohesion policy which is effective and takes account of the special features of the regions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking you for your continuous support and encouragement and for the role the European Parliament has played in preparing a reform of cohesion policy.
First of all, let me say how much we appreciate your role in securing a significant financial envelope.
Secondly, we appreciate your contribution to setting up a new architecture and also new instruments for this policy.
You have insisted on establishing a more ambitious territorial cooperation objective.
That objective has a considerable and clear European added value, in particular in the context of the enlargement of the European Union.
I am sure that the increase of 4% in the financial resources available for this objective of reinforcing transnational and interregional cooperation, which had suffered the most substantial reductions in the European Council decision of December 2005, will help us to be more efficient and more effective in bringing European regions across the continent together.
In addition, I would like to thank you for your support for developing a unique instrument designed to overcome the problems encountered by Member States, regions and local authorities in undertaking cross-border, transnational or interregional cooperation actions, whether funded by structural funds or not.
For the first time ever, the EU will provide an adequate legal framework for enhanced cross-border, interregional and transnational cooperation.
Thirdly, I appreciate your role in ensuring that cohesion policy will apply to all regions and Member States and that it will contribute to more and better jobs and faster economic growth.
In this context, I am also very happy that you welcomed our efforts to create new supporting instruments such as âJeremyâ and âJessicaâ, which will bring in new partners and expertise from European financial institutions.
That will address genuine market values and make the structural Funds work much harder.
Let me use this opportunity to express my personal thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Andria, MrÂ Silva Peneda, Mr Fava and Mr Olbrycht, and to say how much we appreciated the role Mrs Krehl played as rapporteur for the Financial Perspective and her work on the Community Strategic Guidelines.
Let me also thank Mr Beaupuy, without whose commitment the urban dimension would probably not be so prominent in our new policy.
It was a pleasure to work with Mr Galeote, Chairman of the Committee on Regional Development, whom I thank very much for his commitment.
He always maintained a very constructive and cooperative spirit and we shared the same principles and priorities throughout the negotiations.
Jointly we have managed to avoid a policy based on a system of double standards in the application of the rules on the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT and in the application of the principle of total eligible cost as the basis of co-financing.
We will not have two distinct cohesion policies for Europe, one for the old and one for the new Member States.
That would have been, I believe, at odds with our efforts to produce an efficient and coherent policy, with transparency, with sound financial management and with simplified regulations.
You have shared our insistence on the need to strengthen the partnership principle.
We have jointly reinforced the role of NGOs, local and civil society and the environmental partners in our policy.
With your support we have also strengthened the provisions on non-discrimination and sustainable development.
However, there are a number of items where we failed fully to convince our Member States of their added value.
I am thinking here of the concept of a Community reserve, of our intention to render the urban dimension of our policy mandatory and of Parliamentâs idea of recycling the potentially unspent resources allocated to cohesion policy.
As requested by Parliament, the Commission has prepared a joint declaration in which the Commission commits itself to presenting an assessment of the budgetary execution of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the 2007-2013 programming period, including the consequences of the implementation of the decommitment rule.
Our major concern in the months to come is to ensure that the new, good-quality cohesion programmes will start on time.
Much remains to be done.
We are working with the Finnish Presidency to ensure that the Community strategy guidelines on cohesion can be adopted by the Council after the European Parliament has delivered its opinion.
I understand that we can achieve that at the end of September or early October.
The Member States will then formally present their national strategies concerning how they propose to use cohesion policy, after which we will discuss in detail the operational programmes, with final adoption by the Commission.
In order to save time the Commission has already entered into informal discussions.
We have already received the draft national programmes from 21 Member States.
We are gradually completing the preparation of the new 2007-2013 generation, but we have to think long-term to ensure that cohesion policy will continue to support convergence and the economic and social modernisation of Europe.
The Fourth Cohesion Report â due for publication in spring next year â and the Cohesion Forum to be held at that time will be important steps and will flesh out the ideas for the future.
I look forward to your debate, convinced that your decision today will allow us successfully to finalise preparations for the new generation of our common cohesion policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, just like my fellow Commission Member MrsÂ HÃŒbner, I should like to thank you for your support in recent years.
Today, almost two years after the Commissionâs proposal, you are set to vote on the package of regulations on cohesion.
Thanks to your efforts and support, this is a well-balanced package that represents genuine reform.
The European Social Fund (ESF), which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2007, will retain its role.
It will continue to be an instrument providing direct support to individual citizens and as such a key element in bringing the Union closer to the citizens.
The funds, and in particular the ESF, must also, however, promote the Community's priorities much more clearly than before.
The Commissionâs efforts will be channelled into ensuring that the priorities of financing from the funds and of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy run in tandem.
At a time when there is fresh work to be done in relation to enlargement, demographic change and globalisation, this is of key importance.
In this regard, I should like to highlight the three main elements of the new ESF regulation.
Firstly, we naturally need a strategic approach.
During the programming process, the Commission will come to an agreement with the Member States and the regions on the main priorities and goals, which will be fully compliant with the relaunched Lisbon Strategy.
The second is that the new version clearly calls for resources to be focused on the Community's goals under the European employment strategy, including important goals relating to employment in the areas of social inclusion, education and vocational training.
The concentration of resources is an essential prerequisite for success.
Thirdly, support for human capital will enable the ESF to contribute significantly towards creating a knowledge-based society.
Support for an educated, qualified and adaptable work force, and for innovation, is key if we are to increase employment, productivity at work, growth, social cohesion and social security.
Furthermore, also thanks to Parliament's staunch support, this regulation prioritises improving institutional capacity in the convergence regions and countries eligible for cohesion fund support.
I strongly believe that this priority will play a central role in improving the effective functioning of public administration, thereby raising competitiveness and in turn strengthening the development of sustainable jobs and support for social inclusion.
I should also like to point out that the ESF is also tasked with reducing disparities in terms of employment at national, regional and local levels.
The creation of appropriate qualifications at all of these levels is an integral part of, and contribution towards, the growth and development strategy.
These elements are, of course, mere parts of the whole.
Thanks to Parliament, the wording has been tightened in a number of areas.
The fund will from now on play a key role in equality between men and women and equal opportunities, by means of special projects and the implementation of these principles in all areas of life.
The fund will also support projects aimed specifically at combating discrimination in the work place, which can be linked to the priority of enhancing the social inclusion of disadvantaged citizens, in particular with a view to providing them with sustainable employment.
These practical steps help people to develop socially beneficial measures and show how the Fund leads to the sharing of the values on which the European social model was founded.
The ESF will also provide special support for the social partners in the convergence regions.
Thanks to Parliament, the current wording is totally unambiguous, which is something I welcome.
The active involvement of the social partners is therefore a vital prerequisite for well-balanced, harmonious socio-economic development.
Furthermore, I should like to thank Parliament for its active support in ensuring that special provisions on partnership are contained in the new general regulation.
This is a key principle that applies to all the funds that we are talking about.
This principle enables civil society actors to be involved at every stage, namely social partners, civil society, non-governmental organisations and equal opportunities organisations.
One can therefore conclude that extraordinary results have been achieved.
Accordingly, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs under the chair of Jan Andersson, which has provided the Commission with a great deal of support.
At first reading, it drew up almost 100 amendments to the regulation, most of which were accepted by the Commission.
In this regard, I should like to congratulate the main rapporteur, MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda.
We worked together on achieving a particular outcome, and now I should like to focus on the future.
In the coming months, the Member States will submit their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes to the Commission.
The Member States will thus take important strategic decisions on future investments from public resources.
Most Member States have already made good progress in drawing up these documents.
However, there is a certain aspect that emerges from contact with the Member States that in my view may be cause for concern.
It appears that in a considerable number of Member States, ESF investment in our biggest asset, namely our citizens and their qualifications, could be somewhat lower than it should be.
This is highly important, because the right balance needs to be struck between investment in physical capital and investment in people.
The way in which we now invest in our workers in the form of vocational training so that they can adapt to new challenges, in education for young and old, and in support for the unemployed with the aim of helping them to help themselves, will help shape our future.
This will ultimately have the biggest influence on the wealth and prosperity of our citizens.
The Commission will do all that is necessary to ensure that discussions with the Member States achieve a balanced result in line with the priorities of the Community policies and with the shared interests of Europe's citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should once again like to express my gratitude and appreciation for your support and your successful contribution.
I firmly believe that today we are taking a fresh step forward that will lead to an effective EU cohesion policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, when we prepared the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we tabled 32 recommendations.
In our opinion, we focused mainly on how to take the needs of disabled people into account in terms of implementing projects funded in part by money from the structural funds.
We also called for the broadening of qualification criteria for funding within the framework of âregional competitiveness and employmentâ in terms of the level of education available in a given Member State.
We also called for administrative procedures concerning the use of structural funds to be simplified.
Larger amounts should be paid in advance to the beneficiaries at the start of the implementation process for operational programmes.
The so-called multifunding process should be maintained, which provides opportunities to obtain funding for programmes from more than one fund.
We also proposed small changes to the reporting procedures, as we are convinced that excessive red tape will not aid the efficient use of European funds which are, after all, the basis for development in many regions.
Not all our recommendations have been accepted, of course, but that is the way of parliamentary business and compromise, which are the basis for decisions in a Community as diverse as the European Union.
However, we regard the result of our joint work as positive.
We especially welcome the solutions concerning disabled people, social organisations and NGOs, as well as the extremely sensible proposals on the issue of VAT eligibility for certain activities.
Taking this into account, I support MrÂ Hatzidakisâ motion to vote in favour of the proposed regulation.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like in particular to congratulate the four rapporteurs for the regional Funds, and not merely out of courtesy, but because they have done an excellent job, with tenacity and skill, the result of which has been the incorporation of many amendments into the final text, of which the Council has already expressed its approval.
It has been an honour for me to lead these debates and hence to be a direct witness to that success.
It is a pity that the governments of certain Member States have been intransigent and that the Council has not been able to accept the institutional declaration, which is exclusively intended to open up a debate on the excesses of the cohesion policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the discussions in the Council last December on the financial perspective and now on the Regulations on the funds, we have begun to fear that certain governments wish to call into question the most visible and successful of the European policies: the cohesion policy.
I am convinced that the huge majority of Europeans are in favour of solidarity and that our Parliament, always hand in hand with the European Commission â and I would like in particular to acknowledge the work of Commissioner HÃŒbner â will be the guarantor of this essential pillar of European integration and structuring.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, MrÂ Å pidla, MrÂ Manninen, ladies and gentlemen, today, after months of negotiations and talks, the European Parliament will be adopting the regulations on cohesion policy.
I believe cohesion policy to be one of the most important, one of the most positive and, above all, one of the most visible of the European Unionâs policies.
That means it presents us with an enormous challenge.
The disparities in individual countries have grown larger, and we European politicians have a great responsibility to the people as a result.
People are afraid of losing jobs, and they are afraid of globalisation.
If we are to make the most of the opportunities that globalisation offers Europe, however, we must help the weakest in the new and the old Member States.
At this point, I would also like to underline the social aspects of cohesion policy clearly once again.
We are not making cohesion policy for human capital, as the European jargon has it, but we are making policy for people.
That means we must put people at the centre and hence in fact greatly strengthen the social aspect.
We need well-qualified people.
People must have access to the âLifelong Learningâ Programme.
They must be integrated, they must feel that we are there for them.
I think the European Parliament has been very successful in the negotiations.
As a result, there will be more participation in future.
As a result, Member States will not be treated differently.
Sustainability will be written large for us and not seen as a necessary evil.
The urban dimension has been strengthened, just as Parliament has significantly strengthened territorial cohesion, equality of opportunity and non-discrimination.
That means we can say with a clear conscience that the Lisbon Strategy is at the heart of our cohesion policy and the people of our Union really do have opportunities for the future.
In one thing, sadly, we have not succeeded: we failed to get the necessary resources we proposed; and we have not managed to get recycling, the reuse of unspent resources within cohesion policy.
We do still want to have something to do in the years ahead, however, and that is why we will continue to fight to get it.
MrÂ Manninen, as rapporteur for the strategic guidelines, I and my colleagues will do all that we can to see that we are able to keep to this ambitious timetable and adopt these policies in October.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, MrÂ Å pidla, MrÂ Manninen, ladies and gentlemen, I can testify to the vigour and richness of the exchanges of the last few months and the last two years, which have resulted today in texts that my colleagues and I think and hope will in a moment be adopted by the European Parliament by a very large majority.
I would like to stress that, throughout this debate, my group has given the greatest possible attention to the need for these texts to be effective.
The different speeches that have just been made have made clear the various areas where they need to be just that.
As MrsÂ Krehl has just indicated, the Structural Funds are a testimony of solidarity with the most disadvantaged regions, so that they can attain an average level of prosperity.
As the examples of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and other countries have shown, the development of regions benefiting from the Structural Funds contributes to the development of the European Union as a whole, because of the investments that those regions are able to make.
Today, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, MrÂ Manninen, we are going to move on to the second phase.
After the theoretical phase of drawing up the Structural Funds, we are entering the preparation phase.
Allow me to list three conditions â at an educational level and in terms of providing spurs to action and, if I may say so, tempting incentives - that are necessary if this preparation phase is to succeed.
At an educational level, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, I know that, with your co-workers, you have already organised a number of conferences to raise awareness.
We really must develop this communication strategy, and the document that you have just published takes this approach.
We also have to make good practices very widely known.
The Member States, the regions and the different actors which are in the process of preparing projects must really have a good knowledge of different practices in order to be able to prepare their projects properly.
Secondly, let us learn how to handle the various incentives available to us.
You know - and with good reason - that within the Structural Funds it is possible to have recourse to technical assistance funds.
We have noted in the past that a portion of these funds was not used, or was used badly.
From now until the end of 2006, and throughout 2007, the technical assistance funds must be used in order to prepare worthy projects.
Thirdly, as we say in France, âfear of the policeman is the beginning of wisdomâ.
The various Member States, project organisers and regions, etc. need to be reminded that if they do not comply with the rules laid down in the regulations, then they will not be able to benefit from the Structural Funds.
I regret of course that, as my fellow Members have pointed out, certain Member States have recently refused to recycle funds that cannot be used within the specified periods.
Finally, and to conclude, I cannot but point out, as president of the intergroup, that the European Union has finally recognised the need to bring the Structural Funds into play at the level of towns and regions.
Therein, and within the framework of the Lisbon agreement, lies the assurance of improved success in the years to come.
MrsÂ HÃŒbner, MrÂ Å pidla, MrÂ Manninen, please be assured that, together with our fellow Members of the European Parliament, we shall help to make a success of the Structural Funds, without however relaxing our vigilance.
Â Â  . â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I, too, would like to begin by thanking, on behalf of my group, our fellow Members and in particular the rapporteurs for their close cooperation.
I believe it was crucial that in the negotiations Parliament was united in defending the interests of the regions and the people who live there.
It was above all Parliament that ensured that cohesion is and remains the real objective of the Structural Funds, because anyone who puts economic and social cohesion at risk strikes at the very heart of the European Unionâs ability to integrate.
Enough people have tried.
The Group of Six from the Member States should be mentioned first in this connection.
They ensured that there was a massive cut in the Structural Funds and were therefore the first to call economic and social cohesion into question.
Then the Commission also joined in in a big way.
Commission President Barroso was looking for money to pay for the Lisbon Strategy, so he helped himself from the Structural Funds.
Suddenly, at the end of the negotiations, a list appeared in the documents which tied the Member States down to using the Structural Funds to implement the Lisbon Strategy.
The actual purpose of the Structural Funds, to bring about cohesion between the regions and pursue their sustainable development, suddenly became merely incidental.
I think it is scandalous not only that Parliament was bypassed when the earmarking list was put in the documents without consultation, but also that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, should itself sacrifice economic and social cohesion in violation of those Treaties.
It is therefore a quite particular success on Parliamentâs part that at least the horizontal objective of sustainable development is enshrined in the regulation.
I would also like to draw attention once again to the partnership principle, because it is extremely important that civil society is involved alongside the social partners and that the Member States are required to consult environmental organisations and equal opportunities representatives.
I expect the Commission to monitor that.
Finally, I would like to welcome Commissioner Kallasâ transparency initiative.
He can count on our support.
In future, every Member State will have to disclose who is receiving structural funds and how those decisions are taken.
Â Â  . â Since the outset of negotiations on the Structural Funds for 2007-2013, we have stressed that a properly funded, proactive EU regional policy is a prerequisite for effectively reducing regional imbalances at EU level and for genuine convergence between the Member States.
As regards the Community budget, regional policy should be an instrument of much-needed, fair redistribution, which will at the very least reduce the detrimental impact of the internal market on the economically least-developed countries and regions.
Consequently, we must adopt a critical stance as regards this General Regulation on the Structural Funds, which translates into legislative terms the Interinstitutional Agreement on the amounts, the objectives and the implementation rules of the Structural Funds for 2007-2013.
This Agreement represents a reduction in the Structural Funds from 0.41% of Community GNI in 2000-2006 to 0.37% for 2007-2013, despite the fact that the need for cohesion is all the greater following the enlargement and that, in view of the economic and social disparities, the trend ought to be upward rather than downward.
Therein also lies the reason why, for example, the so-called statistical effect regions, such as the Algarve region of Portugal have not been completely compensated, something that we consider unacceptable.
We also object to aspects such as the subordination of Cohesion Policy to the objectives of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, with the inclusion of the objective of allocating at least 60% of funds in the convergence regions and 75% in the other regions towards funding projects laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.
In other words, cohesion is playing second fiddle to competition.
I should lastly like to lend my backing to MrÂ Henin's remarks about certain cross-border regions, such as Hainaut in France and Belgium, which has differentiated access to the Structural Funds.
This situation must be rectified so that the region can grow harmoniously.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to express my admiration for all the rapporteurs.
This marathon, MrÂ Hatzidakis, has required a lot of effort but has resulted in a reasonable compromise.
The fact that we have managed to achieve a political agreement, which takes into account the majority of reservations expressed by the European Parliament, is a success in itself.
We have to be aware that time passes rapidly and that individual Member States need time to prepare their legislative systems in order to be able to make use of these funds before the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective comes into force.
Member States need to coordinate these activities with their national strategic reference frameworks.
Union resources are used in conjunction with the financial resources of individual Member States themselves, as well as the financial resources of regional and local authorities.
If we take this approach to these funds, we will see that there are many fresh opportunities open to us.
Some compare these opportunities for positive action to the benefits once brought by the Marshall Plan.
This is no exaggeration.
All the Member States are counting on these new opportunities, including those countries which, through no fault of their own, spent many years stagnating behind the Iron Curtain.
These countries include Poland, and its eastern voivodships in particular.
The European Union now needs real internal solidarity.
It needs political, economic, social and territorial cohesion.
We are living in regions that have significantly different levels of development and wealth.
It is worth remembering that around 27% of the population of the European Union, namely 123Â million people, live in areas where the GDP per capita is less than three quarters of the European Union average.
Of course we also need to face the challenges of globalisation, competition, science and technology as well as dealing with the demographic crisis, an ageing population, a growing number of disabled people and immigration.
We have to be sure that appropriate use of these funds will contribute to solving some of these problems.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the need to monitor the legislation adopted and, if necessary, to respond rapidly.
Not one euro should be wasted.
Not a single opportunity should be missed.
This is the best way of bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
Â Â  . â Mr President, todayâs debate sees the end of a 14âmonth-plus process of negotiation on general rules on drawing resources from the funds.
What we have before us is a sensible compromise.
What this means for the new Member States is a reduced need for cofinancing, which has rendered effective drawing of resources from the funds impossible.
For example, this will mean a reduction of 15% for the Czech Republic.
Private resources could become part of cofinancing.
Non-recoverable value added tax will be an eligible cost and the absurd N+2 rule will at least for some time become N+3.
Social housing projects that have a direct bearing on the environment will become an eligible cost for the funds.
This sounds like the standard conditions that the original Members of the European Community made use of for decades.
The ten new Member States, however, were denied them, perhaps in the hope that it would be possible to complicate even further the already difficult process of drawing EU resources, even though these resources formed part of the promise made in the accession conditions negotiations.
Fortunately for the new Member States, it is not only Parliament that is unfairly divided into new and old Member States; this also applies to the Council, which has incorporated this compromise into the new rules.
If, however, we leave the Council solely responsible for drawing up reasonable compromises, we will become a superfluous institution, which will simply take advantage of the voting rights of individual delegations to push through rules that will disintegrate the EU still further.
The long and, here in Parliament, fruitless 14-month negotiation process has only served to demonstrate how matters in the EU would turn out if we adopted the European Constitution with a majority decision, indeed a decision that is valid here.
The majority here in Parliament from the original Member States would impose rules on the weak, the small, the poor and the new.
A decision-making process favouring consensus and veto, leading to reasonable compromises in the Council, would be removed from the equation.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the amendments to the structural funds that the Council adopted in the recent negotiations.
Unlike Parliament, the Council displayed a far higher degree of realism and awareness of the genuine needs of the Member States.
I warmly welcome the fact that the Council intends to pay non-recoverable VAT out of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Similarly, the fact that the ERDF will fund housing expenditure, albeit on a limited basis, is something that I welcome as good news for the citizens.
Thirdly and lastly, and thanks again to the Council unfortunately, there has been a change with regard to automatic decommitment, in other words from the old familiar N+2 rule, to N+3.
The Member States are now in a much better position to realise projects and receive money.
Ladies and gentlemen, the only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council has shown far greater solidarity than Parliament as regards the negotiations on the structural funds.
I strongly believe that we should support the Council position instead of thinking of clever ways of changing the rules and the budget during the funding process.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur I would like to look mainly at the European Regional Development Fund.
At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, appreciably changing the Commission proposal, especially in the areas of strengthening the urban dimension, greater protection for the environment and cultural heritage, non-discrimination and the treatment of persons with disabilities, most of which is also brought out in the Hatzidakis report.
The possibility of using ERDF aid to assist with the construction of social housing was also accepted.
The Common Position, which was unanimously adopted by the Council, is therefore a satisfactory compromise.
The majority of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament were either taken over in full or in part, or the principle of them was accepted.
One of the most important changes, which also reflect the outcome of the December 2005 summit on the Financial Perspective, must surely be the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT where there is private cofinancing.
To avoid double standards â and that is one of Parliamentâs successes â in the coming period this support will apply for all Member States.
My group therefore believes that, in view of the urgency, not only the ERDF Regulation but the whole package of Structural Funds regulations should be adopted as punctually as possible so that there can be no further delay in preparing the operational programmes that are so important for us in the regions and the projects in the regions can begin promptly.
In view of the fact that Parliament has emerged from the negotiations with great success, we recommend acceptance of the Common Position without further amendment.
Â Â  () Mr President, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, MrÂ Å pidla, MrÂ Manninen, fellow Members, let me first of all make a general remark: I would like to draw attention to the splendid spirit that presided over the work of the Committee on Regional Development as it examined the three proposals - which are today being submitted to plenary for the amendment of regulations.
It seems to me that the less than generous nature of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has not prevented us from improving the legislative instruments of this reform â reform that is essential for us, as European Socialists, because it is the expression of solidarity between regions.
Our work has made it possible to emphasise the necessity â as indicated by MrÂ Beaupuy a little while ago of supporting sustainable urban development in our regions.
In this respect it is worth highlighting the increasing concentration of Europeans in cities.
We have also been able better to take into account the particular situation of regions that have experienced the painful reality of this statistic and that will benefit from a transitional support mechanism.
Besides the weakness of the budgetary foundation for this reform, allow me to tell you two disappointing facts.
The first one is only half a disappointment because it concerns the partial eligibility for housing expenses - eligibility that I fought very hard to bring about.
This is cause for celebration, but it is regrettable that eligibility only exists in countries that joined the Union after 1Â May 2004.
This national distinction is, in my view, dangerous. It is also unjustifiable because the housing crisis is very urgent in certain big cities in the other Member States as well.
The second disappointment: I do not understand why there has been a reduction of the period during which a business cannot relocate its activity if it has benefited from Structural Funds.
This period was fixed at seven years by the Commission in its initial proposal and confirmed by the vote of this House, and, in view of recent events, particularly the job losses in Europe caused by relocations, I would ask the Commission to reread the report on relocations, adopted by this House in March.
Â Â  The Regulation on the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation has undergone many amendments in the debates on the package of cohesion legislation.
Understandably, this is a new-generation legal instrument that can support the initiatives for regional crossâborder partnerships that are restricted by the diverse nature of national legislations.
However, the final answer to the question as to whether this is an appropriate way to stimulate geographical cohesion can only be delivered by practical experience.
The answer will depend on the circumstances in the individual countries.
Do they have a central or federal system of government?
Are they large or small?
Have they been involved in partnership over many years or are they only just beginning crossâborder cooperation?
The new groupings introduced by the Regulation will in all probability be built around areas of specific common concern.
Their advantage, in comparison with previous crossâborder partnership arrangements, is that they raise the stakes where the implementation of mandatory legislation is concerned, thereby increasing the degree of responsibility of partnership bodies, and at the same time tightening up the area of financial responsibility for the management of common resources.
We have reason to believe that supplementary budgetary resources will make an important contribution to the territorial cohesion of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the Cohesion Fund is an ideal way of putting across one of the European Unionâs most important basic principles, solidarity between Member States, to people where they are.
I very much welcome the fact that this support is more geared to sustainable development and that sustainable urban transport, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies are considered key sectors.
The crucial thing for me, however, remains how these principles are put into practice.
I am looking very much to the Commission there.
Together with the regional players, we will be looking to see whether the eligible environmental and transport sectors are really balanced, whether projects contravene environmental regulations, whether the Gothenburg objectives are complied with and whether there is genuine participation and not just a formal invitation to the relevant partners when programmes and projects are drawn up.
I welcome the Fava report and the Olbrycht report and thank all the rapporteurs.
I particularly welcome the efforts to strengthen the social and environmental aspects of the regulations.
In dealing with these funds, we have generally fought hard to ensure that the role of NGOs is strengthened and that greater account is taken of the environment and to stress the importance of access for those with disabilities.
In welcoming the report by Mr Olbrycht on cross-border grouping of territorial cooperation, I want to stress that this will be of tremendous benefit to border regions and to divided countries such as my own.
Structural funding should be Community-based and Community-driven, with all sections of the Community fully involved in the process.
In my own constituency, we can learn a lot from how other countries empower local communities and local democratic structures.
I look forward to monitoring the progress of the new cross-border groupings.
In Ireland, they will be particularly important in border counties and in the north-west region, which have experienced deprivation, under-investment and unemployment.
Â Â  May I inform the House that there was not a problem with the interpreters this time.
MrsÂ deÂ BrÃºn began by speaking Irish.
Irish is now an official language.
Yesterday the Praesidium decided that Irish may also be spoken in plenary if prior notice is given.
Â Â  This is definitely an instance where work by, and cooperation between, the Commission, the Presidency and Parliament can be evaluated positively.
Today there is reason to hope that the concerns that protracted discussion of the financial plan would lead to delays in implementing the Structural Funds will prove to have been groundless.
I would like to stress here that it is especially important to adopt the Community Strategic Guidelines on cohesion policy, and also to finish work on state aid, and state and private sector partnership legislation.
I believe that the compromise achieved for the Cohesion Fund and the large ERDF projects during the transition stage, applying the n+3 principle, is insufficient and must be retained beyond 2010 until 2013.
I therefore do not agree with the opinion expressed in Parliamentâs report on the Cohesion Fund regulations that the n+2 principle should be applied to all funds, including the Cohesion Fund.
It must be taken into consideration that the new Member States lack the practical experience and human resources for managing such projects, and therefore the n+2 principle will be difficult to implement.
I support developing closer links between cohesion policy and the Lisbon Strategy.
Both these policies are aimed at increasing economic growth and employment competitiveness.
Â Â  Mr President, the last time I saw a printed copy of the budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 it stood at EUR 336Â billion, with a precise allocation budgeted for each of the 25 Member States plus the next two in the queue, Bulgaria and Romania.
Looking at it from Britainâs point of view, it did not make good reading, so I put the following question to the Committee on Regional Development.
I have carefully studied the budget for 2007-2013, totalling EUR 336 billion, which I call Plan A, and I see that EUR 139 billion of the total is being allocated to eight of the latest new Members and another EUR 22 billion to Bulgaria and Romania, with a meagre EUR 12 billion allocated to Britain during that period.
If Britain should decide to withdraw from the EU and thus cancel its contribution, do you have a Plan B?
There was of course a deathly hush, but such a situation is far from impossible.
When the British public finally realises where all its money is going and when the Health Service in particular is so short of funding, a public call for withdrawal is quite likely.
Â Â  Mr President, the unification process within Europe is far from complete.
Regions of the new Member States will continue to trail behind the âold Unionâ in terms of their levels of economic and social development for many years to come.
At the same time, as the European Union, we have to face the challenges of globalisation.
This is why we urgently need to adapt our policy areas to a changing reality.
I welcome the fact that the European Social Fund, as the Commissioner reminded us, places emphasis on education and on doing away with inequalities in employment.
It has also decided to invest in human resources, providing opportunities for disabled people.
New regulations on funds â and funds have always given citizens grounds for optimism â will show that the Union can function effectively, even without a new Constitution, within the framework of the existing Treaties.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the words of the President of this House, this debate may be prosaic, but it is important, because what we are discussing is more than 35% of the EU's budget, and I think it would have been worthwhile to devote the whole morning to such a subject.
That would also have avoided the situation that some Members find themselves in, of having just one minute to deal with a mission impossible.
I myself have two minutes, and I am grateful to those who allowed me this time.
Regional policy is vital for the new Member States, as we know.
It is also important for the others, but it is now the implementation that counts, as our general rapporteur MrÂ Hadzidakis, and the Commissioner, said just now.
This implementation must, of course, take place, but it need not necessarily be uniform: the regional priorities must be as variable as the barriers to development.
We all subscribe to the Lisbon Strategy, but the means to make it successful â which it has not yet been â can certainly not be uniform over the whole territory.
That is true for all the Member States, not just the newest ones: accessibility for the peripheral regions and the enclaves continues to be a prerequisite for competitiveness and, therefore, for enabling us to get them to meet the EU's general objectives.
That is why a strict application of the earmarking of appropriations, with the associated risk of exacerbating still further the disparities between and within regions, would, in my view, be a mistake.
It is vital for regional policy to be visible to and popular with our fellow citizens, in order to avoid further disappointments when they are asked about the future of the Union: in simple terms, we need them to feel involved in the progress of regional development.
In this regard, we still have much to do.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate today is the culmination of Parliamentâs work on the extremely important issue of cohesion policy, a policy that involves more than EUR 300Â 000Â million, clearly demonstrating that we are talking about one of the European projectâs priorities.
Removing territorial differences, supporting infrastructures and the economic and social development of our peoples and regions have been the basis of this work.
We in Parliament incorporated significant changes into the regulations that implement this policy and that have considerably improved its content in terms of the environment, accessibility for disabled persons and the participation of civil society.
We have recognised the differences between regions within the territory of the European Union: rural regions, urban regions, islands, outermost regions, regions with falling populations, etc. Each of them requires specific initiatives.
We should be pleased about the implementation of a technological fund within the framework of the FEDER, with a view to closing the technological gap, as well as about the âphasing outâ in the Cohesion Fund, in order to move towards convergence, acknowledging that, though it is clear that countries with more needs require privileged treatment, there are other regions and Member States that need to make progress in this direction.
That is sufficient reason to support this policy fully.
That is the only way we can make progress with the idea that more cohesion also means more Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, first I all I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their dedication and commitment.
Indeed, I agree with MrÂ Hatzidakis that they have all run a marathon.
Overall, I must admit to a certain disappointment with the final budget.
It is certainly less than the Commission and Parliament recommended.
I believe that this will have an impact on the convergence objectives of the funds.
As far as Parliamentâs work is concerned, however, I am satisfied.
We have succeeded in obtaining many improvements.
In particular I want to mention partnership, which is crucial because it involves civil society, environmental partners and NGOs working in close cooperation with all the partners.
This is a practical demonstration of how Europe can be brought closer to its citizens by involving citizens in the planning and implementation of the programmes, although I agree with Mrs Kallenbach that this must be real, rather than apparent.
I am also particularly pleased that the funds will support accessibility for people with disabilities and will promote integration of the gender perspective.
This is a practical example of how Article 13 can be translated into action.
Â Â  Mr President, today represents the end of a good piece of work by this Parliament, a good piece of work by the Commission and a rather less good piece of work by the Council, in particular a number of Member States within it â sadly, my own among them.
I assure colleagues that I will not start apologising for the short-sighted mean-spiritedness of the United Kingdom Government, because I have only a minute of speaking time.
This is not the package we wanted, but there is more in it to like than dislike.
The strengthening of the partnership principle continues to need defence.
Statistical effect is of crucial importance to regions across Europe.
Accessibility for disabled people and crucially the abolition of double standards between so-called âoldâ and ânewâ Member States are all to be welcomed.
Europe is not about coal and steel any more; it is not about agriculture and fisheries: it is about solidarity and cohesion, it is about where the EU adds value to regional development across the EU.
This package takes us forward and my group will be supporting it.
Â Â  â Mr President, the structural policy of the European Union, as applied today, has limited results because, basically, it is the expression of the social policy of the economic model of free competition derived from the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.
Enlargement in 2004 brought with it an urgent need to change the current criteria for granting appropriations, in order to take account of the increase in social and economic divergences between the 25 Member States.
Divergences are widening to the point at which the criteria no longer apply to regions which still have the same structural problems.
Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council have not taken any decisive steps in this direction.
Let us not forget that the European Commission of the Europe of the 15 looked mainly to satisfy the wishes of the old Member States when it came to how appropriations were apportioned and how the contributions of each Member State were calculated.
However, the most important issue which the new proposals fail to address is a change in philosophy of the Structural Funds, from their current auxiliary function to a means of really promoting social and economic development, so that they can become real tools for social policy and for rectifying inequalities between countries and regions.
Â Â  Mr President, by taking the floor in the debate on the regulations on structural fund spending, I would like to draw your attention to three serious omissions relating to the matter.
Firstly, the appropriations for commitments under section 1B, namely spending on growth and employment, are over EUR 30Â billion less than was previously proposed.
This must have resulted in significant cuts to the resources for individual countries.
In Polandâs case, these cuts amount to over EUR 3Â billion.
Secondly, the dispute within the Council, which went on for many months, led to a serious delay in the adoption of the Financial Perspective.
This has contributed to the fact that we are only discussing regulations on the structural funds in the second half of 2006.
Thirdly, this delay will mean that the so-called Community strategic support framework will not be drawn up until the autumn of 2006 and the national strategic reference frameworks, prepared by individual Member States, will only be drawn up in 2007.
This situation will mean that the procedures for programming resources from specific funds will be significantly delayed.
Unfortunately, as a result, 2007 will to a large extent be a wasted year from the point of view of making good use of structural funds.
Â Â  â Mr President, all these packages are basically dead letters unless we relax the Maastricht indicators.
The Maastricht indicators are so suffocating, it is as if we were giving a glass of water to a person whose neck we have put in a noose.
My country is the only country in Europe which is under surveillance, something like a monetary fund.
This means that we cannot cofinance the packages in order to get them.
We failed to get one-third of the third package, with the consequence that we are selling assets, property and corporations so that we can exist as a state.
Nor shall we be able to get money from the fourth package, because we are under this surveillance.
Let us relax the Maastricht indicators at long last, so that we can take up the appropriations, so that we can be active as citizens and as states.
It is a gift that is no gift.
At the moment, the sums we failed to get from the third package are equal to half the money which my country spends on education and health.
Improve our standard of living for pity's sake!
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating and tomorrow we will be asked to approve the well-drafted reports on structural funds for the 2007â2013 period.
In this context and as aÂ citizen of Slovakia, a new Member State in the European Union, IÂ realise the great importance of structural assistance given by the economically strong Member States to the new members.
We truly appreciate this assistance to the Slovak Republic: we are grateful for it and feel beholden.
In particular, IÂ am pleased by the fact that the agreement between the European Parliament and Council supports the measures proposed by new Member States, also known as the N+3 rules, which address issues such as VAT and housing.
This is a good and long overdue solution, as evidenced by the fact that all MEPs from the new Member States voted for these proposals during the first reading in this House.
For this reason, the Greensâ report on the general provisions of the Cohesion Fund seems to be a document we would be better off without, and I do not recommend approving it.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European structural policy has a secure perspective for 2007-2013.
At last!
The compromise was a long and tedious process, but the results are plain: the weakest regions will gain from European solidarity.
In the economically stronger regions, we support regional competitiveness.
In the border regions the EUâs emphasis is on supporting cross-border cooperation.
In that way, Europe seeks to help the regions concerned to get to grips with structural change and overcome high unemployment.
That is a challenge, especially when growth rates in many countries are lower than anticipated, and the resources deployed amount to only a few percentage points of the recipient countriesâ gross domestic product.
That is all the more reason why we must now press for European money also to be used in the way Europe requires, not squandered on consumption expenditure, not used to finance windfall gains when businesses move in, and not misused by state or semi-state authorities for other than structural policy purposes.
That is why we need an implementing regulation for the Structural Funds that will create transparency.
We must all know, and we want to know, precisely what European taxpayersâ money is being used for.
Parliament must back the Commission in this sensible initiative, because structural and regional policy can only be successful if we use European money in a controlled and targeted way for the most pressing problems.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Å pidla, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, the fact that the Commission and the Council have accepted most of Parliamentâs amendments on Social Fund reform really shows how well this House has worked.
That we have also in the end reached a good compromise on all the points in dispute also shows how well the Austrian Council Presidency conducted the negotiations.
All 25 states can be well and truly satisfied with the results of this reform.
Initial and further training and retraining in promising occupations will continue to be supported in the future. But support is also given for the first time for finding better ways of reconciling family and working life, because, as we all know, we need to do more than just provide enough crÃšche and after-school care places if we want to get more women into work.
What we need are new ways of working and new forms of support that are quite specifically geared to this.
However, there also needs to be a closer link with European employment strategy, and social exclusion must be curtailed.
In view of the 20Â million unemployed and 68Â million people living in poverty in the European Union as a whole, particular attention will in future also be paid to the integration of socially disadvantaged groups.
The same is true for people with disabilities and now, at the insistence of this House, also for asylum seekers and not only for recognised refugees.
At this point, it should also be pointed out that it will of course in future again also be possible to have projects to combat xenophobia and racism in training establishments and at the workplace.
However, a sound general education is a basic prerequisite for good vocational training, and for that reason money from the Social Fund may now also be used to reform education systems.
And for the new Member States I think it is particularly important that we have included the strengthening of the social dialogue and hence of the social partners.
In future, no one will be able to steal away secretly, experience speaks for itself.
Acceptance has been higher where the social partners have been tangibly involved in the development of employment programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, the legislative reforms pertaining to the Structural Funds have had a satisfactory outcome.
It was not an easy task, as the views and interests of the new and old Member States had to be reconciled.
On the other hand, the needs of the southern and northern regions of the old Member States had to be taken into account.
As the member representing the northernmost country in the committee, I tried to ensure in particular that the sparsely populated regions in the north of Sweden and Finland would achieve an equitable position.
The committee reached a position which supported the idea of drawing a parallel between these northernmost regions and the peripheral regions.
Cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament ensured that a solution on financing would be reached that would safeguard the position of the sparsely populated regions in the subsequent financing period.
In the future we will have to ensure that this support remains as permanent as the natural conditions which are the basis for it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are voting in favour of a further redistribution of the funds, on the basis of recommendations that our rapporteurs have tried to optimise, particularly at a time of budget shortages, regarding the distribution of resources and main aims.
Enlargement means a greater number of less developed regions to support and therefore fewer resources than before for the less developed regions in those countries that joined beforehand.
This must not be underestimated, as often happens.
Despite the partial acceptance of some proposals, the objective of supporting regional policies based on competitiveness, employment, environmental protection and support for the disabled seems sufficiently focused.
The trans-European transport network also remains among the priority actions.
In this connection, I regret to point out that, in relation to my country, it is not at all clear whether the current government will be able to make everyone play from the same score, so as not to exclude Italy from the trans-European transport network; if that were to happen, it would also marginalise Italyâs role in the Mediterranean.
I shall vote in favour of redistributing the funds because, in spite of everything, the regional and social development funds and the cohesion fund still represent an opportunity for Southern Italy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, following the long months of endless negotiations on the financial perspective, we now have a definitive proposal for a regulation on the structural funds.
Even so, one must admit that these documents represent a compromise that emerged with great difficulty though the competing currents of national interests.
I should therefore like to commend the rapporteurs, especially MrÂ Hatzidakis and MrÂ Olbrycht, who led the most difficult part of the discussion, for their efforts, for their helpfulness and for their ability to take on board the interests of all those taking part.
I personally believe that if the people are to identify with the EU, they need to be made fully aware of the contribution in the individual Member States.
The issue of housing is one of the most pressing issues in the pecking order of living needs.
Unless high-quality, safe housing can be delivered, people cannot work properly.
I am therefore pleased that in the framework of negotiations with the Council and the Commission, we were able to push through our amendments relating to the eligibility of spending in the area of social housing renovations.
I also believe it is crucial to pave the way for higher investment in the health system.
The obvious rule that only healthy people can be economically active applies here.
As a former mayor, I also welcome the emphasis placed by the Commission on the urban dimension of structural policy, which is stronger in the new legislation.
Ultimately, these are our cities, and they have a better idea of what activities and projects should be supported for the end usersâ benefit.
I am afraid, however, that the urban dimension and the partnership principle will be upheld only on paper.
In the case of the Czech Republic, I know how unwilling the State is to invite our cities to take decisions on the form that operational programmes will take â and this applies to the regions too.
I therefore believe it would be beneficial for the Commission to analyse the extent to which the urban dimension is achieved in the individual Member States.
Â Â  The dream of Robert Schumann and Jacques Delors is coming true.
The European Union no longer has borders which divide people and nations and cause conflict, presenting an obstacle to trade, as well as political and cultural rapprochement.
Europe's citizens are increasingly able to live within the boundaries of natural regions, which have not been formed through political tyranny and the shifting of borders after wars, but rather as a result of natural and historical development.
In the spirit of subsidiarity, regions often use cross-border cooperation to carry out their normal business.
This is one of the greatest achievements of the EU.
With Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU in 2007 and Croatia joining later, this cross-border cooperation will take on an even greater significance for Hungary.
For Hungarian communities living close to Hungary, but outside its borders, a Hungarian population of several million people who live in Romania, Slovakia and other neighbouring countries, joint developments have a significant impact on the transformation of borders into virtual boundaries.
Joint planning and implementation strengthen their sense of identity, as well as cooperation with peoples who have been coexisting for centuries.
They help dispel prejudices which have been causing ethnic and minority problems for a long time.
The historical regions where the peoples and nations of Central Europe have lived together for centuries are being restored.
Economic necessity is reinforcing cohesion between the nations living in the common European family.
Cross-border cooperation in Europe is a logical and good solution for establishing reasonable cooperation between the multifaceted civil organisations and local authority and government bodies in various locations, and for the extension of the principle of equal opportunities.
I cannot help but support this, and I am pleased that the European Union is providing significant support for it.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted at the presentation of the package of almost EURÂ 308Â billion, which on its own represents more than a quarter of the EU's total budget.
Although some Members of this House find it regrettable that the Council rejected the performance reserve, which would have enabled us to strengthen the economic lever effect, we can say this morning that the reports presented to plenary are satisfactory in that they allow us to move forwards in order to be operational in January 2007.
It is now up to us to ensure that the appropriations are spent as effectively as possible.
It is also up to us to promote the projects that provide the greatest added value, and, in particular, to give them greater transparency in order to show our fellow citizens what Europe is doing for them.
Finally, to conclude, because we have to keep our speeches very brief, may I remind you that, following the long fight over the financial perspective, we now have to win the battle for the EU's own resources.
When we call for more money, it is because many of us are convinced that the Europe we are building is not only a Europe of peace and cohesion following enlargement, but also the most appropriate area today to combat the effects of globalisation, by promoting not only growth but also employment for our fellow European citizens.
Â Â  []Â âŠand thanks to having good rapporteurs, we have managed to catch up.
It now depends on the national governments whether the new regional policy can be launched in 2007. Their job is to make sure that the national development plans are ready and are based on consensus, and, especially in the new Member States, to make up for the lack of progress that we have seen in the past few years.
They have not been successful so far, but they can achieve success now.
I welcome the fact that the series of âChristmas presentsâ given to new Member States â at the time of the Council negotiations in December only for the purpose of acquiring votes â are now being made available to the EU-15 too.
These benefits are now available to all Member States.
I am pleased that Parliament has also found a way to support the systematic regeneration of neighbourhoods inhabited by the less well-off.
In doing so, it has also managed to address the specific situation of the hasty, excessive privatisation of housing in a number of new Member States.
I support all efforts to ensure total transparency.
Where assistance is involved, there is also the risk of corruption.
Openness is particularly important in countries that had been controlled by a single-party system for decades, in order to avoid even the semblance of the governing parties continuing the management and money allocation practices of the previous single party.
Good laws are being drafted, but we must have a mid-cycle review of how successful the cohesion policy is.
If required, we will be ready to make it even better.
Â Â  I would like to join my colleagues too in welcoming the constructive cooperation of the Council and Parliament.
I welcome that within the European Social Fund the Council and Parliament have not just supported efficiency and competitiveness against job creation, but also the inclusion of the vulnerable groups in society.
In fact, competitiveness and social cohesion can only be seen as joint goals, which is why we are Europeans.
This is how we can make sure that the divisions do not split Europe in two â into new and old Member States, as it had been predicted by many â while ensuring that the internal incidences of poverty and lack of prospects disappear within the individual Member States, too.
Based on the framework regulation, we can now ask the question: what would ensure a European quality of life for every European citizen?
I myself will try to help answer this.
Â Â  Mr President, this proposal from the Commission and the Council that we are debating today in this House at second reading is the clear result of our commitment to enlargement of the European Union.
Nevertheless, I can and must express my concern about the fact that the requests from the European Unionâs island regions that their structural problems be recognised have not been included.
These problems result from the island regionsâ geographical, natural and permanent conditions and special characteristics, which slow down their economic development.
Declaration 30 of the Treaty of Amsterdam acknowledged that the structural disadvantages suffered by the islands should be compensated for by means of specific measures in favour of those regions, with a view to integrating them into the internal market under the same conditions as the other European regions, improving their access to continental markets and creating a territorial, sectoral and temporal balance in their economic activity.
Nevertheless, in this case, once again, the specific measures necessary to compensate for the natural, structural, geographical and permanent disadvantages suffered by these island regions have not been taken.
It is precisely the permanent nature of these problems that makes these specific measures necessary in order to alleviate and correct the inevitable extra cost of being islands.
For all of these reasons, Mr President, I wish to condemn the fact that, in the drawing up of the regulations on the Funds, account has not been taken of the need to implement a more intensive cohesion policy in those regions suffering from these natural disadvantages, such as the islands.
This has been done in the case of the outermost regions, which have been granted favourable treatment.
What we are asking for for other island regions, although they are not so far away from continental Europe, are measures similar to those provided for the outermost regions.
We are not talking about granting privileges, but about compensating for the obvious difficulties faced by our islands.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by commending the hard work of our rapporteurs and fellow Members who have made it possible to improve the Commission's proposal from the perspective of partnership, non-discrimination and, above all, balance between the regions of the old and new Member States.
It is, however, regrettable that the sums devoted to this major EU policy do not match our ambitions.
In addition, whilst urban policies have been at the heart of a number of debates, the same has not been true of the rural world, the future of which is now linked to the second pillar of the CAP, even though its appropriations have been drastically cut.
We therefore need to ensure that the Structural Funds mesh well on the ground with the new agricultural Rural Development Fund.
Finally, I find it regrettable that the Council has decided to earmark the appropriations of the regional policy for the Lisbon objectives on a massive scale, and, what is more, that they did not really consult Parliament regarding the classification of the spending.
We must remain vigilant, to ensure that the operational programmes in our regions are sufficiently flexible to take account of structural investments, which are still necessary, and of social solidarity.
Finally, I would remind you that, whilst this reform must, of course, contribute to the objectives of competitiveness, it must, above all, contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with todayâs decision, Europe has decided to invest in a cohesion policy that is rich in prospects, by allocating EURÂ 308Â billion to objectives relating to convergence, social cohesion and the promotion of territorial cohesion.
In the European Union of 25, 123Â million people, equivalent to 27% of the total population, live in regions with a pro capita GDP of less than 75% of the Community average; of these, two-fifths live in regions belonging to the old Member States.
Cohesion policy helps distribute the benefits of European economic development, by anticipating change and helping areas that are in difficulty, often for structural or geographical reasons.
This cohesion policy helps limit the negative effects of globalisation.
One can only support the recent reform of the Structural Funds, those crucial instruments of cohesion policy, because it leads to more efficiency, transparency and accountability.
The management system has been simplified, with the introduction of differentiation and proportionality in the context of sound financial management, in line with the requests for simplification made by the main actors of cohesion policy: the Member States.
The new reform is based on the Lisbon and Gothenburg priorities: employment and research, innovation and sustainable development.
The intention has been to invest in human capital, innovation and the promotion of the knowledge society, entrepreneurship, environmental protection and other areas besides.
There are, in fact, countless new elements, such as the creation of three new objectives: reducing the number of Structural Funds, strengthening the partnership, allocating more financial resources to islands and regions with geographical handicaps and protecting âphasing-outâ regions, which will soon no longer be eligible under the convergence objective.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs debate is the culmination of two yearsâ work on structural fund reform.
Today we can say that, following difficult negotiations concerning the Financial Perspective and the entire legislative package on cohesion policy, we have achieved a good compromise.
For the years 2007 â 2013, nearly 36% of the European Unionâs budget has been earmarked for structural funds.
This, in fact, amounts to EUR 308Â billion.
This figure is smaller than we had hoped, but it does provide a basis for drawing up long-term development plans, something that is particularly important for the poorest regions in Europe.
New regulations will facilitate the pursuing of a simpler cohesion policy that is closer to the citizens and that takes into account the problems of the new Member States in particular. These problems include VAT eligibility criteria, municipal issues, creating equal opportunities for disabled people and taking their needs into account.
Creating territorial cohesion in a European Union where there are great differences in levels of development will not be an easy task.
Although we already have a legal framework and earmarked funds, we still need the wholehearted commitment of our national and local governments in order to make the best use of the unique opportunity we have created together to foster regional development in the EU.
I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs.
This is another considerable step forward in the history of Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, unemployment in the euro zone may well be lower than ever, but it still stands at 8.8%, and it is for that reason that the Structural Funds and the Social Fund need to be put to work to improve the employability of the people of our Europe.
I am grateful for the amendments that have been made and also to the rapporteur, MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda, who has embarked on this debate with a great deal of commitment and energy.
The Social Fund now concentrates on globalisation and on improving peopleâs employability.
It can help with getting them access to work, with the prevention of unemployment, with extending working life and getting more people â women and older people in particular â into working life.
Â Â  Cohesion policy could be a symbol of a European mentality, because it is based on open solidarity extending to every region of Europe, especially if the funds are accompanied by regulations that allow even the poorest regions of Europe to use the development opportunities provided.
Two years ago ten new Member States joined the European Community, typically with poorer regions.
The regions in these countries have followed a different development path to those in our Western Member States.
As a result, they also have different problems which we have had to solve.
Through the work we have done over the past two years, which have included major debates and battles, we have managed to create flexible, effective legislation, which can also resolve the new regions' problems.
We have every reason to celebrate this agreement.
If we win the vote tomorrow we will be able to outline an unprecedented prospect for every region in Europe.
We can create jobs, we can build roads, we can renovate housing.
In fact, we can start building a new Europe, and we can bring Eastern and Western Europe closer together not only politically, but also in terms of the quality of life of our citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, regional policy is second only to the agricultural budgets in constituting the most important European investment in terms of integration and achieving the Lisbon and Gothenbourg objectives.
For example, the funds payable under competition policy in Objective 2 areas, together with the research and development budgets, form the basis for a development of cohesion policy up to 2013, as well, I think, as thereafter.
Although, as we heard today, transparency and the production of results will take centre stage over the coming years, not least in the debate on the mid-term review of 2010, what the European people want is for Europe to become visible and tangible.
This is what Plan D â with D standing for development â is about; it is about more than just the pumping out of money from funds, contrary to what the Member States say as they, meanwhile, collect more money with scarcely any sense of responsibility about it, and the promotion of Europe is not forthcoming.
I have a question for Commissioner HÃŒbner: can she produce additional initiatives on behalf of the public, as regions and cities have just done?
The public and the partners in regional policy ...
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the excellent job which they have done throughout this period.
The cohesion tools, the Structural Funds, are what brings Europe close to the citizens.
It is particularly important that the European Parliament managed, through long and difficult negotiations, to introduce important qualitative changes to the texts of the regulations, changes which will help to improve the quality of life of the citizens and to create actions and plans which will not result in divergence, changes which promote sustainable development and the democratisation of procedures to apply the funds through an enlarged partnership and the participation of representatives of civil society.
At times of crisis and European scepticism, such successes are important and we all need to work not only on promoting them, but also on ensuring they are applied properly.
The new programming period is difficult.
The resources allocated to cohesion are inadequate and inequalities in terms of development are acute.
It is very important, therefore, to have decentralised, flexible procedures with as little red tape as possible which ensure that these resources reach end users in less developed regions in the old and new Member States and are not refunded to the rich countries.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their wide-ranging and creditable contributions. It shows that Parliament has taken a thorough and diverse interest in these matters.
It has been agreeable to note that one broadly unifying factor is the notion that cohesion policy should not be implemented as an end in itself.
Rather, the main aim is to bring about equality between people, for their benefit, and to achieve concrete results.
Another central issue, which I mentioned in my opening address, is partnership and civil society.
A third issue worth mentioning is the environment, sustainable development and security.
All these factors will bring the European Union close to the people, as a means of helping them, and they will be an opportunity for making the relationship between the public and the European Union a closer one.
In addition, I wish to make a brief comment, mainly on two matters: the recycling of unspent resources, and the Lisbon objectives and the Structural Funds.
For the first time, the Council adopted a position on the matter of the recycling of unspent resources when it was negotiating the interinstutional agreement, and that position was a negative one.
Owing to repeated requests to do so by the Committee on Regional Development, the country holding the presidency at the time once again raised the matter for debate by the Councilâs Committee of Permanent Representatives.
This committee at the time rejected the European Parliamentâs proposal almost unanimously.
The delegations also refused to make any statement on the matter.
As I understand it, Parliament and the Commission are to make a joint statement on this issue.
This, I think, is a good way to proceed.
The Council, however, will not be able to agree with the contents of the statement, as there is no genuine desire in the Member States to discuss the recycling of unspent resources midway through the programming period.
The Lisbon objectives for growth, competitiveness, and employment should not, in my opinion, be regarded as opposites within the social and regional dimension.
On the contrary, the Lisbon objectives, once properly implemented, will ensure that special regional features are taken into account and that in the future too, effective cohesion policy will be pursued.
My views on the matter can be debated in greater detail at the meeting of the Committee on Regional Development next Monday in Brussels, which I will be attending.
Finally, may I warmly thank everyone for their high levels of cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to share five brief points with you.
First of all, I would like to say that the process that has brought us to this stage of preparation for the next generation of cohesion policy clearly proves that the Community method works and that the European institutions have the capacity to find the consensus that is needed.
Secondly, what I see today is that we have a policy for the whole territory of the European Union, a policy adapted to the challenges of globalisation, of enlargement, of increased diversity, consistent with the principle of equity, adaptable to very different regional contexts and responding to the needs of territories and cities.
Thirdly, I leave this debate with a full awareness of your preoccupations: those related to specific situations in individual regions, those related to the need for flexibility on various aspects and those related to the links between the Lisbon Agenda and cohesion policy.
We will keep them in mind, both whilst negotiating the programmes and during the implementation process.
Fourthly, I am sure that the Members of the European Parliament will play an active role in promoting this policy in their constituencies, through dialogue with citizens and with all partners.
We very much count on you.
Fifthly, the challenge now is to work towards timely implementation, to reinforce management and financial control structures in the Member States and regions to share experience and the lessons already learned, to maximise the benefits derived from good experience and to eliminate the risk of problems recurring.
We have made this policy a major contributor to Plan D, and we are open to working further with you on it.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I have taken part in your debate with interest and I warmly welcome the emphasis placed on social cohesion.
I feel that the main priority at the moment is to pave the way for the most effective practical implementation of Europeâs structural and cohesion policy.
We must also hold a dialogue with the citizens that is as open as possible, and develop as far-reaching a concept of partnership as possible, which in effect is what has been emphasised and put forward in the proposals.
I feel that once we move to the implementation stage, we will enter the next important phase, namely the preparation of further strategies.
