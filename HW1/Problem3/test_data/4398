As Mrs Thorning-Schmidt pointed out, there is still an unsolved problem in connection with the legislation on asbestos.
This was highlighted at the meeting of the Employment and Social Policy Council of Ministers on 7 March 2002.
The problem is that the ban, which is to be introduced in the EU from 2005, does not apply to the production of asbestos for third countries.
I know that quite a few countries, including Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Finland, wanted the ban to be incorporated into the directive, but unfortunately there was only a minority at the meeting of the Employment and Social Policy Council of Ministers who endorsed that approach.
I also know that the Commission has been reluctant to incorporate a direct ban into the directive itself on the grounds that to do so would not be to follow the normal procedure and might therefore cause legal problems.
That is at any event what I have heard.
If this is the case, I would urge the Commission to find another solution so that we can also obtain a ban on the production of asbestos for sale to third countries.
When our own workers are required to take special precautions, the EU cannot of course defend exports to third countries which do not have the same resources to take their own precautions.
It is, to put it bluntly, immoral, and I quite simply do not understand those Member States who cannot appreciate this.
The EU should naturally cease such production.
Moreover, workers involved in production for third countries would be exposed to asbestos whether the product were sold within or outside the EU.
The EU is already notorious for its ambivalent rules in relation to third countries.
A change to this directive so that it also includes a ban on production for, and exports to, third countries could be a good way to begin changing this state of affairs.
Mr President, it has long been acknowledged that asbestos is likely to cause serious diseases, including various types of cancer.
This material is a danger not only to workers who are exposed to it, but also to public health in general.
The Commission proposal, which is to be praised, and which seeks to amend this directive for the third time, has come about because of the need to strengthen existing orders so as to safeguard the health and safety of workers, especially in sectors where the risks of exposure are today acknowledged to be more dangerous.
The proposal also seeks to ensure greater clarity in the definition of various types of fibre, because many doubts still remain about these and about the risks inherent in the minimum dose of exposure.
The rapporteur, Elisa DamiÃ£o, has adopted a balanced position on a sensitive and highly technical issue, on which I congratulate her.
We can only welcome the emphasis she gives to prevention and to reducing exposure by workers to the minimum, particularly in activities involving the renovation, maintenance, upgrading or demolition of buildings.
However, the measures envisaged for limit-values for exposure appear to be excessive where transite is concerned, since this is a substance that contains only 10% of fibres and, consequently, involves a lower degree of risk.
Professional training provided by employers, improving financing methods for small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed workers, is another much-needed measure and is to be applauded, as is the preservation of registers and medical case-notes for a period of 40 years.
Amending this directive not only provides greater protection and safety for workers, but also avoids imposing unnecessary conditions on employers.
Mr President, as the rapporteur has made quite clear, this directive does not require us to debate the hazardous nature of asbestos but to start from the certainty of that fact.
Although further scientific research is necessary to completely clear up the remaining doubts regarding the risks of asbestos exposure to human health, the number of victims of asbestos-related diseases in Europe is such that the majority of the Member States have implemented the ban on the marketing and use of products containing asbestos.
The problem is now also responding to the shift of asbestos-related risks from one sector to another: from the traditional risks in the production sector - which, although significant, are controllable - to the risks in the sectors in which asbestos has to be handled because removal, maintenance, repair, or demolition work is carried out.
The latter are potentially high, predictable risks, with regard to which it is becoming essential to base proposals squarely on the precautionary principle when setting exposure limits.
Furthermore, the risks posed by asbestos extend beyond the workers directly exposed to it. Others, such as the families of workers and persons living near work sites, may also be at risk, albeit to a much lesser extent, namely the families of workers and persons living near work sites.
Although Italy is fortunate in that its legislation is more advanced than the proposed rules, it is important that we support the rapporteur now and adopt the report, for we need to make it absolutely clear that standards of safety at the workplace cannot be lowered.
We must never forget that a high level of competitiveness is based partly on high quality social conditions and that quality of work is an important production factor.
In conclusion, over and above the general political considerations mentioned, which, as we socialists see it, cannot be ignored, we must remember that the internationalisation of the economic and social costs of occupational diseases, both those already diagnosed and those still to be so, as well as accidents at work, should convince everybody beyond any doubt that high standards of health and safety in the workplace are, in addition to being a right of the workers, also beneficial to the companies themselves and to the economy in general.
Mr President, it should be noted that the Commission has been unable to suggest a maximum limit value on the exposure to chrysotile, mainly because it has been impossible to prove that any deaths have arisen from the use of products containing white asbestos.
Yet this committee knows better.
It thinks that the precautionary principle should apply.
The only way to protect workers is a policy of zero risk.
To demonstrate the absurdity of this stance, you should note that a human being on average breathes in 20,000 white asbestos fibres a day; up to 2 million exist in the lungs of healthy individuals, and they are all from natural sources.
In fact, although occupational exposure to massive levels of white asbestos may pose some risk, as indeed does exposure to any dust at high levels, even the UK's own risk-averse Health and Safety Executive concedes that there is a negligible risk from exposure to products made from white asbestos.
Yet the inclusion of white asbestos in this directive is estimated by none other than our own Trade Union Council to cost GBP 80 billion for the UK alone and up to GBP 500 billion throughout Europe, without possibly saving a single life.
At the very least, therefore, this Parliament should pause for thought and refer this legislation back to a committee for a full evaluation of its costs and consequences.
Mr President, a year ago I visited an asbestos factory in Poland where, during the Communist period, it was known that every fourth employee was affected sooner or later by lung or pleural cancer.
However, the information was classified, and the factory was only closed after the Communist system had collapsed.
There now remains a huge job of cleaning up to be done.
Moreover, former employees are in constant anxiety about whether they will be affected by cancer in the future.
As I see it, there are three flaws in this otherwise excellent report.
First of all, it is proposed that national registers be set up of companies suited to the task of removing asbestos.
It would be much better if such companies were to be issued with certificates of competence that could be referred to when contracts were tendered for.
Registers are bureaucratic and difficult to manage.
Secondly, it is certainly possible to require a reverse burden of proof in the case of suspected asbestos-related illness in the form of asbestosis and mesothelioma but, however, quite impossible when it comes to what may be a link between asbestos and bronchial cancer or cancer of the digestive system.
Once, perhaps, many years have elapsed following exposure to asbestos, it is not possible to weigh up the role of asbestos against that of smoking and other factors which may have contributed to the illness.
On the other hand, the link with asbestosis and mesothelioma is very strong.
Thirdly, I shudder, as a doctor, at the thought of the EU's beginning to lay down criteria for diagnosing illnesses.
We have a worldwide system of diagnosis drawn up by the World Health Organisation, and the World Health Organisation ought also therefore to be responsible for assessing this system.
If the EU is to establish diagnostic criteria, we are entering the area of health care, and the EU would then quite simply lack the power to decide on legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have just heard various positions on asbestos, which is a genuine public health problem, that are all based on the same observation but arrive at different conclusions, namely that asbestos poses a highly significant risk that must not be underestimated, that the data are not conclusive enough, and that we must certainly not risk making companies pay too many charges.
This is not very responsible.
The said conclusions, which underestimate a risk as significant as exposure to asbestos, are clearly to be given as much consideration as the grounds for applying the precautionary principle.
The original Community legislation prioritised this protection within the context of the manufacture and processing of asbestos.
This legislation has borne fruit, but a total ban on production has not yet been implemented in certain countries.
Today, the question of the upkeep and maintenance of asbestos found by chance during building works requires a new framework for intervention and new legislation.
This amendment was necessary but the goals of the directive thus amended are not yet truly equal to the seriousness of the problem.
Mrs DamiÃ£o's report, which has genuinely tried to give workers greater protection, is absolutely remarkable.
However, I would like to highlight two points.
First, the problem of derogations: the proposal for a directive does not meet our expectations on this point, so we shall vote for Amendment No 21, which we consider to be a minimum; second, the question of responsibility: as shown by the latest judgments passed recently by the French courts, the wording of the text must allow the broadest possible responsibilities to be envisaged as the concepts of project managers or site managers are not specific enough to be completely effective.
I would like to end with a clear warning to all those who do not wish to support all the minimum specifications proposed here, and who would therefore be willing to take responsibility for the significant health risks that would affect many workers in Europe.
This underestimation of the risks of exposure to asbestos and failure to apply the precautionary principle, a procedure which may well be costly but is less costly than human life, could lead to considerable responsibilities for employers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, and Mrs DamiÃ£o, to whom many thanks for this very balanced report, I think it was not very easy to develop an approach for the future - which is what your report, my dear Elisa, has nevertheless done - from the many and various national regulatory arrangements in the EU.
It is precisely because asbestos is one of the most hazardous materials to work with that the most harmful types of it have been banned in almost every country in the world.
All the same, we occasionally have to contend with difficulties, and indeed with the dangers being minimised, even on a worldwide scale, as for example at present in the WTO with Canada.
From 2005, there will be a ban in Europe on the use and marketing of all types of asbestos.
That notwithstanding, Commissioner, we see your initiative for reform as necessary, as reform was overdue on specific points and aspects.
I therefore do not understand the position of the PPE-DE Group as just put forward by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
Of course it is sensible to extend protection to users and residents as well as workers.
We all know schools, sports facilities, and even European Union buildings, that have had to be closed due to contamination with asbestos and then laboriously and expensively renovated.
One important new essential is prevention, that is, education about the dangers of asbestos, and the greater responsibility of employers - not only the major employers, but also the small ones, including subcontractors, with atypical employment relationships of course included.
That too I see as being necessary.
Europe should set an example in the development and use of alternative materials.
That, rather than the export of asbestos to the rest of the world, is where our future lies.
Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming and thanking Mr de Miguel, State Secretary for European Affairs of the Spanish presidency.
I would like to thank him for his understanding.
We ran out of time, but sometimes things are very difficult.
I want to congratulate Mrs DamiÃ£o on her excellent report on such a sensitive and technically difficult dossier as asbestos.
In order to complement the prohibition of marketing in the use of asbestos and products containing it, it is necessary to amend and update the provisions of the existing directive in order to focus the preventive measures on today's most exposed workers, namely those carrying out repairs, demolition and maintenance activities.
I would like to congratulate the House on the quality of its amendments.
I very much understand why you so much insist on the need to increase the levels of protection, not only for workers but also for the general population and the environment.
Unfortunately, this is not possible within the scope of Article 137 of the Treaty, which is the basis of this proposal.
I am going to reply to the Members' proposals through my comments and my justification for rejection or approval of the amendments.
The Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 11, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 32, 34 and 39, since they improve on the quality of the text and/or clarify its meaning.
Although I can agree to the ideas behind Amendments Nos 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of legal coherence and legislative technique.
The Commission has to reject Amendment No 16 and the second part of Amendment No 25, because the employers' responsibility is clearly established in the framework of Directive 89/391 and any further qualification would introduce legal uncertainties as regards where this responsibility lies.
As regards the limit value, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 21 and 42, because they would introduce two different limit values, implying different protection levels for workers carrying out different activities.
In addition, the expression of the limit values as a time-weighted average in a period of four hours instead of eight hours has to be rejected because it would create confusion when compared to the same values in international standards which use a reference period of eight hours.
Amendments Nos 5, 10, 27, 38 and 40 cannot be accepted by the Commission because Article 137, on which the proposal for a directive is based, does not allow for the recognition of and financial compensation for occupational diseases and concerns only the protection of workers.
In any case the compensation issue is a subject of subsidiarity.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 30, 33, 35, 36 and 37.
Amendment No 29 cannot be accepted since Directive 89/391 imposes an obligation on the employer to provide adequate training for workers and not merely to make training available.
Amendment No 41, cannot be followed by the Commission because it would introduce, in the case of activities involving sporadic and low-intensity exposures, unnecessary additional bureaucratic burden on enterprises and national administrations without any additional benefit.
Finally, the Commission considers that Amendments Nos 3, 6, the second part of Amendment No 23, Amendments Nos 24, 26 and 28 are already contained in substance in the different articles of the proposal and therefore cannot be accepted.
Before summing up, there is a real political question: will this directive as it stands now prohibit any export to third countries after 2005?
The answer, unfortunately, is clear: no, it cannot.
It is one of the main issues of discussion between the Commission and the Council.
A total ban could be the answer but, in that case - and the Commission has no objections to this approach - you must admit that it is a very complicated problem because in the case of a total ban we must take into account not only the problems of demolition or maintenance - and the workers who are exposed to these activities - but also the fact that there is a list of different products which contain very small amounts of asbestos which is not dangerous, and we must see how we can solve this very complicated internal market problem.

There was a question about the exclusion of asbestos cement.
As my colleague, who is an expert on this issue, tells me there is a real problem with this product so we cannot exclude it.
At least it is not something less dangerous than the others which we exclude.
Finally, to sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 11, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 32, 34 and 39.
It can accept in part Amendments Nos 20, 23 and 25.
It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41 and 42.

It was a very interesting debate and there is no need for me to refer to the substance of the directive because everybody agrees that this is one of the most important directives concerning health and safety in our legislation.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
We are aware that the debate has run over, and apologise. It is unfortunately often the case.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
Mr De Rossa has asked for the floor on a point of order.
I trust he does in fact wish to make a point of order.
You have the floor.
Mr President, you will find that it is a very real point of order.
It relates to question No 33 which I was informed, yesterday, was being removed from the list to be replied to today by the President-in-office.
I protested about this earlier today and Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, has written to Mr Pique I Camps requesting that my question and nine others be restored to the order paper.
What I want to know is whether or not that request has been acceded to before I proceed with what I might like to say.
Could I ask if that is the situation?
Mr De Rossa, honourable Members, without prejudice to any information Mr de Miguel might wish to provide on behalf of the Council, I am bound to explain to you that there is a difference of opinion between Parliament and the Council. It concerns the date and time by which questions should have been submitted in order to receive an answer.
I am simply saying that such a difference of opinion exists.
I am not making a value judgment, just stating facts.
Parliament's deadline is 1 p.m. on 26 April. Council's is 1 p.m. on 25 April.
The situation is that in any case the last ten of the series of questions to be put to the Council would not have been answered orally, because they are at the end.
That being so, the Council may decide to provide a written answer, further to the President's letter. This is what would have happened anyway.
Alternatively, the questions may be transferred to the next part-session. That would be the worst scenario as far as Parliament is concerned.
I trust Parliament and the Council will come to an understanding and the questions will be answered. Let us show some optimism for once.
Should you wish to provide further clarification, Mr de Miguel, you have the floor.
Full understanding between our respective institutions and compliance with existing agreements between us are a prerequisite for Question Time to the Council to be properly conducted.
This particular case concerns deadlines for questions to be submitted. As you already stated, our opinions differ.
Nonetheless, the time available to the Council, though it is the minimum required, is always very limited when it comes to drafting replies and having them approved by the Member States. I cannot provide any replies in Parliament unless they are approved by the Council in advance.
Further, on this occasion normal working time was disrupted by the Easter celebrations.
All the institutions shut down for several days. The Council would like to ensure that there is no repetition of situations such as the one we are confronted with today.
We would therefore appreciate it if both institutions could come to an agreement. It should then be able to avoid similar situations in the future, especially when holiday periods intervene.
At a stage when our Presidency is making an unprecedented effort to achieve interinstitutional understanding - I must stress that there has been nothing like this in the past - I really do not want this matter to be blown up out of all proportion. There is no need to make a mountain out of a molehill.
There simply has not been enough time. There have not been enough hours in the day to produce replies, and there has not been time either to have the replies approved by the Council and by Council delegations.
I suggest we provide written replies.
These questions would anyway have been replied to in writing. Let me remind you that it is almost 6 p.m.
We were already half an hour late starting, so we will not even be able to reply to all the questions agreed to, let alone the additional ones.
I should also like to point out, because I feel it is relevant, that the question Mr De Rossa has particularly in mind relates to Palestine. You will recall that an important debate on the situation in the Middle East took place in the House yesterday afternoon.
There was no reason why Mr De Rossa could not have put his name forward and asked his question yesterday. Both the High Representative and I were present on behalf of the Council, and we would have been delighted to answer it.
I shall give the floor to you all, but I must ask you to?Mr De Rossa, please calm down and resume your seat.
Let me remind you that Members wishing to ask questions should not be prevented from doing so. We have only an hour left, and that ought not to be devoted to a general debate on relations between Parliament and the Council regarding questions.
I shall give you the floor so you can express your opinion briefly.
On the basis of my experience over the years, I do not think the first thirty questions could have been replied to in one and a half hours, even if that time had been available. Consequently they would in any case have been dealt with in writing.
If they do receive written replies, that will be the end of the matter. If they do not, Parliament will invoke the necessary measures to ensure they receive oral replies during the next part-session.
I do however have a lot of faith in interinstitutional dialogue and in precedents where agreements have been reached.
I shall not take up the points made by Mr de Miguel, because I do not wish to start a debate.
Mr De Rossa, do you wish to raise a point of order?
Regarding Palestine, I can tell you straight away that usually, when an issue is debated during a part-session, questions on that issue are withdrawn from Question Time. That decision is taken by the President of Parliament in consultation with his Office.
In this case, the President took the decision to retain these questions.
This does fall within the President's competence, and as President of this sitting, I abide by his decision.
You have the floor, Mr De Rossa.
Mr President, on a point of order, could I assure you that I am very calm, but I am not any less angry for that.
I thank the Minister for his consideration in undertaking to reply to the questions in writing.
I presume this means he will reply in the normal way and within the normal period.
I should like to point out to him that unfortunately I am not the master of whether I get the opportunity to put a question to him, or any other minister in this House, during the course of the debates - it is the group which decides who takes the floor.
If I had had the opportunity yesterday to put these questions, I would have done so.
The reason I am raising the matter here, by way of question, is because the content of my question was not dealt with in your statement yesterday.
You may submit a supplementary question when the time comes for Mr Crowley to ask his.
Mr Crowley has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, it is not actually on my own question but on behalf of Mr Gallagher, whose question is No 10.
He had to leave earlier this afternoon and he forgot to sign a letter asking for me to take his question on his behalf.
He rang me before I came into the Chamber asking me if it would be possible to do that; it is in your hands.
There is no precedent for this if a letter from the Member in question has not been received.
I am sorry to say that the question must therefore lapse.
Nonetheless, as it is part of a joint reply, you may submit a supplementary question if you so wish.
Question Time should now commence, as the President-in-Office of the Council is scheduled to leave at 7 p.m.
Question No 1 by Bernd Posselt (H-0166/02):
Subject: Concept of marriage in the EU
In the Polish Sejm, Joanna Sosnowska of the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) declared that EU standards would be taken into account in tabling a draft law on unmarried couples in long-term relationships.
Are there any EU standards on this subject, or is this not a matter, together with the definition of marriage and the family, for Member States' legislation in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity?
This declaration was made in the Polish Parliament, though the Spanish translation states it was made in a Polish city.
Mr de Miguel has the floor.
I should like to confirm to Mr Posselt that there is no EU definition of a couple.
Further, national legislation provides for the right to marry and start a family and regulates the exercise of such rights. There is no EU definition of a couple, however.
Mr President, thank you for this clarification. I really would like to ask that you reiterate your assurance to us that the Council will make it clear to the Member States that it cannot be acceptable for certain ideological groups to attempt to sell things to them as acquis communautaire when they do not form part of it.
There is an increasing impression in the Member States that regulations would be foisted on the candidate states in the areas of family life, abortion and bioethics with the claim that they are part of the acquis communautaire.
I would like to ask you to confirm unambiguously for the benefit of all the candidate countries that these subject areas are not covered by the acquis communautaire.
This situation seems to be as appropriate as any other for me to reiterate something the Council and certainly the Spanish Presidency have repeated ad nauseam, namely that the Treaties on which the Union is based are attributive in nature.
By definition, the acquis is to be found exclusively in the primary legislation agreed in the treaties, and in secondary legislation which must be based on primary legislation.
As Ferdinand of Aragon, a former King of Spain once said way back in history, whatever is not in writing does not count.
Similarly, anything not contained in primary or secondary legislation is meaningless as far as the Union is concerned.
Question No 2 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0170/02):
Subject: Power of large states in the EU's future: the Blair-SchrÃ¶der document
What is the Council's position on the document signed by the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the German Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der on the power of states, particularly large states, in the EU's future?
Mr President, the joint communication from Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor SchrÃ¶eder refers to a whole raft of measures.
It offers an interpretation of the measures aimed at ensuring optimum results from work in the Councils. It does not refer only to the European Council but also to councils deriving from it.
In addition, it sets out to improve the efficiency of the European Council and other councils, notably the General Affairs Council.
Implementation of the suggestions contained in this communication would not require amendment of the Treaties.
The suggestions largely coincide with the proposals put forward by the High Representative, the Secretary-General of the Council at the Barcelona European Council. These are intended as a contribution to the current debate on improving the working of the Council with a view to preparing it for enlargement.
The honourable Member is doubtless aware that the Seville European Council is to rule on a series of proposals presented by the Secretary-General, the High Representative of the Council, at the Barcelona European Council. These proposals are aimed specifically at improving and making more efficient the work of the European Council and sectoral Councils.
The SchrÃ¶eder-Blair document is therefore just one more contribution to this debate, along with that of Prime Minister Persson of Sweden. The debate is open, and should culminate at the Seville European Council.
The changes it is hoped to introduce will not of course affect the Treaties.
That is solely within the competence of the Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I see that you are not going to give me a straight answer on an issue that the European public has been debating for several weeks, and which concerns a political matter that must now fall within the competence of the Convention, the institution that will be addressing this and other fundamental aspects of the future Constitution of the Union.
My question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is whether or not the issues that are to be addressed at the European Councils will be referred at this historic moment to the competent institution, which is the Convention chaired by Mr Giscard d'Estaing?
It is an extremely serious matter that the Spanish Presidency, which has regrettably said nothing yet about the political future of the Union, is remaining on the sidelines of a debate that deals with an issue to which, furthermore, it is going to be difficult to find any democratic solution that respects national and European diversity except through the existence of a government of the Union and of a European Parliament with full legislative powers.
I repeat what I have said before: first of all, the Council has sovereign powers to equip itself with the means to achieve greater efficacy, greater transparency, greater effectiveness and greater order in its deliberations, provided it does not touch the Treaty provisions.
Nobody, therefore, can stop the Council from adopting internal rules, provided these rules conform to the terms of the Treaties.
I have also said that if, in the end, the European Council considered that some of the Treaty provisions needed amending, they would immediately be referred to the Convention so that it could prepare them for the Intergovernmental Conference.
I should like to repeat to Mr Nogueira that nobody upholds the preservation of the institutional balance in the famous Council-Parliament-Commission institutional triangle more firmly than the Spanish Presidency.
He can therefore rest assured that during the Spanish Presidency there will never be an attempt to upset this balance, nor will the Council adopt any measure affecting primary legislation, because that is solely the competence of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Europe is, after all, about unity in diversity, and so I would like to put the following question. How do you think the right of veto will develop?
This is a major and very important area for the smaller States.
Do you believe - and this also relates to the Convention - that the Council will in future consider the retention of the right of veto in certain areas indispensable?
This is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference, and I hope the Convention will deal with it in preparing the Conference.
Let me say, however, that you are talking of the right of veto and I am talking of unanimous decision-making.
I want to remind you that in the most democratic societies decisions can be made either by simple majority or by qualified majority or by unanimity, and the fact that we have unanimity when making decisions in the Council does not imply the use of a right of veto; it merely means we have to try harder for everyone to agree.
Moreover, you will agree with me that there are still areas subject to Community decision-making which, because they are politically sensitive, require the Council to try hard - as hard as is needed - to unify what we all want.
That is the positive explanation I give for the fact that unanimity still exists in just a very few aspects of decision-making in the Union.
It will continue to exist, provided that it is politically necessary, in order to maintain balances, which I believe are a major fact of life in all the countries that make up the Union.
First of all, I should like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that King Ferdinand of AragÃ³n was not a Spanish king, because Spain did not exist at that time; he was a king of AragÃ³n.
Secondly, I want to point out to him that Ireland's refusal to ratify the Treaty of Nice and Denmark's reluctance in the past are proof that the small Member States are afraid that the large States - the superstates - may impose their own criteria and interests on them.
I should therefore like to ask him if the best solution for the smaller States' fears might not be to grant the European Parliament full legislative competence in all Community and European Union matters, without exception, and to demand the presence of the governments of the historical nations, federal states and constitutional regions in the Councils of Ministers, providing a more balanced position for the Council's decisions, which would not be so centralising but rather more balanced and better distributed from a territorial point of view.
I was not interested in wearying this Parliament with history lessons or particularly in wearying Mr Ortuondo Larrea with some reference showing him he might need to brush up on Spanish history, although I am hardly surprised that he does not know it because he is not interested in doing so.
With regard to his second question, this is a matter for the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference and it is not a subject for debate in Parliament right now.
The Council cannot give an answer.
I should just like to reject the way Mr de Miguel jumped to conclusions saying that I am not interested in knowing Spanish history.
I am interested and I do know it.
I am not going to judge now whether I know it better or worse or the same or more than Mr de Miguel.
I ask the Members and all the institutions that we should focus on the debates before us.
I am going to act as if I were a Finnish President who knew nothing about the history of my country and not intervene in any way.
Question No 3 by Brian Crowley (H-0172/02):
Subject: Peace in the Middle East
Will the Council outline what initiatives it has taken in recent weeks aimed at establishing new contacts with Mr Arafat in the context of the continuing and growing violence in the Middle East, and will it further state what influence the Council can have or intends to use with regard to its relations with Israel in order to halt the rising and alarming number of deaths in the area?
Even though there was a debate on this subject yesterday which lasted more than two hours, I understand this question is being maintained.
I therefore do not mind answering that in its Declaration on 16 March the European Council clearly stated that the bloodshed must stop, that there can be no military solution to the Middle East conflict, and that peace and security can only be achieved through negotiations.
The Council is keeping in constant touch with the two sides and other important players, particularly through the High Representative for the CFSP, who has already visited the region three times this year.
I recall that the President-in-Office of the Council has been twice.
The European Union special representative for the Middle East peace process, Mr Moratinos, is continuing his efforts in the field.
The Council has been working closely with other interested parties, such as the United States, Russia and the United Nations; proof of this is the summit taking place today in Madrid between the four players I have mentioned - the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the Presidency of the European Union.
It has also been in contact with countries in the region.
In addition, it has expressed its support for the recent initiative by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
The Council is delighted that this initiative has been backed by the Arab League Summit in Beirut, which the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union also attended; this was indeed an unprecedented action because never before has a President-in-Office of the Council been invited to take part in a meeting of Arab League Ministers.
I believe, therefore, that all the preconditions for peace have been placed on the table by the European Union, as was made quite clear here in the debate we had yesterday.
Contacts are continuing, and we hope that decisions may come out of today's meeting that will allow us to achieve an immediate ceasefire and start peace talks straight away to re-establish order between Palestine and Israel.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
I know it is difficult to come back to this question again and again.
However, you will see that my question was submitted at the end of February.
Like my colleague, Mr De Rossa, I did not have time to speak in the House yesterday.
There comes a time within a negotiation when the kid gloves must come off, when action must be taken.
The European Union delegation was given a kick in the face by the Israelis by not being allowed to meet with the necessary parties to try to start a dialogue and bring it around.
We have to be more vocal in our support for the right of the Palestinian people to have their own state, whilst at the same time guaranteeing the right of Israel to its security.
None of us could agree with or condone the suicide bombings which have taken place over the last number of weeks.
But likewise it would be wrong of us not to strongly condemn the reactions taken by the Israeli forces.
Until such time as both sides can be brought together to work out a solution then peace will never arrive.
Peace can only be built on parity of esteem, where there is respect for the territorial integrity and the rights of each group.
I urge the President-in-Office of the Council to utilise what are obviously the good offices of the Spanish presidency to bring about that solution.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Crowley for his considerations, with which I agree.
As we debated this subject in depth yesterday and this morning Parliament supported a strong resolution on the subject of the Middle East, I think we should refer to the conclusions we drew jointly from yesterday's debate, which were well reflected in the resolution approved by the House this morning.
Mr President, my question relates to whether or not the Presidency-in-Office has on its agenda the issue of suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel.
There are very clear human rights provisions in that Association Agreement. There are very strong indications that torture is being used against Palestinians - Israeli human rights organisations are reporting that.
If this is true, it is in breach of the Association Agreement.
Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he intends to place this on the agenda and make it clear to the Israeli Government that the Association Agreement can be suspended and that even tougher action, such as a trade embargo, could be put in place if this kind of activity does not stop.
Mr President, I should like to remind the honourable Member that it was only yesterday, right here, during the conclusion of the debate, that I pointed out on behalf of the Presidency that it intended to convene the European Union-Israel Association Council.
With regard to the measures that may derive from our considerations on whether or not it is appropriate to apply or suspend any part of the Agreement, I should like to remind you also that these decisions are made unanimously by the Council and that therefore it will be the Council, in its wisdom, that decides whether the measures you refer to will be adopted.
At the moment I can only tell you what I said yesterday: the Presidency is actively working on convening this Association Council and, if circumstances permit, it might even be able to meet during the next General Affairs Council, to be held in Luxembourg on the 15 and 16 April.
If for procedural reasons it does not happen, we will convene it as soon as possible.
I repeat, however: it is one thing to convene the Association Council and another to adopt measures that have to be approved unanimously.
Mr de Miguel, I am glad to hear you speak again.
I heard you yesterday, when you did indeed announce that the Presidency intends to convene the Council, and today you remind us that the review of the agreement with Israel has to be adopted unanimously.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council this: what is the Spanish Presidency's position?
I will say that, with regard to the Council, the Presidency cannot have a position, although I believe Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez is well aware of the Spanish Government's position on this matter.
I hope, therefore, she will excuse me from having to express it in public, because that would not befit the neutrality that the Presidency must have.
Question No 4 by Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin (H-0174/02):
Subject: Community programme for environmental education
The aim of the Spring Summits is to evaluate the degree of integration of sustainable development in Community policies.
In your priorities for the European Council Presidency you said that education would play a major role.
How do you aim to incorporate the idea of environmental education, not included in the priorities for the 'Spanish Presidency programme: More Europe', in your proposals?
Mr President, I should like to reply to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin that at the moment no proposal has been put to the Council on the idea of environmental education alluded to in her question.
But I should also like to remind her that the subject of education is not something that lies within the competence of the Community, but is the exclusive competence of the Member States. I am very pleased to hear - although I do not know the details, I do know enough to say this - that environmental subjects are already included in primary and secondary teaching and, of course, at university level in most Member States.
As I say, however, this is something that falls to the Member States and is not within the competence of the Community.
The only institution that has the right of initiative to submit proposals is the Commission and, since it has no legal base to make proposals on this, it has not made any.
Mr President, I was half expecting your response as we are well aware that education is the responsibility of the Member States.
The reason I asked this question, however, is precisely because it is really urgent.
You all know that people everywhere are talking of nothing but sustainable development, without knowing exactly what this term means.
We must therefore take action, and I think it would be useful if, at Council and European Union level, an initiative was taken precisely so that we could envisage every pupil, every high school student perhaps, being able to have a lesson on 'sustainable development and the environment' within the European Union.
Although it is not the responsibility of the Member States, I believe there have been other requests on the history of the European Union.
I think this is urgent, as we have been talking about the environment and environmental education for thirty years, and ultimately, this subject is always the responsibility of the Member States or the voluntary sector.
I think it is time, and the matter is urgent now, to implement provisions and practical initiatives.
I do not need to be convinced of the need to introduce an element of universality in education matters at a European level, in both history and the environment, but I repeat what I said a moment ago: in the Union attributions are made only by the Treaties and secondary legislation.
Primary law does not, therefore, recognise this Community competence.
You know that the possibility was raised in Intergovernmental Conferences of amending the articles of the Treaty, and this was rejected by several countries that I am not going to name, but you know which they are.
Therefore, all I can tell you is that the only instrument at a European level that can prick the consciences of the Member States is this Parliament, and so I encourage you to put forward a motion or a parliamentary resolution to get this subject on the table, so it can be a wake-up call for the Member States' governments.
Since there cannot be a common policy and the Commission cannot, therefore, make proposals, let these come from the Union's political body, the European Parliament.
Question No 5 by Francisca Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco (H-0179/02):
Subject: Ratification of the Cotonou Agreement
By 6 March 2002, according to information published by the Council itself, only four of the European Union's Member States (Denmark, Finland, UK and Sweden) had ratified the Cotonou Agreement signed on 23 June 2000.
To date, only Belgium and Italy have begun the relevant ratification procedures; the ratification of the Agreement by the European Community took place on 16 January 2001, after the European Parliament had given its assent.
What are the Council's forecasts for the ratification of the Cotonou Agreement as we approach the second anniversary of its signing?
What action has the Presidency taken or will it take to encourage those Member States which have not yet done so to initiate their respective ratification procedures?
Does the Council not believe that there is a need for a European-level campaign to inform individual citizens and associations of the existence of this agreement, which constitutes the framework for the EU's associative relationship with 77 countries in the developing world?
I should like to confirm that, unfortunately, even though it was signed some time ago, only four Member States have so far ratified the Cotonou Agreement.
In chronological order they are Denmark, United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland.
The Council wishes, however, to correct the statement that only two Member States have begun ratification procedures.
That is not the case: these procedures have been started in all the Member States without exception, and they are even nearing completion in Spain, for instance.
I could almost say it is a matter of days rather than weeks.
The ratification procedures are following their normal course, although it is a long process, and we can expect that, if nothing untoward happens, all the Member States will have ratified the Cotonou Agreement before the end of this year, 2002.
The Presidency of the Council - which has been aware of this situation - has contacted all the Member States of the Union to urge them to push forward and speed up their ratification procedures, and nothing would give us greater satisfaction than to be able to say that by the end of our Presidency the Cotonou Agreement had been ratified.
We must bear in mind that this agreement will come into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the ratification instruments are deposited by the European Union Member States and two thirds - i.e. 51 - of the ACP states, as well as the instrument by which the Community approves the agreement.
As of today, 42 ACP states have deposited their ratification instruments.
I want to take this opportunity to emphasise once again that the Presidency is reminding all the contracting parties to the Cotonou Agreement that full implementation of this agreement is urgent, since it is an essential component of the European Union's foreign cooperation and development policy. I did so myself on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly which took place in Cape Town from 18 to 21 March this year.
This will of course be a priority issue at the meeting of ACP-EU Ministers to be held at Punta Cana -Dominican Republic - on 28 June, during the Spanish Presidency.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, from what you have said today and you also said in Cape Town, I imagine that Spain is about to ratify it.
In any case, given the importance of this Association Agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union, and as two years have now passed since the signing of the Cotonou Agreement, I should like to know whether - apart from what the Member States that have ratified it - only four of them, as the President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out - may be doing - the Council is thinking of organising a campaign to inform our public opinion in Europe, which hardly knows what this Cotonou Association Agreement is about.
The same cannot be said of the ACP countries, 44 of which have ratified it, as he has indicated.
Does the Council intend to make the most of this Presidency and the current situation in the ACP countries to carry out this awareness campaign?
I think you are quite right about this being an opportunity to launch a campaign to make European citizens aware of the importance of this relationship, the longest-standing one that the Union has had with third countries.
It is a commitment that the European Union has to the developing world, a world towards which the countries of Europe hold a special responsibility since most of these ACP countries were once colonised by the former colonial powers, now members of the European Union.
I also think the time is just right.
The Monterey Conference on development funding has taken place, and in Johannesburg there is going to be a world conference on sustainable development in early September, at which development funding and all the actions developed under the Cotonou Agreement will be high on the agenda.
I am, of course, prepared to bring this up with the Commission - with the Commissioner responsible - and to back a campaign to effectively raise European citizens' awareness of the importance of this instrument, which places Europe at the head of development cooperation in the world we live in.
This is particularly important, especially when you take into account the fact that at Monterey we were reminded of the special duty that the more developed countries have to help the less developed ones.
Question No 6 by Richard Corbett (H-0183/02):
Subject: Kashmir
Does the Council agree that recent developments have made it all the more urgent to find a solution to the dispute over Kashmir?
What steps does the EU intend to take to help bring the parties concerned together to negotiate a solution?
The Council is concerned about the recent tensions between India and Pakistan, especially in view of the extent of their military build-up and the nuclear capability of both countries.
It hopes that, as a result of the firm measures taken by Pakistan against the terrorist groups that are based in its territory and operate in India, both countries will be able to resume bilateral talks in the spirit of the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration.
The Council also hopes that these talks will cover all subjects of interest to both parties, including the question of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Council is prepared to assist in the talks, but only if the parties consider it would be useful.
Does the presidency agree that Kashmir is a good example of a conflict allowed to fester for too long?
While our attention is understandably focused elsewhere - such as on the Middle East - we tend to forget that there are very dangerous conflicts going on in other parts of the world and therefore tend to do too little about trying to resolve them?
Is the presidency aware that there are many EU citizens of Kashmiri origin - not least in my own constituency - who are very worried, and increasingly worried, about the wellbeing of their relations?
Does the President-in-Office agree that it is now time to press even harder for the parties concerned to find a negotiated solution?
We should not forget that conflict while our attention is focused elsewhere.
We need to pay more attention to it as a European Union and, if necessary, we offer the European Union's services as a mediator if that would be helpful to those involved.
Mr President, the Presidency is well aware that the Kashmir conflict is one of those conflicts that last or have lasted longer than would be desirable.
Unfortunately, adjustments in the modern society that has emerged on the international scene in the twentieth century have caused flashpoints to develop in various parts of the various continents; it has not been possible to defuse these flashpoints, because they are highly charged both politically and emotionally.
Kashmir evidently does not claim our full attention, but not because it is not a serious problem but precisely because of the praiseworthy efforts made by both India and Pakistan to contain this hotbed, which has been on the brink of sparking off a war that could have had incalculable consequences. This was possible thanks to the spirit of dialogue which still exists between India and Pakistan, despite their many problems.
I think the Council has been extraordinarily appreciative of this spirit of conciliation shown by the Indian Government and the Pakistani Government, particularly over the recent months when very serious events have occurred, with terrorist attacks that could have destabilised the region, which was already unsettled enough with the conflict in Afghanistan.
The Presidency has, of course, been offering both sides its services since the very first day.
I believe Pakistan and India are countries with a high culture and long traditions.
They believe they can solve the conflict by themselves.
If they should need us, you can rest assured that we will be there for them, but for the time being the spirit of dialogue that reigns between the two powers, Pakistan and India, suggests that slowly but surely they have the will to solve this conflict, which is similar to what happened at the time of separation from India, when Pakistan became independent, which sparked off great frustrations.
Question No 6 by Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m (H-0187/02):
Subject: Visitor's visa for leading Taiwanese citizens
Taiwan's democratically elected Liberal President, Chen Shui-bian has been invited to Sweden by a Swedish sister party to take part on a private basis in its hundredth anniversary celebrations.
He is being refused an entry visa on grounds that EU visa rules do not allow the Taiwanese President to enter any EU Member State.
President Chen Shui-bian was also refused a visa to visit Brussels last autumn.
The One China policy is clearly restricting the EU's room for manoeuvre in its relations with Taiwan.
EU Member States have for a long time been testing the limits as regards our diplomatic relations with China and have occasionally managed to stretch those limits.
As recently as autumn 2001, for example, the European Union received the Tibetan leader, Dalai Lama.
Is the Council prepared to review its visa policy towards Taiwan so that the country's democratically elected president can enter the European Union at least for private visits?
Does it consider the policy of allowing the Tibetan leader to visit, but not the democratically elected president of Taiwan, to be consistent?
Council Regulation 539/2001 lays down the list of third countries, identities and territorial authorities not recognised as states, at least by one Member State, whose citizens are required to hold a visa to cross the external borders of the Member States, and Taiwan appears on this list.
It is up to the Member States to adopt decisions regarding the granting or refusal of a visa in individual cases, based on the criteria laid down in the Common Consular Instructions on Visas, when said decision relates to the Schengen acquis.
There is no specific Council decision obliging Member States to refuse a visa to the person you refer to.
The Member States therefore have the power to do so if they so desire.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for that clarification.
We discussed China this morning, and there was a great deal of agreement in the House about how important it is to have dialogue and cooperation where human rights too are concerned.
If I interpret your answer correctly, you are saying that there is no justification for the references to the EU's visa regulations made by the French, Danish and, now most recently, the Swedish Governments when President Chen Shui-bian was refused a visa after he had received an invitation on a private basis.
As I now understand it, there is, then, no decision by EU ministers which must be adhered to in this case. Instead, each country can make its own judgment on the matter.
Do you not think it strange that these judgments are made?
It sends very odd signals to China at a time when we are so anxious to emphasise the dialogue on human rights and to strike the right note in discussing this issue with Taiwan.
I see nothing strange in that, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
What I have to say is that Taiwan poses a political problem that you are aware of - and which, naturally, I am not going to go into - and so the Common Consular Instructions on Visas do not state that visas should be automatically issued to people from Taiwan, especially to someone as significant as the President of the Government.
Nevertheless, any European Union country that itself wants to issue such a visa exclusively for entry into that country may do so, and nobody will stop it.
That, of course, depends on the political considerations of each Member State, and I imagine it does not escape you that there are powerful political grounds and great pressure from China for such visas not to be issued.
As the author is not present, Question No 8 by Mr Van den Bos lapses.

Question No 9 by MarÃ­a RodrÃ­guez Ramos (H-0192/02):
Subject: Action to unblock international adoptions in Romania
Following pressure from various international institutions, the Romanian government decided in June 2001 to suspend international adoptions.
It is now preparing a new adoption law which will reportedly soon be put before the national parliament.
Nonetheless, on 7 December 2001 the Romanian government adopted an 'emergency ordinance' opening the door to the completion of the procedures currently sub judice, thus authorising certain exceptions to the blockage of procedures pending adoption of the new law.
A considerable number of families from the Member States, including 1200 from Spain, had started the procedure for adopting a Romanian child.
In some cases, the Romanian Adoption Committee had gone so far as to assign a child to prospective parents, and the couple concerned had visited Romania to get to know the child - only to be faced with the suspension measure.
These circumstances apply to 17 requests made by Spanish families to whom a child has been assigned by the Romanian government and who have been waiting for confirmation from the Romanian Adoption Committee before they can act within the Romanian legal system.
What action has the Council taken, or what action does it intend to take, vis-Ã -vis the Romanian authorities to ensure that these 17 procedures are completed? What initiatives does the Council intend to promote to ensure that the families whose adoption procedure has been bureaucratically blocked since 2000 are offered a rapid solution to an agonising situation which now has been going on for far too long?
Question No 10 by Pat the Cope Gallagher (H-0219/02):
Subject: International adoptions and Romania
In June 2001 the Romanian Adoption Committee stopped referring children to international adoption foundations and suspended the registration of new foreign families requesting international adoption for at least one year.
Will the Council state what steps it is taking to seek the lifting of the moratorium on international adoptions in Romania, and is it satisfied that enough is being done to integrate childcare policy with other sectoral policies?
Mr President, by chance you were chairing this sitting in March this year.
At this very time and in this sitting I answered a question by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and I spoke plainly and at length on this subject.
The question now asked is identical.
I could refer you to my reply to Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, but I am not going to do so; instead I am going to read out exactly what I replied to him, so that everyone will know that the Council has not in fact changed its mind between March and April:
'The European Union has systematically given priority to the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities within its relations with the candidate countries.
'This issue is a key element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries, in accordance with the political requirements for accession established by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993.
'In the case of Romania, one of the specific areas included in the pre-accession strategy is childcare.
In the Commission's periodic report for 2000 on Romania's progress towards accession, the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the legislation and practice on adoption between different countries, which allow considerations other than the best interests of the child to influence decisions on adoption.
As a result of this, and other expressions of concern, the Romanian Government decided to suspend international adoptions.
In the revised Association for the accession of Romania, adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, amongst the intermediate priorities and objectives, it is stipulated that Romania must maintain the moratorium on international adoption until new legislation is adopted which is compatible with the interests of the children and with Romania's international obligations, and the necessary administrative capacity to apply the new legislation is guaranteed.
As well as maintaining the general moratorium, the Romanian Government adopted measures in December 2001 to allow for the completion of adoption procedures in those cases which were already before the courts at the time of the suspension of international adoptions.
The Presidency of the Council believes that the adoptions of those children whose adoption procedures have already begun in the Member States, with all legal guarantees, should be completed within a reasonable period.?
Actually, the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union - the President of the Spanish Government, Mr Aznar - obtained this commitment when he visited Mr Iliescu and Mr Nastase last November during a tour of capital cities prior to the beginning of the Presidency.
There we were given guarantees that the adoptions were to go ahead and, moreover, that they were going to introduce all the legislation needed.
Thus the Presidency did this before it started its term of office, and now it intends - as was said in the reply - to 'closely monitor the situation in Romania in this regard, especially within the bodies created within the framework of the European Agreement, such as the Association Council and the Association Committee.'
I should point out that this subject was raised at the last meeting of the Association Council, and we have also raised it bilaterally with both the Prime Minister, Mr Nastase, and the Foreign Minister, Mr Geoana.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have, in effect, told us that there is a new piece of legislation, an emergency decree that will allow some formalities to be completed more quickly.
Mr de Miguel, I do not want the Council to change its mind, and I also believe that we need to protect children, but, do you not think that our governments could at least be as effective as their American counterparts?
You are well aware that in February, after a visit from the Romanian President to the United States, and pursuant to this new decree and this new legislation, nineteen children were given up to American families for adoption.
Do you not think that, once this decree is in force and we have removed barriers to adoption, keeping a close eye, of course, on the children involved, but also asking the Romanian Government to ensure equal treatment for European families, the solution lies in properly exerted political pressure?
Do you not think that if Mr Aznar were to include this issue in his agenda once again, if he were to pick up the telephone, if he were to establish political contact at a high level, this issue - which affects at least 17 Spanish families that have already been allocated children - the barriers would be removed, as has been the case for the Americans?
I think it would, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I would ask him to do this.
I can only reiterate that the President-in-Office of the Council indeed took action, which managed to kick-start this issue, before Spain took on the Presidency of the EU.
This issue has been raised again, most recently at the Barcelona European Council. I am not aware of the measures Romania has taken with regard to children given up for adoption to American families, nor do I know the specific details of the adoptions under way in EU Member States.
I would remind you that the Presidency makes no exceptions for nationality - all children in the EU are equal, whether they be Spanish or from any other Member State.
I do not know the numbers of adoptions under way that have been unblocked, but I have the impression that the process is well underway.
In any case, I would like to tell you, Mrs DÃ­ez, that we will naturally spare no effort, and if we need to take further action, we will not hesitate to do so.
I have taken note of what has been said and I will not hesitate to pass these views on to the appropriate person - I will even take the necessary action in this regard myself.
I thank the President-in-Office for his honesty in saying he has given the same reply as he gave last month.
My supplementary question relates in particular to vast evidence that is available to us in Parliament thanks to a report that Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne drew up on behalf of Parliament.
It is in the interests of a lot of children to be given up for adoption because they can have a better chance in life.
In particular there are a number of severely disabled children in orphanages in Romania for whom there are willing host families in European Union countries.
These families are now being prevented from taking what in a lot of cases would be unwanted children in Romania and other countries - in America in particular.
There are host families in the European Union who are willing to take in severely traumatised and disabled children - disabled both physically and mentally - into their own families.
Unfortunately they have been blocked from doing so.
Could not a priority system be put in place with regard to those kind of adoptions?
Mr Crowley, my work takes me frequently to Romania and I have had the opportunity on several occasions to see the wretched and miserable lives led by children who are orphans or who have been separated from their parents in orphanages and children's homes.
I can only agree with you when you say that these children would be much better off living with a family than in a charitable institution, which usually have neither the resources nor the money available to be able to offer these children a decent life.
This issue of adoption, however, is very emotional for Romania and states in a similar situation to it, and, because it is emotional, it is also highly political.
The Romanian Government is not finding it easy to put its house in order where this matter is concerned, because this issue has also been tainted by the unbelievable corruption that has tarnished Romanian public life.
I think that we should give a vote of confidence to the new government put together by Mr Nastase, an honest Prime Minister, which is trying to establish a system free from corruption and based to the greatest possible extent on respect for rights and human rights as it is required to do by the Copenhagen accession criteria for EU candidate countries, and I feel that we need to give Romanian Government the space it needs to be able to reconstruct the adoption system.
This issue, however, which affects many families, is a humanitarian issue.
There is also the problem of families who are still waiting for the children they have already been allocated; we need to take care of this situation and then give the Romanian Government the room for manoeuvre it needs to establish a completely transparent adoption system that allows Romanian children, that have neither family nor fortune, to find a better future with European or American families.
It gives me very great pleasure to thank and support the Council for everything that it has said today on this complicated issue.
I rise because, although the Council position has not altered, the Romanian Government has put in a great deal of work, and I want to commend to the Council the report that came out just a few days ago from the independent group for international adoption analysis, which the Prime Minister commissioned.
The report has now been adopted and will be published and promoted once one or two details have been sorted out.
This new report is very important, in particular for unblocking pipeline cases, which I know will give my good and eminent colleague, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, very great pleasure.
But we need to remember that it is not just families in Spain and North America who are affected by the corruption and child-trafficking to which the Council has referred.
There are many thousands of children in Romania who have families of their own and have become detached from them.
So the whole system has to be refreshed, renewed and looked at, as the Council has said.
It is a very important matter, particularly in regard to severely disabled children, and I feel confident the new report helps on priority as well.
My question to the Council, however, is that I am very concerned at reports, that appear to be very well-founded that the US, stirred perhaps by the emotion that this issue creates, is linking the potential membership of Romania to NATO, which this Parliament 100% supports, with the lifting of the moratorium on inter-country adoption.
Could the Council please state - if it is true - that this is a most improper way to behave?
My reply is going to be very succinct, because I do not wish to continue discussing this issue.
Baroness Nicholson has made a very significant contribution to relations between the European Union and Romania in her report, of which we are all aware and, with which the Romanians are, of course, even more familiar than we are.
I think she knows that many of these issues are in the process of being resolved and I do not think it is an appropriate time to continue speculating on matters of adoption in Romania.
Mr President, my question will be very brief.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether, according to his information, there used to be around 3 500 international adoptions every year in Romania, and the same number of children living in orphanages?
If there are now at least 50 000 children in orphanages, we will not be able to resolve this problem using this system. Is the Romanian Government truly exempt, because of its duty to eradicate corruption, from a basic principle of the European Union, which is the non-retroactivity of current laws, under which adoptions have hitherto been processed?
To tell the truth, I am not able to give any precise details on the number of children in Romanian orphanages.
It goes without saying, however, that there are tens of thousands.
I also agree that one way - a humane way - of providing some kind of future for these unfortunate children would be to speed up the adoption procedure.
However, I also said that I believe this is a serious political problem for the new Romanian Government, which is dogged by what has happened in the past.
This government is taking great steps to produce legislation on and to put some kind of order into this issue of adoption which, I might add, is extraordinarily sensitive inasmuch as it affects the whole of Romanian society.
Therefore, I think that we must be prepared to give this government the benefit of the doubt and have faith that Mr Nastase and his government will implement this new legislation and be able to re-establish the pace of adoptions that existed before.
The principle of retroactivity is one option for the Romanian Government, which can, if it wants, apply the old legislation, or wait to apply the new legislation.
In any event, we have already reached the compromise that children allocated under the old legislation will be delivered to the corresponding families, and this is what is actually happening at the moment.
Question No 11 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0193/02):
Subject: Extension of scope of SIS 2
The Council is considering a proposal to extend the recording of details in the SIS 2 register to include 'troublemakers', for instance football hooligans or violent demonstrators.
Does the Council intend to make it possible to record in the SIS register details of demonstrators who have not committed any offence, too?
Mr President, the question refers to the Belgian proposal to include details of persons known to have committed certain public order offences, who could become troublemakers in certain circumstances, such as at sporting, social or cultural events, or any kind of demonstration, in the SIS (Schengen Information System) register.
The intention was to match this information with descriptions provided under Article 99 of the Schengen Agreement, but with a different aim: that is to say, to actually prevent these people participating in certain events, instead of implementing specific or one-off surveillance operations, as has been the case recently.
Ministers debated this proposal at the meeting of the Joint Committee on 7 December 2001.
There were differences of opinion and some delegations firmly opposed to the proposal.
Consequently, no detailed examination of the proposal by experts was carried out nor were the possible conditions for the introduction of this information on particular individuals made clear in case it was agreed that these measures would be introduced.
Therefore, at this time, a definitive answer to the question cannot be given but, taking account of current opinions, it does not seem likely that this proposal will prosper in the near future and even less likely that it could affect persons who have not committed any crime.
For your information, the Council would like to point out that there is a draft Council Decision concerning security at international football matches.
In the aforementioned draft decision, the exchange of police information between national football information points is anticipated but not the use of the SIS for this purpose.
I would thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer.
My question now is about whether this proposal will be debated again by one working party or another or in the Council of Ministers.
Has it been included on the agenda for forthcoming meetings?
I should also like to emphasise that this is an important legal rights issue.
It is about possibly restricting fundamental human rights: the right to travel and the right to express one's opinion by taking part in a demonstration.
There need to be very strong reasons for imposing any such restrictions.
An absolute condition must be the existence of a judgment so that it is not done merely on the grounds of, for example, a political suspicion.
I am pleased with the Council's answer, to the effect that it does not see it as possible in practice to include people not convicted of crimes in such a register and that it considers it unlikely that such a decision would be made.
I think I have been explicit enough, Mr SjÃ¶stedt.
The Council has not been receptive to this idea of adding to the SIS lists of persons known solely for their slightly unusual activities at particular events, because this would give rise to an absolutely intolerable surveillance of persons who have committed no crime.
The SIS is only used to compile lists of criminals.
In cases where public order issues are expected to arise, such as at sporting or political events, or demonstrations, as has been the case in the past, the discreet surveillance of individuals entering a country and of borders is far more effective than compiling such lists which are not only odious, but run counter to our civic tradition as a whole.
I would like to remind you that the last occasion when discreet surveillance was used was the Barcelona Council, to prevent the streets of Barcelona from being turned into some sort of battleground, as happened in Genoa. The temporary suspension of the Schengen Agreement allowed the Spanish police to stop several troublemakers at the border, who were carrying clubs and baseball bats with which to break shop windows, for example.
More than 2 000 implements were confiscated.
Everyone was allowed to cross the border, except those carrying objects with the aim of causing destruction.
Such controls are surely more effective than the publication of a list of persons that have theoretically committed no crime and who, therefore, have absolutely no reason to be classified.
Mr President, this is not really a question, but I shall willingly respond to your suggestion that, in effect, neither controls, whether discrete or not, nor the SIS lists can prevent unfortunate acts from taking place at public demonstrations.
I believe that the Spanish Presidency can pride itself on the fact that absolutely no violent acts were committed in Barcelona, against goods, property, persons or against demonstrators, because the police as expected - carried out their task of control and surveillance with sufficient respect for the people demonstrating, always attempting to separate troublemakers from peaceful demonstrators.
It should be remembered that the Barcelona demonstration was an extraordinary display of civic unity and that for a demonstration of such size to be free from violence is quite unprecedented.
Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the best way of preventing these occurrences from taking place is to carry out effective surveillance and to have a police force that knows how to operate effectively, as was the case at the Barcelona European Council.
As the time allocated to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 12 to 40 will be answered in writing.
Mr President, I have attended Question Time in this Parliament on many occasions and my personal view is that, when compared with others, Mr de Miguel is guilty of parliamentary filibustering, because he speaks very slowly, but more than anything, he also reads very slowly, which is even more astounding.
I understand the Spanish language very well, and I see this approach as a kind of parliamentary nit-picking, designed to all but bring the debate to a halt.
I believe that if we were to carry out a comparative phonetic, phonological and time study, we would see that there have been Presidents-in-Office of the Council whose participation in these debates has been magnificent, and who have devoted a great deal of time to their explanations, but unfortunately, this is not the case here.
I believe there to be a certain amount of political filibustering at play here, in deliberately slowing things down, so there is not enough time to answer all the questions.
For this reason I would ask the Presidency to study this issue to see if it would be appropriate to give Mr de Miguel some advice on this matter.
Mrs Izquierdo, I can tell you that my perception of this matter does not coincide with your own, very personal, opinion.
This is not a point of order.
You have every right to express your views in writing, but I can tell you that the Presidency has absolutely no intention of carrying out any phonological or time study and believes that Mr de Miguel answers questions as he is supposed to.
Sometimes Members of this House like this arrangement and on other occasions they do not, Mrs Izquierdo.
I do not think this is too hard to understand.
If Mr de Miguel would like to answer, since this matter concerns him, he has the floor.
I think that this remark stretches courtesy to its very limits, and even more so today, since Parliament kept me waiting for half an hour before starting Question Time because of another debate.
I did not reproach Parliament for this delay in the debate because this seems to be a completely normal occurrence.
I find it absolutely incredible that someone in this House should accuse me of wasting time when answering questions when it is Parliament itself that has kept me waiting for half an hour.
Mrs Izquierdo should be aware of this.
Furthermore, this is not the first time I have spoken in a parliament - this not even the first time I have spoken in this one - and nobody has ever accused me of filibustering.
In fact, the opposite is the case. I believe I read with sufficient speed and talk quickly enough for no one to accuse me of such things.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to formally protest at these comments, which I think are bordering on out and out rudeness, to put it very mildly.
Mr de Miguel, I would like to apologise for the late start to Question Time.
I am sure you are aware that this delay is not the fault of the President of a particular sitting, because the debate running beforehand has to come to an end.
I have already made it perfectly clear that the Presidency does not agree with any of the comments made by Mrs Izquierdo.
We have no intention of stirring up trouble between Parliament and the Council, because this would be pointless.
I personally, as President of this sitting, am very satisfied with your answers, with the pace at which you give your answers, and with your cooperation with Parliament.
Having established that, we, or rather the Members of this House, are free to criticise the type of answers given as they see fit and as takes place in parliaments worldwide.
I am sure that Mrs Izquierdo will at some point come to share this view, even if she does not right now.
However, the Presidency is absolutely convinced of the President-in-Office of the Council's dedication in coming here this evening, and he has done exactly what you have asked of him, if not more.
With the utmost courtesy, then, I would like to thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for coming to Parliament to speak to us today.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0020/2002) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the Parliament on implementation of the risk capital action plan (RCAP) [COM(2001)605 - C5-0015/2002 - 2001/2213(CNS)].
Mr President, it is because the Lisbon Summit first of all set its sights on making Europe the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 that we actually have the risk capital action plan we have today.
It was optimistic of governments to set this target, but not unrealistic, given that it is within their grasp to achieve it.
A stimulating framework is required for us to promote high-growth industries such as information and biotechnologies and from that the jobs that must come.
SMEs are a part of that process and that is what this is about: attracting finance to try to generate those businesses.
Why do we need the risk capital action plan?
If we make a comparison of Europe and the US in the areas of business generation and equity financing, particularly amongst small businesses, then venture capital activity demonstrates a huge gap in Europe's readiness to compete.
A framework has had to be established in order for us to plot Europe's future.
To begin with, and the Commission has done this fairly well - after prompting by Parliament - key barriers had to be removed and benchmarks set for their removal.
The framework for these benchmarks has now been identified.
The first is market fragmentation.
How do companies actually raise debt and equity finance across the European Union?
There are varied and contrasting pictures across the 15 Member States.
There are can best be described on one side as nascent markets, and on the other, rather more sophisticated and developed approaches.
Commercial bank loans are how many small- to medium-sized businesses attract finance.
This is wholly appropriate in some circumstances; but new and exciting projects or spin-offs are not necessarily so appropriate for bank loans.
In areas where risk is likely to be a considerable feature of the exchange, dotcoms for example, commercial banking may be deemed inappropriate and unworkable.
Alternative processes are then required - business angels or groups of investors, private investors - bringing together people with ideas on one side and money on the other.
At the institutional level, there is the possibility of quotation on the AIMS market in the UK, for example, and perhaps even the idea of using pension funds to allow for higher growth returns rather than with bonds and blue chip equities.
Given the pursuit of those higher returns for potential new and growing firms, it is not perhaps surprising to learn that an entire industry has sprung up in this field.
Similarly, the careful approach of these investors, with their application of the principle of due diligence, means that spontaneity is not a part of the risk equation, as one might have first imagined.
If the EU wants a place in the "premier division" of industrial growth and competition, then funding the industries of tomorrow is of vital importance.
This is the stark reality of a market which is held back, not just by the slow evolution of debt-raising, but also by the nature of the institutional and regulatory barriers which fence in any further development across the European Union.
Let us have a look at some of those barriers.
On the administrative side, it is nice to see that the administrative formalities for forming a company have now acquired the cornerstone of the company statute.
This permits the kind of progress we hope to see.
I note also that in January 2002 the Directorate-General for Enterprises started to work on benchmarking the administration of business start-ups.
The cost of starting up a business varies across the European Union and there is some progress.
But look at some of the licensing issues.
Look at some of the other issues which hold companies back.
It is important to make distinctions, and here we see companies in the areas of hi-tech, drugs, and biotechnology being made to jump through hoops which may have to be reconsidered.
We have to look at just how these businesses fare.
We do not just need to look at start-ups - businesses grow, they develop or they are bought out.
So, for any practical observation, we need to consider just what kind of businesses we are looking at for risk capital.
Even now buy-outs - and management buy-outs in particular - are the single largest category of acting in venture capital.
Clearing the path of regulatory barriers means introducing new directives.
There they bind together the approaches necessary for a single market to emerge.
Recently the prospectuses directive was adopted and now - I believe, because of the activities of this Parliament - protects small- to medium-sized businesses from the bureaucratic requirements of continual registration or the dangers that threatened their ability to have access to funding.
The issues of the prospectuses directive which Parliament had to address could have been avoided if there had been sufficient cross-referencing with the risk capital action plan in the first place.
Let me also just mention pensions and the need for us to have a good quality directive on pensions - one that avoids the prudential plus approach.
That approach, would actually reduce the prospects of any kind of funding from the pensions industry - an industry which, in the US is a major source of small business investment.
If that prudential plus approach is used, then we may as well not have a pensions directive in Europe.
The financial services action plan itself gathers together many of the directives necessary for completion of the risk capital action plan, including most of what I have already mentioned.
But now that the Lamfalussy issue is practically resolved, progress will be assured, leaving the regulatory framework requirement for the risk capital action plan well within our sights.
The impact of small- to medium-sized businesses has long been an issue raised by many parliamentarians who want to see nothing but the most positive advantages passed on to companies.
The Commission's benchmarking of its achievements in these areas has given the European Parliament and the Council the tool to measure Europe's progress.
So far that progress has been good, if a little slow.
There are other areas which have been mentioned, such as taxation, double taxation of venture capital or capital gains tax, tax arrangements for new firms and comparative tax rates with less risky forms of capital.
These have been taken up by a number of Member States but some backbone still needs to be put into these issues.
Also, in terms of human resources, we have to have the kind of training or advice that is necessary to help these businesses flourish in the first place: life-long learning and initiatives in vocational qualifications can seen as the start of the spread of best practice, as is the introduction of business mentors in certain countries and developments in school curricula.
The high-tech small businesses which, in the end, are the target of the risk capital action plan, are in short supply themselves.
The Lisbon Summit of 1997 threw down the gauntlet of the risk capital action plan for Europe to pick up.
The expectation is to reach completion by 2005 in terms of a regulatory framework and 2010 for the knowledge-based economy.
The risk capital action plan is not in itself a master plan for increased growth or job creation, but it is the essential framework.
Progress has been made but it is quite slow.
Mr President, I should like to begin by making two declarations of interest.
The first is that I represent Wales in the European Parliament.
Members may know that the risk capital action plan was first adopted at the Cardiff Summit, the capital city of Wales and also the city in which I live.
However, a rather more direct financial interest is that I am a director of the National Farmers' Union Mutual Insurance Company in the UK, one of the UK's top ten insurance companies.
I should mention that because some of my remarks will touch upon issues that are relevant in the insurance sector.
I congratulate Mr Skinner for the work he has done on this report.
It is traditional to say that but, in this instance, I really do value the hard work and commitment that he has given.
He is a somewhat solitary figure on that particular side of the House in terms of the need to ensure that we develop the interests of business.
Nonetheless, his is a voice that we welcome.
His report is one that we welcome.
My colleagues and I in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have made some variations to the report which make it even more acceptable.
This report is set within the context - I believe - of some of the failures of the venture capital industry.
There have been such failures.
The venture capital industry has been too focused on areas where there is already significant financial activity.
That is why it is necessary for there to be some guidance in relation to the state aid rules.
But I should like to caution Parliament in the light of some of my own experience of the history of the failure of government-sponsored forays into the whole venture capital area.
First of all, people imagine that if there is some government-sponsored capital scheme it is bound to mean a guarantee of financial support.
Secondly, what are the judgments as to which investments should be backed and which should not?
Who is making those judgments?
Thirdly, the effect that there can sometimes be in distorting markets and actually driving good competitors out of business.
These are some of the cautions there may be.
The report we are considering here gets this balance right but we still need to get away from the idea that government, in some sense, can resolve all of these issues.
It is important that we deal with the promotion of entrepreneurship.
We give too much lip service to this without effectively putting it into operation.
In my own country we have Objective I status but getting the people who are involved in putting that plan into operation to recognise the importance of entrepreneurship is very difficult.
Very often we have local and regional administrations run by the public sector who just regard this as yet another income stream.
So there must be guidance in those areas as well.
Finally, I want to make a point about the sources for raising funds.
They are pension funds, banks and insurance companies.
That is something that is recognised by the Commission and Mr Skinner as well.
In this House we have to get away from demonising these organisations.
These organisations are the ones that we look to for the funding to create the dynamic economy that we want to develop in Europe.
There will be two benefits: we will create new businesses and employment opportunities and we will, at the same time, be funding, very often, income for retirement for European citizens.
As a result of that we will be creating a virtuous circle of investment.
That is a message that is not heard often enough in this Chamber.
Mr President, without any sense of parliamentary obligation, I shall begin by welcoming Peter Skinner and praise him for the quality and depth of his report which, in fact, obviates the need for me to make specific points on the subject, since he deals with them very well in his report.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe's economic recovery, which is absolutely crucial to the Union's achieving all its political objectives, must depend more on the quality of the policies themselves than on the result of favourable boosts that it receives through recovery in other economic areas.
In Lisbon, in 2000, the Union defined the clear and crucial objective of making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
Achieving this objective involves, on the one hand, taking full advantage of all the potential arising from the expansion of the information and knowledge-based society and from the liberalisation of some markets, specifically in the area of energy, and, on the other hand, the definition and implementation of public competition and competitiveness policies that create an environment that favours sustainable economic development.
A Community-based Europe consists of an economy founded on a commercial framework in which private initiative is dominant and a culture of innovation and risk is an indisputable reality.
This, therefore, requires the national authorities for political regulation and the appropriate Community institutions to promote and not to hinder all these efforts at innovation.
The risk capital action plan drawn up at the Lisbon European Council, which called for its full implementation by 2003, is one of these instruments and certainly one of the most effective instruments available to us.
It is, therefore, important that it is assessed and that its implementation is monitored, not only to record the progress that is made, but mainly to motivate all the relevant bodies in the Member States and to alert them to the need for the gradual and ongoing pursuit of a healthy entrepreneurial spirit underpinned by a culture in which risk is a factor that is permanently under control.
The use of risk capital as an instrument to promote investment in new businesses and above all in sectors that face considerable uncertainty at the start of the production process must be stimulated and protected, because the enormous potential that risk capital creates and multiplies is not yet exhausted.
Nevertheless, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out, this requires a set of measures for legislative harmonisation and the acceptance of policies for fiscal stimulation drawn up by every Member State, but also some suggested by the Union, which will enable us to break down existing barriers in the field of capital provision and, specifically, with regard to the access of small and medium-sized enterprises to this financing instrument.
By accepting greater responsibility for the financing of risk capital through the European Investment Bank, Europe is demonstrating its desire to unequivocally shoulder its share of responsibility.
Nevertheless, without precluding access to this form of financing by the high-technology sectors, we must strengthen and develop the appropriate political, economic and institutional framework for the full use of the instrument of risk capital for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The role of the Commission and of Parliament becomes, in this context, absolutely essential and will certainly be decisive.
Many major technological breakthroughs were made by small-time entrepreneurs with an ingenious streak.
For example, Philips invented the light bulb at home and Bill Gates started developing software from his garage.
Needless to say, not every innovation is immediately accessible to the public at large.
This requires courage, moral fibre, boldness and risk capital.
In order to allow society to benefit from these innovations, it is important that investments be made.
These promote the further development of new technology.
However, many small entrepreneurs do not have these investments at their disposal or have no access to the capital market in order to obtain these resources on favourable conditions.
It is therefore very important to promote access to risk capital and to remove obstructing rules.
Based on the fact that, in the past few years, both supply and demand in respect of risk capital for medium-sized and small businesses have been stagnating, it can be concluded that only an approach which removes obstructions both on the supply and on the demand side will be effective.
In this context, I can hardly see a case for making public funds available, if at all.
It is mainly up to the Member States to provide sound legislation with regard to the way in which pension funds make the resources entrusted to them profitable.
Scope to invest in risk capital must be possible under strict conditions, taking into account the risk profile of the funds.
Pensions should not be put at risk as a result.
In addition, Member States must ensure that incentives do not ultimately become government support.
This is undesirable and does not provide incentives to the innovative and creative entrepreneur.
Nor is it a solution to the substantial problem of an inadequate capital market.
The incentives should therefore certainly be temporary in nature.
Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are not yet present, it is clear to all of us, how significant equity capital and risk capital are in terms of Europe's achievement of the Lisbon objectives.
We are glad that clear indications were given in Lisbon of the important role played by efficient risk capital markets in respect of innovative, fast-growing small and medium-sized enterprises and thus also in the creation of new and lasting employment.
We are very glad that Lisbon saw the renewed demand made for full implementation of the risk capital action plan by 2003, and that it was made clear that small and medium-sized enterprises are the foundation of technological development and innovation on our continent.
We are therefore also most heartened by the result showing that venture capital investments in Europe increased in gross volume from EUR 10 billion in 1999 to EUR 19.6 billion in 2000.
Despite this report of success, we are saddened by the fact that we are still a long way behind the United States.
Taken as a share of GDP, venture capital investments in 2000 accounted for only 0.23% of Europe's, as against 0.7% in the United States.
We must catch up on America, or overtake them, if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives in this area.
It is also important, in this connection to point out - as my predecessor on the floor has done - that the largest sources of finance are the pension funds, followed by insurance and banks.
It is, then, all the more regrettable that the Commission proposal for Europe-wide enhancement of occupational retirement provision in the Internal Market as part of the Financial Services Action Plan has to this moment still elicited no official response from the Council, so that we are at the moment unable to negotiate.
I also regret the fact that we get the feeling that the so-called compromise proposals in the Council cannot and will not be adopted by either Parliament or the Commission, so that Commissioner Bolkestein, who is responsible for these matters, has now felt constrained to say that, if we make no headway here, the need to get things moving would force him to withdraw his Commission proposal.
The Council's behaviour also goes against the Barcelona decisions.
We also know that small and medium-sized enterprises have difficulties when it comes to getting access to capital.
That is why the Basle Process is so important, as is the fact that the Basle result makes allowances for the private business sector in Europe and does not make access to capital more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises.
We would, then, also request the Commission, not only to monitor the Basle Process in line with the Barcelona decisions, but also, in the interests of European economic structure and in view of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises for growth and employment, to actively influence it.
Mr President, the Skinner report provides a sensible response to the October 2000 Commission communication to implement the risk capital action plan which dates back to the 1998 Cardiff Summit and dovetails neatly with the financial services action plan which Barcelona has made a priority.
SMEs in Europe face much greater difficulties than their US counterparts in raising loan or equity finance, which may help in part to explain the extraordinary success in US economic growth over the last ten years.
Although there is now rapid growth in venture capital funds in the European Union, there is enormous variation in performance.
The City of London, which I proudly represent, leads the way at 0.4% of UK GDP devoted to this cause.
But even here, most funding comes from US sources.
Pension funds are the prime source of capital, and I have advocated UK-style self-select pension plans for the self-employed being permitted to make such investments on a pan-European basis, although this was rejected in committee, unfortunately.
I agree with the call for US-style EU-wide insolvency laws along the lines of the American Chapter XI bankruptcy procedures which afford a number of advantages, particularly in so far as they do not disrupt the continuity of trading in failing companies.
I also lament the lateness in bringing forward the much-needed Community patent, due to excessive sensitivity on the language issue which will only add to the cost for SMEs and make the procedures unworkable.
Not radically tackling the language issue now will only get worse after enlargement when there are 40 million Polish speakers who also want their language to be given the same priority as, say, Italian or Spanish.
Member States should also seriously consider promotion of funds through generous capital gains tax incentives to mitigate the risk to investors.
I generally, though, reject State funding directly for SMEs as the State is generally poor at picking winners amongst competing demands for capital.
Nevertheless Mr Skinner's suggestion of a one-stop shop risk capital website to facilitate the interface of SMEs and the finance-providers is a very good one.
This excellent report enjoyed considerable cross-party support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in spite of originating from the other side of the House, deserves our full support.
Mr President, I wish first of all to praise the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, who has done very well in describing a large number of measures which must be taken if the supply of risk capital in Europe is to be increased.
If we are to be able to attain the very optimistic objective set in Lisbon two years ago, according to which Europe is to be the world's top economy by the year 2010, measures must be taken quickly to increase companies' access to risk capital.
Time is running out, and the United States is increasing its lead.
As the rapporteur also points out, it is especially important to review the conditions governing small and medium-sized enterprises, for it is among these that regeneration and technical development take place.
It is also small and medium-sized enterprises that can give rise to new job opportunities.
We know that risk capital investments have fallen in Europe.
In such a situation, it is easy to revert to the solution applied in the past: public funding.
However, that would lead not to strong and healthy companies but to companies which, though certainly new, would be dependent upon subsidies.
It is therefore important to emphasise that state support can only be justified in exceptional circumstances.
The overall business climate is crucial to the success or otherwise of the European economy and the economies of the Member States.
One clear example of a country that is deficient in this area is Sweden, which has experimented a great deal with state aid and so excluded healthy competition.
Since 1960, not a single large company has been started up in Sweden.
The report discusses much that is important to small and medium-sized enterprises, and what clearly emerges from this discussion is that there are still administrative, legal and cultural obstacles to be overcome and that too little has been done to remove these.
It is essential that the work required continue at a brisker pace because access to risk capital is a prerequisite of companies' growth and development.
It must be possible for companies which go bankrupt to be given another chance.
To try and then fail must not lead to companies' being stigmatised due to bankruptcy legislation. Otherwise, no one in the end will want to go out on a limb.
People who are prepared to do just that, together with the availability of risk capital, are the indispensable features of a growing economy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jonathan Evans represents the citizens of Wales, and I represent the citizens of Wels.
In both our cities we have strong small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is also Europe's strength.
It is because firms with under 250 employees account for two-thirds of jobs that we in the political world must always bear in mind the need to 'think small first'.
First we must think of the 'small players' and look to see how we can apply some leverage for them.
It is precisely for the students or workers who want to become self-employed that we have no help to offer by means of functioning instruments.
The so-called 'one man start up' is a very important area of concern.
It must also be possible to make risk capital available in instalments ranging from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000 rather than only from EUR 5 million upwards.
In particular, we will have need of that when it comes to the new Member States.
We must be aware that they suffer a glaring lack of equity capital, and that even the banks there find this very difficult. If we want to build prosperity there, with a market economy that works, we have to consider how these businesses get their hands on the capital they need once they are working in the European Union.
The second major area is the transfer of businesses.
There is at present an enormous tax burden when businesses are handed on from one generation to the next.
It is, though, precisely at this stage that the enterprise is at greatest risk, as, on the one hand, the experienced generation is stepping down, and the new generation takes risks in its desire to build something new.
I would ask the Commissioner to offer alternatives on this point.
I would like to add, in conclusion, that it is important that we think about fiscal optimisation.
Are the rules on depreciation right?
Do new businesses and enterprises using risk capital not need new rules on depreciation, new allowances and reserves?
How long are time limits to be, and to what should they apply?
I believe that tax also plays an enormous role in the accumulation of equity capital.
I request the Commission to produce a Green Paper on this issue, because it is in taxation also that Basle II will bring enormous changes, as we can create the conditions for Basle II only if there is massively reduced taxation of business proceeds, especially of undistributed profits from businesses, and then the Finance Ministers really will have to prick their ears up.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that the Commission welcomes this report and would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for preparing the report on implementing the risk capital action plan.
The report is clearly supportive of the Community strategy to develop the EU risk capital market.
As has been said a number of times this evening in this Parliament, risk capital provides a vital source of financing for new and innovative enterprises, and in that way it contributes significantly to economic growth and to the creation of jobs.
The development of a large and efficient EU risk capital market is a key element in the so-called Lisbon Strategy to create a more dynamic and prosperous European Union.
The period since the launch of the risk capital action plan has seen a rapid growth in the EU risk capital market.
Investment almost tripled between 1998 and 2000.
Growth then slowed in 2001 as the "dot.com bubble" burst and the global economy weakened, but nonetheless the market remains fundamentally sound.
Indeed the slowdown in growth may be seen as a necessary consolidation after the rather exuberant behaviour of previous years.
But despite the real progress that has been made, there are still important barriers to development of the EU risk capital market.
As the report points out, these barriers affect both the supply side and the demand side of the market.
The risk capital action plan is designed to address those barriers, and in order to meet the deadline of 2003 for implementation of the RCAP a number of key actions are required.
Perhaps I may mention four of them.
Firstly, the relevant measures in the financial services action plan must be adopted urgently.
Those measures include the proposed directive on prospectuses, the proposed directive on occupational pension funds, about which a number of Members have spoken tonight, and the proposed regulation on international accounting standards.
The commitment by the Barcelona European Council to have those proposals adopted as early as possible in 2002 is very welcome.
May I say in reply to Mr Karas, on the matter of occupational pension funds, that the Commission is not in the business of making life more difficult for those pension funds that are in operation and that operate efficiently and satisfactorily.
Why should the Commission place an increased burden of regulation on those pension funds?
That is why I recently said that if the Council were to insist on further restrictions on those pension funds which operate satisfactorily - and basically they are found in the United Kingdom and Ireland, in the Netherlands and Denmark: together those countries account for maybe two thirds or 75% of total capital assembled and saved for the purpose of defraying pension fund obligations - why should the Commission place further restrictions on those pension funds?
That is why I have said that if the Council wants to do that then the Commission will have no alternative but to withdraw the proposal.
That is the first way in which the Commission aims at increasing the risk capital action plan market.
The second way is that Member States must maintain, and improve where necessary, the pace of structural reform.
The objective of reform must be to create an environment in which the risk capital market can flourish.
Progress has been made but much remains to be done.
The Commission's broad economic policy guidelines for the year 2002/2003 will again call for intensified efforts in this area.
Thirdly, entrepreneurship must be encouraged.
Measures to promote a culture of enterprise in the EU have been taken at Community and national levels, but Members of Parliament will appreciate that to change a culture is not easy.
Cultural barriers can indeed be particularly difficult to overcome but our efforts in this field must continue and, if possible, be intensified.
Fourthly and lastly the efficiency of public funding for risk capital activities must be improved and it is important that public funding should not crowd out private sector investment.
We do not want to see that happen. Based on that consideration the Commission has clarified its policy on state aid to risk capital activities.
I regard the report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as another important building block in our efforts to develop the EU risk capital market.
It is encouraging that the recommendations from the committee correspond fully to the measures proposed in the risk capital action plan, and the Commission would very much like to once again thank the rapporteur for his work.
Before I end my contribution to this debate I should like to say, in reply to a question put by Mr Karas, that the Commission is actively following the negotiations at Basle.
As Mr Karas knows, the Commission is an observer in those negotiations.
We are now entering a third consultation round.
More time has been allotted for those negotiations and one of the prime objectives of the Commission is to see to such a development as will ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises will have the same possibilities of attracting capital as larger companies.
Again, why would the Commission approve something which would harm the possibilities for small and medium-sized enterprises to get capital?
After all, all we want to do is to facilitate capital going to SMEs since we all know that SMEs play a very important part in creating jobs; of course they also they play a very important part in the creation of high-tech industries, or rather, activities which may lead to high-tech industries.
In conclusion, I would like to say something about the five amendments which have been proposed by Mr Goebbels.
Unfortunately he is not here, but I would like to say that on the first amendment the Commission has difficulties because we fear that his amendment would send the wrong signal to the market.
We are particularly concerned that state aid discipline should not be weakened, and therefore the Commission does not really like the first amendment and hopes that it will not be accepted by Parliament.
The second amendment states that a shortage of appropriate finance is the major obstacle to starting a business.
The Commission begs to differ.
The Commission does not agree that the shortage of funds is the major obstacle.
There are a number of obstacles and it would be difficult to say which one is the major obstacle.
Therefore the Commission regrets it cannot accept this amendment.
The other three amendments - Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 - are acceptable to the Commission and no doubt Mr Goebbels will be informed about the opinions of the Commission.
We therefore once again accept the fact that those three amendments will be approved by Parliament.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The Presidency will, of course, pass on your opinions to Mr Goebbels, who was, however, represented by Mr Santos in this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0073/2002) by Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin [COM(2001)101 - C5-0095/2001 - 2001/0055(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The EU produces 20 million hectolitres of alcohol annually, of which 13 million hectolitres are of agricultural origin and the rest of the Union's production is what is known as synthetic alcohol.
The main manufacturing industries that use ethyl alcohol are the spirit drinks industry, which represents around 30% of the European alcohol market and can only use alcohol of agricultural origin, and the chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, which represent the other 70% and which can use both agricultural and synthetic alcohol.
Both types of alcohol, therefore, are competing in the same market.
In the past, there have been five successive attempts by the Commission to set up a COM in alcohol, but all of these attempts have come to grief in the Council.
The reasons for this failure lie in the wide variety of national systems traditionally used for alcohol in the various Member States.
The main reason is that, in principle, establishing a COM would entail dismantling national aid, as set out in Article 10 of the proposal.
This type of aid, linked to rural aid, however, can and should be maintained, not least because it does not distort the market in the current Europe of fifteen.
The arguments in favour of a Community legal framework are to improve the functioning of the single market, to ensure fair conditions of competition between operators and to help improve transparency and knowledge of marketing flows with a view to globalisation.
The global liberalisation process is the main threat to European alcohol producers.
Alcohol imports from third countries are finding it increasingly easy to gain access to the EU market due to new openings arising from preferential systems, GATT tariff-cutting agreements or bilateral negotiations with specific third countries that produce a large amount of alcohol.
Other factors which might affect development prospects for the European alcohol market at this time include the substantial levels of alcohol production in the applicant countries, future tariff reductions in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and a possible increase in bioethanol production for fuel in the European Union, that could significantly alter the horizon for traditional uses of European ethyl alcohol.
Faced with such developments, the Council of Agricultural Ministers of 17 July 2000 asked the Commission to examine the possibility of introducing a regulatory framework for agricultural alcohol, in order to improve statistical information and market transparency, as well as introducing a regime for import and export licences, and to create an appropriate management committee for the sector.
The Commission is proposing a limited scope or 'lightweight' COM, which does not involve measures under the EAGGF, but does however go further than the Council request in that, in addition to the definitions, statistics, import and export licences system, and the establishment of an appropriate management committee, the proposal also contains elements such as the possibility of establishing tariff quotas and a safeguard clause, the possibility of prohibiting or restricting inward processing arrangements and a specific provision on state aid.
The problem arises from the fact that a COM can apply only to products included in Annex I of the Treaty, which means it can apply to alcohol of agricultural origin but not to synthetic alcohol.
Given that the two types of alcohol compete with each other and are to a large extent interchangeable for most uses, the fact that the Commission is only intending to regulate alcohol of agricultural origin prompts questions about the purpose and value of rules supposedly designed to regulate the European alcohol market as a whole.
For this reason, a problem surfaced at the time of drawing up the corresponding report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, what should be done with synthetic alcohol?
To add synthetic alcohol would mean having to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, given that this addition would involve amendment to the legal basis of the Commission proposal.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market established that the dual legal basis (Articles 37 and 95) is impossible, given that the procedures that correspond to the two articles are incompatible.
As a result, faced with the impossibility of amending the proposal to include synthetic alcohol, the rapporteur proposes that the Commission should put forward a new proposal to include synthetic alcohol within its scope.
In this way it will be possible to regulate the whole ethyl alcohol market at Community level.
You will understand why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted for this proposal unanimously.
A COM is probably not the appropriate instrument, but we have to bear in mind that it is the Commission that has the power of legislative initiative.
I would like to finish by asking the Commission three questions. Can you tell what stage negotiations in the Council have reached?
Is the Commission intending to withdraw the proposal?
If this is the case, does it intend to present another?
Mr President, we have reached that time of the evening at which I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, you and I can all think of better things to do with ethyl alcohol than talk about it.
However, we are fated to spend at least a few more minutes in conversation.
I would like to express profound sympathy with Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez for the amount of work and time she has put into this report, only to discover that it was not possible to construct an adequate legal base to bring in both the sources of ethyl alcohol.
As I understand it, ethyl alcohol produced for industrial use comes more or less equally from agricultural sources and from non-agricultural sources, chiefly from the oil industry.
In that context, it would be necessary to find a dual legal base to deal with both together.
Personally I think she is right that it would be absurd for the Community to try to deal with this single identical substance differently according to the two alternative sources.
On the other hand, the economics of production and the industrial circumstances of production are quite different, as I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein knows even better than I from his own manifold past experience.
So it is quite an important question to try and find a way of dealing with the whole market in a way that is sensitive to both sources of production.
It would have been objectionable - I know from contacts of my own with the oil industry in Scotland - to spatchcock the oil industry-produced ethanol into an agricultural organisation which had been set up without regard to circumstances in the other sector, so we need a two-handed approach to this.
Thus it is absolutely right to suggest that the Commission should put its thinking cap on again and come back with a new look at whatever is needed in the way of keeping an eye on the whole alcohol market at this difficult time, dealing even-handedly with both sources of production.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Ayuso most warmly for the work she has done.
The Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol was voted down in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We are convinced that the Commission should withdraw this proposal and revise it.
Whilst the Spanish Presidency would very much like to wrap this issue up during its term of office, I do not think this will be possible, quite simply because Parliament will not have produced a position for the Agriculture Council in due time.
There are three key issues; firstly, for example, the title of the act.
Is a Common Market Organisation appropriate, or a simple regulation?
Secondly, to what extent do we include synthetic alcohol?
Thirdly, is there the need for a regulation on state aid?
As discussions currently stand between Parliament and the Commission, these issues have not been resolved.
If the Commission were to abandon its dogmatic position on the Common Market Organisation, it could surely agree to the regulation providing for the purely statistical supervision of synthetic alcohol.
This way ahead would be possible even without extending the legal basis.
I reckon that a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers could adopt the lightweight Regulation that was originally called for.
I continue to be highly sceptical about the aid provisions, on which many questions remain unanswered.
On the issue of universal land use management across the whole of Europe, which includes the sparse areas, and also on the twofold task of agriculture, which is both the cultivation and raising of agricultural products and the care and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, we must support producers of agricultural alcohol through the production of corn, potatoes and fruit.
My appeal to the Commission is this: please, let us not needlessly wreck a system that works.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I also wish to thank the rapporteur for the work that we on the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development jointly prepared.
The proposal before us now can be traced back to when my country held the presidency in 1999.
Then once again it was realised that the alcohol markets need common rules.
The objective is to correct the surplus situation and it is being proposed to dismantle national aid as part of the measures to be implemented.
The committee, however, was unanimous in its conclusion that the whole proposal should be rejected.
Synthetic alcohol should be considered comparable with alcohol of agricultural origin.
The legal basis now in force makes this impossible.
The ELDR Group endorses the course of action proposed by the rapporteur as we wish to make two comments: firstly, we want to complain about the unsatisfactory way in which the Commission has prepared this matter, and, secondly, it would be good to keep the legal basis consistent from the point of view of the single market.
We could in this way also proceed in the right way in COM reform.
Although the Commission's proposal is by no means totally acceptable, my personal opinion is that it would make the situation better than it is now.
We on the committee drafted a good number of amendments to it which might have helped this matter to gain ground.
It is a pity that now we will not effect any legislation.
This is probably the sixth time this matter has been discussed by the EU institutions.
The end result is always the same: nothing is done.
The legal basis cannot be changed just like that.
We have to continue with things as they are.
As I understand it, this is all very much based on the question of the codecision procedure relating to agricultural matters, which causes problems all the time.
It is continually being discussed in the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development and often we reach a situation that is somewhat artificial.
The EU is in the process of enlarging.
Soon we will have ten new Member States, and a simple matter like this, such as similar substances coming from the same source, as Mr MacCormick said here, cannot be dealt with or decided upon.
The EU institutions have debated this issue five or six times and have always drawn a blank.
Ethyl alcohol and synthetic alcohol are, in my view, an excellent example of why we must swiftly address questions about the Treaty, as after 2006, with the reform of agricultural policy, Parliament will have to take some very fundamental decisions.
If the Treaty prevents this kind of issue from being corrected and taken forward we really will be on the wrong track.
How will it reflect on the agricultural profession as a whole and how will it be for the European agricultural model and its justification if we cannot have a decision on a matter of this sort?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to create a common organisation of the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin is underpinned by a good intention.
This is to establish conditions ensuring that the market is better regulated and that there is greater transparency and fairer competition in trade both within the European Union and with third countries.
This product should, furthermore, make a major contribution to the functioning of the single market in this field.
Its use in sectors such as the spirits industry and in the chemical, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, gives it a strategic importance in the European context.
Ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, however, only represents around one half of alcohol consumed and produced in the European Union, with the rest being produced synthetically.
This type of alcohol which is a good competitive alternative for all uses except alcoholic drinks, has seen increased growth in the European Union.
The Commission proposal, however, only covers ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, and ignores synthetic alcohol, as stated by Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez.
Consequently, the proposal will not enable us to achieve even a minimally effective regulation of the market unless we include, without rules or with different rules, this type of alcohol.
It is also worth adding that the Commission proposal also fails to solve the problem of the small and very small distillers which, until now, has been resolved by means of national schemes and national aid.
For these reasons, we feel it is reasonable to do as the rapporteur proposes and reject this Commission proposal.
The European Parliament would be thereby clearly expressing its dissatisfaction with the scope of the Commission's intentions and would call on the Commission to submit a new proposal regulating the entire market in alcohol, of both agricultural and non-agricultural origin, and to resolve the outstanding problems with the various national systems in force.
The issues of bioethanol and enlargement will also have to be considered in the next proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks must go first to Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, who has invested the greatest effort in this report, even if we are left to vote on just one amendment.
Members who sit on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, with Mrs Ayuso, have disregarded party boundaries in trying to point the Commission proposal in a more balanced direction.
By balanced we mean that, as well as agricultural alcohol, which makes up only a part of the alcohol market as a whole, synthetic alcohol must also eventually be the subject of a Common Market Organisation, both types of alcohol being in direct competition with each other.
Our demand that this be done was rejected.
Secondly, there must be exceptions to the existing regulations in Member States which give state support to the production of agricultural alcohol in order to take account of the need to protect the landscape and environment, safeguard the diversity of species and maintain the structures of smallholdings.
I am speaking here with specific reference to the German agricultural alcohol monopoly, which has to date effectively performed the functions I have just mentioned.
Minimal state aid, which in the European context is in no way relevant to the Internal Market, is used, particularly in southern Germany, to maintain cultural landscapes with fruit meadows that are of ecological value, and which are cultivated and looked after almost exclusively by smallholders.
The result of this policy, which has to date been right and proper, can be seen by you yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, on the steepest slopes of the Black Forest, which are now in bloom.
This small remuneration for caring for the landscape is almost an idea from the second pillar, which is widely believed to be in need of reinforcement.
This concern, though, has not been taken into account either.
Parliament is therefore, in my view, doing the right thing in rejecting the Commission proposal before us, which, moreover, utterly disregarded the Council's original mandate for a simple framework regulation.
We have kicked the ball back.
I am putting my hopes in the unofficial meeting of agriculture ministers at the end of April, and quite specifically in Mrs KÃŒnast.
The desirable outcome would be for the Council to take up what Parliament has come up with, which I presume will be decided on tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I unequivocally welcome the favourable opinion the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has on Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez' report.
Rejection of the Commission proposal for a Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol is the only sensible response that the committee could have delivered.
I would like to use this opportunity to briefly recapitulate on why this is the case.
The Commission had not been tasked with the setting up of a new market organisation and with using it to intervene in a healthy and intact market.
Despite that, and with great zeal, it drew up a proposal whose substantial loopholes are evident even on first sight.
Thus, synthetic alcohol is left completely out of the equation, even though it now has a 50% share of use in the EU and is, above all, indispensable in fields as important as the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
This gives rise to the danger that distortions in competition may result to the detriment of the market for agricultural alcohol.
A new market organisation is also to be rejected in view of the EU's enlargement, and of the fact that very large quantities of agricultural alcohol are produced in many candidate countries.
We cannot, shortly before the accession of these countries, make a regulation that takes no account of their circumstances and thus would not sufficiently prepare their existing markets.
A further significant point of criticism lies in the Commission proposal's manifest complete disregard for the cultural and economic importance of agricultural alcohol.
Alcohol, when produced on an agricultural basis, originates as a natural product in small and medium-sized enterprises mainly situated in rural areas, and makes a substantial contribution to preserving traditional cultural landscapes. Mrs Jeggle has pointed this out.
Its production is also of great significance from an ecological point of view, and the by-products are, indeed, still used as agricultural feedingstuffs.
Rural areas characterised by fruit meadows would find themselves in a serious crisis situation if the Commission's plans were implemented.
It is easy to see that not only the regions shaped by private business and farming would suffer as a result of this, but that there would also be massive loss of jobs.
The Commission cannot and must not overlook this, and so I find it utterly incomprehensible that they are disregarding the adverse consequences for agriculture and above all for small and medium-sized enterprises in this way.
The Commission paper before us is thus, in my opinion, a futile approach to shaping the market in alcohol.
Any new regulation must cover all types of alcohol.
There cannot and must not be partial solutions that bring more imbalances in their train.
Quite apart from that, it makes sense not to provide a transition period for the current national aid arrangements, but rather to integrate these into the overall framework in a rational way.
Mr President, it is actually a pity about the great amount of work done by the Commission and by the rapporteur, who has indeed taken a great deal of trouble, because, at the end of the day, tomorrow's vote will not result in a satisfactory outcome.
So this sixth attempt is a real loss.
I would like to make use of the opportunity afforded by this short speech to refer to two things.
I get the impression that, with the avowed intention of thoroughly justifiably protecting small businesses - some of which are very small indeed - we will end up back with a situation we very often encounter on agricultural issues, where the small players are used as a pretext while the big players can continue to safeguard their position.
Please do not misunderstand me.
I am very much in favour of maintaining the small distilleries and the arrangements for benefits in kind, especially in the form in which they exist in Germany, but within bounds, and for the benefit of the small rather than of the great.
I would like to end with the topic of biofuels, one that is of the utmost importance.
I believe that biofuels represent a great opportunity for agriculture.
There is still far more that we can do in this area than has been done to date, and that is through research into them, into the conditions to be imposed on them and how best to promote them, so that we can involve these alcohol products, too, in an ecological approach to our surroundings and thereby find new trade outlets for our agricultural sector.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would like to thank Mrs Ayuso for this report and for the work she has done.
She has spared neither effort nor trouble in trying to bring about a positive outcome in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but that has unfortunately not been possible.
Around 20 million hectolitres of alcohol are produced in Europe every year, around 13 million hectolitres of which are of agricultural origin.
The attempt has often been made to create a common market organisation for alcohol in the EU.
Up to now, proposals for this have always failed at Council level, as the national regulatory systems were so heterogeneous, and the frameworks and aid structures so diverse, that no common denominator could be found.
This time, the hurdle at which it fell was that of the legal basis.
The new Commission proposal envisages what is termed a 'lightweight' COM, with no provision for intervention mechanisms to the detriment of the EAGGF or of export refunds, and, hence, comprises only the definition of products, a system of monitoring foreign trade through import and export licences, the possibility of laying down tariff quotas and a protection clause, the collection of statistical data or specific provisions on state aid.
My response to this is that I basically welcome the Commission proposal, even though the current position of the alcohol sector in Austria is not a very important problem.
I am well aware, though, that for other Member States the inclusion of synthetic alcohol in the proposed COM is a central issue.
It is precisely for this reason that I do not see it as possible, because there is no basis that is legally incontestable.
It is for that reason, too, that I fully endorse our rapporteur's view that we should call on the Commission to submit a new proposal.
At this point I would like to make a more critical observation on the relationship between agricultural and synthetic alcohols.
The concerns of farmers and of the rural areas as a whole matter to me.
It is from this perspective that I would like to point out that the agricultural manufacture of alcohol as the product of specific raw materials such as, for example, wine, fruit, corn, and potatoes represents an important trade outlet.
I want to firmly emphasise that this portfolio should cover the production and sale of agricultural alcohol and not of synthetic alcohol.
Synthetic alcohol is in my view to be used only for industry, pharmacy, energy and so on, and not mixed with any other products.
As a representative of rural areas in Parliament, I will always put forward the interests of farmers and of rural areas, as multifunctional, farm-based, universal and environmentally-responsible agriculture is the model for land management throughout the whole of Europe.
It is my view that any new proposal by the Commission should, in any case, provide for a specific Management Committee, as the present Management Committee for Wine is already overstretched by its plethora of competences.
In conclusion, I wish to declare my wholehearted commitment to a common agricultural policy, from which I have learned of the problems of farmers in the different Member States.
I would like to thank all Members of Parliament who have spoken for the work they have put into considering the proposal for a Common Market Organisation for Alcohol.
In particular, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso, for her analysis of the proposal and efforts to understand its objectives.
As you know, this is another proposal to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, after several attempts in the past that all failed for different reasons, as has been mentioned tonight by several Members.
The Commission is of the opinion that the actual market situation in this sector made it necessary to propose at least a minimal set of rules and that, under those circumstances, the chances of succeeding this time were fairly good.
That was also the opinion of a large majority of Member States that invited the Commission to come forward with such a proposal.
The Commission is therefore somewhat surprised that, despite the hard work of the rapporteur, who initially came forward with a series of amendments which might well have been considered, Parliament now proposes rejecting the whole proposal.
In the draft resolution Parliament has asked the Commission to withdraw its proposal as it does not fulfil its objectives of regulating the whole market of alcohol in the European Union.
I presume this amendment refers to the non-inclusion of synthetic alcohol in the proposal for agricultural alcohol.
The Commission cannot, at this stage, agree with Parliament's position, as is understandable.
Parliament's position would imply considering the proposal to be the result of a lack of reflection and lack of analysis of the real situation of the sector.
If, from an economic point of view, there are good reasons to extend the proposal to synthetic alcohol, there are legal and practical reasons why the Commission did not do this, when it established the proposal.
Synthetic alcohol is a non-Annex I product and therefore not covered by CAP.
Inserting it into the proposal would mean that we would have to find another legal basis other than the CAP Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty.
More importantly, the smoothest way to make a proposal was to limit it to agricultural alcohol because the production and trade in synthetic alcohol in the European Union is more limited.
Most of the problems the sector faces are linked to agricultural alcohol and not so much to synthetic alcohol.
If, once this regulation is applied, serious problems arise in relation to synthetic alcohol, insertion of synthetic alcohol into this instrument could always be envisaged.
The Commission is well aware of the fact that the major part of the alcohol market is accessible to both types of alcohol, which therefore compete for the same outlets.
In order to realise its objective of better market information and transparency, the insertion of synthetic alcohol in the article on data collection to establish a yearly market balance of the sector and therefore to increase market knowledge might be considered.
The Commission is working on that.
This would also be defensible without a change of legal base provided that it could be shown that it was genuinely necessary, in order to manage the CMO for agricultural alcohol, that we should have the data for synthetic alcohol.
The case-law of the Court of Justice permits the use of Article 37 for provisions that have an ancillary effect on non-Annex I products, where this is necessary for the proper functioning of the CMO.
For the rest, the Commission is of the opinion that all other provisions proposed are necessary to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, including the provisions on the application of the rules on state aid.
Without a fair application of those rules there would not be a common market for agricultural alcohol, as already exists for synthetic alcohol.
I should like to say something about the German market in answer to Members who have made reference to that particular aspect.
The Commission is well aware of the functioning of the German alcohol monopoly.
The purpose of this proposal for a common market organisation for alcohol is not to put an end to the existence of the German monopoly.
If the production of alcohol by German farmers, under the rules of the monopoly, including federal payments, is necessary for the maintenance of precious eco-systems or to cover the additional costs of environmentally-friendly production methods, there would be no problems, as current state aid rules offer substantial possibilities for Member States to grant aid for those purposes.
If, on the contrary, the aid in Germany is not given for such reasons but is simple operating assistance, paid for other reasons, then the application of the state aid rules would cause a problem.
On the other hand, those small distillers who produce not only alcohol but also a spirit, could benefit from the de minimis rules on state aid for non-agricultural products.
I hope that these comments which I have also made on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, have clarified the Commission's position on the proposal.
Moreover, I would like to thank Members of Parliament for their constructive suggestions, which the Commission will consider.
In answer to the question put to me by the rapporteur, if this amendment is accepted - which the Commission would regret - then Mr Fischler and my other colleagues will reassess the situation and reflect on a further course of action.
Again I thank all Members that have spoken and others who have dealt with this subject.
I thank them for the time they have given to this proposal.
In particular I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, for her efforts.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I voted in favour of the draft recommendation for second reading tabled by Mr Sterckx.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who presented those of Parliament's amendments that had not been taken up by the Council in its common position.
For first reading, I proposed a tighter timetable for the installation of black boxes and transponders onboard vessels.
This timetable was adopted in plenary by the European Parliament, but was not taken up by the Council in its common position for second reading.
However, the United States has made a submission in IMO concerning the anticipated application of AIS carriage at the latest in 2004.
I would point out that the Council common position gives 2007 as the date for application by Member States.
Once again, we will be lagging behind the United States in the area of maritime safety.
I therefore welcome the fact that the House has reintroduced this request in today's vote.
However, I have some reservations as to the concept of places of refuge, which does not provide the same guarantees as a port, for equipment and naval installations.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Protection of minors and human dignity
Mr President, may I first pay credit to my colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, for the initial work he did in drafting this report before he moved to another committee.
The rapid development of the audio-visual media has brought many real benefits in terms of education, spreading greater awareness of public affairs around the world, and not least in the field of entertainment.
However, along with the undoubted advantages, there have also been concerns that, given the generally greater adeptness of children at using audio-visual resources, in some areas there are dangers of their obtaining access to unsuitable or harmful material.
This is most obvious in the fields of overt sexual material and gratuitous violence.
The principles which have guided this report are to encourage greater public awareness of these issues and to support parental responsibility and to develop co-operation between the content providers, consumer organisations and the respective authorities, both national and European.
Self-regulation is considered to be the main instrument, underpinned by legal requirements where necessary.
The report, which analyses the Commission's evaluation report, is primarily concerned with the Internet and with video games, as it was felt important not to anticipate a possible future review of the Television without Frontiers directive.
The report calls for user-friendly content filter systems to enable parents to predetermine the sort of content which they feel is unsuitable viewing for their children and, in this regard I very much welcome the fact that, since the report was first drafted, the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA), has launched a filter system available free of charge, an initiative supported by the Commission.
We also called for greater public awareness, for education campaigns and hotlines to be set up, as already exists in TV broadcasting, so that complaints about illegal or harmful content may be recorded by consumers, particularly by parents.
We consider that so-called 'Internet Chat Rooms' should be subject to greater monitoring, both of the rules for their installation and in relation to their use.
As far as video games are concerned, we call upon the Member States to continue to promote the rating of video games, again through self-regulation, but if that is considered to be inadequate in some cases, it should be backed up by the introduction of agreed minimum standards of content and promotion.
It is also hoped that the Member States will continue to exchange best practice in this field and co-ordinate measures which are taken in co-operation with the industry and with content providers.
The report does not seek to sensationalise or exaggerate perceived dangers, but it does provide a useful framework to encourage public awareness of the risks involved and to provide practical remedies.
Finally, Parliament calls on the Commission to draw up a further report, preferably before the end of this year, on the implementation of the recommendation with specific reference to implementation in each Member State.
I commend the report to the House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of minors and human dignity is an issue that is close to the hearts of us all.
It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission has presented this evaluation report on the progress we are making in this area in relation to audio-visual media and the Internet.
Mr Beazley, as Mr Heaton-Harris before him, has drafted a sterling report on the subject.
Nevertheless, I should like to take this opportunity of drawing your attention once again to the fact that technical resources and legislation from above are not sufficient to guarantee this protection.
There are always ways and means, devious or otherwise, to get round this, and certainly children are very resourceful in this area.
Self-regulation, as is now being applied on a large scale, appears to be a very handy instrument.
However, I want to point out again at this juncture that instilling awareness in minors themselves, as well as their parents and educators, is still the best way forward.
This is possible by, on the one hand, paying ample attention to media education at school, so that minors can be taught to identify harmful content for themselves, and, on the other hand, by providing educators with a tool, such as the Dutch 'viewer guide' classification system.
This is a system on which we had a very interesting hearing yesterday and in which I am also personally involved in the Netherlands.
It is a well thought-out system which actually works, and by means of which children can handle audio-visual media products with awareness.
The system is also accompanied by an age category.
MG6 means: six years, parental guidance desirable, and, in this way, adults are reminded once again of their responsibilities, for uninterested parents produce vulnerable children.
I would therefore call on the Member States and the Commission, when studying best practices, to keep this classification system in mind and, when planning school curricula, to make room for media education too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like first to congratulate Mr Beazley on his report and thank him for his good cooperation.
This topic is, as my predecessor on the floor has confirmed, close to all our hearts.
There are many points on which we agree, such as trust being a better fundamental premise for this common endeavour than overall control or even censorship, neither of which would serve as a good basis for cooperation.
We also agree that we must advertise the hotlines more extensively in order for them to be used, as we desire, right across the whole of Europe, and in order for us to be able to establish where protection is needed.
We agree, too, that we have to provide parents with the right tools to enable them, together with their children, to assess which TV programmes, computer games, and films are the right ones for their children, and in order to support them in their judgment of the programmes.
On this I agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, who spoke before me.
This is where moving closer on a European level to a uniform system of classification for the whole audio-visual sector seems to be of the greatest and most urgent importance, as that would be a tool facilitating control by parents and young people themselves, one that could also function on the basis of trust and not tend towards either excessive control or censorship.
I now come to what I believe is at the moment the most important point in connection with this 'box', namely that the Internet strikes many as a sort of 'wonderbox'; they stand in front of it and are simply overwhelmed by all the stuff that comes out of it, forgetting in the process what influences can come into play, especially on children and young people, if we do not consciously discern what is heading in our direction.
Let me emphasise it three times, four times, ten times over: media literacy.
Media literacy - we cannot start too soon on heightening awareness of it and on playing our part in developing it.
To do this, we also need not only the political willingness; we also need more programmes.
For them, we need money.
Perhaps we will achieve some sort of collaboration with all the players at the European level, something which is, at the end of the day, in the interests of all.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our experience following the quantum leap in the mass media, especially television, is increasing daily.
I am sure you have all witnessed in your countries, as I have witnessed in mine, the boom in cheap 'big brother' type television programmes in which people agree to be imprisoned, for want of a better word, while viewers are invited to peep through the keyhole, waiting for something titillating to happen, usually - to be frank - a sex scene, or for something unexpected or interesting to happen.
But, at the same time, this sort of programme encourages viewers - especially young viewers - to look on the people playing this sort of lottery, betting body and soul in the hope of winning money at the expense of the others, as role models.
These programmes are objectionable and absurd but we cannot attack them through legislation or administrative intervention.
As other speakers have said, technical rules do no good, nor does informing and educating children, because forbidden fruit does, of course, taste sweeter.
None of this is enough especially, Commissioner, as everyone will be able to access this sort of programme on the Internet sooner or later. I think we need some sort of European legislation and regulations with more teeth than we have at present.
I do not have a great deal of faith in self-regulation because competition lives by its own - very powerful - rules.
However, it would be no bad thing if we could come up with some sort of more binding code of conduct than we have at present.
If we were to give parents and consumers the right to lay siege to the producers of these cheap programmes, it would, perhaps, provide some small counterweight to competition.
And, of course, we could look at the more technical question of watersheds to draw a dividing line between when children watch television and their bedtime and when these programmes go out.
However, even with all this, unless we come up with something more original and imaginative, I shall persist in my pessimism as to the future and the success of this sort of programme.
. (FR) Mr President, the representatives of the MPF in this House welcome the European Parliament resolution on the evaluation report by the Commission concerning the protection of minors and human dignity, which they will be voting for.
On this subject, which concerns the very essence of humanity, there are two main players involved: the family, first of all, which bears full responsibility for the upbringing of its children, and secondly, society, which must ensure that children are protected.
It is, therefore, important - as emphasised in the resolution that we are discussing today - to do all we can to ensure that protective frameworks are established, in particular for the forms of media which are used freely by young consumers, be they audiovisual, written resources or on the Internet.
It is also important for the victims of abuses of power to be able to turn to a moral authority that can help them.
We must increase the means available to these organisations.
Changing the behaviour of adults is something else that will enable us to protect our most vulnerable fellow citizens effectively.
We must not be afraid; we must be prepared to go against the flow and to lay down new rules for a moral code that respects all aspects of the individual.
We must condemn these counter-models of pleasure, who are all too often idolised by the young, whose points of reference some are seeking to destroy.
We should also be inculcating a genuine appreciation of the beautiful, the good and the true in minors, so that they hold the keys to their protection in their own hands.
To answer Mr Papayannakis, I would say that adopting this attitude demonstrates our optimism and I personally am not pessimistic about what society and what individuals can do to effectively protect minors.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Beazley on his report.
