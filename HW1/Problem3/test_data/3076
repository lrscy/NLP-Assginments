I have great difficulty with the US view that they can decide when to support an international organisation, be it 'just' the United Nations or the International Criminal Court, and when they themselves should act and when they can carry out pre-emptive strikes, and whereby they can define the danger and make decisions on deployment without consulting the international authorities.
Lastly, I also have a big problem with the idea that the President of the United States can read a book over the summer that says that you should not trust the military, because the military will hesitate and always see the risk of failure, and that the sign of a true politician is that he distrusts the military.
Given that the same author, Elliot Cohen, believes that we did not drop enough bombs on Yugoslavia, any country that listens to advisers like that really worries me.
Mr President, I was not intending to speak but whilst listening to this debate, one cannot help but be struck by, if I may say so, the predominance of ignorance and powerlessness.
As regards the predominance of ignorance, we know nothing or virtually nothing of the decisions which have been taken by the United States, of the specific information that they have and of their aims.
What do they want to do with Iraq, what can they do with Iraq?
How can we resolve the problem with Iran on the one hand and with the Kurds on the other?
We know nothing.
As for the predominance of powerlessness, which arises from the absolute division and the complete heterogeneity of opinions were expressed here.
I also feel that we should reflect on the fact that we are not in the middle of a moral or sentimental debate, but a political debate.
A political debate is based on two pillars: force and law, on the understanding that force must be subject to law and that there is a place where law must be exercised, and that is the United Nations.
It is indeed premature, I feel, in view of the discussion which has just taken place, to think the European Union might have a seat at the United Nations, because one wonders what opinion it would express there.
That said, there are members of the European Union that have a seat at the United Nations, and the European Union could perhaps reflect on finding a solution to the current debate.
Clearly, the United Nations must be involved, clearly, the permanent members of the Security Council which belong to the European Union must adopt a position.
Which position must they adopt?
Which mandate can be given to them, providing that a mandate is possible in this situation?
In any case, what position will the countries of the European Union - those that are also members of the UN Security Council - adopt if the latter is invoked?
This is the real question which, at the same time, sets out the limit of this debate.
Mr President, preparations are under way for a war that could have devastating consequences for the population of the whole world .
For my part, I firmly believe that a country must be built on the rule of law, and this applies nationally and internationally. All countries must comply with international law, including Iraq and - lest we forget - the US.
All countries must comply with this legislation, and they have no right to take liberties that are not provided for in legislation that has been enacted jointly.
In answer to Commissioner Patten's question regarding the way forward, I believe the key issue is to bolster our relations with the Arab world and to get it to put pressure on Saddam Hussein.
There must be a better alternative to making enemies for ourselves in the Arab world.
Naturally we must demand that the weapons inspectors be allowed back unhindered.
We want peace in the Middle East.
We want a Palestinian State.
That goes without saying.
The sanctions currently in place against Iraq, and which have been in place for 12 years, have brought enormous suffering to the Iraqi people.
According to the UN's own figures, one and a half million people, including 600 000 children, have died as a direct consequence.
Moreover, the country has been subject to low intensity bombing for several years.
This has strengthened Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship instead of weakening it.
A war such as that currently being prepared will, of course, undermine world peace and security.
The EU must therefore speak with one voice, and a strong one at that.
It is the prerogative of the Iraqi people to establish their own democratic regime; this cannot be achieved with bombs.
International law and the UN Charter must be respected, and the EU must state unequivocally that the international community has a duty to solve conflicts peacefully.
'Yes' to weapons inspectors, but 'No' to war against Iraq!
That concludes the 'catch the eye' section of this debate.
I thank all colleagues who have contributed and apologise to all those who have not been called, but it is in the nature of the 'catch the eye' procedure that we cannot take everyone in the time available.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the conclusions of the informal Elsinore Council were reasonable; it agreed to explore all avenues for a non-military solution to this problem, including sending in inspectors.
However, for this to succeed, for example getting inspectors into Iraq, means Saddam Hussein honouring his obligations.
That needs to be made crystal clear.
We cannot allow him to act as judge and jury here.
There needs to be broad agreement that Saddam Hussein must go.
But this can only succeed if various viewpoints are taken on board.
Unlike Mr Sakellariou, I believe that pre-emptive wars are acceptable.
However, they are only acceptable if there is evidence of immediate danger and proof that there is a greater risk than without a pre-emptive war.
Such evidence is not forthcoming at present and we can therefore see no justification for war.
Nor has proper consideration been given to whether starting such a war and terminating Saddam Hussein's regime would not lead to changes in other parts of the Islamic world involving far greater risks than allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power.
Destroying the coalition against terror and establishing fundamentalist regimes in the 'moderate' Arab countries could have very negative consequences, particularly for us in Europe.
This needs to be weighed in the balance if we wish to succeed.
For example, we also need to consider what the direct consequences of such a military conflict would be for Iraq's minorities, given what Saddam Hussein has done to the Kurds or other population groups in the south of his country in given situations.
This all needs to be taken into account in weighing up the situation.
We Europeans, however, can only drive forward this process of weighing up the situation if we have a common view.
That is a prerequisite.
Neither Mr Blair's position on one side nor Mr SchrÃ¶der's position on the other is very helpful in trying to reach such a common stance.
I believe that the only way to stop the Americans going ahead unilaterally is by means of such a united approach.
There is a debate raging about this even in America itself.
If the US is aware that we in Europe are presenting a united front on this issue, it will be possible to get certain points accepted.
Since 11 September, approaches have been adopted that may be understandable but are nevertheless dangerous.
Since the events of 11 September, Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been discussed but not implemented, because implementing it would have meant that we in Europe were involved in joint strategic planning and decision-making.
So we Europeans have to ask ourselves this fundamental question: Can we position ourselves as partners and take part in the decision-making process, or we will just be ordered into action when the decision has been made and a war is imminent?
This also has fundamental implications for future transatlantic relations.
Parliament should endeavour to support the Council and the Commission in pursuing this common policy approach, because that is the best way of both getting rid of Saddam Hussein and avoiding a war.
Mr President, on the eve of the anniversary of 11 September, Europe must, more than ever, speak with a single voice and defend peace.
Europe must firmly tell the world once again that the fight against terrorism, which it supports unreservedly, cannot involve war and that a so-called preventative war against Iraq would, on the contrary, sacrifice a nation, would cause unrest in the Middle East, and would have no guaranteed outcome.
Europe is faced with an historic opportunity to speak with a single voice and to distance itself from the policy of the axis of evil that the United States is trying to impose whether we like it or not.
In its report of 16 May on Iraq, the European Parliament called, in particular, for the UN to play a crucial role in seeking a regional, political and peaceful settlement, and for Europe to adopt a common position on the issue at last.
These words have been almost completely disregarded.
Once again, Europe is divided on which strategy it should follow.
Baghdad is wavering over whether to open its doors to UNMOVIC inspectors and the Iraqi people are continuing to mourn the victims of an inhuman embargo which has failed to destabilise the regime of Saddam Hussein, whilst President Bush is mounting his crusade of good, blatantly breaching international law in doing so.
What game are we playing?
That is why I shall avoid beating around the bush and ask the Commission and the Council the questions that are on everyone's lips today.
What guarantees can Europe offer Iraq that the UNMOVIC inspections will be carried out fairly, that they will have a time limit and that they will ultimately lead to the lifting of economic sanctions?
In other words, that these inspections will not, as before the 1998 crisis, be infiltrated by US intelligence officers taking notes on locations to bomb in the future.
Secondly, what guarantees can Europe give Baghdad that, once it has been proven that its arsenal has been dismantled or it has been verified that there are no weapons of mass destruction, America will not immediately attack, once they can see that the regime is not armed?
Although Europe is seeking to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we all know that the United States want the regime overturned.
Is this indeed Europe's mission to seek to overturn regimes?
There are certainly other regimes that we would like to see overturned!
Thirdly, what would Europe's reaction be if an attack against Iraq were carried out without the backing of the UN?
A war against Iraq would not be fair, appropriate, or effective.
It would not be fair because, without the green light from the UN, it would be an affront to international law.
It would not be clean because, as Mr Morillon has said, there is no such thing as a clean war, not to mention the fact that it would be an experimental war in new weapons, which would harm the Iraqi population.
It would not be effective because, in terms of the fight against terrorism, and Afghanistan is proof of this, bombs are of no use. Osama bin Laden is still at large and Saddam Hussein will, in all probability, remain at large.
That is why, when I hear Mr Van Orden speak I am afraid, as I was when I heard Mr Blair speak yesterday, I have just one message, based on the words of the Count of Auteroche at the battle of Fontenoy: if the English wish to support our American friends, they can fire first, but they cannot count on us to support them!
Mr President, I know that the President-in-Office, a highly respected former colleague in this House, will take back our views to the General Affairs Council.
There may be no consensus among the Member States, but there is broad consensus in this House.
Since the end of the Gulf War, our strategy has been one of containment and deterrence.
To change that strategy, we need compelling evidence that our objectives in the regions would be better served by military strikes.
Even with such evidence, military action should not be undertaken without clear and realistic political objectives and a commitment to finance and administer the necessary reconstruction.
To win a war against terrorism in one country, you need broad consensus of support in that country.
To win a war against terror across borders, we need to build a consensus across borders.
The Council must unite, either to agree such objectives, to make such a commitment, to build such a consensus, or to rein in the declared ambitions of the United States.
Mr President-in-Office, an opinion poll by the German Marshall Fund and the Council on Foreign Relations shows that two European citizens in three support the Union acting in this way.
We in this debate are urging you to seize the initiative.
Mr President, the truncated speech by Mr Haarder and the much longer statement by Mr Patten give us cause for concern, dismay and alarm, particularly after the British Prime Minister's warmongering in Sedgefield yesterday.
It is evident that the unstated assumption by the European authorities - with the remarkable exception of the German Republic - is that war is, by now, a certainty.
Never mind that there is no scrap of evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, even nuclear weapons, never mind that Mr Blair has again postponed the publication of his own private dossier on the matter.
There is no doubt that, as with Enron's creative accounting, the CIA are working on creative evidence.
Confronted with such an imminent disaster for humankind, the Council and the Commission are taking the wrong - although expected - stand.
As the French newspaper le Figaro puts it, 'confronted with American intransigence Europe excels again in its inclination to compromise'.
Compromise in this case is offered by the figleaf of the United Nations, a figleaf that in this specific case covers much more than has been covered by UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.
Unfettered, unconditional, intrusive access by United Nations inspectors, let us say Anglo-American inspectors, to every site in Iraq - something which Mr Rumsfeld himself expects to be rejected out of hand by the infamous Baghdad dictator.
After that only one alternative: war.
Unfortunately, what we have heard today from Mr Haarder and Commissioner Patten confirms our belief that there is a growing gap between the people of Europe and these governing bodies, a gap which this war will enlarge with deleterious consequences for the future of the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the end of this debate, I am left with a number of questions.
The condemnation of the dictator Saddam Hussein appears unanimous.
Are we not forgetting, though, that in the eyes of some Muslims and even of huge groups of them, he is considered a hero?
This is a major problem.
Secondly, how far does this unanimity extend?
Are we convinced that the resumption of weapons inspections will bring any closer the solutions we want?
Do we think that these should be unconditional?
Do we think we should set an ultimatum?
Should this ultimatum be set by the UN?
And what conclusions will we draw if nothing, or something, is found?
In my view, all these scenarios should be thought through beforehand.
Is the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq a necessary or satisfactory reason to start a war?
Or will we then want to enter into negotiations concerning their dismantling?
Who will provide proof of the existence of these weapons of mass destruction?
Some of our fellow MEPs are already saying that this proof is there because he had them before.
On the other hand, a number of weapons are reported to have been destroyed during the second Gulf War.
Are people in the EU agreed on the interests that are really at stake in the Middle East, on this region's stability, on the risk that the Gulf States are running?
Not that they are models of democracy, but what will happen to them?
What happens if a prior solution is not reached for Israel and Palestine?
Are we getting any nearer to a solution?
Is it the EU's intention to avoid a war against Iraq only in the short term?
Is the aim to bring down Saddam Hussein?
Or would we much rather broker peace in the Middle East, as the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the problem?
Should we not express our aspiration to defend human rights and democracy so that partnerships can be forged in future?
In my view, the solution we need is long-term.
I would also like to know whether the EU will take an initiative to let the UN play a prominent role in the Middle East once again?
Apparently, this question was not even raised in Elsinore.
Are the two European countries on the Security Council, namely the United Kingdom and France, on the same wavelength?
Probably not, for the signs are there for everyone to see.
I have a few more questions, but time is running out.
However, I should like to finish with one final question.
Is it right for Denmark to give itself one month to find a compromise which is also acceptable to the Americans if we establish that the European themselves are still struggling with so many problems?
How many subscribe to Mr SchrÃ¶der's opinion?
Not only are we, along with Mr SchrÃ¶der, saying 'no' to war now; we also want Europe to have the objective of establishing stable and lasting peace in the Middle East.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I served in the American Army in the 1950s, so I have a little knowledge of the horrors of war.
I also want to say that George Orwell would find it difficult to create characters like Rumsfeld, Cheney and Ashcroft.
It is very important to ask ourselves what precisely do we mean by weapons of mass destruction.
Are we talking about Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Cambodia, or even Korea, where I served in the American Army?
What precisely is our definition, and what are they and where are they?
A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness.
The 22 million Iraqi people have already suffered enormous pain and loss.
They are now threatened with a full-scale invasion by a so-called Christian power, resulting in countless dead.
It will be seen for what it surely will be: a crusade by the West against Islam.
We are told that Israel will use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances.
Yet we have no evidence, as has been constantly repeated in this House this morning, that Iraq has weapons of the kind referred to by the hawks in the American Government.
US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, is proclaiming that Iraq is giving refuge to al-Qa'ida terrorists.
Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing.
Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder.
The American Government talks about saving civilisation - a 200-year-old civilisation or a 5000-year-old civilisation?
One has to really ask the question: who is the American Government really out to save?
The American Government could be boosting the armaments or the oil industries at home or it could be geared towards the re-election prospects of President George Bush, Ã  la Margaret Thatcher.
We will certainly see a rise in Islamic fundamentalism and individual attacks on Western targets will continue unabated, even on a freelance basis, should this war take place.
I urge the Iraqi regime to change course and allow UN inspectors to be readmitted to Iraq now.
Finally, I ask the media to examine their conscience and ask: why now, why not then?
Mr President, one might wonder whether we are in Parliament or whether we are listening to continuous CNN propaganda.
What has been said about Saddam Hussein could be said about countless other heads of State the world over.
We are well aware, since we are the representatives of the nation States, that the Member States are, by nature, cold-hearted monsters, so cold-hearted that they only very rarely back down in the face of war, especially when seeing where they stand in the power stakes leads them to assume an imperial mindset, which is the case today of the United States which is fuelling potential conflict situations, throughout the world, in the simple, albeit acknowledged aim of achieving world domination.
This is absolute madness, because let there be no doubt, it is not the United Nations that is waging war, it is the Empire.
Imperialism equates to war.
In order to prevent Member States engaging on this slippery slope, a few rules were drawn up through the ages, which, in the twentieth century, took on the name of collective security.
Unfortunately, in the same way as the efforts of The Hague were scuppered in 1905 by the First World War, the efforts of the League of Nations were scuppered by the 'Imperial' and not the 'National'; the Imperial Hitler Socialism and, more specifically, its preventative wars, particularly in the Sudeten region.
In 1948, we had to start again from scratch.
That was the task of the UN founders and of the UN Charter, which now forms the backbone of any international order.
In our book, war is banned.
War is only permitted in specific cases, framed by stringent rules which assume, on the one hand, the support of the Security Council and, on the other hand, the monitoring of military operations by a major multinational State, itself placed under the authority of the Security Council.
We are brushing all that aside today .
We are completely brushing aside international law.
This is an enormous breach of the law.
We are now in the middle of a discussion to determine whether we shall condemn a State which is, led by its own President, contravening international law, whereas Europe should quite simply condemn it, not simply out of pity - and I did indeed say pity, speaking as a Christian - for a nation, which has, for ten years, been suffering genuine martyrdom and upon which we are turning our backs because it reminds us of our own powerlessness, but we must, above all, think of the very concept of law, with which Europe has become synonymous for centuries.
It is this concept that the United States is now disregarding, thus opening the door to new acts of barbarism.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Watson is right: the Council's position does not surprise us because, as illustrated so well by Mr Pasqua earlier, there is no more of a common foreign and security policy than a common policy in Europe.
Our positions will never be similar, but Europe should, at the very least, remember that it has become synonymous, as has France, with the concept of law and this is much to its credit.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the American and British governments are preparing a general military offensive against Iraq, a small country of 19 million people, a member of the United Nations Organisation, in order to overturn Saddam Hussein's government which they - the self-appointed global police - suspect of posing, sic, 'a threat to world security'.
In doing so, they are violating the United Nations' Charter, international law and, more generally speaking, people's rights.
Since the end of the Gulf War, America and Britain have, in fact, never called a halt to their air attacks on Iraq and have caused, by imposing sanctions - a genuine crime against humanity - the poverty and death of civilian populations and, according to the UN, the death of more than one million children.
It is surprising that, although a number of countries, including the allies of the United States are dictatorships, Iraq, a Muslim country that is secular and tolerant towards religions and minorities - the Deputy Prime Minister is Christian and three government ministers are Kurds - is their number one target.
It is also surprising that these western superpowers, paragons of democratic virtues, are preparing so cynically to breach the peace.
You are against the death penalty for murderers, but the British and the Americans are going to murder thousands of Iraqis and their children.
This preventative war is unacceptable and you are well aware that real reasons are immoral; in fact, this war is essentially for electoral purposes and to protect oil supplies.
(Applause from the Non-attached Members)
Mr President, I should like to express my thanks for a good debate with many sound viewpoints and many good pieces of advice.
It is a difficult matter we are debating, but it is also a very simple matter.
I have very deliberately confined myself to the crux of the matter, namely that the EU wishes to put maximum pressure on the dictator, Saddam Hussein to get him to comply with the UN resolution and the conditions to which he himself has agreed.
That is not a weak but, on the contrary, a strong position.
Everything we say and do must put maximum pressure upon Saddam Hussein.
Strong and combined international pressure of this kind is the only thing that can induce him to respond.
I would therefore thank you for all the reflections that have contributed to this agreement to put such pressure upon Saddam, and I would ask you to appreciate that, because of the need to do this, I am neither able nor willing to adopt positions on all contingencies.
I can assure both Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and others that what Mr Patten said was, in every detail, in accordance with what is the common EU position, confirmed once again in Elsinore at the weekend.
It was an informal meeting with no new decisions taken, but I can readily divulge that there was support for maintaining the existing policy and for the importance of broad consultation on the part of the United States, including consultation with Arab states.
There was agreement about the inspectors now having to be given the opportunity of entering Iraq and there was concern about the weapons of mass destruction that not only the United States but also UNSCOM have reasons for suspecting are being produced and that may be a deadly danger to peace in the Middle East and in the rest of the world.
The EU supports the UN's efforts.
A regime such as Saddam Hussein's can only be expected to be prepared to comply with its obligations if there is strong and combined pressure from the international community.
I should like to say to Baroness Nicholson and Mrs Napoletano that the Council fully supports Parliament's desire that everyone who has committed war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity should be held to account for their actions.
That also applies of course to those responsible for the Iraqi regime's many crimes, and it is something for which preparations must be made in time.
In connection with this, I should like to say that I am able to confirm what Mrs Maes said, to the effect that the Danish Presidency has set a deadline of a month for a dialogue with the United States on the International Criminal Court.
I am able to confirm that this is what was at issue.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo would have liked me to report on the EU's latest efforts to help solve the Middle East conflict.
I cannot give a detailed answer to his request but, like Mr Patten, I am able to inform you that my colleague, Mr MÃžller, is in the Middle East right now to present a proposal from the EU for a practical timetable or 'road map' for establishing a legitimate Palestinian state by June 2005.
We are confident that there is broad support for this initiative, which can contribute significantly to further progress in the positive process which the Quartet has succeeded in setting in motion and in which we must place all our hopes.
Mr President, I think that it is probably true that I have had the honour, and always the pleasure, of replying to more debates in this Parliament than any other Commissioner in the last three years, such is Parliament's welcome interest in external affairs.
For me this has been one of the most interesting and important debates.
It is no business of mine how Parliament conducts its affairs, but if one of the reasons for the interest and informed passion of this debate has been the formula which you have applied on this occasion, that which I think you call 'catching-the-eye', then I, for one, very much welcome it.
I think that there are more people in the Chamber than normal.
If Parliament does not mind me making the point, in my experience we have had the rather more unusual spectacle of people waiting to hear other people's speeches.
I am even delighted to discover that one or two people have come back into the Chamber to hear the winding-up speeches which is a particular and rare pleasure.
So speaking for my humble self, in the expectation that I will have rather a lot more debates to reply to in the next couple of years - unless Parliament focuses its interest entirely on domestic affairs - I found this an extremely welcome breakthrough.
I was asked one specific question, and another rhetorical question to which I will return.
General Morillon asked the specific question of what we know about the attitude of the people of Iraq to their own regime, what we know about their ambitions and aspirations.
The sad truth is that we know damn all because they have not had the opportunity to express their views for all too long.
Indeed, the expression of free opinions in Iraq has led to people being shot, tortured and stuck in jail.
I look forward to the day when we will know rather more about the aspirations of the people of Iraq but I have my doubts as to whether, in a free election, Saddam Hussein would sweep back with a plurality of the votes.
I should confess to a personal prejudice at this point.
I have never regarded enthusiasm as a huge attribute in the discussion of foreign policy.
I think enthusiasm does not always go well with the discussion of difficult foreign policy issues and I have always preferred foreign ministers who are prepared to sit under the tree for a bit and think what needs to be done first, rather than those who tear around trying to change the world.
I find myself signed up enthusiastically to the famous dictum of Talleyrand 'surtout pas trop de zÃšle'.
Reading so many articles over the last summer on Iraq and so many speeches, I have sometimes wished that I believed in the veracity and wisdom of anything I say as fervently as some people seem to believe in the veracity and wisdom of everything they say.
I also think that we have seen a parade of certainties sometimes based on obfuscation.
I know very few people, for example, who seriously contend that Saddam Hussein is not in possession of any weapons of mass destruction.
As I said earlier, if he is without any weapons of mass destruction, then what is the problem about letting inspectors in?
When we are asked to define weapons of mass destruction, I suspect it is a question which could be put with some benefit to the Kurds in Iraq or to the people who live in the marshes in the south of Iraq, who could explain what chemical weapons do to your lungs.
Those would be very good replies.
Some of the certainties are also based on evasions and, from time to time, on a lack of willingness to enunciate clear, consistent and defensible principles.
I just want to refer to a number of questions that we need to face up to.
They go right to the heart of the issue of compliance with the United Nations and the whole issue of the justification for military action - an issue which was widely debated during the campaign in Kosovo and a question which goes to the heart of the matter we have debated on many occasions in this Chamber - the so-called clash of civilisations.
My first question is what happens if Iraq continues to defy existing UN resolutions?
Do we simply shrug our shoulders?
Secondly, what happens if we go back to the United Nations Security Council, get a new resolution and Saddam Hussein defies that?
What do we do then?
Do we simply wring our hands?
Thirdly, what happens if we give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum and he defies it? What do we do?
Write a letter to Le Monde, sign a petition?
There have been several references - not all of them as laudatory as Mr Alastair Campbell might have liked - to the press conference which the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland gave in his constituency yesterday.
The honourable Member Mr Lagendijk, for example, referred to what he said.
Let me quote one thing which Mr Blair said yesterday: the UN had to be a way of dealing with it - i.e. the problem caused by Iraq - not a way of avoiding dealing with it.
While I am not a paid-up member of New Labour, that is a pretty good point and one which we simply cannot duck.
My fourth question concerns a point which Dr Kissinger has often reminded us of.
Since the Treaty of Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years War, international law, itself sometimes a rather nebulous concept, has been based on, among other principles, the principle that one state should not intervene in the affairs of another and certainly should not intervene militarily.
Is that an entirely adequate principle of international law today?
We saw the debate begun a couple of years ago by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, about whether humanitarian intervention was sometimes justified, for example when a sovereign government could be accused of assaulting the interests and the liberties and the rights of its own people.
Is intervention in the affairs of another sovereign state justified by its possession of weapons of mass destruction?
Can you turn that into an acceptable principle?
Does it depend entirely on context?
Does it depend on the nature of the regime?
Does it depend on the stated intentions of the regime?
Does it depend on the scale of threat represented by that regime?
Whatever else you say, clearly if you are arguing along those lines you will need to present a good deal of evidence.
Finally, on the question of justifying intervention, there is the point which Dr Kissinger argued very explicitly in a recent article in The New York Times.
He argues that terrorism raises an entirely new issue for nation states.
Today, he argues, one nation state can be faced with a threat from another nation state operating through non-state actors.
In other words, the argument is that intervention could be justified where a nation state appears to be using terrorist organisations to threaten another nation state.
At the very least I imagine all of us would argue that military intervention in a sovereign state demands a clear and well-argued justification.
Those are all issues which will be very near the heart of foreign and security policy debates in the next decade or longer.
They are issues on which we in the European Union, not least because of our tradition of the rule of law, not least because of the other principles in which we believe, should have clear and unequivocal opinions.
The final question is: if the present government in Iraq is replaced as a result of military intervention, will that make the politics of the region more moderate or will it make the politics of the region more extreme?
All those are questions which we cannot duck.
They are all questions to which we will have to find our own answers over the coming weeks and months.
I would like to finish with this thought.
There has been a lot of reference to our relationship with the United States.
I very much hope that we can work together with the United States - Europe and the United States - over the coming months to deal with an undoubted threat to world peace and to international stability.
We on our side may from time to time sound to Americans as though we are speaking with a rather self-serving condescension in arguing that United States leadership should be based on as broad a moral consensus as possible, referring to the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which helped to secure our futures, our prosperity, our freedom in Europe.
But we in Europe, if we are to pull on our end of the rope, have to face up to one or two rather difficult issues ourselves.
We must avoid wishful thinking and we must avoid ducking the difficult questions which I have addressed during these remarks today.
I am sure this will not be the last time we debate this issue.
I hope we can clarify our responses to some of those questions in the weeks and months ahead.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I want to apologise to Commissioner Patten because in my speech I gave him the title of Vice-President of the Commission.
It was a lapsus due to the Convention.
I hope that Commissioner Patten will not be offended.
Mr President, I shall respond to that very courteous point.
I am always delighted to be identified with Mr Kinnock, and even more delighted from time to time to be identified with the honourable gentleman's Spanish colleagues Mr Solana and Mrs de Palacio!
The debate is closed.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Afghanistan.
Mr President, I should like firstly to congratulate Parliament on the 'catch the eye' form of debate we have just tested in practice.
For a former parliamentarian, all these debates with planned speaking times have been a misery. Relief was at hand, however, and the delightful experience of real debates with spontaneous contributions in which people respond to each other instead of reading from pre-prepared scripts.
Where Afghanistan is concerned, I should like firstly to draw attention to the fact that, a year ago, Afghanistan was a country in ruins, which initially suffered under an occupying power and a succession of warlords and then under an extreme Islamic revolution which forced through the de-modernisation of society and introduced mediaeval methods.
Finally, the country became the domicile of fundamentalist terrorists.
That is what makes it that much more significant and that much more of a pleasure to be able now - nine months after the Bonn process was set in motion - to report on a country in which the situation is gradually being normalised.
There is nonetheless a long way to go before there can again be talk of a stable Afghanistan.
There continues to be inadequate security in the country.
In July, Vice-President Haji Qadir was killed openly in the street.
Conflicts between local warlords continue, and serious infringements of human rights continue to take place.
The conclusion of the Bonn Agreement of December 2001 between Afghan groups under UN leadership marked the start of the positive development we are now seeing in Afghanistan.
The Bonn Agreement lays down a process for the re-introduction of democracy.
As a first step, an interim government was established which governed the country for six months until a hastily convened council of elders, Loya Jirga, met in June and appointed a transitional government headed by Mr Karzai who is to lead the country for two years until elections are held.
The convening of this Loya Jirga and the formation of the transitional government were essential steps forward.
The Loya Jirga process and the regional and district elections showed that Afghans throughout the country have the desire and the courage to participate in the process of democratisation.
Afghan women played a striking role.
There have been attempts to mediate in the conflicts in Afghanistan.
If the Bonn process seems to be a success, this is particularly due to the fact that it is founded on traditional structures in the country, based upon the need to secure a broad representation of the various ethnic and religious groups.
It is precisely the securing of representativeness and the protection of minorities that are the keys to long-term stability in the country.
Afghan ownership is another code word.
Even though the UN has operated as an essential catalyst in the process that is now developing, it has played its role with full respect and support for Afghan ownership of the process.
The re-establishment of an Afghan state that can secure unity, peace and stability in the country and guarantee the observance of human rights is absolutely crucial.
Progress is slow and the transitional government still has difficulty controlling large parts of the country where, as a result, local warlords and bands of robbers have an easy time of it.
Central to the efforts to promote security is the establishment of an Afghan army and police force in which the population has confidence and which operates with respect for human rights.
In that connection, the EU has expressed great satisfaction with the setting up of Afghanistan's National Defence Council.
Just as important a factor is the state's ability to deliver development, including access to health services.
A large number of Afghan refugees have returned, and those who have done so need international aid to secure their permanent reintegration.
On the issue of the return of refugees, I am delighted to note that, according to the UNHCR, the situation in Afghanistan has now improved in such a way that the great majority of Afghans are able to return voluntarily without risking persecution.
I agree with the UNHCR that their return should be supported by relevant relief measures put in place by the international community and that individual Afghans should be offered 'realistic repatriation packages'.
Seville gave high priority to adopting measures to promote an accelerated return to Afghanistan.
In cooperation with the Commission and the Member States, the Danish Presidency will make efforts to comply with the Seville Declaration.
I myself also had a meeting with Ruud Lubbers a short time beforehand.
There are still forces that are seeking to knock developments in Afghanistan off course.
There are still various ethnic groups that, with the support of groups in neighbouring countries, do not believe that their own particular viewpoints are adequately represented.
There are various warlords who, for long periods, have become accustomed to a high degree of self-determination in those areas they control and who have resisted the establishment of a central government.
There are also different points of view as to how quickly and how far Afghanistan can move in the direction of a modern Islamic state with close contacts with the West.
The hope is that, by setting up a democratic process, opportunities will be created for solving these conflicts through political negotiations rather than through a return to the pointless fighting of the past.
The relatively encouraging development is also due to the fact that the international community has committed itself to Afghanistan.
The United States played a decisive role in the rapid removal of the Taliban government through Operation Enduring Freedom.
The American-led forces are still present in the country, combating the last remaining pockets of al-Qa'ida fighters.
In and around Kabul, the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, is helping to ensure stability so that the interim government is able to operate.
The EU also attaches importance to helping promote stability in Afghanistan and in the region.
The country must not again become a seedbed of terrorism and of drugs production.
We wish to support the Afghan people in their efforts to secure peaceful development.
Together, the EU Member States contribute the larger part of the ISAF force and are the largest international providers of aid.
The Commission's and the Member States' combined promise of aid amounts in 2002 to more than EUR 550 million.
Recently - or, more specifically, on 22 July - the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted conclusions concerning the situation in Afghanistan.
It was stated that, in dialogue with the transitional government, the EU would proceed on the basis of the key principles agreed by the Afghan parties and the international community.
The principles are stated in the Bonn Agreement, the final declaration from the Tokyo Summit in January and UN Security Council resolution 1419.
The principles include the formation of a broadly constituted, multi-ethnic and representative government, in which women too participate.
Through its special representative, Mr Vendrell, the EU is maintaining a close political dialogue with the government in Kabul and other Afghan parties.
The purpose is to help developments proceed in the right direction.
Dialogues are also being conducted with the countries neighbouring Afghanistan in order to ensure their cooperation.
International commitment to Afghanistan will in the last analysis depend upon whether the Afghan parties really make efforts to achieve the stated objectives.
The EU will therefore attempt to promote a process in which, in partnership with the international community, Afghanistan's transitional government develops verifiable criteria and monitoring systems in connection with the considerable aid that is being given.
The EU will promote the allocation of aid in a way that strengthens the central government and weakens those who are not involved in, or who are directly opposed to, the Bonn process. At the same time, it will be ensured that the population as a whole shares in the aid as a visible peace dividend.
The financial situation in Afghanistan is characterised by a serious budget deficit, and the government will soon be in no position to pay out wages.
Direct budgetary aid will therefore also be necessary to ensure political stability in Afghanistan.
The international community and the EU can therefore strengthen the peace process.
Whether those steps in the right direction we are now witnessing in Afghanistan can be translated into genuine and sustained improvements of the situation will, when all is said and done, depend upon the Afghan people's own desire to support the process that has been set in motion.
Mr President, I am extremely surprised because the Conference of Presidents has - unanimously - asked the Council and the Commission to specifically include in this morning's statement the issue of war crimes allegations in Afghanistan, which have recently been acknowledged by the UN.
I am extremely surprised that nothing has been said on this issue, and I would like to ask you, Mr President, to ask Mr Haarder to expand on his statement so that it includes the subject that the Conference of Presidents specifically requested.
As I was not present at the Conference of Presidents I do not know about your discussion, but Mr Haarder will have a chance to reply at the end of the debate.
If he then wishes to take up that matter he is free to do so.
The Minister may well want, on behalf of the presidency, to say a word about those allegations of human rights atrocities.
I was certainly intending to say something myself, which I do not imagine will be very different from the presidency's remarks.
Indeed it would be a cause of considerable diplomatic anxiety were we to be saying anything very different on this subject.
I am sure we will not.
I would like to thank Parliament for this timely opportunity to review the situation in Afghanistan.
It is almost a year ago that the events of 11 September catapulted a country which the European Commission's humanitarian office had labelled a 'forgotten crisis' at the beginning of that year, into the limelight of world attention.
Since then we have witnessed remarkable changes for the better: the Taliban regime imploded more rapidly than some expected, leading to the installation of an interim authority which soon established its credentials around the world and - even more importantly - managed to develop a balanced relationship with its neighbours.
In June this year, an Emergency Loya Jirga brought to power a Transitional Authority which has more democratic legitimacy than any of the previous regimes over the last two decades.
By and large therefore, the Bonn process is on track.
However, there is still a pretty bumpy road ahead.
As Afghanistan moves into the post-Loya Jirga phase, a number of key challenges need to be addressed.
The most imminent is internal security - or rather, to be more accurate, the lack of it.
So far, President Karzai has found it extremely difficult to extend the authority of the central government to the regions, despite his own formidable efforts.
This challenge is linked to the difficulty of turning warlords into politicians.
Some of them continue to thrive on drugs and other illicit trade; some profit from their involvement in the Operation Enduring Freedom; others are attempting to openly challenge the leadership of President Karzai.
In this fluid environment, concerted long-term international support for the central government is more crucial than ever.
This brings me to my second point.
Unless President Karzai manages to show that the trust he generates among the international community in its turn generates tangible economic benefits and improved security, he will not find it easy to convince his rivals that he is the best man to lead the country through this difficult transitional period.
As the going gets tougher, he needs even more of our support.
The Commission is therefore pursuing - along with other donors - a two-pronged strategy: delivering a tangible peace dividend to the population as swiftly as possible, while ensuring that most of this assistance flows through the central government.
In turn - and this is my third point - we insist absolutely on the conditionality of our assistance.
In a nutshell, this means strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Bonn process as well as to sound macroeconomic and financial management.
Let me turn briefly to the Bonn Agreement.
The appointment of the Constitutional Commission is due very shortly.
This Commission's work paves the way for the general elections due by mid-2004.
It will have to make difficult decisions on the future centre-provincial structure, the question of secular versus Islamic society, gender issues and the role of minorities, to name but a few thorny questions.
This Commission, together with the Judicial Commission, will also have an impact on the dealings with war criminals, both past and present.
It will take time to find lasting solutions to many of these issues.
The important thing, however, is that we see this country progressing, with our assistance, towards peace and long-term stability.
The issue which was raised earlier about human rights atrocities is of very considerable concern to the international community.
Among other fora, it was discussed by the Security Council in a meeting on 28 August.
The UN, I am pleased to say, is prepared to assist the government in a future investigation.
At the moment it is important to keep the grave site protected and to protect potential witnesses before an active investigation can be carried out.
In my judgement, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan - UNAMA - is best placed to handle this delicate issue, supporting the key role of the Afghan Human Rights Commission in taking future steps.
We totally accept that it will be necessary to take future steps and to be as transparent about the process as possible.
The need for steady, long-term progress must not distract us from the huge and immediate humanitarian challenge.
Since March this year, 1.5 million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan under the UN repatriation programme.
A further 116 000 have returned from Iran.
This is an impressive number but it is creating a large problem for the aid agencies.
The same is true of the large number of internally displaced people.
The international community is now faced with additional demands, both on the humanitarian and on the security front.
These bills come on top of the EUR 1.8 billion pledged for 2002 in Tokyo in January.
In such an environment, it is important to get priorities right, since it is unrealistic to assume that all the additional funding requests are going to be met at once.
One such issue is the funding for the increased rate of return of refugees where some international agencies have claimed Europe has not been generous enough.
I can speak for the European Commission.
We have more than doubled the humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year - from EUR 25 million initially earmarked at the beginning of the year to EUR 60 million at present.
However, I believe it is a mistake to look at this issue solely in quantitative terms.
The foremost challenge is - and this has been our line from the start - to ensure that this summer's returnees do not become again this winter's refugees.
Our interventions are therefore carefully linked to the overall sustainability of the return programme.
For our rural recovery programme, the migratory flows are one important criterion for the selection of areas of intervention.
Another important selection criterion is dependence on poppy production.
Together with a few other donors, the Commission is leading the debate on how best to develop alternative livelihoods.
All these issues throw up one unavoidable conclusion: Afghanistan needs partners who are prepared to be there for the long haul.
This, however, is not to say that we cannot point to early achievements in our aid effort.
Let me give you a few examples.
Under the Aid to Uprooted People's programme, the Commission is funding the operation of 450 primary schools around the country in Afghanistan.
We are now supporting over 200 clinics, three district- and three provincial-level hospitals.
Our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes are providing over 3 million person-days of work this year alone.
Under a contract with Habitat, we are cleaning up five cities around Afghanistan, preventing diseases like cholera.
We are co-financing a massive mine-clearance operation.
We are contributing more than any other donor to the operating costs of the government (EUR 50 million from the Asia and Latin America budget and EUR 2.5 million from the Rapid Reaction Mechanism).
While less visible, these sums finance the salaries of essential government servants, including nurses, doctors, policemen, teachers and civil servants.
Regarding performance, I am pleased to say that Afghanistan proves that the reform of the management of external assistance produces results even under the most difficult of circumstances.
Of the EUR 120 million available so far for recovery and reconstruction, EUR 100 million has already been contracted.
This figure does not include the EUR 45 million in humanitarian aid under the ECHO programme, which has already been committed, or the further EUR 15 million due to be committed under the same programme before the end of the year.
I understand that Parliament will vote on a draft supplementary amending budget for the remaining EUR 70 million pledged for 2002 in October.
It is intended for further support to the public administration, for much needed infrastructure projects and for a primary health care package.
Preparations for implementation of this programme are well advanced.
I can assure Parliament that these funds will be put to immediate use once approved.
So we will have committed in Afghanistan this year - committed and largely spent - almost EUR 250 million - a good step forward in discharging our pledge to spend EUR 1 billion over 5 years.
That, the House will recall, has been achieved almost from a standing start.
It was, of course, only possible because of the understanding of the budgetary authority - Parliament and the Member States. But it has also been achieved because of the outstanding work done on the ground by our delegation and our ECHO staff.
I cannot speak too highly of their cheerful dedication and professionalism in very tough circumstances.
I much enjoyed meeting them during my visit in May and look forward to making a return trip.
We in the Commission have good reason to be proud of those, like our team in Kabul, who do such a first-class job.
They will, I know, work as well with our new, experienced EU representative Ambassador Vendrell as they did with his committed predecessor Ambassador Klaiber.
I am determined to ensure that the European Commission remains fully engaged in Afghanistan even if world attention shifts to other places of conflict and post-conflict rehabilitation.
Let me again thank the European Parliament for its very constructive attitude in dealing with additional budgetary needs to underwrite this commitment.
I hope that as the months and years pass, Members of this Parliament will be able to go to Afghanistan - as they have been going to the Balkans in the last few years - and see European assistance being provided generously, efficiently and wisely, as it should be everywhere.
We will not be able to complete this debate before lunchtime, but we will carry on until about 12.20 p.m. so that we can take the speakers from the political groups.
Mr President, Mr Haarder, Commissioner Patten, thank you for giving us the opportunity to review the situation of this ruined country - as Mr Haarder described it last year - of this forgotten country, as the Commissioner so accurately described it.
No one here, however, has forgotten the opinions of those who considered themselves, not so long ago, to be experts on Afghanistan and who recommended reaching an agreement with the Taliban regime, on the pretext of implementing a realpolitik which would mean that only the Taliban would be able to guarantee some semblance of peace in this ill-fated country which has been torn apart for so long - you mentioned this, Mr Haarder - by tribal feuds.
The risk was that the country would once again fall prey to various warlords once the Taliban regime had been eliminated.
That is why we can only welcome the fact that, despite these forecasts, Afghanistan is not being torn apart today and that the progress we have already made in restoring order in the country is, on the contrary, encouraging.
The progress made is, of course, encouraging, as you have said, Mr Haarder, but it is far from satisfactory.
The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa'ida and Mullah Omar is far from over, security in Afghanistan is not, therefore, guaranteed, the reorganisation needed in Afghanistan - which involves creating institutions to ensure the representation of all ethnic groups and respect for international law and human rights - has only just got underway, and, lastly, because the large-scale return of refugees has only served to exacerbate the already disastrous humanitarian situation caused by the war and the drought which have been raging for years.
I shall return to all these points in order, if I may.
The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa'ida and Mullah Omar is far from over because we have no idea what has happened to them, for it is unlikely that they could have found refuge in areas bordering on Afghanistan, in the uncontrolled territory of the Pashtun tribes in Pakistan, but there is nothing to prove either, as far as I know, that they are not still hiding somewhere in the very heart of Afghanistan.
The security of the country is, therefore, not guaranteed.
Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder talked about the murders.
They quite rightly emphasised the difficulties caused by these attacks for our representatives on the ground, and I join you, Commissioner, in praising the dedication and bravery of these representatives.
This may be the reason for the demand made by the transitional government, by President Karzai, to all donor countries, and to the European Union in particular, to extend the mandate granted to the peacekeeping force to outside Kabul and even to the whole territory.
Like the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do not think that this is desirable.
I do not think that it is desirable for the Afghans to entrust the responsibility of maintaining order on the ground to others.
It is far more desirable, to my mind, to speed up the training of the national army and police force, which has already begun, so that the Afghans themselves can take responsibility for security in their country, as they have begun to do within the institutions.
I mentioned the reorganisation that is needed and which has been carried out by setting up institutions which ensure the representation of all ethnic groups.
You are well aware that there are on-going difficulties with the Pashtuns.
I would also point out that we are expecting a great deal, and rightly so, from the work undertaken within the framework of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs seeking to make it possible to enforce international law and respect for human rights in Afghanistan.
I welcome the news that I received yesterday that a class has begun at the French High School in Kabul which is open to women and where female students do not have to wear veils.
Lastly, I mentioned the humanitarian situation.
In this respect, and I shall conclude on this point, we can only welcome the fact that, when examining the 2002 supplementary budget, the European Union has agreed to increase aid to Afghanistan, bringing it up to EUR 250 million.
What we shall ask for is greater transparency in the way this money is used.
That is why, when examining the budget, we asked for a line indicating all the transactions made with respect to Afghanistan.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, when we endeavoured to come up with a joint motion for a resolution yesterday, we took all the issues you have touched upon today into account.
There was a really broad consensus on the points we discussed, and I do not just mean humanitarian issues and reconstruction in Afghanistan, but also other political issues.
I would like to discuss that here, but I would like to specifically mention that my colleague Mrs GrÃ¶ner will be dealing with the position of women in Afghanistan, which is a very special issue.
Our motion for a joint resolution starts with a clear condemnation of terrorism, stating that Afghanistan's historical problems also contributed to the need for intervention of this kind.
I do not want to say any more about that intervention.
It was very broadly-based and it at least attracted support and could be justified.
We believe that the role of the United Nations - and I am now returning to the same discussion that we had earlier - is not being given sufficient weight at present.
The United Nations needs to decide not only about peacekeeping measures, but also about the future of this intervention.
The United Nations also needs to define the objectives of this intervention, the time required for it, and it should also decide when this intervention should come to an end.
We believe that the moral justification we had for this intervention should also apply to the treatment of prisoners from this war, either in Afghanistan itself or outside Afghanistan, in Guantanamo.
These prisoners deserve to be treated in accordance with international law and the international conventions.
We believe that the international community bears an important responsibility for investigating and establishing the position as regards the human rights violations in northern Afghanistan that have been mentioned, and in particular those in the Dasht-e-Leile region which have been reported by the UN.
In reply to Mr Wurtz, who mentioned this point just now, I would say that we in this House should make a very clear request for the United Nations to carry out an investigation and to bring those guilty to justice once they have been tracked down.
Mr Wurtz, I regret that your group feels unable to sign this motion for a resolution, but you can at least vote for it.
Mr President, I congratulate the Commission and the team led in the Commissioner's office by Mr Fotiadis and those on the ground for the amazing work they are carrying out.
I attended the Tokyo Pledging Conference and was proud to see the way in which European Union leadership in nation rebuilding was exemplified by both the Commission and the presidency.
I congratulate the Commissioner himself and the presidency at the time - the Spanish presidency - for the way in which they conducted the business of the European Union there.
But the Commission's subsequent work has proved my view to be correct: amongst the international community blocs claiming to be able to rebuild nations, the European Union is standing alone.
And we are working in a tough and dangerous situation.
Afghanistan is a very difficult country to help.
For example the main message coming from the Afghan Government at the moment is that international pledges made in Tokyo are not being fulfilled and the government therefore cannot conduct its business.
Last Saturday I had the opportunity to speak in Tehran with the new Afghan Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
He made this very point.
I pointed out to him that the one partner on which he could firmly rely was the European Union.
I commend the priorities the Union has set itself, as the Commissioner has outlined today, because, as I said, it is not a simple matter.
Water.
One Member - Mr Morillon - has already mentioned the acute drought.
The acute drought is so widespread in the south-west of Afghanistan - it feeds across from the plain in Iran.
There are 26 major water projects under way in the Islamic Republic of Iran to try and provide the local population with water.
Over the border in Afghanistan, I have seen no water projects at all on the ground.
Yet this is the largest drought for at least 300 years.
It has hit many hundreds of thousands of people.
Of course in a drought the farmers cannot grow alternative crops.
The south-west of Afghanistan is not particularly heavily mined.
They can grow opium poppies in this drought.
Unfortunately, poppies grow extremely well in drought.
Until we put water projects in the south-west region, we cannot complain as much as we do that opium production is not being contained.
Of course it is not being contained.
The figures provided by the Afghan Government have been unintentionally misleading to the international community.
Water ought to be one of the topmost priorities.
On health care, the population is virtually at the lowest ebb.
Life expectancy is 46 years - the lowest in the world apart from Somalia.
All the health indicators show that health has been abominable for the last 23 years and there is a lack of education.
May we insist that other international donors focus on small-scale health projects to implement the World Health Organisation master plan on health.
Not large hospitals, for which there will not be enough staff or resources, but more mass immunisation, more primary health clinics, more mobile health clinics.
Could we please press other donors to focus on those areas?
Then, of course, women's rights.
I must tell you that women's rights have gone downhill, not up.
Only last week, for example, the government passed a law stating that women would not be allowed to perform music on the radio.
So it is not easy.
I congratulate the Commission and I urge it to persuade other donors to adopt the same approach as our team in Brussels and on the ground.
We are doing wonderfully well; others, I fear, are not being nearly as successful.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when my group invited the director Jamie Doran to show his film at the European Parliament on 12 June, we had three objectives in mind.
The first aim was to gain as much recognition as possible for the overwhelming validity of the war crimes allegations made by the people interviewed by the British journalist in Afghanistan.
Next, we wanted to give as much backing as possible to the idea of sending, under the auspices of the United Nations, a committee of enquiry to the region in question, with a view to establishing the truth of events. This would enable us to stop, hunt down and bring to justice the possible perpetrators of these atrocities, whoever they may be.
Finally, we wanted to use this opportunity to reaffirm the need to respect the law and international conventions, in any situation, and this also applies to the fight against terrorism.
The joint resolution which will be submitted to us tomorrow explicitly fulfils these three desires and this is an exceptionally encouraging outcome, even though, to achieve it, it will have taken a leading US magazine to confirm our statements and, in addition, the State department, the UN and, if not the Council, then a number of European leaders to speak more openly.
We must now bring this episode to a conclusion and, furthermore, my group believes that we must learn some strategic lessons from it for the future.
Personally speaking, I have no doubt whatsoever regarding the need for a consistent fight against terrorism, and I have never had one ounce of sympathy for the Taliban regime.
It must be pointed out, however, that the military operations carried out by the United States or the West in Afghanistan, like the random detention of alleged Islamic extremists in Guantanamo or the compilation of ever-expanding lists of suspect organisations, have not enabled us to stamp out the al-Qa'ida criminal network.
To some extent, this observation is based on the report that the anti-terrorist monitoring group formed by the UN sent to the Security Council today.
On the other hand, the actions mentioned above have brought about inhuman and often traumatic consequences for the population, have without a doubt reinforced the most radical and extremist elements and, lastly, have increased insecurity throughout the world.
That is why my group deeply disagrees with the passages of the resolution which seek to justify war as part of the fight against terrorism.
If these paragraphs were to be adopted, many of use would unfortunately be unable to support this text.
We must bear in mind that the subject of war has once again become a major concern in most of our countries.
Unlike the sorcerers' apprentices who, not so long ago, supported Islamic extremist networks in their attempts to destabilise whoever their enemy happened to be at any particular time, we are calling for responsible, on-going management of security issues; I am thinking, in particular, of the need to improve civilian conflict prevention and, if necessary, civil crisis management.
The fact that al-Qa'ida cells still exist in at least 40 countries, according to the UN report that I mentioned earlier, also reminds us that terrorist networks are drawing their resources from the troubled waters of the international financial market.
When will we finally adopt drastic measures to clean up and lend greater transparency to the international financial circuits where speculative - let us call it traditional - capital now mixes, if not crosses paths, with dirty money from organised crime?
This is one of the costs of a genuinely effective fight against terrorism.
For the time being, Mr President, it is clearly vital, as many of my fellow Members have said, that the international aid promised to Afghanistan at the Tokyo Conference be provided immediately so that the deeply scarred population - these people and, especially, these women - can, at last, begin to live once again like human beings.
Mr President, let the current situation in Afghanistan be a hard lesson to the United States and Europe about what happens to a country during and after military intervention.
In my first point, I should like to comment on Mr Wurtz's contribution and the indications he has given, in combination with, in my view, strong clues in the article in Newsweek, as well as in the footage which he and his fellow MEPs showed last time, that hundreds, possibly even more, Taliban have been killed under suspicious circumstances.
I am not quoting this to indict the Americans in any way for something which may be completely unrelated to them.
I am quoting this because, in my view, it is extremely important finally to put an end to lawlessness after 20 years of civil war.
This means that a serious inquiry must be mounted into this and, unfortunately, similar cases.
We are all agreed without much hesitation that this inquiry falls within the remit of the United Nations.
The only problem is that the UN's special representative, Mr Brahimi, has already made it clear that the United Nations is unable to carry out this enquiry because it cannot guarantee the safety of, for example, witnesses and researchers.
My very explicit question to the Commission and the Council is whether they would make every effort to enable the United Nations to look into this and similar cases, and to sufficiently protect witnesses and researchers.
My second point concerns the comment I made earlier in the debate on Iraq.
The much vaunted regime change can only be effective if there is support for it in the country itself.
Militarily speaking, such support was in place in Afghanistan, in the form of the Northern Alliance.
If a regime change were to depend on the construction of civil society or the existence of NGOs, then this would be extremely difficult.
These have all but gone in Afghanistan, and the European Union is at the moment trying its best - for which all credit to it - to develop these.
Nevertheless, I am very anxious about the way this is going and the resistance that is met along the way.
There are large groups in Afghan society that reject what they call Western, but in my eyes, crucially democratic, values.
As Baroness Nicholson already mentioned, there is what I see as a setback where the role of women is concerned.
Although I welcome the fact that the Loya Jirga included many women, there are now all kinds of signs that the role of women is being repressed.
I think that this is a sign that nation building does not happen overnight.
I am also addressing this statement to the Americans: nation building does not happen overnight.
Building a democratic society is a long-term commitment.
My final point is, in my view, politically speaking, the most important point at the moment and I would particularly ask the Council to address this matter.
It is about extending the mandate of ISAF, the peacekeeping troops currently based in Kabul.
We as the Parliament and also most Member States have been insisting for months that the mandate should be extended beyond Kabul because that is where chaos is escalating.
Although the United States seems able to permit this, it will not supply a single soldier.
It will be up to the European Union, the European Member States, to extend the mandate of ISAF by sending more troops to Afghanistan.
My question to Mr Haarder is the following: is the Council prepared to send more troops to Afghanistan in order to control the chaos outside Kabul and to keep the peace?
Finally, Mr President, the lesson I have drawn from this situation is that we ought to think twice, if not more, before we decide on military intervention.
Once we are there, however, we should acquit ourselves of our tasks effectively for as long as this proves necessary.
Mr President, the fierce Taliban regime was defeated in the war but social and political calm and economic stability have yet to be established in Afghanistan, and the many problems linked to respect for human rights persist.
The new government is faced with severe difficulties and we must provide more than just economic aid.
Over 1.5 million refugees have returned from the places they had fled to during the many wars and upheavals which have afflicted their country in recent decades, but they have neither houses nor work and are prey to the ongoing dangers caused by the lack of security in the country.
With a view to bringing greater security, the US Special Forces advisors are working together with the Karzai government to set up a national army in Afghanistan, but if, on the one hand, the soldiers of the new army lack weapons, on the other, there appear to be 750 000 armed Mujahideen belonging to the various ethnic groups.
All this means that there will be further difficulties and that there is a need for especial political and diplomatic mediation between the national government and what are known as the 'warlords'.
No progress has been made as regards the situation of women: the only woman elected a minister in the new government had to resign after receiving death threats for declaring her opposition to the Sharia.
The recent attacks, the recent discovery of a chemicals laboratory for producing explosives and lethal materials and the existence of an area under tribal influence between Afghanistan and Pakistan are further indications of a dangerous situation.
The Afghan government is proceeding, one small step at a time, to bring a return to law and order and respect for human rights, combating the extremist fringe groups which have combined terrorism and Islam to make a single religion.
However, the international community must also continue to discharge its responsibilities through technical, humanitarian cooperation which will give Afghanistan the economic and structural support it needs to eliminate drug cultivation, and through more unambiguous measures to combat the Sharia and discrimination against women.
The European Union has a particular responsibility: for too long, our democracies were deaf to the cries for help coming from the Afghan people oppressed by the Taliban regime and by the cultural and physical violence imposed by their dictatorship.
This new, specific undertaking by the Union will also be an - albeit posthumous - tribute to the appeal made by Commander Massoud, who, on 5 April 2001 here in Strasbourg, called upon Europe for help, although Europe, I am sad to say, was insensitive at that time to the afflictions of a country oppressed by Taliban fundamentalism and which al-Qa'ida had made the cradle of international terrorism.
In a few days' time, it will be the anniversary of the assassination of Commander Massoud, who was murdered a few hours before the tragedy of 11 September.
It is our hope that the men and women in Afghanistan too who believe in freedom and democracy will respond to Commander Massoud's call and work together to defeat fundamentalist violence and secure peace for their people.
Mr President, it is difficult to speak in this House which barely resembles a genuine Parliament.
What we can say about the situation in Afghanistan is a mere extension of what we were saying earlier about Iraq.
In both cases, we are witnessing the unleashing of an empire, which is using every possible excuse to inflict on a nation - and, there is no doubt, via this nation, on the whole world - a display of its military capability.
In Afghanistan, the excuse is not plausible.
One does not destroy a whole country because a terrorist is hiding there.
As Mr Gollnisch said earlier, we will have to bomb London until the British Government extradite to France Rachid Ramda who masterminded several terrorist attacks that were carried out on the Paris underground in 1995.
Although he spoke in an ironic manner, Mr Gollnisch has simply made a logical point.
Due to the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that the empire and its propaganda are so deeply engrained in our minds, we are losing sight of the most basic logic and even the most basic common sense.
Who, if not the empire, is flouting the law, and as I said earlier in relation to Iraq, the UN Charter, to which we are all bound, in the war that it unilaterally decided to enter into, first in Kosovo, then in Afghanistan and now in Iraq?
Who if not Washington is guilty of war crimes, which I, like Mr Wurtz, would like Mr Haarder to speak to us about this afternoon.
And who, if not Washington, is using weapons of mass destruction in Kosovo, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, as proven by the numbers of deformed children being born in these countries as well as the condition of many American soldiers themselves?
The American people are themselves victims of the unleashing of the empire.
Open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen.
The great warlord is no longer Saddam Hussein - it is George W. Bush.
The Hitler of today cannot be said to be the remote, sectarian 'hashassins' - it is Bush and the pathetic, militaristic gang with their aspirations to dominate the world.
They should know that although they will not find wretched Europe standing in their way - Europe which is so divided now and becoming increasingly divided - they will at least hear the voice of the freedom of the Nations, and above all, the voice of France.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is certainly true that considerable progress has been made in the situation in Afghanistan and anyone who has visited the country recently can see that, despite the huge problems, there is hope and life.
You are quite right, however, Commissioner, that the problem in Afghanistan is the lack of security and that the current government, led by President Karzai, has little power outside of Kabul.
This is why, unlike Mr Morillon and the decision of the Security Council, I think that we are wrong not to respond in the positive to Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai's request to step up the presence of the international peacekeeping force, to extend it temporarily and to widen its territorial jurisdiction.
Personally speaking, I think that we perhaps have won the war, but there is a risk we might lose peace.
Currently, 4 800 soldiers from the international peacekeeping force are stuck in Kabul.
You are right, General Morillon, it would be better for the Afghans themselves to be responsible for the security of their country.
However, to put together an army and a police force takes time and, in the meanwhile, the tribal leaders are becoming more organised, as is evident from the attacks carried out in recent weeks.
That is why I am saying that reconstruction is a good thing.
The Commission and our staff are, in my view, making miracles happen in Afghanistan, but I sincerely hope, Commissioner, Mr President, that the next time Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai ask us to step up the peacekeeping force, we might have the courage to say yes.
There are 7 800 American soldiers in Afghanistan to combat terrorism and 4 800 soldiers to maintain peace.
I think that we have done the wrong thing.
It would have been much wiser and perhaps more useful if we had had the courage to invest as much in peace and security as we have in the fight against terrorism.
We will now interrupt the debate for the vote.
The debate will be resumed this afternoon at 3 p.m.
Mr President, I would like to tell Parliament that this morning the Prince of Asturias Foundation awarded the prestigious Concord Prize jointly to Daniel Barenboim and Edward SaÃ¯d.
I believe this is an appropriate encore to the concert we enjoyed on Monday.
Mr President, I was the Member responsible for the successful amendment to the Corbett Report, as a result of which the book where you sign written declarations under Rule 51 was moved to just outside this Chamber instead of being stuck in an office which nobody could find.
I spoke to the official there today, who complained that not a single Member has shown any interest in reading the declarations or signing the book, even though the procedure is now much easier and more convenient.
Can Members please cooperate with this project, in order to justify the change and the human resources dedicated to making it work?
Thank you Dr Tannock.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to move a point of order pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
The motion is to refer this text back to committee.
We believe that the Beysen report cannot legitimately be adopted until the questions that were raised by the Executive Committee in the Green Paper on Consumer Protection have been resolved. These questions are: should we harmonise European consumer law using a framework directive or using specific provisions of the type used in the proposal for a regulation on sales promotions?
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, can I have a speaker for the motion and one against?
Mr President, I think that the argument put forward by Mrs Patrie is based on common sense.
We should not be expected to vote before we have held a debate on the Green Paper on Consumer Protection.
My group is therefore also in favour of Mrs Patrie's request.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
Mr President, Mrs Patrie's suggestion comes as a huge surprise to me, because not a single new issue was raised during the extensive debate we held here yesterday, both in the morning and in the afternoon, and because Commissioner Bolkestein has also emphatically confirmed that the Green Paper and the draft regulation are completely compatible.
Moreover, I should like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that this report has been approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs by an overwhelming majority, with two votes against and two abstentions, and that normally speaking, this report would not have been discussed in the plenary had we applied the new procedure.
What is more, it cannot be the intention, surely, to obstruct the legislative procedure because a group, however important it may be, fails to reach unanimity on this report.
It is up to us to assume our responsibility freely; this is quite simply our mandate.
I now put the motion that the text should be referred back to committee to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the request for referral to committee)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment.
Mrs Villiers is suggesting the following amendment: 'believes it will be necessary to revise the regulation in order to apply it also to the transport area, as a strategic instrument for the development of the EU'.
If we adopt this amendment, we will prevent the Commission's regulation on State aid for employment from coming into force, which is something, I am sure, no one wants.
I therefore propose that we add the short phrase 'in the near future', to urge the Commission to present to us, in the near future, the proposals that Mrs Villiers desires, which will enable the Commission to apply this regulation that is, indeed, important.
I believe Mrs Villiers is in agreement.
Mr President, this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the report.
The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support.
The new rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports.
The British Conservatives deplore violence of any kind and welcome measures to combat this, including some of the initiatives under the Daphne programme.
Violence, especially against women or children, is completely unjustifiable and cannot be accepted.
However, the measures called for in Article 18 of the AvilÃ©s Perea report represent an infringement of the Member States' right to determine their own criminal justice systems and represent measures to introduce harmonisation of criminal law.
The calls for a specific European legal base infringe the principle of subsidiarity.
We strongly believe that national parliaments and not the European Parliament should lay down laws relating, for example, to eviction of violent partners.
Whilst accepting that good work is being carried out by the Daphne programme, the British Conservatives are opposed to the principles of the report, for the reasons outlined.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have fully and enthusiastically supported this magnificent report by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea.
In fact, the Daphne programme, designed to protect women and children against violence, and which is now also open to the countries that are candidates for accession and to the countries of the EFTA-European Economic Area, has had an exceptional level of response and, as has already been said, is a victim of its own success.
Therefore, the efforts made to draw attention to the programme's clearly inadequate funding are not excessive. This inadequate funding is a matter of the greatest concern, particularly when we consider the forthcoming enlargement of the Union.
To date, the participation of the candidate countries only represents 6% of the programme's total resources and this is predicted to rise.
We also support the rapporteur's proposals on the rehabilitation and treatment of aggressors, on undertaking comparative studies into legislation and punishment, on approaches to the problem of prostitution, to undertaking educational programmes which show that violence against women and children is unacceptable and on the creation of a common database on eliminating violence against women.
Nevertheless, in line with our Conservative colleague who has just spoken, we consider some excessive steps to be dispensable, in particular those which could be interpreted to favour a common European code, which we believe would breach the principle of subsidiarity.
Physical, sexual or psychological violence exists in every country in the EU.
The statistics gathered in the various countries are quite high, varying from 14.5% in Germany to 56.3% in Portugal, with 52.8% of women suffering physical violence at the hands of their partner or spouse.
Since 1991, Portugal has had a law to protect women who suffer domestic violence.
Nevertheless, this law was adopted under international pressure, and not as a result of any greater awareness, which means that there are almost no measures in place to implement the law.
Violence perpetrated against children, adolescents and women must be condemned, because it violates their fundamental rights, entails serious consequences for society as a whole and constitutes an obstacle to gender equality.
The Daphne programme to combat violence involves policies combining prevention, punitive action and victim support.
To comply with the objectives that have been laid down, sufficient funding is necessary and it is, therefore, crucial that we increase the budget for forthcoming years.
We voted in favour of this report despite the fact that, even in view of its limited objective - aid to associations which combat sexual violence and fight for women's and children's rights - the proposed budget is quite obviously insufficient.
The report itself recognises this and lists the projects rejected due to lack of budgetary resources.
We must, however, stress that, amongst the types of violence inflicted on women, who suffer not only sexual and domestic violence - they also suffer social violence which can in fact affect men as well, such as having to endure unacceptable working conditions. One example is working at night for women, which is permitted in industry by the European Parliament, or worse still, losing one's job and one's income.
The inability to combat social violence and therefore prevent its consequences is also severely hampering efforts to combat domestic violence.
Increasing numbers of women and children are victims of - as you would expect - physical, but also psychological violence.
It is women and children who suffer the most from violence, but we must not forget that men are also sexually exploited and also suffer.
We must therefore put in place effective measures to combat all forms of violence, by combining prevention, punitive action and support for victims.
The Daphne programme is an effective instrument and it must be further developed.
The fight against trafficking in human beings must include penalties that act as a deterrent and that are common across all Member States.
All NGOs must be actively supported and violence must be understood in the broad sense.
All forms of violence must be opposed because violence is unacceptable.
. (PT) There is an enormous gap between the declarations of good intent proclaimed in the Social Agenda and the way in which these are put into practice, as proved in the report itself, despite some weaknesses and some specific negative points with which we disagree and hence our abstention in the final vote.
We welcome the report's criticism of the Commission, however, both with regard to issues of form and for the lack of information given to the European Parliament and the social partners, and for the delays in meeting commitments it has given, in particular concerning the following aspects:
amending Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, on the basis of the proposals tabled in the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2000;
the establishment of criteria for the recognition of disabilities and the submission of an effective action plan to prevent musculoskeletal damage occurring in the workplace;
and paying greater attention to the quality of work, to developing the social economy, to illiteracy, to combating illegal labour and discrimination against people with disabilities in terms of access to employment, to education and to vocational training.
The aim of this Commission proposal for a regulation is to remove any restrictions imposed by the Member States on unfair sales promotions (price reductions outside sale periods, free gifts, below cost selling), such as the restrictions adopted in Greece in law 2941/01 banning below cost selling.
This ruling will do even more to help large multinationals concentrate money and corner the market, because only they will be able to increase their overall profits, even if they sell certain products below cost.
At the same time, it will be a disaster for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have already been hard hit by the implementation of the single internal market, and for consumers, who will be even more exposed to deception and will suffer the consequences when markets are cornered.
The fact that it has opted for a regulation, which ensures immediate application, and the fact that the proposal was not discussed with the interested parties, especially SMEs, shows just how concerned the EU is to directly promote the interests of large companies.
The whole affair illustrates exactly what it means by competition on the single internal market.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece call for this regulation to be withdrawn and will be voting against the report.
The report dealing with the proposal for a regulation on sales promotions in the internal market, voted on by majority in the European Parliament, improves the European Commission proposal, although it contains some contradictions and incorrect points, which we voted against.
We voted in favour, however, of the proposals that are intended to provide greater protection for consumers and micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises, by combating the habitual and repeated dumping practiced by certain economic groups, which use a predatory price strategy, in the de facto aim of ruining weaker competitors and of forcing them out of the market.
We also support the proposals that are intended to uphold the most progressive national legislation, to protect subsidiarity and the sovereignty of every Member State, specifically in laws designed to protect consumers and minors and to support micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises, as has happened in Portugal, specifically with a ban on below cost selling outside sales seasons.
.
(DE) Below cost selling has been a much-discussed issue over the past months.
The Commission would prefer to use this regulation to lift the ban on this practice in various countries.
Such a commitment would have catastrophic consequences for smaller producers, such as those in the agricultural and viticultural sectors.
Unlike the major supermarket chains, they often sell only one product and cannot pass onto other products the losses involved in below cost selling.
They would therefore lose all their capacity to compete, and, in order to counteract that, many producers would feel themselves constrained to use ingredients that were cheaper and thus of poorer quality.
Lower prices would not alter the fact that it would still be the consumer who lost out in all this.
It was with some satisfaction that I noted that the committee with competence in these matters has adopted the text of my amendment on the subject and managed to reach a compromise that satisfies almost everybody.
In the Legal Affairs Committee, other amendments sought to prohibit any sales promotion whatever of alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer or spirits.
There is no doubt that excessive consumption of alcohol needs to be stopped by means of appropriate education at an early stage.
Moreover, all the Member States stipulate a minimum age for the public consumption of alcohol.
Prohibiting any sales promotion whatever is, however, disproportionate, harming as it does all consumers rather than only the small minority who are addicted to alcohol and therefore need treatment.
A majority on the Legal Affairs Committee realised the absurdity of this step and rejected the amendments to which I have referred.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) These days, people are mainly seen as consumers.
They have to try to accumulate as much money as possible by working long and hard, or through speculation.
Anyone who fails to become rich fast, often at the expense of their fellow citizens, is considered a failure.
The winners, on the other hand, are continually invited to hand over all their savings as quickly as possible to estate agents, those offering expensive holidays, and casinos.
And also to schemes which will make them independent of the normal education, health care and public transport services, for these have been whittled down to a level that is now only acceptable to the losers.
No wonder that the successful consumer is inundated with advertising, including from abroad.
In this proposal, it is assumed that sales promotions, such as discounts, gifts and games, are conducive to welfare.
In 2000, they accounted for a million jobs in nine Member States and investments to the tune of over EUR 40 billion.
Although even the liberal-minded rapporteur, Mr Beysen, has to admit that such sales promotion adversely affects the ability to publish books, the fair distribution of medicines and encourages young people's addiction to alcohol and gaming machines, he does not focus his proposal on consumer protection but on the suspension of rules and fewer obligations for those who run companies.
That is why I will be voting against it.
I have supported the rapporteur's proposals, which significantly improve the text produced by the Commission and which seek to provide a satisfactory response to the points that could be most controversial.
I abstained, however, from voting on the legislative resolution, because I believe it is still necessary closely to observe the follow-up given to this report in the legislative process.
I agree with the ideas of ensuring price transparency and of strengthening legal certainty, responding to the pressing need to establish uniform rules with the introduction of the euro and corresponding to the new Community approach intended to provide more appropriate and coherent regulation at Community level.
This proposal could contribute to clarifying contractual positions in a field of some sensitivity to consumers, such as sales promotions of the type covered by the regulation: discounts, free offers, prizes or opportunities to participate in promotional competitions or games, in the context of the selling of a product.
I welcome in particular the constant focus on the need to provide full information in sales promotions, a feature that stands out in the new agreement on commercial communications policy and which I hope will run through future rules in this field, as the rapporteur recommends.
The Member States - and France in particular - which have passed legislation, using their sovereign right, to regulate below cost selling and sales, have done so with the clearly stated aim of preserving the balance between manufacturers, distributors and consumers.
It is the interests of each of these that the national parliaments have sought to protect.
The Commission's desire, therefore, to remove restrictions on sales promotions, on the grounds of strengthening economic harmonisation, poses a direct threat to the interests and the balance of economic players.
It is also - on the grounds of a misinterpreted benefit to the consumer - the image of our leading brands of products that could suffer under the policy , ahead of certain manufacturers' unscrupulous distributors - and their own economic restrictions - on which they thrive .
The amendments adopted by the parliamentary committees, including those that I tabled, have fortunately allowed respect for our national laws to be restored. Only on the condition that Parliament adopts these amendments shall I support this text.
I fully support this report, which will potentially ensure that EU consumers operate in a level playing field and sales promotions are standardised across EU Member States.
Indeed, one of the most compelling arguments in favour of the euro is that European citizens are able to compare prices across borders.
This advantage is at present distorted by the fact that different types of sales promotion exist in member states and therefore cross-border price transparency is effectively distorted.
Once this directive eventually comes into force, it will represent one more step towards the completion of a fully functioning single market.
So this proposal is the best way to achieve price transparency and to ensure a level playing field.
However, as the committee recommends, it should remain the prerogative of individual Member States to decide whether to ban discounts on fixed price products and I fully support the committee's insistence that the principle of subsidiarity must be upheld in this domain.
State aid for employment is an important way of stimulating the job market and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Transparency and rules at European level are also important.
Having said which, however, I worry that the Commission regulation may deprive the Member States' governments of specific, additional tools for fighting unemployment under special circumstances.
Likewise, the report throws its weight behind labour market 'flexibility', which may further dismantle the employment rights of workers, which is why I am unable to vote in favour of it.
. (IT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
State aid must be defined and provided by a nation at times of economic crisis.
If aid were to become a normal, regular occurrence, far from benefiting the country or providing an essential means of overcoming difficult times, it would without a doubt exacerbate the problems of the recipients.
The Berenguer Fuster report on the draft Commission regulation on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to state aid for employment should be read in this light, considering that these articles would also normally apply to the transport sector.
The impending enlargement must be seen as an extraordinarily important, exceptional event.
It will lead to a change in the distribution of work and to marked differences in salary levels and standards of living between the current Member States and the newly acceded countries.
The potential structural distortions generated by the - certainly lower - cost of labour in these countries, by different environmental, social and technical standards and by strong competition between the labour forces on the market can be addressed by making the labour market more flexible and, to some extent, through the provision of state aid to employment.
The accession of the candidate countries will lead, especially in the traditional economic sectors such as heavy industry, agriculture and transport, to excesses of labour, and these people will not be able to find work immediately in the new, emerging economic sectors.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of procedure)
The very title of this report is misleading in itself.
The title talks of 'State aid for employment' whereas the report is, in fact, about funding to increase employers' profits.
However much the report 'welcomes?greater transparency and legal certainty' in the areas of aid, tax relief and benefits which are granted to employers on the pretext of encouraging them to create jobs, it does not question employers' right to do what they want in their businesses.
Nothing can prevent them, therefore, from pocketing the funding without creating a single job, which is what employers have routinely done for a long time.
Since we do not wish to give our approval to this farce, we voted against the report.
I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Berenguer Fuster on his work and on his report and then say what great benefit could be derived from a European Parliament resolution which seeks to encourage employment and which recognises the need for State aid.
The report says that unemployment is too high.
I would add that it is a tragedy and a real disease into which we must channel all our energies!
It is perfectly legitimate to use State aid to support a number of measures to combat unemployment and encourage employment.
It was, incidentally, totally unacceptable to associate aid with increased labour market activity. However, since the right-wing Members voted in favour of the report, my colleagues from the Delegation of the Republican, Radical and Citizens' Left and I had to vote against the motion.
We are concerned at the approach that the report insists on promoting when it states that 'the key to improving employment in the European Union is encouraging labour market flexibility through structural reform'.
This ignores all the problems of unemployment caused by restrictive monetary policies and by constant privatisations, including in basic sectors of the economy and in social fields.
It is also unacceptable that the report considers state aid for employment to be a last resort, thereby condemning disadvantaged regions and sectors in difficulty to failure and to poverty.
Of particular concern is the damaging impact that its implementation could have in countries such as Portugal, with micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises which are experiencing serious difficulties, and in sectors such as ship building, which are affected by unfair international competition policies.
Hence our vote against this report.
.
(DE) I voted in favour of the Berenguer Fuster report, as I, like the rapporteur, support the Commission's approach to reforming the system of employment aid.
I particularly welcome the way in which the planned limitation of the prior notification requirement now gives regional authorities more scope to develop local employment programmes, thus enabling them to respond quickly and flexibly, with targeted measures, to changed conditions in the labour market in the regions.
It is in particular small and medium-sized enterprises that will benefit from the more lenient conditions, being able, where the need arises, to expect the speedy and straightforward payment of aid, which I emphatically support.
The consolidation in a single text of current legislation on employment aid means that the Commission is also doing justice to its objective of greater transparency in the EU's lawmaking processes.
There is one point, though, in the rapporteur's argument where he and I part company.
The key to improving employment cannot be found in the greater labour-market flexibility for which he calls.
It is far more a matter of responding to the changed situation in the labour market by rethinking employment policy, for example by using new working arrangements to guarantee full employment while simultaneously safeguarding quality jobs.
. (NL) State aid has become a dirty word within the EU.
This is partly justified.
State aid can mean that the tax money we have all helped to raise for community tasks has been transferred to friends of politicians in government to give them an unacceptable advantage.
More often, however, state aid has been a means of protecting weak regions, disadvantaged professional groups and vital public services, or of protecting society against the effects of major economic crises.
For example, following the 1929 crisis, attempts were made to crank up the economy by means of huge, Keynes-inspired investments.
These days, these forms of aid are often treated as a form of distortion of competition because they contravene the liberal principle of competition and go against government cutbacks.
In this light, each regulation that grants tiny scraps of state aid appears an improvement on a harsh, all-encompassing form of liberalisation which makes problems completely impossible to solve.
Unfortunately, this proposal, targeting vulnerable groups of employees in small and medium-size enterprises, is immediately being rendered ineffective by a plea for the labour market to be made even more flexible.
Cutting back on employee protection is therefore promoted as the best way of guaranteeing more employment, and aid is seen only as a last resort.
This is sufficient reason for me to vote against the proposal.
.
(IT) We voted for Mr Berenguer Fuster's report.
Indeed, it would be difficult not to, considering who the beneficiaries of this aid are and the goals of simplification and transparency that the Commission has set itself.
The issue we need to reflect on, however, is the fact that, as the Commission is quite aware, in some regions of the Member States of the Union, the difference between being in an area receiving aid under Article 87(3) and not being in such an area is a tax reduction in excess of 12%.
The question is then the content of Article 4(3) of the draft regulation, with reference precisely to the above-mentioned regions, for we believe that the method of determining the areas does not produce a wholly accurate definition of which areas are genuinely disadvantaged and that the Commission is aware of this.
Consider the method used by local employment systems to define these areas and how it has been disregarded in some cases.
We therefore believe that the current maps should be revised to ensure that they are consistent, irrespective of whether the regions themselves have used them. Otherwise, even with the planned 10% increase on the upper limit, the draft regulation would, in those cases, essentially serve the purpose of - covertly and only partially - remedying the errors made.
. (EL) Unemployment is constantly on the rise, followed by even faster rising underemployment.
The aim of the ?U's employment policies is not to reduce unemployment; they are a vehicle for abolishing wage, labour and insurance rights and they spell redundancy for workers in full-time, stable employment, the aim being to impose flexible forms of employment.
This state aid represents net revenue to employers; it results in workers being replaced by the subsidised unemployed and permanent violations of collective agreements.
It helps reduce labour costs and supports the interests and profits of big business.
Priority for SMEs and proposals to draw up a list of the groups which will benefit from the measures merely sweetens the pill.
The purpose of these proposals is not to help SMEs strengthen their defences against the onslaught of big business but to make use of SMEs, which have always had the most jobs but which also have the weakest trade union movement, and of the weakest social groups in order to support the drive towards labour market flexibility.
The workers want full, stable employment, protected social rights, a higher standard of living, real social development and prosperity, unemployment benefits of 80% of the basic wage and a different sort of policy, which centres around man and his needs.
We find it entirely understandable that the European Commission should consider the time to have come, on the basis of an active policy of employment aid, to establish more binding criteria and to lay them down in a single legal framework.
In fact, this rationalisation is intended to pursue a dual objective: on the one hand, to simplify and clarify the system of regulating aid to employment, in the aim of ensuring greater transparency in the Commission's action and of facilitating understanding and monitoring of this action; and furthermore contributing to stimulating employment in the European Union, in line with the European employment strategy, especially for workers in the least-favoured categories.
I have, therefore, approved the rapporteur's position, which supports, to a large extent, this Commission proposal, considering this to be the approach that will achieve the Lisbon Strategy, and I welcome in particular the references made to the need to support the economic development of the least-favoured regions of the European Union, with particular focus on the outermost regions.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.53 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the situation in Afghanistan.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, 11 September is almost upon us, the first anniversary of that day when two aircraft, piloted by terrorists belonging to al?Qa'ida, crashed into the World Trade Centre, caused both towers to collapse, killed thousands of people and, at a stroke, changed the world - or, at least so we thought at the time.
There have indeed been changes.
Under UN mandate, an alliance against terrorism was forged.
For the first time, a crisis was declared to be a matter for NATO, Article 5 of whose Treaty was invoked.
The American President Bush called for the head of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi billionaire who headed up the al?Qa'ida network, and the war against terrorism met with its first significant success in Afghanistan itself, where the fundamentalist Taliban regime, which was generally inhumane and in particular hostile to women, was driven from power and an interim government under President Karzai, which is putting down democratic roots, was established.
One year on, we are of course all aware that the struggle against terrorism, as President Bush himself once said, will be a long one at various levels, and that quick victories are illusory.
In Afghanistan itself, the Karzai government enjoys de facto power only in Kabul.
The authority of the various provincial rulers belonging to different tribes is undiminished, and has, in some instances, even been reinforced, a fact demonstrated just as much by the murder of Commander Massoud as by the murder of Afghanistan's Vice-President Abdul Qadir, who had incurred the enmity of rival drug baron, supporters of Osama Bin Laden and of the Taliban, but possibly also of members of the Northern Alliance who had felt themselves bypassed.
It is also far from clear whether or not Osama Bin Laden is still alive.
What is beyond doubt is that the al?Qa'ida network has regenerated itself and reorganised both its guerrilla organisation, which is active not only in the neighbouring Pakistan, and also its sources of finance, which continue to flow in abundance.
Anyone reading today's Herald Tribune will find a sobering report on the transfers of gold to Sudan through channels running from Pakistan and Iran.
This means that the al?Qa'ida network and the Taliban militias still have large reserves of finance at their disposal, derived from the cultivation and sale of opium.
Set against the sums involved here, the aid given by the European Union towards stabilising the situation in Afghanistan looks rather modest, even though the EU has become the largest donor of funds for this purpose.
There is no doubt that we have to do this in order to bring peace to this country once under Soviet Communist occupation and ravaged by decades of civil war and thus make a contribution to consolidating the crisis region between Pakistan, Iran, India and the unstable Asiatic part of the former Soviet Union.
We also have to do it for reasons of self-protection.
Europe is a destination not only for Afghan drugs, but also for illegal immigrants, in the number of whom there has been a significant increase on the borders between the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria over the past year.
There is, then, a need for humanitarian aid just as much as for targeted measures in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a fight we will certainly have to carry on for a long time yet, and one in which we can expect no quick victories.
Yet do it we must, if we are to demonstrate to the USA that we are to be taken seriously as a partner in an alliance against terrorism.
Relations with the USA in the aftermath of 11 September have, to put it mildly, been beset by irritations.
We are both saddened - Europeans when America goes it alone, and the USA by the European Union's lack of political unity and its military weakness, both exemplified by the EU's line on Iraq, which has to date been less than coherent.
Also symptomatic of this are the USA's threatening gestures directed at Baghdad, which are not always credible.
What is needed on both sides of the Atlantic is coherent crisis management combating not only the symptoms of international terrorism, but also and especially its causes, as rightly demanded by the former White House security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.
Developing such a strategy to pull the plug on the crises in the Middle East, settle the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and neutralise Islamic political fundamentalism wherever it rears its head - and it has its boltholes in Europe itself - to all these things, the European Union can and must make a substantial contribution.
EU aid in Afghanistan is an essential building block in this.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union played a very active part in the democratisation of Afghanistan, for which particular thanks are due to the Commission and most especially its staff on the ground.
It was as early as the International Women's Day in 1998 that European women started the 'Flower for the Women of Kabul' campaign, and deplored the human rights violations that excluded women in particular from education, medical treatment, work and political involvement.
Another six years of the Taliban's despotic rule had gone by before things began to look up for democracy.
The international anti-terror alliance then laid the spectre of the Taliban to rest.
Democracy movements were launched at once, and the EU again played an active part in this on the Petersberg in Bonn.
At the same time, albeit attracting almost no attention, the first Afghan Women's Summit was meeting in Brussels at the invitation of European women.
It was there, for the first time and after two decades without political involvement, that it was possible for Afghan women, whether living in exile or in Afghanistan itself, to have their own forum and find themselves.
International pressure made it possible for women to be first admitted to the Loya Jirga and subsequently to participate in the new transitional government.
In the meantime, we saw to it that the Budget included funds to help the women make up a great deal of lost ground, and that it was again possible for self-help organisations such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) to receive support from Budget funds.
It is with consternation that we now hear it reported that the first schools for girls are being closed down again, that fundamentalists again want to force women out of public life, and that the political influence of women ministers is being curbed.
All the political influence at our disposal must now be brought to bear in order to prevent the situation of women worsening still further and above all to ensure that aid reaches rural areas and is passed on to women.
Jointly with the women on the European Council, we had taken the initiative of setting up a multinational group of women observers to ensure that women get the aid they need.
Believing as I do that this fire must be kept alight, I now urgently call upon the Commission to continue to focus on the situation of women, and urge that we combat the principal evil, which is poverty and illiteracy among women.
Even if world public opinion concentrates on other issues, I do think that we should continue to focus on Afghanistan and that we have to maintain a local presence there.
My group, the Group of Social Democrats, will be sending a delegation to Afghanistan, and I look to the Commission to provide support for it in the shape of logistical aid.
The threat of war in Iraq would destroy much that has been achieved, and so all our efforts are needed to help make peace in the region.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, following on from this morning's debate, it is encouraging to be able to read in the telegrams from Johannesburg that the President-in-Office of the Council, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, held a meeting this morning in Johannesburg at which it was established that the United States would consult its allies about Iraq and that the US agreed with the EU about firstly trying to get Iraq to give international weapons inspectors free and unfettered access to the country.
The Afghanistan debate covers two matters: the current issue of the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and the longer term question of the situation itself in that troubled country.
With regard to the alleged war crimes, we must now await the outcome of the UN investigation.
If the investigation shows that war crimes have been committed, the people responsible must be found and prosecuted in accordance with the current regulations.
There is really nothing more to be said about that matter at present.
It has been very encouraging to hear the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner report now on developments in Afghanistan less than a year after the country lay in ruins.
We can be pleased with the Bonn process and proud of the aid provided by the EU to that poverty-stricken country.
We have in fact heard today about an EU success story in rebuilding a country, and we should thank the Commission in particular for its persistent efforts.
We also know that we are only in the first phase, that there is a long way to go and that the new administration, or transitional government, is subject to both external and internal threats.
Although much reduced in size, al-Qa'ida is still an external threat from hiding places in the regions bordering Afghanistan. Internally, the fact that warlords clearly continue to operate, are still behind the cultivation of opium poppies and are in a position to threaten the stability of Afghanistan is necessarily a source of concern.
It is a threat to the country's integrity and to Mr Karzai's government, which is the best guarantee of a peaceful process of development involving the implementation of those values we cherish.
We must therefore continue to maintain a close dialogue with the transitional government, as well as engage in close dialogue with any government resulting from the 2004 elections.
Prompt and effective efforts on the part of the EU must be followed up by long-term efforts.
The fact that the EU has just launched the 'Water for Life' initiative is commendably in line with what we have previously heard in this Chamber. Unlike almost all crops, opium poppies do not require much water.
So let the EU supply water to Afghanistan, show responsibility and contribute to a more peaceful world.
Mr President, I like to think and act to promote mediation and combating poverty and injustice as the means of resolving conflicts, not war and bombing, but I am not a saint: I am completely immersed in the complexity and contradiction of conflicts.
I agree with Commissioner Patten: it is not enthusiasm that is needed - although a little would not go amiss - but solutions, and these solutions must not be the Danse macabre being performed by Mr Bush and Mr Sharon or Osama Bin Laden and Hamas, who are destroying people, nature and human and social rights.
The conflict between forces of good and evil is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, and it undermines the rule of law.
The Taliban have been defeated but their ideology lives on: many of their practices, with which those in power today are not unfamiliar, remain.
The refugees are returning home but they are given no support, schools are reopening but schoolgirls have been the victims of a bomb attack, cinemas are reopening but they are banned from showing Indian films because they contain women without veils, women are banned from singing on the radio or television, rape and violence are common occurrences, the lethal, lucrative opium trade continues, and, although reconstruction is taking place - and it is a slow process - Afghanistan is in danger of forfeiting its sovereignty to money and corruption.
For this and many other reasons, our economic and social aid must be provided swiftly and effectively to allow the establishment of the structures and infrastructure of a rule of law and to empower that part of civil society - particularly women - which is completely devoted to securing freedom, justice, development and peace for all men and women.
The situation in Afghanistan is tragic and we must continue to help the country in the knowledge that there is a universal need for sovereignty and that there must be an end to war in the region.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we actually made a big mistake after the first war, after the defeat of the Russians in Afghanistan.
We showed far too little concern for Afghanistan's reconstruction, and failed to put conflict prevention in place by reconstructing society there.
We should, of course, not make the same mistake twice.
Afghan society is complex due to its many factions, tribes, and religious and ethnic differences.
The different cultures must be integrated and Afghanistan, a country that has probably always been heavily militarised, and certainly still is, must be told once again that the rule of law cannot grow out of the barrel of a gun.
Fundamentalism has certainly not died out in Afghanistan's society, but we must make the return of refugees possible by planning our programmes well and by guaranteeing maximum participation by the population, including women.
We must set this as a pre-condition, for if they are only given funding and are able to go back to shrouding women in burkas and confining them to the home, something is very wrong.
The economy must be developed, and the mines must be cleared in order to restore the countryside to its former state.
All of this will require a great deal of expenditure and, above all, patience.
Given that gangsterism is so prevalent, we should not be surprised to come across renewed armed fighting between the factions from time to time.
This is why I would underline the need to safeguard human rights.
We must ensure that nothing goes unpunished, and that enquiries are definitely mounted into any crimes against humanity.
We might be able to help the United Nations in this endeavour, so that their moral prestige is also shored up financially.
Mr President, in all our efforts to help construct a better Afghanistan we should not lose sight of why we are now involved there with such commitment.
It is, of course, to root out terrorism, to help build a peaceable, well-disposed, durable and better society and to ensure that the extremists do not set down fresh roots either within the country or elsewhere.
All our actions should be measured against these yardsticks and we should be under no illusions about the fragility of the situation, which poses major challenges both for ISAF and the other coalition forces operating within the country.
There is now wider agreement about the desirability of ISAF broadening its mandate beyond Kabul.
This is not just a matter of the availability of suitable international forces but, as Commission Patten has said, it also tests the willingness of reluctant local warlords, often backed by foreign interests in the region, to comply with the authority of Kabul.
The Turkish armed forces are to be congratulated on the satisfactory completion of the first half of their span of command of ISAF.
The building of a professional and reliable Afghan army and police force, which is happening in parallel largely under American, British and French auspices, will take time and there seems little doubt that ISAF will have to continue its operations next year and an early indication of the follow-on command arrangements is needed.
The last thing we need, when action against Iraq is in the air, is uncertainty about military arrangements in Afghanistan.
I should like to highlight three particular aspects of the situation: refugees, EU funding and the landmine issue.
Firstly, refugees, which Mr Haarder touched on earlier.
There is now a degree of security in Afghanistan.
Yet, while many refugees have returned to the country, millions remain in Iran and Pakistan.
Some talk about two or three million respectively, though estimates differ significantly.
Furthermore, a large proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain and other European countries originate from Afghanistan.
We should bear in mind that many have extremist backgrounds and that we are therefore vulnerable to the implantation and cultivation of Islamic extremists within our own societies, not just from Afghanistan.
This is madness.
More focused and determined action is needed to deal with these problems and encourage return to Afghanistan.
On the funding question, the USD 4.5 billion pledged at Tokyo in January, including over USD 1 billion from the European Union, has, for the most part, been slow to arrive - although I note the Commissioner's remarks about the way the Commission has responded.
There is an absorption problem: the Afghan Interim Government lacks the institutions to disburse the money efficiently and needs greater assistance in this area.
At the same time there has to be proper control and management of international funds.
I say this at a time when, yet again, the European Commission's procedures in this respect have been the subject of serious criticism and, as in the Palestine Authority area until recently, the issue of proper control of funds appears to have been largely avoided by the international community.
The Bonn Agreement merely states: 'The members of the Interim Administration shall abide by a Code of Conduct elaborated in accordance with international standards.'
This Code is not published and, in any case, seems less than adequate.
We must insist that measures be put in place by the Afghan authorities and the international community, including the European Union, to ensure the proper management, accounting and use of these funds.
Finally, the question of landmines, which has already been touched on by other speakers.
Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
This was the case before last September and the situation has been exacerbated since then.
The presence of landmines and UXOs - unexploded ordnance - are a major obstacle to economic and social regeneration.
It is estimated that between five and ten people are injured in mine blasts every day in Afghanistan and that an estimated 10 million mines litter the country.
We welcome the undertaking by the Afghan Interim Government to accede to the Geneva Convention banning the use of antipersonnel landmines, but the mines are still there in the ground and the victims hobble through the streets.
There is an urgent requirement for a properly coordinated and funded programme of action to enable the resumption of mine action operations at least at the level they had reached before last September.
A concerted time-limited effort is needed, otherwise we are still going to be talking about this in ten years' time.
There is much to be done in Afghanistan.
Let us get it right, working in harmony with the United States and other allies - and all the time remember why we are there.
Mr President, a great deal still needs to be done for Afghanistan, and this resolution is a good political contribution.
I would, however, just like to focus on three points.
Firstly, we must restore the role, responsibility and visibility of the United Nations.
In terms of assessing the outcome of the intervention, in terms of analyses which would justify any further action, we note that the United Nations is absent, often considered to be an intruder, and is, in effect, excluded.
This unilateralist approach does not further the cause of Afghanistan, not least in that we are legitimately and frankly concerned at the way we are blindly placing all our trust in President Bush, whose approach to foreign policy is quite inconsistent and has, moreover, even been questioned by his Executive.
Secondly, we reject double standards in matters of human rights.
We call for guarantees of fair trials for all accused persons, whatever the offence they are being charged with.
We call for respect for international conventions.
It may be that some of them need to be reworked and revised, and they must genuinely be revised, not set aside. We call for these guarantees to be applied to all accused persons because it is a fundamental rule, a fundamental principle that there is no room for compromise in human rights, particularly if it is designed to make things easier for ourselves.
I would stress: whoever the accused person is.
Lastly, Mr President, through this resolution, we call upon the Afghan authorities to make the greatest possible endeavours to obtain justice for the journalists killed in Afghanistan and to expose the truth behind their murders - I reiterate, to obtain justice and to reveal the truth: as well as justice, we demand to be informed of the reasons why many journalists have been killed.
If we have had the opportunity to find out about what has happened in Afghanistan, it is partly thanks to the journalists who decided to go and report on this war on the spot.
To call for justice for those who fell doing their duty, Mr President, and for the truth behind their deaths to be revealed, is the least that Parliament can do now.
Mr President, we are opposed to the motions on Afghanistan and to the joint motion because, although they may have some good points, they legitimise intervention and the slaughter of the Afghan people and give the go-ahead for similar operations in Iraq or wherever else the imperialists choose to go.
We are all the more opposed because the aim is to brainwash nations into believing that the imperialists have the right, on various and sundry pretexts, to intervene, bomb, kill, destroy entire countries and set up puppet regimes.
It happened in Iraq in 1991, in Cyprus in 1974, in Yugoslavia in 1993-99 and elsewhere.
Following the horrendous attack on 11 September, the pretext for the savage attack on Afghanistan, which resulted in unimaginable destruction, countless thousands of victims and mass slaughter, was the fight against terrorism, based on the arbitrary, unproven claim that the US agent bin Laden, al-Qa'ida and the USA-supported Taliban, were to blame.
As US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has stated, no confirmation is needed for this sort of military operation.
Unfortunately, this view is shared by many here in this House.
Mr Blair, who is even more merciless, tells us that the attack on Afghanistan was carried out as the moral basis for the forthcoming attack on Iraq.
Today, the US president has shown his cynicism by stating that, even if Iraq allows inspectors, the problem will only be resolved by war, never mind that this will result in yet more slaughter and give even more support to Saddam.
The excuse for such an attack, even with the blessing of the United Nations, is the unproven claim that the brutal dictatorship headed by Saddam holds weapons of mass destruction.
And yet those who make these claims have many more far more destructive weapons scattered throughout the world and are threatening to turn them against China, Russia and elsewhere.
Hence, the Bush regime is even more dangerous and nations need to unite against it...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, a year has now passed since the tragic 9/11 events which triggered the war against Afghanistan, now mercifully in a mopping-up phase to search out and destroy remnants of the odious Taliban regime and their al-Qa'ida terrorist allies.
Nevertheless, Afghanistan has come a long way since the rout of Mullah Omar and the disappearance, hopefully for good, of Osama Bin Laden.
Girls are back at school, music and film are allowed again and football is replacing public hangings.
We have had a successful Bonn Conference and a Tokyo Donors Conference.
The Loya Jirga was opened by the former king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting last September in Rome.
He has now been granted the title of 'Father of the Nation', as he has worked tirelessly and assiduously behind the scenes to reunite his nation and stop squabbling, particularly amongst the Pashtun communities.
However ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force, still has its work cut out.
We have witnessed the assassination of two ministers and this week a bomb attack, presumably aimed against western forces.
We still see the evils of warlordism, ethnic division and a flourishing drug trade.
I was shocked to read that the opium crop this year was up to three thousand tonnes, overtaking even that of the Golden Triangle's 900 tonnes in Myanmar and Thailand.
We still have the problem of considerable sympathy for Islamic terrorism in neighbouring Iran, where some al-Qa'ida fighters have allegedly taken refuge, but almost certainly many are sheltering in Pakistan, where president Musharraf walks a tightrope between cooperating with the West and yet not fully cracking down on his home-grown Jihadi Islamic terrorist groups despite pledging to do so.
These groups infiltrate Indian Kashmir, causing mayhem and making a war between the two nuclear neighbours a very real possibility.
Clearly, President Musharraf does not want a peaceful Kashmir election to be held.
Pakistan is also not fully cooperating with ISAF, allowing it to enter the tribal areas of the north-west frontier region where al-Qa'ida is currently regrouping to threaten Afghanistan's government and civil society.
The West must now be prepared to extend the mandate of Turkish-led ISAF forces beyond this December at the UN and extend their remit to Afghan provinces as well, to end the warlordism and extend the government's authority in the provinces as part of the nation-building exercise and construct a national army and police force and distribute much needed aid to a desperately poor country.
Sadly, the USD 1.8 billion promised in Tokyo for reconstruction has yet to materialise.
Only humanitarian aid has been seen so far.
The recent Operation Mountain Sweep has only brought a few weapon caches to light and we still have a long way to go to make this beautiful country a peaceful and prosperous one and a respectable member of the international community again as it was once in the 1960s and 1970s.
I feel particularly strongly that the government of Afghanistan should grant a moratorium on the use of Sharia law in areas such as the stoning to death of women and the amputation of limbs, in order to show how a modern Islamic country respects international covenants and treaty obligations and promotes justice without cruelty or abuse of human rights.
War criminals must also be brought to book and tried.
Refugees coming to the West who are terrorist sympathisers or have been active with the Taliban or al-Qa'ida must be sent back to face the music.
I sincerely wish President Karzai and ex-king Mohammad Zahir Shah well with all the challenging problems that they face in the months to come.
Overall, I sincerely hope that Afghanistan will again be a respectable member of the international community as it once was.
(Applause on the right)
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we knew, and we warned, that the damage done to women by Taliban fundamentalism was going to be very difficult to repair.
The current situation now shows that a great deal of sustained effort and programmes specifically designed for women will be needed in order to re-establish the minimum right to personal autonomy.
There are, however, many practical actions that the European Union can establish.
We propose, for example, a project offering women the chance to exchange their burkas for driving licences, so that women can exercise their right to free movement and, if they so wish, exchange this item of clothing - which incapacitates them - for cars and driving licences.
The Commission should set in motion a cooperation project allowing Afghan women to make this change: burkas for driving licences, with cars included.
Commissioner, this morning you spoke of the importance and achievements of the groups working over there.
I encourage you to include this very imaginative, innovative project: burkas for cars for Afghan women.
Mr President, wars, the Soviet presence and the Taliban have left a State without institutions or industry and with its agriculture struggling to survive. It has left a State with levels of poverty and illiteracy, including returning illiteracy, in men as well as women, which are truly incredible.
Furthermore, the lack of integration between the different cultural, social, religious and ethnic identities making up Afghan society increases the complexity of the problem with which the transitional government has to deal on a daily basis.
As has been said, governing this country means not just carrying out essential institutional reforms, starting with the Constitution, but creating a basic banking system from scratch with all speed, disseminating education and promoting respect between the citizens and ethnic groups, rebuilding cities and infrastructure, separating military and civil affairs and creating anew industry and agriculture which will be able to survive in a globalised world.
The challenge facing the transitional government is not inconsiderable, for it is a question of doing everything at once with all possible speed, as cheaply as possible and with the widest possible participation.
Clearly, these tasks are not easy, particularly if they have to be carried out within a relatively short space of time.
Moreover, Mr Karzai has explicitly undertaken to achieve a stable peace between the citizens, between ethnic groups and between the sexes, to establish the bases for democratisation of the country in the transitional government's two years of office.
However, as Commissioner Patten said, the path is still very tortuous.
There has been no real, practical improvement in the situation of women, in particular, despite Mr Karzai's statements.
The level of illiteracy among women is incredible - six or seven percent compared to 39% previously.
Even the new government has deteriorated from this point of view, with some warlords assuming a political role not just in the decentralised administrations but in the Kabul government too.
Censorship has increased, as has been mentioned, and women continue to wear the burka and are marginalised, particularly in the southern and south-eastern regions.
The Union must multiply its endeavours to ensure that the hopes which were raised at Bonn are not completely dashed and that the present situation of far-reaching inequality, discrimination and failure to respect human rights does not become established in the long-term.
Mr President, I think everyone agrees that big improvements have taken place in Afghanistan in the last eight months, and I should like to thank MEPs for the debate that has been conducted, but there is also agreement that there are still major problems, as emphasised in, for example, some of the most recent speeches.
I should like firstly to add a couple of remarks about the issue of possible infringements of human rights, for example in connection with the recent discovery of mass graves in northern Afghanistan.
There must be no doubt that the Council attaches crucial importance to the Afghan Government's and the Afghan people's taking responsibility for the past and for the war crimes that might have been committed.
That does not of course mean only the atrocities committed by the Taliban regime.
In that connection, President Karzai's statement that the issue of the mass graves is to be investigated is encouraging.
The UN will play a central role in assisting the Afghan Government with this work. The EU too will of course help as far as possible, partly through our special representative, Mr Vendrell.
Regarding the difficult security situation, especially in the areas outside Kabul, it is my view that the most realistic and forward-looking approach at the moment is to strengthen the transitional government's ability to take care of security itself, partly through assisting with demobilisation, building up the army and the police, developing programmes designed to root out drugs production and setting up an efficient judiciary.
A number of EU Member States are making valuable contributions to this work.
That also applies to the important task, to which Mr Van Orden referred, of clearing the many mines which are a constant danger to the civilian population and make economic regeneration more difficult.
The Council is also alert to the large need for aid of various kinds which has been highlighted on many sides of this Chamber and which is perhaps greater than first assumed, partly because of the large number of refugees who have returned.
In order to contribute to stability in the country, we must, as has been stated, secure a visible peace dividend for the Afghan population.
Aid is also an important tool in our efforts to strengthen the transitional government at the expense of the local warlords.
I might point out that, at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in July, the Chairman of the Council reminded the Member States of the need to ensure that the promises made at the Tokyo Donor Conference earlier in the year are complied with in good time.
Finally, the issue of the situation of women in Afghanistan was raised on quite a few sides of the Chamber.
Right from the beginning, the strengthening of women's rights has been an absolutely central feature of EU policy, and we shall pursue this objective both in our dialogue with the Afghan parties and through the aid we provide. As Mrs Izquierdo Rojo said, it is a question of replacing burkas with driving licences.
I agree entirely. Commissioner Patten will no doubt also say a little about this.
In an overall assessment of the situation in Afghanistan and of the efforts by the international community, it is important to keep a sense of proportion.
As many have pointed out, there are serious problems in Afghanistan today. There are problems with security, with drugs production and, especially, with women's rights.
Compared with the situation less than a year ago, the conditions under which ordinary Afghans live have improved no end.
It may be said that still more might have been expected, but I do not in actual fact think it could have been.
In view of the circumstances, there was reason to fear the worst.
The EU and the Member States reacted quickly and generously, as soon as the opportunity presented itself.
Thousands of Europeans, soldiers, police, emergency aid workers and officials are now making invaluable efforts to help Afghanistan get back on its feet.
It is a difficult, thankless and dangerous task. Many had to lose their lives.
We must, of course, always be receptive to criticism, but the efforts of all the courageous and committed people who have helped rebuild Afghanistan must not be belittled.
On the contrary, we owe it to them to point out the major results that have been achieved.
Europe has nothing to be ashamed of in Afghanistan, and I would just add, last of all, that 100 000 Afghans are now returning home to Afghanistan.
Only very few are obtaining asylum in our countries, because it is now safe in Afghanistan, in any case in large areas of the country.
In this connection, it is a question of acting in accordance with the declaration from the Seville Summit and making vigorous efforts to facilitate repatriation.
That is something we owe to Afghanistan and to those people who are now taking the courageous step of returning.
Mr President, let me make one or two comments in reply to this debate.
First of all, I am grateful for the kind words expressed about the work that has been done by our Commission staff in Kabul and Afghanistan as a whole.
Those tributes are wholly justified.
The remarks made about the International Security Assistance Force underline the importance of the role that has been undertaken by the military in extending security.
I am sure that Member States will note what a number of Members of this House have said about the possibility of extending the role of ISAF and extending its mandate.
It is certainly the case that, if we want to see the authority of the Transitional Authority run right across the whole of the country, then it is imperative that we do not undermine that authority by reinventing the warlords as part of the continuing campaign against al-Qa'ida and the Taliban.
It is absolutely imperative that we give all our support to President Karzai and his team.
I want to make three other points.
First of all, Mrs Maes reminded us of the great importance of not making the same mistakes that we made after the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
We are not engaged in what has occasionally been rather derisorily described as nation-building or, by one distinguished politician, as social work.
All I can say is that it is a pity there was not more social work and nation-building in the 1980s after the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
We might have avoided some of the excesses of the Taliban if that had been the case and avoided the problems that have been visited upon us.
What the honourable Member said is a reminder that the task that we have put our shoulder to is not going to be a short one.
We have to be in Afghanistan, we have to be working in partnership with Afghanistan for many years to come.
It is going to take a long time to complete this work.
Several honourable Members - principally ladies, although it should be an issue of just as much importance to people of my sex as well - referred to gender issues.
We must ensure that they get proper priority in our development assistance and development programmes.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo asked about exchanging burkas for car licences.
She has not, alas, been able to stay with us for the end of the debate, but I will examine the point that she made and we will certainly ensure that the delegation to which she referred gets as much help as is required.
It is extremely important for Members of this House to visit Afghanistan, see for themselves what is going on and give their support to the early stages of the democratic process in that country.
Let me now deal with the issue of implementing the pledges and promises that were made in Tokyo.
It is obviously important, as we discovered in Kosovo, in East Timor and in other countries and societies recovering from crisis, to ensure that the help which is pledged arrives as swiftly as possible.
Not all is perfect by any means in Afghanistan.
When Mr Tannock said that only humanitarian aid had arrived so far, that was a tad exaggerated.
Certainly, as I made clear in my own speech, a great deal of reconstruction assistance has already been provided by the European Commission and others.
It is particularly notable that the money we have been providing for budgetary support just to get government running - and we have probably been the biggest providers of that support - has certainly been provided rapidly and has been well used.
I want to refer to the point made by Mr Van Orden about ensuring that even as one spends money rapidly, it is spent prudently and transparently because we have to be aware of the Court of Auditors, we have to be aware of the terrors of appearing in front of the Committee on Budgetary Control or the Committee on Budgets, we have to be aware of the importance of keeping European public opinion on our side.
Just as in the case of the Palestinian Authority, to which he referred, it is the European Commission which has actually led the way in ensuring that reformed and transparent financial controls are put in place.
We have led the way in reforming those financial controls which everybody is now supporting and using.
