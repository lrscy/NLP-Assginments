I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services.
Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance.
Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.
However, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market.
However, these countries â precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market â need a longer period of adaptation.
It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States.
These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly.
These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita.
This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping.
Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.
Apart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions.
We are not aiming at introducing an approach that would drive investors away from the European Union.
Therefore maintaining well-targeted, but moderate assistance could be both justified and useful, without distorting competition.
This is already forecasted in the Directives concerning regional assistance.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr HÃ¶kmark, for his balanced report on State aid, which is identical to a balanced report and presentation of State aid on the part of the Commission.

Within this framework I should like to highlight certain important points, to which priority should be given: firstly, the need to redefine the objectives and forms of State aid and the system for controlling and notifying State aid; secondly, the safeguarding of legal clarity as to what qualifies as State aid in services of general economic interest, where over-counterbalancing should be considered the most fundamental criterion, the differentiation of State aid between small and large public corporations and the promotion of company subsidies, which should be combined with strong tax incentives.
Finally, there should be support for innovative actions on matters of research, development and innovation, mainly in remote countries and areas, especially where there is a large technological divide.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking MrÂ HÃ¶kmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today.
The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States.
It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform.
When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives.
Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent.
This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended.
We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose.
We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid.
We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt.
We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo.
Once again, I wish to thank our rapporteur for his work.
Â Â  Mr President, State aid is a legitimate instrument for public action.
Since it provides a particular advantage and differentiated treatment, its establishment required stricter justification than other alternatives and it needed to be drawn up in a careful manner in order to guarantee that it is effective and consistent with the Unionâs policies and objectives, as well as its international commitments.
The reform of State aid for the period 2005-2009 must bear in mind that, even when regional aid contributes to true convergence, there are great internal differences in income and opportunities amongst the regions of Europe.
The result of the HÃ¶kmark report is well balanced.
I am pleased that it reflects the need to link the reform of regional structural aid to the reform of the regulations on the Structural Funds until 2013, stressing its complementary nature, and that it advocates the maintenance of adequate support measures for regions affected by the statistical effect without any discrimination.
I take a positive view of the proposal to increase the threshold for de minimis aid, which will eliminate bureaucracy and above all benefit SMEs.
Â Â  ( I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr HÃ¶kmark, for his excellent and well-balanced report, with many ideas on how State aid policy should be consistently evaluated and implemented.
On the one hand, it is naturally in our interest to make sure that State aid provided in individual Member States does not undermine the natural competitive environment.
On the other hand, it gives me great pleasure that in its action plan for State aid reform the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that it is essential to strengthen the European Union by means of promoting the knowledge-based economy, something we have been demanding for so long.
In my contribution, IÂ would particularly like to emphasise innovation, research and development, areas closely associated with access to venture capital.
These are areas where public funding may be usefully applied, generating high rates of return in the form of sustainable development and the increased competitiveness of the European economy, primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The model of public and private partnerships establishing research and development centres, technology incubators and high-tech centres where universities have an important role, as well as local and regional authorities and third sector institutions, may contribute significantly to greater transparency over the use of public funds and, at the same time, help better tap the research, technological and innovation potential of individual member countries.
The same applies to venture capital funds.
Without public funds, it is almost impossible to set up the seed capital funds that innovative start-up businesses need so badly.
State aid policy must in no way restrain their development.
On the contrary, it should encourage and attract sufficient private capital funding.
I trust that State aid reform will meet such requirements.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too agree with the rapporteur, with the Commissioner and with many of my fellow Members that we should reform State aid by adapting it to the current challenges.
The problem is finding the right methods to do so.
I believe that the key strategy is one of reducing the amount of State aid, rewarding some sectors that have been mentioned, such as innovation, research, the environment and businesses, and ensuring greater transparency.
As my colleague, MrÂ SÃ¡nchez Presedo, just mentioned, it is also advisable to link State aid to the cohesion policy.
In this area, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has rightly added a paragraph on advantageous tax conditions.
We are talking here about an instrument that can tie in with the cohesion measures and release entrepreneurial potential in some particularly disadvantaged areas.
I hope that the Commission and Commissioner Kroes intend to take account of this important statement by Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, delighted as I am with Mr HÃ¶kmarkâs report on European State aid reform, I should like to thank him warmly and join in the broad support he has received here in this House.
I fully endorse the Commissionâs chief message of less but better-targeted State aid, as well as the fresh policyâs mainstays of innovation and research.
I am looking forward to the Commissionâs concrete proposals on this score.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be closely monitoring the Commission in the next few months and we will gladly enter into dialogue with it, because I hope that the Commission will issue more detailed guidelines on the definition of State aid so as to guarantee more legal certainty and prevent misuse at the same time, because innovation should be what it implies, rather than a licence for certain Member States to carry on as before.
I am also pleased that the majority in Parliament wants to go further than the Commissioner, by doubling the minimum threshold at which point State aid must be reported to Brussels.
This cuts out much of the red-tape and administrative burden, which will mainly benefit SMEs.
I would ask the Commissioner if she is prepared to accept Parliamentâs proposal.
Commissioner, we in the Netherlands have been familiar with your determination for much longer, and I should like to thank you for the determined manner in which you are reforming State aid.
I would urge you to keep up the good work, for much remains to be done.
Â Â  Mr President, State aid policy must be consistent with the EUâs proclaimed political goals.
State aid should accelerate sustainable growth and sustainable competitiveness, and reduce regional disparities.
Aid must not be given where it would work against these principles.
Properly targeted State aid encourages enterprise and creates jobs, even in regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages or are a long way from the big markets.
Those regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages, such as those in the north, should be in the same category as the Objective 1 zones.
Aid needs to be targeted more precisely, and should especially be allocated to bottlenecks in business, such as risk financing to create new technology and put it to use.
Special attention needs to be paid to environmental technologies and their potential for job creation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr HÃ¶kmark, for his outstanding report.
As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013.
As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area.
The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europeâs disadvantaged regions.
As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals.
The scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration.
Were such support is no longer possible, these regionsâ convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid.
This is particularly the case for regions bordering on the new Member States.
The reduction of bureaucracy is an important part of the law on aid and, like the increase in aid, makes an important contribution to making the legal environment more welcoming to businesses.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the same way that our rapporteur is a sensible man, this proposal for a resolution is a sensible balance between various opinions and fulfils a core requirement of the European Union, which has been stuck in a rut of low and uncompetitive growth for far too long.
The Prodi Commission always looked upon State aid as the enemy of competition and of the single market.
Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy.
In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.
None of us opposes competition.
Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.
As MrÂ Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies.
To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.
I therefore want to make just one recommendation to MrsÂ Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible.
This proposal should â if not exclusively, then mainly â take account of Parliamentâs guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Councilâs crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member Statesâ markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is.
Â Â  . Mr President, I count my blessings tonight.
I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.
I should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma.
That was made clear on your side.
It is more that we try to give a hook to Member Statesâ companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves.
Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.
Mrs inât Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid.
She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion.
I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council.
Aid should be less and better.
That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report.
State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues.
We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model.
These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg.
However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayersâ money.
We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route.
It would have a very detrimental effect.
We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.
On the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice.
It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members.
Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.
A couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need.
We discussed this before and it was adopted last year.
Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment.
We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.
We will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships.
The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation.
The question of innovation has been raised.
I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top.
That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.
Turning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises.
So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises.
That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies.
It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.
It has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe.
Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks.
State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.
Mr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold.
I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it.
However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape.
The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category.
So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.
On the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental.
I am sure that is not the question that is being asked.
We have to look at all the policies of the Union.
However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.
On public services, services of general economic interest, the Commissionâs decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation.
The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments.
As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary.
I am talking about less bureaucracy.
I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.
Finally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0021/2006) by MrsÂ Edit Herczog, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the effects of globalisation on the internal market (2004/2225(INI)).
Â Â  Globalisation has been present throughout the history of Europe.
Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution.
Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.
At the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation.
This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe.
The same is true today.
The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.
The question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century.
I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines.
The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves.
Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in todayâs world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind.
With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title.
The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates.
To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition.
We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises.
There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament.
It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks.
I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.
This is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property.
If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision.
And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within.
We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.
This is what I have tried to contribute to with my report.
I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped.
I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs MrsÂ Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together.
I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.
It was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter.
I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say.
The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way.
The report is a timely contribution to an important debate.
Europe needs to find appropriate responses to todayâs key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.
As international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack.
Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation.
There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular.
There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance.
However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom.
I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere â foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.
Protectionism is not the answer. It never was historically â it only ever led to great tensions between nations â and it is not now.
Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will.
For people first. With jobs.
With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.
I am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation.
As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths.
And we do not need to be modest about this.
Europe has a lot to offer.
We must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in high-value products and services, where our businesses excel.
This requires a strong, knowledge-based and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned.
This is Europeâs best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.
Priorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders.
Most of the relevant work is already under way, and it is important that all players, at the EU level and at Member State level, do everything to make it happen.
As the report quite rightly stresses, globalisation also has a strong external dimension for internal market policy-making.
We need to be much more outward-looking than in the past and to be aware of the external aspects of our internal economic policies, such as our internal market rules.
Nothing is simply domestic any more.
We need more international regulatory convergence and equivalence of rules.
This is particularly important in the area of financial markets, which are leading the way in globalisation.
Furthermore, Europe must use its scale to help deliver ambitious and balanced solutions to problems of market access or regulatory issues.
A successful conclusion of the Doha Round, including on services, is a key element in this respect.
Everyone will benefit!
Last but not least, we need a new partnership of the EU and Member States.
Neither can deliver on their own to ensure that Europe remains the attractive place that it still is.
I am confident that the report of the European Parliament will contribute significantly to this important wider discussion on Europe in the globalised world.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Herczog, Commissioner, the Committee on International Trade has delivered an opinion that, understandably enough, concerns itself primarily with trade issues, and, although her committee has not taken on board all our suggestions â for such is politics â we are grateful to the rapporteur for this own-initiative report of hers.
What, then, did we see as the main points of concern?
As a means of compensating for globalisationâs potentially adverse effects within the European Union, the Commission had proposed the creation of a special fund, and we had agreed that this was the right thing to do, going on to say that such a fund would have to be properly endowed.

Secondly, we had noted that the European Union, despite adverse conditions worldwide, is one of the worldâs biggest producers and investors, and that it does indeed, of course, have opportunities to carry on exercising a great deal of economic clout in globalised markets, but we did also point out that â particularly when doing business with third countries â we need to consider whether those countries comply with international standards in labour law, social security law and the environment, and we proposed that preferential trade arrangements should be extended or adapted in such a way that certain preferences would be accorded to those third countries that do so â that is, to those that have ratified the international agreements on the protection of workers and of the environment and have duly implemented them.
The Commissioner has just referred to the Doha Round, and he was right to do so, although assessments of it differ widely.
In the opinion that our committee has produced, we said that we call on the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of further multilateral agreements on agriculture and services within the European Union, before we continue with these negotiations.
There is an interaction here; just as we in the European Union have certain problems that I could enumerate if I had sufficient time, so, likewise, the third countries have their own, and I do believe that the only way that all sides will make headway is for them to accept one anotherâs problems.
Â Â  . â This report, which I instigated, is a response to the increasing problems facing the Unionâs internal market within the world economy.
Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Unionâs internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads.
The fate of Europeâs prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely.
High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet.
On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards.
In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness.
Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws.
This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.
This report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards.
It is also a call for Europeâs foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values.
Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue.
The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Unionâs internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has taken account of the public hearings and the entire debate in both committees.
Her report is both well-balanced and thorough, and as such deserves Parliamentâs resounding support.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a global market in which information technology enables the movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is a phenomenon we cannot deny, and we must strive to take advantage of the positive opportunities offered by this phenomenon.
Only a competitive economy can survive in a global market.
The EU's internal market, having been one of the strongest participants in the world market, is losing acceleration and is stagnating.
By taking advantage of imperfection in WTO rules, and by not adhering to work safety and environmental standards, Asian countries, China for example, are successfully conquering the EU's textiles, footwear and electronics markets.
The hesitation of EU states to make decisions, which will influence the long-term outlook for the EU's economic development, also threatens competitiveness in other areas.
By this I mean the absence of a common energy and industrial policy, and the growing threat to the EU's labour market and the free movement of services.
The application of the transition period for the movement of the new states' labour forces, and the adoption of a services directive, which does not embrace the country of origin principle, will reduce the EU's competitiveness.
Therefore, I urge the old EU Member States to reject the transition period for the movement of labour forces, and urge the European Parliament to vote for a services directive, which embraces the country of origin principle.
Â Â  . Mr President, the report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market is based on an erroneous perception which has been generally promoted for some time now by the European Commission and which is leading to the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty.
In other words, instead of identifying social inequalities and promoting their eradication, it takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote them, in the name of deregulation of the market.
As a result, I distinguish three basic negative concepts in the report: firstly, the fact that we are calling on the European Union to define a strategy for facing the challenges in question, by making the internal market more flexible.
Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.
Anyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7Â billion people in the rest of the world.
Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write.
The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments.
Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day.
Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.
Finally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals.
The report does not identify these effects, let alone address them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I speak as a professional economist of some years â not without a modest prestige in the City of London â so perhaps I know something of how the global economy works.
The idea that failing national economies should be given money to protect them from global realities is like giving a bottle of whisky to an alcoholic.
One manâs State aid is another manâs tax.
Money spent by a politician is nearly always wasted.
This place is the problem, it is not the solution.
Perhaps we should occupy our time with a standardisation of windscreen wipers or spirit bottles, or phasing out the oldest profession in the world, or some such nonsense.
Let us see if serious thought should be left to those with experience of the real world, sadly unrepresented in this place.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Herczogâs report contains a whole list of very wise observations.
Europe needs sweeping change, and in particular it needs to build a genuinely common market for labour and services.
At present, this market remains closed to a great many Europeans.
If Europe fails to remedy the situation it will suffer in terms of global competitiveness.
If we are honest with ourselves, I think most of us have now lost count of the number of times we have heard statements of this sort.
Citizens of the new Member States of the Union are only entitled to work in three countries of the old Fifteen.
The overwhelming majority of the Unionâs Member States still does not believe that cheaper labour and cheaper, more competitive, services are good for the economy, or that they will reinvigorate it, thus generating growth in both employment and income.
The more national protection of national markets of labour and services there is, the more jobs and services will be delocalised beyond the Unionâs borders.
They will move to Delhi and Beijing rather than to Warsaw or Budapest.
We need more action and fewer words.
The first test of our real intentions will come on Thursday, when we vote on the Services Directive.
This will be an opportunity for us to demonstrate whether we want a genuinely free common market or whether we will be content with a cheap sham and with empty words, blaming an evil and callous outside world which is fast leaving us behind.
Â Â  Mr President, although we know that we cannot stop globalisation, there is no doubt about the need to create the right framework conditions to keep the number of its victims in EU states as low as possible.
It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels have left them in the lurch.
The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it.
The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at.
We must, then, cost what it may, stick with the transition periods for the labour market in order â even if only to a limited extent â to alleviate these evils.
There may well be export surpluses, and major conglomerates may be doing well, but jobs that pay social insurance contributions are stagnant, and so our social security system is taking a battering.
For years, the Commission has been stressing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses as job generators, yet one after another, laws are being enacted that make life more difficult for them.
Both support grants and public contracts are targeted at big firms, so these move every couple of years to wherever the highest grants are currently paid.
This must change, and change without delay, or else â or so it seems to me â Europeâs small and medium-sized businesses will be thrown to the wolves.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have six ideas that I would like to put forward on this subject.
In the first place, although we are all aware that globalisation is going on, I do believe, in contrast to MrÂ MÃ¶lzer, who spoke just now, that we have to seize it as an opportunity if we want to take the right action.
Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the worldâs ethics organisation alongside it.
Ideas about a âglobal Marshall Planâ in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.
My third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this.
Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.
Fourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation.
A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European Peopleâs Party that âthe globalisersâ young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisersâ senior citizens are in the Westâ.
We see this as a disconcerting analysis of our necessary response.
Fifthly, we make the internal market into a domestic market and make the four freedoms a reality for employers and workers.
The services directive is part of that.
Lastly, I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved.
Â Â  ( To begin with, IÂ would like to thank the rapporteur, Edit Herczog, for her detailed analysis of the effects of globalisation on the internal market and for incorporating my amendments and additions to this consistent report.
I agree with the rapporteur that if the phenomenon of globalisation is to be positively perceived, it must benefit as many stakeholders as possible, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
What should the European Union do to stand up to the competition of the USA and vast, rapidly growing, Asian economies?
Firstly, investment in education, research and development must be a priority, because the only way for the European Union to compete is through high added value in its goods and services.
Since implementing a knowledge-based economy is not feasible without a proper strategy and adequate financing, it will be necessary, before approving the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013, to reconsider the incomprehensible reduction in education and research spending, which jeopardises such important activities as the 7th Framework Programme.
A warning to this effect has also been issued by the European Universities Association, aÂ prominent European academic body that brings together universities and the national organisations for heads of universities.
Secondly, we must focus our support on small and medium-sized start-up businesses, and improve their access to venture capital in the early phases of their development, as they form the backbone of the entire economic system.
Thirdly, twelve Member States of the European Union must embrace theÂ message from the European Commission that closing labour markets does not pay.
Fourthly, we must eliminate barriers in the internal market by approving the amendment to the Services Directive proposed by IMCO.
Ladies and gentlemen, globalisation is both a great challenge and an opportunity for Europe.
If we fail to make use of it, we will lose out to our competitors.
Â Â  . Mr President, we should thank Mrs Herczog in particular for provoking such a stimulating debate on globalisation, but this eveningâs discussion shows that globalisation is something of a loaded term.
It causes concern and apprehension.
I understand these concerns, but I do not share them.
We in Europe should have more confidence in our own ability.
Globalisation can be a challenge, but equally it is an opportunity and that is how we should approach it.
The reason is simple.
We have no alternative.
Seeing globalisation as a threat feeds calls for protectionism.
I have stated on numerous occasions that I do not think that closing borders and protecting markets can be the answer.
Shielding economies from competition does not make them competitive.
Markets only become competitive if companies are forced to compete.
Remaining in a state of denial, pretending the outside world does not exist, is a recipe for lacklustre economic performance.
With poor economic performance, we simply cannot sustain our social model.
Globalisation is not something that happens outside the single market; it is part of the single market and the single market is part of a globalised market.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the oral question to the Commission, on SOLVIT, by MrsÂ Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (0-0087/2005/rev. â B6-0001/2006).
Â Â  . It was my predecessor, Philip Whitehead, who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers.
That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network.
I want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system.
He said, âSOLVIT is a great service and it should really shout louder about its achievementsâ.
The positive achievements and experiences of our citizens translate into positive attitudes towards Europe, and I believe that our duty as legislators has to be to ensure that the laws we pass are implemented in a way that gives our citizens and consumers the benefits of working, living or doing business in the internal market.
When errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws, not only are citizens denied their rights, but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined.
SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union.
At the same time, it has the potential to be the customer service face, or the front desk, of the EU law-making process.
It can influence peopleâs perceptions of the EU.
I have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions.
One of my constituents had difficulty in having a blue disabled badge issued in Germany: Mrs Nuttall was informed that she had to be a resident in Germany.
SOLVIT stepped in and contacted the local German authority, which then issued her with a temporary blue disabled parking badge â again, that was the EU delivering for citizens.
As is indicated in our question, the committee certainly believes that the online problem-solving network can find pragmatic and rapid solutions, which do not have to end up in the courts or as infringement cases.
Clearly, however, SOLVIT needs more resources and support, and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public.
It needs to make its services better known to libraries, to consumer watchdogs and, of course, to my fellow MEPs, as well as to local authorities, which are often in breach of EU law.
I believe, as does my constituent, that a revamp of the website is needed, with, where possible, real-life cases that have been solved by SOLVIT.
Mr Meehan has said to me that the SOLVIT system could benefit from joint cooperation with Europe Direct.
Often he has contacted Europe Direct with questions only to find that it is the SOLVIT staff that have the technical and legal expertise to answer the questions that the public and his citizens need answered.
There could well be a strong role for the SOLVIT network in assisting with the implementation of the Services Directive.
It could assist in aiding market access for businesses, by supporting the role of the single point of contact for businesses to get into the single market in services, known as the âone-stop shopâ.
The committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened.
We want to see it better resourced, both in the Commission and at Member State level, and we want to see SOLVIT as a trouble-shooter for citizens and consumers throughout the EU.
Commissioner, I hope you will take up the issues in the committeeâs question.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission very much appreciates the interest expressed by the European Parliament in the EU problem-solving network SOLVIT.

SOLVIT is more than just a system, it is in many ways the starting point of a change in administrative culture, for the following reasons: firstly, with its ten-week deadline and pragmatic approach, SOLVIT cuts procedural red tape and puts citizens and businesses first; secondly, Member States are made directly responsible for solving internal market problems that arise between them and, thirdly, with its fully transparent way of working, SOLVIT delivers measurable results that make a real difference for citizens and businesses.
After three years of experience, the Commission can wholeheartedly recommend SOLVIT as an alternative, fast and effective way of handling complaints.
Therefore, more resources have been allocated to the Commission SOLVIT support team, which, since September, counts five full-time and four part-time staff.
One of the key policy objectives for SOLVIT is to integrate it as a standard instrument in the toolbox of all Commission case handlers dealing with the complaints of citizens and businesses.
We also wish to further increase awareness about the existence and the possibilities of SOLVIT within other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament, within national administrations and within organisations representing citizens and business interests.
There are currently two issues that need to be addressed to allow SOLVIT to reach its full potential: the need for Member Statesâ authorities to change administrative practices and habits, and ensuring that sufficient resources are available at national level to handle SOLVIT complaints and to engage in awareness-raising activities.
SOLVIT is a tool designed for problem solving.
The Commission believes that the SOLVIT working method can be developed in order to support administrative cooperation in many areas.
Inspired by the success of SOLVIT, we are currently developing an internal market information system, which is a more general tool aimed at supporting administrative cooperation between Member States across the internal market.
The profile of SOLVIT at the political level should be raised.
It is only with sufficient political commitment that administrations will be prepared to resort to faster and more informal methods for problem solving wherever possible.
It is only with a clear political will that sufficient staff will be allocated in national administrations to solve problems within deadlines and to get the word out to businesses and citizens.
Given its rate of success so far, the Commission believes that it will be possible to ensure more awareness-raising without having to provide a binding legal basis for SOLVIT.
The absence of such a binding legal basis has, to date, allowed a great deal of flexibility.
Moreover, over the past few years we have seen interesting spontaneous developments, such as the more structural resolution of problems by several SOLVIT centres, even though this is not part of the SOLVIT mandate as described in the Commission recommendation.
The Commission will continue to play an active role in the further development of SOLVIT.
A second annual report on the functioning and development of SOLVIT will be available in April 2006 and will allow the European Parliament to further monitor the situation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome this question.
I would also like to welcome my friend and colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who is here for the first time as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection: this is the first of many future occasions when we will grapple with the issues.
I want to declare a special interest in SOLVIT.
My office was privileged to be one of the pilot users of the system, and my staff have been trained on it.
We have referred quite a number of complaints to it.
We have been extremely gratified by the results, and the people we have helped have also been pleased.
I would like to associate myself very fully indeed with the tone of this question, but I think that there are a number of points that flow from it, because the resources that it needs are not just at Commission level as you, Commissioner, pointed out.
We also have to get the Member States to put the resources in and gear up their activities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank publicly the very hard-working UK staff of SOLVIT in the Department of Trade and Industry who have been extremely helpful to my staff in pursuing a very wide range of complaints.
I am sure that other countries have had the same experience.
But, Commissioner, you need to put pressure on the Member States as well.
As you said, it is the change of culture that is going to be absolutely vital in this respect.
I also want to support very much what you said about the evolution of this type of combination of technology and process â using the technology to cut through the bureaucracy â because we hope and we are sure, in fact, that we will need this as the internal market for services develops.
I am increasingly certain that we will improve this with a substantial majority this week, but we want to get on with that.
There are new cooperative provisions in there, there will be new small businesses accessing the single market and all of them will need access to SOLVIT if we really are going to get the economic benefits that the single market promises.
Â Â  . When we talk about consumer protection, assistance granted to enterprises or any aspects of the expansion and enforcement of European Union law, we always mention efficiency and pragmatism as important endeavours.
SOLVIT is the system that could be a textbook example of the achievement of such objectives.
SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face.
As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004.
This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week.
But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all.
If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem.
The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system.
This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.
This means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years.
This process will need appropriate human and financial resources.
We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible.
And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens.
We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.
Therefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is indeed a special question, and it is good that it represents the continuity between our former chairman, Mr Whitehead, and Mrs McCarthy.
When the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work.
It has been a success: it delivers positive outcomes; it has practical effects both for SMEs and others trying to make the internal market work.
It deals mainly with administrative problems.
But I, like others, have had many positive experiences in referring constituents to SOLVIT and seeing them come away as satisfied customers.
However, the question certainly points out the problems: resources and publicity.
If there is a good service there, then we surely need to tell more people about it; and if resources are needed and the problems are at Member State level, we need to try and address that.
But I want to draw attention to something else.
Last week I had the opportunity to speak at a meeting hosted by the Commission of consumer representatives from consumer bureaux across the European Union.
It is quite clear that there are still enormous problems in satisfying the cross-border difficulties that consumers encounter.
I believe that we could do more to extend the SOLVIT-type system to these sorts of problems.
The SOLVIT system is, after all, simple, pragmatic and practical â surely an example of the best sort of thing we do, rather than being overly legalistic.
It shows the EU can deliver added value that gives practical effect to our citizens, to make our internal market work for the best.
Let us take it further, if we can, by extending it more into the area of consumers, and not just that of administrative problems.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is more money again, is it not?
May I suggest that the people who think this network is a really good idea pay for it themselves, instead of squeezing ever more money out of the hard-pressed British taxpayer, who is already being squeezed dry by the greedy and stupid politicians who seem to hold sway over us at every level.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the existence of the internal market opens up tremendous opportunities for the citizens.
However, this market often fails to operate as it should.
The law is often unclear and incoherent and problems concerning its interpretation arise constantly.
As a result, individuals and economic entities have to deal with many obstacles in the course of their activities.
The SOLVIT system can be very helpful in such cases.
The unquestionable advantage of the network is that it deals with complaints from both citizens and entrepreneurs, and that it is required to find solutions to any problem raised within a short period of time.
Another important feature is that SOLVIT is free of charge.
Also, according to official statistics, it resolves 75% of the cases it takes on.
SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States.
A further advantage of the network is that thanks to its negotiating skills, SOLVIT is able to find quicker and far cheaper solutions than the courts could to even the most complicated problems.
In order to guarantee high operating standards, SOLVIT has recently introduced a range of improvements to facilitate communication between networks and the individuals or entrepreneurs seeking solutions to their problems.
As a result, my constituency office has also been linked to the SOLVIT network. This enables the citizens of my region to bring their problems to my assistants and seek help through us.
In view of the SOLVIT networkâs success to date, I believe it should be developed further.
That is why I fully support the proposal to increase the human resources allocated substantially above the four officials currently assigned to it.
There can be no doubt that the concept of the operation of the European SOLVIT system as an instrument to resolve problems within the internal market is a worthy one and deserves strong support.
Nonetheless, as politicians responsible for law making, it is incumbent on us to make every effort to create clear, transparent and wise laws.
These laws should meet the citizensâ and entrepreneursâ expectations.
They should also foster economic development and the creation of a genuine single market.
It is an inspired venture, close to the hearts of the founding fathers of the European Union.
Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.
In the course of this parliamentary sitting we shall have a good opportunity to make up for lost time where the creation of a single market in services is concerned.
We must not give in to public pressure.
Instead, we must send out a clear signal that Parliament is determined to create a genuine single market where there will no longer be problems for the SOLVIT programme to resolve.
The European Commissionâs draft Services Directive deserves our support.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years ago the European Commission introduced the SOLVIT network, dedicated to solving infringements of Internal Market law without legal proceedings.
EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc. SOLVIT offers the complainant an opportunity to save time and avoid expensive judicial proceedings.
This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.
Around 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved.
In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states.
Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons.
Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania.
However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.
The small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system.
This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT.
We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses.
I urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions.
Some practical suggestions and ideas were put forward, particularly by Mrs McCarthy, which I have taken up with my services.
SOLVIT is about making the single market work.
We often hear calls for more single market, more harmonisation.
That seems to many to be the answer to all problems.
I do not believe that more directives and more harmonisation are the only solutions.
Indeed, they may even be part of the problem.
If there is a practical problem with doing business across borders, it needs a practical solution.
Legal proceedings or regulation are rarely a practical solution, but SOLVIT is.
It allows the parties to the problem and the national administrations to communicate effectively and to find a solution in a matter of weeks.
Our businesses and consumers need an answer and a solution.
Systems such as SOLVIT contribute to that.
SOLVIT has been a success.
Hundreds of problems have been solved through it.
Some may not be impressed by these figures, but high numbers indicate that there are problems and that the single market is not working in some areas.
That is certainly not the case; the single market working, but it needs some assistance here and there through light-touch mechanisms. That is what SOLVIT is.
We should not make it a victim of its own success by formalising it or making it heavy-handed.
Yes, we must raise awareness that SOLVIT is a way of solving problems.
Yes, Member States and the Commission must ensure it is properly resourced, but we should not turn it into something that it is not.
My recommendation for SOLVIT is the same as it is for many other issues: namely, keep it simple.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the confiscation of automobiles by the Greek authorities (2005/2005(INI)) (A6-0394/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a sadness to have to deal with this issue, which goes to the heart of the .
One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy, but one that affects other EU citizens.
On the Committee on Petitions, above all other committees, I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us.
We have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities.
The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC, which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are â and that is key â in another Member State.
The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitionersâ property, claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments.
The petitioners have been asked, in some instances, to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle.
This report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November.
The petitioners came to present their petition, explaining that, in some cases, they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EURÂ 45Â 000 to retrieve their property, after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles.
Both I, as rapporteur, and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them.
An amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament.
However, I am informed that this law still gives the Greek Government the power to confiscate vehicles in this situation.
It is worth remembering that the petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption, laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC, from, in particular, turnover tax, excise duty and other consumption tax, in respect of temporary imports from another Member State of motor-driven road vehicles.
All the petitioners have their normal residence â i.e., the place where they live at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal or occupational ties â in a Member State other than Greece; that is, they fulfil the conditions laid down in the directive.
The petitioners were also able to give absolute proof of their normal place of residence by appropriate means, such as identity cards or other valid documents.
Furthermore, the imposition of a special administrative penalty and, in particular, of fines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle â with no account being taken of the age of that vehicle â as well as of an increased duty, which, in some cases, can amount to up to ten times the taxes in question, is â not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of the Commission â incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality.
Finally, I hope that the adoption of this report will send a very strong signal to the Greek authorities that they must amend their law so that it is in conformity with the EU directives that I have referred to.
Often in the EU, we believe that the is an menu from which we can pick and choose what we like.
On the contrary: the and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the .
I call on the Commission to tell us what actions it will be taking if the Greek authorities fail to implement the Community directive appropriately.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece.
I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashmanâs report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it.
The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.
Let me say a few words on the case in question.
In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars.
I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State â I emphasise âresidentâ and not ânationalâ â to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met.
One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.
The application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece.
It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece.
This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis.
The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case.
The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences.
For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.
Let me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.
To a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level.
Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.
When an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.
It is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs.
However, they should respect the principle of proportionality.
A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.
The Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation.
However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.
To conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals.
In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market.
One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years.
The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.
I thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the Cashman report was not drafted in order to defend the .
It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support.

I shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament. Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?
As to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States.
That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive.
As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores.
So why was the report drafted?
The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament.
The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule.
The report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts.
I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice.
I trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome.
Â Â  â Mr President, as vice-chairwoman of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament and given that we are debating the report by my honourable friend MrÂ Cashman on confiscations of automobiles in Greece, I should point out the following: firstly, a final judgment has not been returned on all the cases before the judicial authorities; consequently there are proceedings pending and, if we assume that we have this jurisdiction, then why has it not also been applied to other similar cases?
I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory, a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted, however, on the grounds that proceedings were pending.
Secondly, the report only concerns Greece, at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union.
The obvious conclusion from this is that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself.
Let us look now at the report, the petitions and the data: Community directive 83/182 on tax exemptions lays down the preconditions for application of the scheme for the temporary importation and transportation of automobiles for private use.
It does not stipulate the fines imposed, for which the Member States are competent.
Greek legislation on the fines was adopted in order to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, at a time when it was rife.
Besides, the fines do not relate solely to individuals; they also relate to dealers and organised groups that are demonstrably trying to evade taxes.
With respect to the non-application of the rule of proportionality, which the report cites for the imposition of fines on the basis solely of the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the court notes that the adoption of such measures is needed for reasons of suppression and prevention.
Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state. As a result, the courts have handed down acquittals in respect of the criminal element, but not in respect of the fines.
As far as the fines are concerned, a bill was tabled before the Greek parliament on 22 December 2005, which makes provision for reductions and for the application of temporary seizure in exceptional cases only.
It is, I think, clear that we are all defending the application of the , while at the same time recognising crucial differences between the Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mr Cashman for his very clear, concise and accurate report.
It would appear from the tone of the debate that some people do not have a very good understanding of what the Committee on Petitions is; we respond to the complaints and concerns of the citizens, from any country.
We do not deal with a countryâs internal affairs, quite the opposite: we deal with cases of European citizens whose rights have been violated.
That is what the Committee on Petitions does.
We are neither the judge nor one of the parties.
We in the Committee on Petitions do not make any decisions.
We are mediators.
We respond to the European citizens.
In this case, I believe that the majority of members of the Committee on Petitions believe that rights and directives have been violated and that the Greek authoritiesâ practice of confiscating cars and the practice of imposing astronomical fines are totally unacceptable.
There is a clear violation of Directive 83/182, and that affects the whole of Europe.
An Administration must not fund itself nor act in such an unclear and unjust manner towards its citizens and ultimately towards all of the Europeans who wish to visit that beautiful, wonderful and historic country of Greece.
We want to be able to visit Greece without fear of our car being taken away, or of the other things that happen there.
Finally, I would like to thank the Commissionâs technical team for the excellent, exemplary work of mediation and communication it has done, which has been professional and, I believe, very effective.
I hope that the Greek authorities will act to change the condemnable practice that we are discussing today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I have closely followed the matter and I have met some of the petitioners, including MrÂ Louloudakis, the man responsible for bringing the lawsuit against the Hellenic Republic, which came before the Court of Justice.
I am genuinely shocked by the seriousness of the case.
Like MrÂ Cashman, whom I thank for his excellent and balanced work, I actually find it unacceptable that this has happened in a European Union that is aiming to complete the single market precisely in the next few days and months, by means of the free movement of goods, persons and economic services.
It is unacceptable that European citizens in possession of valid documents, who temporarily find themselves in a Member State as tourists or workers, should be treated like criminals and accused of crimes for which there is not even any evidence.
The petitioners have found themselves stripped of their rightful belongings and inflicted fines of many hundreds of thousands of euros.
In some cases, these fines have dealt an extremely serious blow to the financial, physical and emotional stability of the families affected.
Through this institution, I therefore call for greater compliance with Community law and with its general principles of freedom and proportionality, through strict monitoring of customs procedures.
I also call for the persons affected to be duly compensated for all the material and moral damage they have unfairly suffered until now.
Lastly, I call for vigilance so that the power of control, which is lawful in every country, does not end up being abused more or less deliberately.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened to the debate attentively and I wish to comment on a few aspects.
It is true that since the beginning of the infringement procedure, the situation has improved in the Member State concerned.
I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law.
This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made.
However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.
Let me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue from the one dealt with in Mr Cashmanâs report.
On the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned.
European law â particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods â may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to second-hand cars.
However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.
On the other hand, Mr Cashmanâs report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to re-register it.
I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities.
The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of ânormal residenceâ by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.
In fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located.
If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly.
I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State.
This is the core point of the case being discussed now.
Before concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate.
It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.
Another issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case.
We sought the opinion of Parliamentâs Legal Service.
It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliamentâs Legal Service.
To conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible.
A case is pending before the European Court of Justice.
Of course this pending case does not in any way prevent a Member State that wishes to comply with Community Law from changing its legislation in the meantime before the decision is issued.
We have indeed heard that Greece has drafted or is drawing up legislation, but as we have not received any official signal from the Greek authorities, we cannot give our opinion on it.
The Commission very much welcomes the encouraging signals that it has received from the Greek authorities during the debates in Parliament and would also welcome this being consolidated by the adoption of the new law.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, there was a suggestion, interestingly from my own side of the House, that we were targeting Greece unfairly.
Let me just say that, in the Committee on Petitions, we can only react to and deal with petitions that we have received and we have received no petitions from any other Member State regarding the confiscation of vehicles.
As Commissioner KovÃ¡cs quite rightly said, where there are problems, vehicles have not been confiscated.
I therefore say to Members of the House that they should look at the title of this report.
Quite clearly Greece is not in compliance with this directive. There are clear violations, otherwise the infringement process would not have begun.
When we sign up to laws, we have to implement them properly.
Whether the case is before the Court or not, given that we are co-legislator it would be staggering if the European Parliament did not have an opinion on whether a Member State is compliant.
Finally, the resolution of this problem quite clearly lies with the Greek authorities.
They can resolve it swiftly or they can leave it to the European Court of Justice.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wanted to ask if we will have a second chance to speak, as you gave the floor to Mr Cashman.
If that is the case, we too have something to say.
We want to ask the Commissioner why he is taking such a negative attitude.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not think my attitude was negative: it was objective, based on the facts made available to us and on the complaints we have received from Greek citizens who have their residence in a country other than Greece.
It related to the lack of proportionality expressed by the confiscation of cars and the high fines.
These were the basic points of the infringement procedures, which we had to launch because this is a violation of Community law, and the Commission is Guardian of the Treaties.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Csaba Ãry, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents (artificial optical radiation) (19th individual directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (PE-CONS 3668/2005 C6-0001/2006 1992/0449B(COD))(A6-0026/2006).
Â Â  . â Please allow me to briefly summarise the main stages of this complicated legislative procedure, as a result of which we can now debate the third reading of the Directive on Optical Radiation.
The procedure started with Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, which provided a comprehensive regulation for the entire issue of health and safety at work, and created the legal framework for a single approach to all possible risks that may arise at the workplace.
Section 16 of the Framework Directive stipulates that individual directives must be created to address risks of various types.
These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations.
The adaptation of the content of general obligations to individual risk types is very much in the interest of employees and employers, because this is how the law of the European Union can be implemented in practice, and it can create competition neutrality and guarantee greater safety.
If the content of the obligations is not unequivocal, employers will have difficulty proving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal disputes of unpredictable outcomes.
It is also in the employees' interest that the protection in the area of health and safety at work, which is the inalienable right of each European citizen, as stipulated in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, should be implemented through efficient articles of law that are easy to apply in practice.
The preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half.
The Directive on Optical Radiation is meant to cover the fourth extremely important area after noise, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiation.
As originally envisaged by the European Commission and Council, this fourth directive would have addressed the treatment of optical radiation originating from both natural and artificial sources. However, there are some significant differences between these two areas, in terms of intervention and risk level reduction.
Therefore, during the debate of the second reading of the Directive, the European Parliament passed on to Member States the entire regulatory competence regarding solar radiation risks.
However, it was subsequently found that this decision violated certain European Union competences, as it would have prevented the application of the stipulation contained in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which stated that the minimum level of requirements applicable in the area of health and safety at work should be set within EU frameworks, for each risk type.
This was why the Council and the Commission were unable to accept the decision of Parliament taken at second reading, and a reconciliation procedure followed.
In the course of the reconciliation procedure, the Council accepted the majority of the amendments made by Parliament, and only suggested two substantive and two formal alterations.
The most important substantive amendment suggested that the scope of the Directive should not include optical radiation from natural sources, as the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down.
However, legislators are not disputing any of the issues concerning artificial radiation, and it would be expedient to introduce the individual directive providing precise regulation in this area right now, this year.
The Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament.
Consequently, it was the wording proposed by the Parliamentary Delegation that was included in Section 8 concerning medical surveillance, and in the relevant preamble paragraph.
We can say that the reconciliation procedure was rapid and successful beyond our expectations, and a final agreement was reached as early as December 2005.
Consequently, this is what I would like to ask my colleagues and Parliament to support during the voting.
Â Â  . âMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the Council and Parliament, on the Commissionâs behalf, for their endeavours in this area.
I also wish to express my appreciation for their rapid conclusion of an agreement on an issue as difficult as optical radiation.
This is the fourth and final part of the proposed Directive on the exposure of workers to risks arising from physical factors.
The adoption of this new Directive, the provisions of which are based on the latest scientific reports, will make it possible to guarantee greater safety and health protection for all workers exposed in the workplace to artificial optical radiation.
The Commission is pleased that this directive complies entirely with the in the area of protecting the health and safety of workers whilst ensuring the flexibility and proportionality required for businesses to be competitive.
The directive on which we have agreed forms part of moves to improve legislation which, on the one hand, ensures that businesses are not disproportionately or unnecessarily overloaded and, on the other hand, complies with Article 137 of the Treaty, on protecting workersâ health and safety.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, come what may, the text is well balanced, meets the requirements for health and safety work and maintains the required balance in relation to business competitiveness.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, who would not be in favour of protecting people against dangerous artificial optical rays, such as lasers, at their place of work?
Yet we Christian Democrats were opposed to regulations on such natural optical rays as sunlight.
Would building workers be allowed to work in the open air only with protective headgear and long shirts?
Would the lifeguards in swimming pools be virtually wholly wrapped up?
Would waitresses in beer gardens have to cover up their ?
Was all this really to be imposed uniformly right across Europe?
We supported German building workers when they demonstrated in front of the Parliament building here in Strasbourg â an event that got a very strong helping hand from the European People Partyâs SME group â my groupâs tradesmen â and from the British members of our Groupâs European Democrat wing, including the energetic Mr Bushill-Matthews.
By means of amendments, first in the lead committee â the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs â and then in the plenary, we got a majority in favour of doing away with the mandatory health checks and with expensive action programmes against sunburn, which would have laid still more administrative burdens on the backs of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We voted for solutions founded upon the solidarity principle, with the Member States themselves deciding on what measures they regarded as reasonable, adapted to the most diverse weather conditions and, of course, also to different skin sensitivities, all of which vary from one country to another.
I might add that, in the Conciliation Committee, of which I was a member, it did not take us long to reach a workable compromise with the Commission and the Council.
We withdrew our demand for the application of the subsidiarity principle in return for the deletion of the references to natural optical radiation, which were not replaced by anything else.
The title of the draft directive now refers to âartificial optical radiationâ.
I wish to thank, once again, our rapporteur, Mr Ãry, for the work he has done.
Together, we have highlighted the need for decisions at European level to be workable in everyday life.
The European Union should spend less time on peripheral issues and a great deal more on the problems that really matter, such as the fight against unemployment and campaigns for sustainable protection for the environment and for effective cooperation in internal and external security.
I very much hope that this good outcome from the conciliation committee will be reflected by a clear majority when we vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to join those who have already congratulated the rapporteur.
I think he has done an excellent job of work.
This directive will benefit workers exposed to risks from artificial sources of optical radiation in a wide range of working environments: everything from electric arc welders to workers using advanced industrial lasers.
When I was rapporteur at first reading on this proposal well over ten years ago, the use of industrial lasers was pretty much in its infancy, but now they are very widespread and exposing workers to varying degrees of risk.
It is a useful piece of legislation and again I would like to say âwell doneâ to the rapporteur.
I have to say, however, that he produced good work despite, rather than because of, the help of his own group.
At one time this institution took its work on health and safety subjects very seriously, but a rather worrying trend has developed in relation to recent directives.
When we dealt, for example, with the directive on vibration, we were told that we must exclude whole-body vibration because â and this was used in the tabloid press â what we were trying to do was to prevent farmers from driving their tractors for more than three or four hours even at the height of the harvest, which was nonsense.
When we dealt with the noise directive we were told that we must exclude music and entertainment because what we were trying to do was to force members of orchestras to wear Mickey Mouse ear protectors and that we were about to ban the use of the bagpipes in Scotland.
Again nonsense, but it grabbed the tabloid headlines.
In this proposal we have had a determined push by a number of Members in the rapporteurâs group and elsewhere to exclude a particular phenomenon from the scope of the directive. They pushed for that without realising that the risks arising from this phenomenon are clearly covered in the placing of clear obligations on employers by two earlier directives: the framework directive and the directive on temporary and mobile work sites.
The phenomenon I am talking about is, of course, natural radiation.
The rapporteur made a valiant effort and we tried to help him to give legal certainty to employers when it comes to solar radiation.
They are now lacking that legal certainty and still have the full implications of the framework directive and temporary mobile work sites directive to deal with.
Hopefully, common sense will prevail at Member State level, as it has so far.
That would mean, for example, that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England, but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months.
That is the difficulty now facing employers.
We have not given them legal certainty.
We will have a number of more difficult cases to assess for employers between those two extremes that I have given as an example.
I hope that in future we can again focus on producing good, serious health and safety legislation and not on producing tabloid headlines.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation.
We now have a sensible directive to protect workers such as welders from artificial radiation.
I am delighted that, at long last, everyone has seen sense and removed natural radiation from the remit of this directive.
It has been a long, hard battle.
I congratulate Mrs Weisgerber.
She and I worked very hard after the Commission proposed to legislate against sun in the second reading.
Not only would it have brought the EU into disrepute again, it would also have been a nightmare for employers and workers alike.
Legally, it would have been very difficult to prove whether a worker had contracted skin cancer from the workplace, the back garden or the beach.
Certainly, everyone ought to be warned about the dangers of the sun and that is why I am very much in favour of national campaigns.
But once people have been given the information, we are adults and should be able to make up our own minds.
It should not be left to the employer to enforce it.
That is the nanny state mentality gone too far.
Imagine the language from some builders, for instance, if they were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan for their holidays!
It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they cannot go bare-chested or wear shorts.
Today's proceedings, and I hope the vote tomorrow, are a victory for common sense.
They also demonstrate the power of the European Parliament.
If we had not voted the way we did at second reading, the Commission would not have changed its mind and probably, more importantly, neither would the Council.
This is a good day for sensible legislation.
As a pro-European, I think it very sad that we have had to waste time blocking ludicrous proposals like this.
Sunlight should never have been included in the directive.
It is a very good directive and I hope everyone will vote for it tomorrow, but just for artificial radiation and not for the inclusion of natural radiation.
Â Â  . Mr President, after all the discussion of the technical details associated with this directive, I would like to make a general comment.
In principle, any initiative that reduces health risks and thereby affords people better protection deserves support, and, as people spend a considerable part of their lives at work, it is logical that the various dangers there should be precisely analysed and all of them, along with all hazards to health at work, reduced to the minimum possible.
I see it as an extremely good thing that the attempt should be made to lay down, across the EU, uniform minimum standards of health and safety protection.
What I found really scandalous about the debate on this directive was the attempt that was made to prevent anything that might cost money.
There is also something dubious about this compromiseâs statement in one of its recitals that, and I quote, âThis directive must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.â
I do not understand why health protection is not supposed to cost anything if the same rules apply to all, so that there is no unfair competition.
By all means let services and products involving a greater health risk cost slightly more.
Why should they not?
Why should people in general cough up for the costs that business imposes on public health services simply because of the negligent attitude taken towards certain risks?
Real competition exists only when rules apply equally and if the real costs are reflected as a matter of principle.
Anything else is a short-term subsidy for individual businesses or sectors at the expense of the general public and to the detriment of workers who do dangerous jobs.
What I want to see is more economic probity.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is all about sunlight emissions, but I feel we would be better off listening to Beethovenâs Moonlight Sonata.
I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament.
The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera.
Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable.
Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation.
What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.
The rapporteur, Mr Åry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise.
Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive.
It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections.
Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.
The Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation.
The situation that confronts us today in this area is far from what I would consider a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy.
I fear that in the future legal disputes will be unavoidable.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissionâs proposal for a directive to protect workers against optical radiation was, as regards what it had to say about protection from sunlight, a masterpiece of European over-regulation.
At second reading, and by an absolute majority, we in this House nailed our colours to the mast by voting to remove the provisions on protection from natural radiation.
In the conciliation process, too, we showed that we MEPs are able to get our own way, rather than being powerless and at the mercy of the Commissionâs mania for lawmaking.
We are empowered to draft the sort of directives that will be of benefit to the public.
Verheugen and others are always talking about the better lawmaking that will bring about more growth and jobs in the EU, but it is regulations like these that need to be improved first.
It is a matter of considerable surprise that we have now been able, in the conciliation procedure, to persuade the Commission and Council of this.
The parts of this directive that make sense â the ones dealing with the protection of workers from artificial optical radiation, such as lasers, infra-red light and the like â remain unchanged.
As regards the regulations on natural radiation, it has to be said that the Commission missed the mark by a long way, for the original proposal for a directive required employers to commission comprehensive assessments of the risks associated with sunlight and bureaucratic action plans to deal with them, which would have involved employers having to provide t-shirts and suncream for workers working outdoors.
It would also have entailed liabilities of which employers would have been unaware, and, in any case, any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun.
It is all about personal responsibility and is pretty much the last thing that Europe should be laying down the law about.
Europe has quite different problems to deal with, in the shape of unemployment, exhausted social security systems and more and more aged people among the population.
Those are the things we need to worry about, not protection from sunlight.
Even the Commission and the Council have come to their senses and recognised this in the course of the conciliation procedure, and I am very glad that they have.
It has made possible a considerable improvement in the directive and prevented over-regulation that would have resulted in needless additional expense, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I urge you to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the Conciliation Committeeâs proposal, and then we will flag up our desire for less bureaucracy and less red tape throughout Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this, today, really is the last time we will be discussing this directive, which has prompted so much public debate in my own country.
Rarely, if ever before, have I known such distortion of what a directive is all about, and so I would like to go over once again why we Social Democrats eventually, in the course of the conciliation process, decided that we would rather leave natural radiation out of the directive altogether.
We came to that decision simply and solely because we want the minimum standards that we lay down for health protection in the workplace to be applied equally and across the board in all the Member States.
Where social policy is concerned, we do not want an Europe, which is what the outcome of the second reading would have given us, a Europe in which each and every Member State could decide for itself whether or not to oblige employers to inform their workers about the potential hazards of natural radiation.
Even though the references to natural radiation have been removed from the directive, the framework directive is still in place and still obliging employers to protect workers from the hazards of sunlight.
That has been confirmed to us not only by this Houseâs own legal services, but also by those of the Commission and the Council.
The only thing we wanted was to give this obligation more concrete form, and, painful though it is, the conservatives and liberals in this House must now face up to the fact that it was they who made this impossible.
The consequence of that is that employers are still uncertain of where they stand, legally speaking, as regards whether they need to take steps to protect workers from hazardous natural radiation, and, if so, what action they need to take.
The bottom line is that the majority in this House has relinquished to the European Court of Justice the right to shape policy, and that really is very much to be regretted.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a piece of very good work.
I believe we now have a reasonable decision from conciliation.
It is a sensible and workable decision, through which we have limited the scope of this directive.
However, we will still ensure that workers exposed to optical radiation will be fully protected and that their health and safety will be looked after.
As far as natural radiation is concerned, risks must be pointed out and reasonable precautions must be taken, but Member States should have the responsibility for drawing up the action plan, and that should give legal certainty to workers and employers in different countries.
However powerful we may consider ourselves to be in this Parliament, we cannot legislate for sunshine or rain across 25 Member States.
In Ireland, partly because of our own inaction and through our own fault, we currently have a nitrates directive based on rainfall, weather and climate, which is totally unworkable, but that is another story.
In this situation and with this directive, we have struck a balance.
We have avoided over-regulation and excessive bureaucracy and come forward with a piece of legislation that is reasonable and workable and which protects workers.
Â Â  Mr President, the question as to what is reasonable is often a rhetorical one.
While it is certainly to be welcomed that a compromise has been reached in this matter, it is, alas, only a partial solution to the problem.
It is certainly to be welcomed that a regulation at least covers artificial optical radiation, but one can no doubt categorise the removal from it of natural radiation as one of this Houseâs less inspired ideas.
Where the protection of the eyes and skin is concerned, artificial optical radiation is just as much a problem as the natural variety, in that there is a causal connection in both cases.
It follows that legal certainty is needed both as regards artificial optical radiation and that from a natural source.
We will learn from the way environmental policy develops that the courts and the ECJ will be giving more and more attention to this problem, and then we will again have to take action.
The protection of workers has, for some considerable time, been founded upon information and prevention; that is more humane and less costly.
The process that has brought this change of thinking has been a long and laborious one, beginning with sympathy for the workers, followed by the realisation that employers had a duty of care, and that suffering and illness can be alleviated through treatment.
It was only then that people realised the value of information about illnesses and work-related accidents and of the prevention of these.
That brings me back to the question of what is reasonable, and, for an answer to that, I would like to turn to my friend Mr Thomas Mann.
What do you think, Thomas?
Â Â  Mr President, with the vote tomorrow on this directive on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to optical radiation, the EU legislation stipulating minimum health and safety requirements for workers exposed to physical agents will come to a much-awaited and much-needed fulfilment.
It is true that this particular proposal proved rather difficult to bring to a finalisation agreement, but thanks to the perseverance and the common-sense approach exhibited by all involved in the conciliation process, all the hurdles were overcome.
Many congratulations are thus due to our Parliamentâs delegation, including the rapporteur, Mr Åry, for the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure.
Optical radiation arising from artificial sources may, under certain circumstances, cause exposed workers serious eye trauma â including blindness â or severe skin damage, including cancer initiation.
This legislation, if properly implemented, will undoubtedly help reduce the chance of such occurrences and will protect many workers from the perils of yet another work-related risk.
However, we must not forget that the biggest source of optical radiation is not artificial radiation but the sun, and for most workers skin cancer occurs as a result of exposure to the sun.
Therefore, at some stage in the future, we have to face this problem and deal with it successfully.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with interest to your debate and I am happy to note the broad support for the proposal that emerged from the conciliation process.
I should like to thank all those who took part in that process, because it was not a smooth ride and in a number of cases it proved very difficult to reach a decent compromise.
In any event, many arguments have been taken into account, and this Directive does represent progress.
I believe that none of the ideas expressed in this debate can easily be rebuffed with a simple argument.
I also feel that there is room for further reflection on the development of health and safety protection at work.
In conclusion, I consider that the process represented a step in the right direction and I assume, on the basis of this debate, that the Directive will gain resounding support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Vittorio Agnoletto on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements (2005/2057(INI)) (A6-0004/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights and democracy clause has a long history within Parliament and is based on the assumption that civil and political rights and, in a broader sense, economic, social and cultural rights as well need to be at the heart of European Union policy.
The clause began in the early 1990s with the LomÃ© Agreement and in 1990 itself was also applied to Argentina.
Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation.
Parliamentâs requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response.
The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries.
In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause.
The first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament.
It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement. That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role.
That is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.
Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives.
In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country.
Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas.
Another point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited.
I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion.
It is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries.
Human rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas.
To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commissionâs external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis.
A structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights.
We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights.
It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society.
Then there is a further extremely important aspect.
This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause.
We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases.
Lastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today.
Human rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved.
All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.
I shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full.
After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries.
A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as âGSP+â, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.
The impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence.
Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners.
Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.
The Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous dÃ©marches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world.
The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries.
The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.
I would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard.
EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy.
More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.
Assessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner.
The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights.
The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues.
Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.
As far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states.
I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EUâs human rights policy could be damaged.
For its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement.
Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities.
This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.
As regards Parliamentâs involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union.
Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues.
Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically.
I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.
I also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.
In conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.
Over the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour.
That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament.
We are in a listening mood, but we would also like to contribute to improving human rights in the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the inclusion of a human rights clause in our international agreements is one of the European Unionâs distinguishing features.
Its content has been evolving over time and in accordance with the nature of successive agreements: currently more than 50 with more than 120 countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out.
Unfortunately, this has not prevented us from occasionally having to suspend our agreements because of human rights violations.
With regard to the report that we are debating today, the Committee on Development wishes to stress the following points:
Firstly, we would state that human rights are universal and indivisible and that human rights, democracy and development are highly interdependent.
Secondly, we wish to stress that the fight against poverty is our priority and that we will not be successful without a global approach to processes of democratisation and development.
Thirdly, we would insist on a twin approach in terms of conditionality: positive discrimination for countries that achieve greater progress and negative discrimination in cases of serious and persistent violations.
Fourthly, we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement, given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause laid down in Article 96, thereby making it the only agreement that has led to sanctions and that has functioned relatively well.
Fifthly, we would insist that transparency is one of our governing principles.
Sixthly, we support all measures aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, we welcome the G8âs decision to cancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries on this planet.
Seventhly, we would appeal for greater commitment from the countries with which we cooperate in the achievement of those Objectives.
Eighthly, we regret certain Commission decisions with which we do not agree, such as the lifting of sanctions on Sudan, given the serious events in Darfur.
Â Â  . Mr President, my committee welcomes Mr Agnolettoâs report which, with very few reservations, we fully support.
In fact, we adopted our opinion, which echoes what Mr Agnoletto was saying, by 20 votes to 1.
As the Commissioner said, 14 years on from the start of these human rights agreements being included, it is time for a fresh look.
Since 1995 the human rights clause has been invoked on 12 occasions.
We have invoked it against Niger, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Togo, Haiti â from which I have just returned from an election-observation mission, Comoros, the Ivory Coast, Fiji, Liberia and Zimbabwe.
The human rights clause has also prevented the conclusion of agreements with Australia and New Zealand and with Belarus, following the increasingly authoritarian rule of Mr Lukashenko.
We welcome the inclusion of the clause and would like it extended to sectoral trade agreements as well.
We believe there should be specific benchmarks and possibly a more nuanced set of benchmarks for responding to human rights violations.
We ask that the Commission establish a monitoring mechanism that links the implementation and temporary suspension of trade agreements and autonomous trade measures to beneficiary countriesâ compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for human and minority rights, as set out in the European Parliamentâs annual report on human rights in the world.
I take the Commissionerâs point that, if our involvement is included in terms of the adoption of the clause in trade and other agreements, it is not formally included in terms of the implementation of the clause.
However, we ask the Commission, by its own initiative, to involve the European Parliament more systematically in the assessment of the implementation of the human rights clauses and similar requirements in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Agnoletto, on the excellent work he has presented.
It is important, I think, that Mr Agnoletto refers in his report to the new role which needs to be given to the European Parliament, not only with respect to negotiating agreements with third countries, but also with respect to application and control.
This would change significantly the institutional framework within which these agreements are concluded.
Mr Agnoletto is right to recommend the extension of the human rights clause to all sectors and to all countries and the precedent which he uses to support this opinion is interesting.
Mr Agnoletto is right to call for better control and a better monitoring procedure to establish if the parties are adhering to what they have signed, because often, as you all know, signature is easy, but adherence is hard.
Mr Agnoletto is right to mention the need for a mechanism on the application of agreements, among other things. He is right to insist that the human rights dimension should be highly visible in this mechanism.
Finally, he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come, at long last, for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that, on other occasions, we criticise through the European process.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, as you know, tabled an amendment which, as far as I understand, Mr Agnoletto accepts and, consequently, it supports his report.
Â Â  . Mr President, respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inspires the internal and external policies of the parties and constitutes an essential element of the European Unionâs international agreements.
The cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause to which I have just referred has many limitations and lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly.
The result is that the clause is often used as an alibi or rhetorical example, without having any real consequences.
The report we are debating today is intended to put an end to this situation, increasing the effectiveness of the clause from a legal point of view.
To this end, we Socialists have made several proposals that have been taken up in this report, something about which we are very pleased.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Agnoletto and thank him for his work and understanding.
We do not want to be under any illusions, though.
This initiative report will once again come face to face with reality when we come to applying the clause.
The European Union must promote the introduction of the clause in line with the recommendations of this report, and that is what we are calling for today in this House.
We shall continue to need great political will on the part of the Union so that respect for human rights genuinely provides added value in international agreements and in the promotion of dignity and so that the introduction of the clause is not a dead letter and so that it is not used in a hypocritical fashion and only applied when it suits our interests.
For this, we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights; an effective, credible and coherent commitment.
We can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time.
Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause, because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements, and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries, in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals, for example, and react accordingly.
Europe must maintain a credible position.
Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip.
We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests.
Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion.
We must call for an end to the death penalty in India, China, Japan and the United States.
We must demand an end to torture wherever it takes place, whether in GuantÃ¡namo, in Iraq or in Syria.
In a world obsessed by short-term benefits and security, we cannot lower our guard when it comes to defending our universal rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, in May 1995 the Council decided that, to promote fundamental rights and the EUâs democratic ideals, a clause insisting upon human rights observation should be included as an essential element of all bilateral agreements.
In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EUâs agreements.
However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.
By way of illustration, I make reference to the fact that, despite what we demand on paper, the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests.
Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself, the EU-Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage.
However, when probed about the EU-Israel Association Agreement, despite Israelâs catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice, as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination, what is the EUâs response?
I have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House.
Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms, such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue.
If the Council and the Commission cannot spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently, effectively and transparently, then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements?
The vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions, nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations.
A revised text must provide a concrete, step-by-step implemented mechanism, from dialogue to warning signals, and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension, to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators.
Moreover, the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad.
If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe, it is that when it comes to human rights, the EU has failed to keep its own house in order.
The significance of this latest twist in the war on terror cannot be exaggerated, effectively shattering EU complacency about its own human rights record, with enquiries launched by the Council of Europe and this House with warnings that the sanctioning mechanism of ArticleÂ 7 may be used.
It is time for the EU to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review and to connect and balance the external and internal dimensions of its policy on human rights.
Whilst the EU has struggled to consistently and systematically promote a coherent view of human rights, this Parliament has been praised by NGOs for the positive impact of the revival of the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
Under the chairmanship of Mrs Flautre the subcommittee has gone from strength to strength and, coupled with the appointment of Mr Michael Matheson, we have made inroads into the implementation of human rights guidelines.
I finish by saying that as human rights feature more prominently in a range of foreign and security policy domains, and as cross-cutting issues demand more consistent participation, our knowledge and proficiency must be drawn on as joint decision-maker when it comes to initiating consultations and suspending agreements on the basis of human rights.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the clause we are debating today constitutes the basis for and legitimises the European Union's actions towards third countries with regard to respect for human rights.
MrÂ Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament.
This clause does suffer from some deficiencies.
First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another.
I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact.
It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them.
Secondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods.
In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods.
We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights.
At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration.
The mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated.
We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries.
That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important.
With regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause.
When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate.
The second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue.
The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened.
I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours.
If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights.
With regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions.
We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make.
Finally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies.
That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.
Â Â  () Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an outstanding piece of work.
In my view it is well-balanced and objective, and above all it gives us an excellent summary not only of what has been achieved in the area of human rights, but also of the important aspects that we must focus on in the future.
I should like to mention the following key areas.
Firstly, I endorse the view that human rights should not be understood only as civil and political rights, but that it is absolutely necessary to focus on economic, social and cultural rights as well, and not only within the context of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals.
Secondly, we should draw on the positive experiences that have emerged so far from the Cotonou Agreement, and ensure that clauses on upholding human rights and democratic principles are included in all sectoral agreements or all agreements with developed states, in order to achieve a level playing field for all parties to the Agreement.
Thirdly, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on implementing so-called positive measures to motivate states, and to use negative measures only where absolutely necessary, where other options have been exhausted.
When weighing up such options it is clearly necessary to consider the impact of the measures on ordinary citizens.
In my view, one of the key factors from the standpoint of ensuring transparency is for the European Parliament and civil society to play a greater role in the implementation of clauses relating to human rights and democratic principles.
The work of the Commission and Council has so far had little transparency, and has often been misleading, giving rise to concerns that political, strategic and commercial interests are over-ruling the consistent implementation of clearly defined standards.
It is absolutely necessary, if we are to increase transparency and democratisation in decision-making processes, for the European Commission to inform Parliament and interested parties in the public sphere regularly, ideally on an annual basis, about the implementation of clauses dealing with the upholding of human rights and democratic principles, including studies of individual cases and of the approach taken by the Council over a given period, the success of given measures and suggested approaches for the future, in case a situation does not improve.
An objective methodology and a clear procedure for implementing the aforementioned clause will of course be essential.
Â Â  . Mr President, this clause was drafted ten years ago and applied in certain agreements.
This report wants new criteria which must apply between EU Member States and third countries.
Suspension of agreements with those countries would follow if the clause was contravened.
This report criticises the fact that the clause does not exist in three big areas, namely agriculture, fisheries and textiles.
Of course democracy and human rights should be encouraged in all the states of the world which are unfortunate enough not to enjoy them already.
All decent democratic states should use their relations with other countries â diplomatic and trading, cultural, etc. â to encourage the growth of democracy and human rights, something that my country, Britain, has done for many years.
However, this report says that the clause must apply in all countries equally.
Has this been properly thought out?
If so, it will apply to China and other developing economies in the Far East and other parts of the world.
Many jobs depend on trading relations with China and the number will increase in the future.
Are we really saying that we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight, just on the basis of one report from the European Parliament?
I think not.
Today the United Nations has called for GuantanÃ¡mo Bay to be closed and there are many human rights questions hanging over what the Americans are doing in GuantanÃ¡mo Bay.
If this agreement is to apply equally to all countries, are we going to suspend relations with the US if we think that it is contravening human rights in GuantanÃ¡mo Bay?
I was also struck by the arrogance of the Commissioner in demanding that other countries, such as China and Japan, abolish the death penalty if they want to have relations with the EU.
I think that is an unbelievable intrusion into the democratic and sovereign right of other countries to have a penal system that suits them and their citizens rather than the European Union.
The European Union itself is undermining democracy in all its Member States.
I know at first hand how democracy in Britain has been undermined by our relationship with the European Union and our increasing political integration into a United States of Europe.
So I think perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned.
Perhaps it could make a start by paying attention to the results in the Dutch and French referendums on the Constitution.
I suggest that this report is not properly thought out.
Yes, we want democracy and human rights in all the countries of the world.
But let us try to do it by setting an example in friendship, rather than setting criteria and conditions that will not be met.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if our successors attempt to assess the principal values and advantages of the European Union in a hundred yearsâ time, they will note that one of the main reasons why the Union came into being was to defend and promote human rights the world over.
We should be flying the flag for human rights at all times and not lowering it in unfavourable circumstances, as unfortunately sometimes happens.
I am concerned about our notorious double standards.
We are quite prepared to demand that human rights be respected and to condemn certain countries that fail to do so.
However, when it comes to the largest countries or countries that are particularly important in economic terms for businesses in the Member States of the Union, we are just as prepared to remain silent on the subject of human rights or we speak about them in whispers.
The curse of these double standards is a stain on the Unionâs honour.
It is a stain on our fine blue flag with its gold stars.
Human rights must also be understood in an economic context.
That is why we support the granting of debt relief to developing countries, as MrÂ Martin mentioned.
However, we are also in favour of monitoring the implementation of Union aid to ensure it is not used to prop up dictatorships in Africa and Asia.
I believe it is worth emphasising the need to include clauses on human rights and democracy in the sectoral agreements we enter into concerning agriculture, fisheries and textiles for example.
In conclusion, we must always bear in mind that where human rights are concerned, it is never possible to say that everything that should be done has been done.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this own-initiative report by Mr Agnoletto on the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements.
I believe this is an ambitious and serious initiative by the rapporteur.
He has produced a report that the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has described as one of the most important reports for some time.
Human rights clauses have been included in EU international or trade agreements for more than 50 years.
As the Commissioner has said, they involve over 120 different countries.
This report assesses the effectiveness of such human rights clauses as regards implementation and adherence and proposes new ways to strengthen the clause to make it more effective and better monitored.
Human rights clauses have had some success in the past.
If the truth be told, however, in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on.
Therefore a trade and cooperation relationship develops as a result of an agreement, yet basic and clear breaches of human rights continue; human rights clauses are ignored or not taken seriously, but there are no consequences.
This is a regrettable situation; not only is it a missed opportunity for the EU to use its considerable influence better in order to raise human rights standards, it also undermines the credibility of the EU in a key policy area.
This report goes into a lot of detail about what a new human rights clause could or should look like, how it could be monitored and enforced to make it more effective and what the consequences of breaching the clause might be in different cases.
In essence, however, the report aims to do two things.
Firstly, to ensure that a new and improved human rights and democracy clause, based on a respect for international law and accepted EU conventions, is included in all new international agreements entered into by the EU.
Secondly, a mechanism must be put in place that better monitors adherence to the human rights clause, so that breaches of the clause have a range of real consequences for the overall agreement.
This would ensure that human rights are given the kind of political priority the Commissioner has spoken of today.
Â Â  Mr President, once again over the past year the EU has been accused of failing in its commitment to human rights by refusing to effectively use human rights clauses in trade and cooperation agreements.
An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre, but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past.
Despite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East, human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt, Israel or Tunisia, in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding.
With the ACP countries, I acknowledge that so-called ArticleÂ 96 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years, in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures.
However, the EU maintains close relations with Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations.
In Eritrea there has been little response to the dÃ©marche so far: forced military conscription, arbitrary detention, harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue.
How do we ensure the success of consultations on the human rights clauses?
It needs commitment on the side of the third country.
Too much today this seems dependent on how far there is dependence on EU funding.
It needs coordination between donors, for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003.
It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them, as in the case of Guinea-Bissau, when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue, something that can be blocked and â as was seen today â was sadly lacking in the case of Iran.
We agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States.
I do not think she is arrogant; I think she is noble when she upholds the EUâs unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty.
