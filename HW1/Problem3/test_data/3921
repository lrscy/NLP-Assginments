The Laeken European Council will, no doubt, or, at least, that seems the most likely road, appoint a president, assisted by a bureau made up of at least one member of each component of the convention and assisted by a secretariat.
The convention's brief would not be to adopt a final text but, at this stage - I think that answers Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's question as to whether these are proposals or whether these are options - simply to decide whether we are in favour of options rather than proposals, leaving it, of course, to the bodies concerned to choose from among these options, since options are never more than variations on proposals.
I am not embracing any one point of view: I am simply describing things as they are.
If it was just up to me, believe me we would go much further than proposals.
We would be more radical.
However, I simply have to adjust to toeing the presidency's line...
So I am telling you what I believe I have to tell you for the sake of transparency.
I can do no more.
The convention should become operational as soon as possible, during the Spanish Presidency, that is, during the first half of 2002.
Let me also touch on two questions relating to this convention: it is important that you remember them but also that you can discuss them and make your views on the subject known.
First of all, it is important to gain the support of the candidate countries.
We saw a fairly strong convergence of views in Genval on the need to involve the candidate countries in the convention.
Although, in effect, we are moving towards giving them a status and right of say there, obviously we still have to define the precise procedures for their representation.
Here, the presidency is putting forward three possible formulas: representation modelled from the outset on that of the Member States, namely one representative of each government and two members of each national parliament - that is conceivable; or one representative per country for the duration of the convention's activities; or, the third formula, progressive representation, consisting of a single representative until the accession treaty has been signed, then representation in line with that of the Member States after the signature.
Representatives of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions could also be invited as observers.
Those are the ideas now on the table.
The next question is how to involve civil society.
On the whole, the idea of a civil forum was well received by the delegations.
Nevertheless, some questions came up about the composition of this forum, that is, the selection of representatives of civil society - its organisational procedures and the nature of its links with the convention, which could, for example, take the form of hearings or a variety of other formulas.
In the presidency's view, this forum could take either of two forms.
Either it could be like an enlarged assembly, in which case one would need to define its exact composition, role and modus operandi; or it could be a structured network, made up of organisations representing civil society, established at European level.
The organisations making up that network would be kept officially informed of the activities of the convention and their written contributions would form part of the official documentation forwarded to members of the convention. They would be heard by the convention, in accordance with procedures to be defined, and, where appropriate, they could also be consulted by the convention on specific issues.
If that option were adopted, it would probably be advisable to appoint a coordinator at political level, who could be chosen either by the Laeken European Council or by the convention itself.
That is the additional information I wanted to give you on the convention and you are, of course, welcome to come back to us with any ideas this might suggest to you or inspire in you, since that is the purpose of this kind of exchange of views.
I am entirely open to any comments, ideas or suggestions on the subject.
Several Members raised the issue of security in Brussels, so I will address their concern.
I do not think there are any difficulties in principle, except for one aspect where we do come up against certain problems - I will endeavour to analyse this matter and take a closer look - namely the question of unconditional access to Belgian territory. I do believe this could pose a number of problems.
That aside, it looks as though we can certainly reach an agreement fairly soon.
I promise I will discuss it with the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers immediately after my return so that I can give you practical answers to your questions as quickly as possible.
Let me highlight something that has emerged from our debates and to which I too am paying close attention.
If we take a whole range of measures to combat terrorism effectively, they will necessarily - and we must not pretend otherwise - involve the risk of taking measures that curtail freedoms.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said so and Mr Lannoye also drew our attention to it.
I have heard statements in this Chamber that show that some people have not entirely understood this: for instance, if I had to translate Mr Berthu's programme into action, it is clear that this would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms, which would have nothing to do, let me say, with the quality of life, with the democratic quality of our societies.
That is the way it is, that is my opinion and I am sharing it with you.
I think we must be very watchful here, for this really is an important issue.
We cannot bring back the olden days on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
I think that would be very dangerous, so I am not in favour of it.
I believe the difficulty we will keep encountering will be, precisely, how to evaluate our margin for manoeuvre constantly.
But let us please not give in to a security phobia, because sooner or later we would all end up as victims and that would be democracy's loss.
Mr Lannoye and several others made a most important point in relation to our foreign policy and I entirely agree with him here: the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our friends.
Of course, I agree with him.
It is true that, under cover of this kind of consensual coalition, necessarily based on immediate needs and, admittedly, to some extent also on feelings that are justified, it might well be tempting to overlook, to look away from or to forget certain aspects.
I think it was yesterday, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that I was asked whether I had put any questions to my interlocutors about State terrorism.
I think we must not, indeed, lose sight of that aspect in considering our approach, our European commitment and our values.
It is true that we will have to be very vigilant here too; in other words, sometimes we must not forget that countries, organisations and bodies that form part of the coalition should also, to some extent, render account for some of their own practices, forms of behaviour and policies.
I therefore agree that we must avoid any kind of naive optimism in this respect and not forget to continue to fight for and campaign for a democratic society wherever possible in the world.
I therefore agree that we must strengthen the role of the International Criminal Court.
As time goes by, we come to realise that it is absolutely crucial to have that vital tool at our disposal.
I was asked whether I am in favour of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into a constitution.
You all know my views on this.
Unfortunately, I do not think everybody is quite ready for it yet.
Nevertheless, I believe that there are all sorts of arguments that can be put forward and that we must, therefore, pursue this debate.
We will get there in the end.
Another important aspect on which I was questioned was the danger of curtailing freedoms.
It is true that if we take a range of measures - Members have referred to the freezing of assets and various other measures - we must ensure that, however urgent, they are accompanied by a systematic evaluation process, preferably conducted soon after their adoption, whatever their nature.
I think that it will, of course, be necessary for urgent measures to be re-evaluated fairly early on and fairly regularly.
We must avoid a practice often seen in some countries - and I know this happens in Belgium - where temporary measures are still being applied 50 years later.
So I support those who call for guarantees.
In the event of urgent measures, we must indeed lay down a procedure of regular re-evaluation of those measures.
Apart from that, I basically agree with the ideas and concerns that have been expressed.
Mr Dupuis spoke of the effectiveness of the secret services.
I must admit that I know little about the secret services, since they are secret.
I suppose that, from that point of view, they certainly are effective.
I would simply appeal for more regular exchanges of information, deeper integration and closer coordination.
I think others will agree with me on this point.
I also replied to Mr Dupuis on the question of the risk of encouraging State terrorism or, at any rate, concealing certain facts about certain countries.
I also agree that we must not abandon our action; we must persevere and continue trying to persuade certain countries to move towards democracy.
We must not conceal that aspect or pretend the problem no longer exists in certain Arab countries.
We must nevertheless continue to bring it up.
I, personally, am convinced that we must strengthen political dialogue wherever we can, a political dialogue without taboos.
I think it is quite possible to impose that dialogue in our relations.
It is a minimum condition and, during my visit to Iran, for example, we agreed to set up a European Union-Iran group, which would have human rights questions as the only item on its agenda.
This was accepted.
We definitely need to take more initiatives of this kind.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I believe I have answered as fully as possible although I may well have omitted some aspects.
Let me say, however, that, in general, I broadly share the concerns you expressed.
I heard them clearly.
In any case, I undertake to pass them on to the quarters concerned.
I will do my utmost to transmit faithfully the information, ideas, criticisms and suggestions Parliament has offered me today.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 21 September initiated the forthcoming review of our fundamental concepts.
Since 9 November 1989 Europe has known that the cold war is over; but since 11 September 2001 the world has known that this cold war is over and it is now time to form global alliances against terrorism.
Today the right to speak will go to those who can demonstrate their full solidarity with the United States and commit themselves unreservedly to this fight against terrorism.
But that also means forbidding any sideslipping within our own ranks, for neither obscurantism nor fanaticism are permissible weapons in the fight against terrorism.
We will also have to inquire into the root causes.
The European Union knows that not all acts of terrorism are the consequence of poverty, but frustration and humiliation do feed terrorism.
We must, therefore, review our development policy again.
We must cancel the developing countries' debt.
We must resume our work on light arms trafficking.
We must urge everybody to play their part in the multilateral structures.
Within our institutions, we must give ourselves the means to prevent all forms of conflict, for they are also a source of tension.
I do not believe this is the moment to drop one of Parliament's initiatives, namely the prevention centre, which we are now told may be under threat.
The European Council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead.
To mention only a few issues, let us turn first to the question of the financing of terrorism.
Yes, the Union put itself in a position where it could fight the Talibans' money and freeze their assets, thanks to the regulation of 4 July 2001.
Some European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, have already frozen these assets.
Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative.
Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us on what basis the Commission envisages the revision of that annex.
It is an important question because this is the first time Parliament has been consulted on measures of this kind.
Then there is the fight against money laundering, the fight against tax havens; we will have to give new impetus to all these tasks on which the European Union has embarked.
These upheavals have come at a moment when the European Union is entering the final stage of its transition to the euro, when it is engaged in vital projects: enlargement, but also the definition of a genuine common foreign and security policy, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.
These projects will be given a strong boost, circumstances will sweep away any hesitation, force us to be resolute.
But if we are to be able to seize this opportunity for Europe, Ghent will have to live up to our high expectations. I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options.
On the other hand, Parliament will certainly support the Council when it comes to broadening the agenda of that convention, to asking useful questions, for instance whether we need to maintain the pillar structure.
What kind of presidency will the Union have?
Mr President, it is only natural that the issue of the fight against terrorism should be given a certain amount of attention in Ghent.
The European Union has acted with impressive unity and decisiveness.
We can look forward to a long-term battle on several fronts, including the political and the legal fronts, with a sensitive balance regarding respect for legal rights.
In terms of the long view politically and economically, we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN.
It is gratifying that the US has realised the importance of the UN and is paying its debts to that organisation.
Perhaps the EU can also get the US to ratify the protocol on the International Criminal Court.
Of course, we must also work in the long term to achieve peace and democracy throughout the Middle East.
In Ghent, enlargement will also be discussed.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes it is vital that each country be assessed on its own merits and that the principle of differentiation be genuinely upheld.
That is a message I should like to send to the presidency.
Finally, when it comes to the Convention, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the concrete explanations.
However, there is still a certain amount of concern in this area.
The Convention is not a debating club for talking in rather general terms about various alternatives regarding the future of Europe.
The Convention is not an alibi for the Council, but a serious and democratic partner in this discussion.
Regardless of its composition - I hope that the candidate countries will be given a strong role to play in this context - the Convention will contain a large number of hard-working parliamentarians who need to know that the work that is put in is taken very seriously.
Mr President, war is not the answer.
Our message of suffering for the victims should not turn into a war cry. These were the main signals sent out by the thousands of American demonstrators who took to the streets of Washington last Saturday.
On our side of the Atlantic, tens of thousands of demonstrators in Athens, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Barcelona, Stockholm, Istanbul and elsewhere raised their voices in protest against the warmongering plans of the American and European imperialists.
What has happened is that those who systematically engage in state terrorism, those who made the Bin Ladens and the KLA what they are, those who turned whole nations into terrorists have found a golden opportunity, following the hideous terrorist attack in the USA, to settle their accounts with anyone and everyone who opposes their world dominion.
At the same time, in the countries of the European Union and the United States, suppressive policing measures have been stepped up in order to gag anyone who stands up against or questions their anti-grass roots policy.
The President of the United States said that the war against 'terrorism' will last a long time.
The resistance of peace-loving grass-roots forces will be equally long-lasting.
We are certain that the justice of peace will prevail against the barbarism of imperialist war.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I fully support the conclusions of the extraordinary European Summit in Brussels, I can only condemn the amount of time it is taking Europe to make a practical response to terrorism top priority.
It took thousands of deaths for us to be able to come to an agreement on establishing the European search and arrest warrant; it took thousands of innocent victims for us to be able to agree on defining a common strategy to combat terrorism.
Only now is the Union being called upon to participate more actively in the prevention and stabilisation of regional conflicts.
Where was Europe - we wonder - when the Mediterranean sea was seen as the border between two opposing worlds, between Islamic fundamentalism and religious tolerance?
Will the Union please realise, at last, that we can only define a European security and defence policy if we take the Mediterranean as our starting point.
I live on the farthest edge of European territory in the Mediterranean, just a few metres away from the most advanced NATO base - the Sigonella base - and a few minutes away from the Middle East by 'plane.
I know how willing the moderate Arab and Muslim world is to cooperate; I met the mayor of Jerusalem and the mayor of Gaza last year.
Well then, I am convinced that it is now up to Europe genuinely to start to turn what have hitherto just been good intentions into practical action.
There are quite a few worrying messages from the Brussels Summit.
First of all, it is glaringly obvious that the summit reflects a shockingly small degree of self-knowledge, which also characterises the United States' s government.
There is no understanding of the fact that there is a political background to the horrific massacres on 11 September.
In keeping with this small degree of self-knowledge, at odds with the insights of international conflict researchers, alliances for combating terrorism are being entered into with the world' s most effective State-authorised terrorists.
Russian genocide in Chechnya is being legitimised, and alliances entered into with oligarchies in Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, not to mention Saudi Arabia.
Any intervention is legitimised in this way and, at the same time, attempts at international conflict resolution under the UN system, including the international administration of justice, are being set aside.
Moreover, the adoption of new police measures is tailored to the same pattern and based on the same low level of self-knowledge.
It is the end that justifies the means.
In this case, the means will deprive us of the very democracies we are supposed to be defending.
I believe it will subsequently be possible to say, 'The operation was a success, but the patient died.'
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I hope that the terrorist atrocity on 11 September had the same effect on the Council, that is to say the Interior and Justice Ministers, as it did on the Heads of State and Government, namely that of shaking them awake and bringing it home to them that national resentments and animosities have no place in the fight against terrorism.
I see these resolutions overall in a positive light.
We must, though, be able to expect a rapid start to be made on putting them into effect.
I also expect the Union at last to embrace the possibilities already open to it; that the Member States will at last comply with their obligations and supply the necessary information to Europol in The Hague; and that the counter-terrorist Conventions will at last be brought into force.
I also look forward to Europol being supplied with the personnel and technology it needs to its at last being put in a position to carry out an investigation into the state of terrorist networks in Europe and to a joint investigation team soon being set up.
What I look for from the Summit is that new projects will be called into being, such as intensive cooperation between Europol and the United States security services and the networking of police databases, ranging from Europol to Schengen via Olaf, so that these might be used against terrorism; that Eurojust should become the reality to which Mr Poettering has just referred, working closely with Europol; and that Europol should be developed in the direction of the first pillar, with authority to conduct investigations; and that the intergovernmental level should be abandoned in favour of the European in closely circumscribed areas of organised crime.
In other words, to take this cooperation in security policy as an example, Europe has a great opportunity to bring the added value of the European Union home to its citizens.
Let us make use of this opportunity without delay!
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have shown, once again, how wide the gap is between the Europe that is and the Europe that ought to be.
The shock we felt at the inconceivable level of violence reached by terrorism must now give way to a practical endeavour to provide Europe with the political and institutional tools it needs to play a role combating terrorism and working towards peace and justice in the world.
We therefore welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September in the field of judicial cooperation and home affairs and on combating money laundering.
Against this tragic backdrop, the decision of the Italian government and the majority supporting it to make changes to the judicial cooperation treaty with Switzerland appears even more serious and irresponsible, changes to its own code of criminal procedure which are in direct conflict with the commitments made at the extraordinary Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
This law would mean that evidence gathered abroad could not be used in court proceedings and that, since this measure applies retrospectively, it would jeopardise hundreds of trials which are currently in progress, nullifying evidence already established.
It is this kind of decision which made the Public Prosecutor of Geneva say that this law is a disaster for international justice and that, in twelve years of judicial cooperation with countries throughout the world, he has never, ever seen rules like this adopted.
Since I feel that this is not the right place to express an opinion, I call upon the Commission, the Council and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to ascertain whether this measure is in line with the decisions of the extraordinary Summit.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, stated before the United Nations General Assembly, the terrorist attack of 11 September was an attack on the very ideal of free, inclusive, civilised society and on its practice of openness and tolerance.
The attack will be unsuccessful only if we are able to enhance these characteristics rather than weaken them.
Our initial response, our initial reaction must be to switch off the psychological 'emergency' mode and get a grip on our agenda.
Therefore, I welcome the commitment to be made at Ghent to proceed with the debates on the euro, enlargement and the political integration of Europe at Laeken and through the Convention.
It is in this sense that the fight against terrorism must be seen as part of a series of structural operations.
In the area of air safety, for example, we must proceed on two levels: on the one hand, there is an urgent need for a revision of the Regulation establishing the European Air Safety Authority, extending its responsibilities to include accident prevention and - if we can call it that - terrorism prevention; on the other, we need incisive action from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to ensure that the rules we are seeking to adopt for Europe become rules which are binding upon the whole world.
Europe must be capable of taking the initiative in this and many other minor areas to express all that potential for peace and democracy which is its strength and must become the strength of the whole world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we Europeans should be clear in our own minds that we are going to be weighed in the balance in the times that lie ahead.
The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible.
European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty.
Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty.
Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks.
It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so.
Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended.
That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community.
His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting.
These remarks, then, must be withdrawn.
We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them.
Mr President, it was as if Europe was drowsing. Its one dream seemed to be comfort and peace.
Suddenly the shock of the brutal terrorist attacks in New York profoundly shook its confidence and its hedonism.
Europe suddenly felt vulnerable and unprepared.
After all, its hard-won fundamental freedoms were being threatened by mysterious terrorist networks, which nonetheless appeared to be dominated by Islamist religious proselytism.
This violent and anti-modernist proselytism is anti-Western by definition.
However, this does not authorise cultural cretinism and historic ignorance leading to an abusive fusion between Islam and the aberrant, irrational and sectarian assertions of the perpetrators of the attacks.
It was not only the United States, the target of these sinister attacks, which was put to the test.
Europe was also put to the test and the European Union has to do some deep soul-searching.
In the immediate aftermath, still in shock, the European Union proved equal to the occasion at the Brussels Summit.
It was fast, clear and precise in its emergency responses.
But, now what?
Europe cannot in future act in such a spontaneous, opportunistic and superficial way.
Europe cannot be a plaything of destiny, a destiny plotted by others.
What has been established in Ghent and Laeken is that Europe should completely rethink its project and its role in light of the new world order and adopt a clear guideline for the troubled times ahead.
Without becoming unduly pessimistic about the human condition, Europe must be less ingenuous in the face of the dangers that will arise in the future.
Europe must unite more strongly on the economic level, the political level, the military level and in its internal security.
That is obvious.
But how is it to do so?
What are its priorities beyond fighting relentlessly against terrorism?
What are the new aims of the European project?
Will enlargement continue to take place on the same terms?
Will it not be necessary, from now on, to speed up the accession of, for example, Turkey to the European Union?
Will it not be the most elementary common sense to give absolute priority to the strategy for the Mediterranean and provide new impetus to partnerships with the Muslim countries?
Mr President, the attacks on New York and Washington were a new form of terrorism on a new scale, amounting to an act of war.
The intention of the coalition, led by the United States, to eradicate terrorism deserves the support of the European democracies in particular.
We welcome the measures taken by the European Council since the attacks and we are playing our part in putting them swiftly into effect.
However, let us also be vigilant in ensuring that the European Union does not, in its haste, take steps which exceed the current needs.
In some cases, these measures should be renewable and temporary.
Last week in Rome I and my colleagues had a series of meetings in connection with the reaction to terrorism.
We met the exiled Afghan King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, who ruled for 40 years until 1973 and who in 1964 introduced free elections and a free media and brought women into politics.
We affirm our support for the central role he is willing to play in the return to democracy of his country.
We urge the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to take up immediate contacts with the king.
We also had meetings with Italian ministers and were able to express our thanks for the additional deployment of troops in the Balkans, allowing British special forces to be deployed in another theatre.
We also discussed at the Vatican the values shared by all faiths, including Islam, concerning the integrity of human beings, their rights and the universal belief in the peaceful resolution of disputes, whether in the context of democracy or other systems.
We held meetings with the World Food Programme and were told that the international community should start to plan now for a reconstruction agency similar to the one the European Union set up for Kosovo.
Even before the current crisis, drought, a failing economy and war had turned Afghanistan into one of the most difficult places to live on earth, with as many as 22% of children in some districts dead before they had reached five years of age and an average life expectancy of 40.
The actions about to begin are designed not simply to eradicate terrorism, but also to eradicate an evil regime.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we support the anti-terrorist measures announced by the presidency, both these measures and any others needed, goes without saying.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the global coalition against terrorism, although we have little advice to offer about the technical, policing or military measures which will need to be applied.
What we can do, however, is to speak with perhaps greater authority about the political preconditions to success.
No campaign of this sort and no war, at least no war in which democracies have taken part, has ever been able to create the necessary alliance of nations - because that is the alliance which counts, not the alliance of governments - without offering a vision of a better world at the end of the campaign.
Politically, we need to point out yet again that we support all the democratic regimes and, more to the point, that we reject any tyrannical regimes which may promise to help fight specific terrorist organisations but which, in the long term, work with secret services which collaborate with them like terrorist recruiting offices.
Socially, we need to recognise that environmental catastrophes, epidemics, poverty and misery threaten the security of the world and need to be dealt with as threats which are every bit as serious as terrorism.
We need to state that, in a globalised society, our wealth and our military power do not offer the man in the street any security.
The only realistic solution is to find ways of taking the tension out of social and ethnic fights, of reconciling all men of good faith, irrespective of nationality, religion, social position or ideology, in fact everyone who is determined to put an end to the scourges which inflict mankind and which, even if they do not result in terrorism, prepare the ground for terrorism and we need to remove this ground if we are to guarantee the security of our citizens.
Mr President, a great Italian writer, Oriana Fallaci, breaking years of voluntary silence, has written a major article seeking to stir the consciences of many Europeans involved in the fight against terrorism and to promote the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance throughout the world.
At a time when fresh threats are being made to American targets in Italy, it is the European Union' s duty to take the lead in defending these values, which apply to all citizens.
That is why, while I support the decisions taken by the Council at Brussels, I feel that it is vital that, as we implement the inevitable specific military initiatives, we must step up political and economic initiatives as well.
In any case, I cannot remain silent regarding a controversial point raised in this Chamber: Mrs Napoletano' s call for the Italian Parliament to be monitored by the Council is irrelevant and devoid of any legal basis.
I would remind Mrs Napoletano and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that the Italian Parliament is sovereign, like all the parliaments in consolidated democracies.
The statements of the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are, as far as we are concerned, extremely serious and unacceptable, for they amount to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State of the European Union.
And before making pronouncements on legislative affairs such as international letters rogatory, with which he is clearly unfamiliar, I would suggest that he read Article 3 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed right here in Strasbourg, where he will find answers to his unfounded concerns: I would advise Mrs Napoletano, who also is clearly unfamiliar with this provision, to read it as well.
It would, in any case, be appropriate for the Chairman of a Parliamentary Group, and also for those holding positions of responsibility in the European institutions - I refer to the absent Mr Michel - not to make statements either of approval or condemnation in this Chamber on the internal affairs of a Member State.
Rather, we would like to hear what action the Belgian government intends to adopt, at last, to ensure the safety of the thousands of people who work within the European Parliament in Brussels, especially the staff based permanently on that site.
Declarations of intent must be followed by practical action.
Mr President, the conclusion and the action plan of the extraordinary Council offer a solid basis for a focused, measured, coordinated response to the attacks of 11 September.
The following are examples of the proposals which receive my full support: developing international judicial instruments, freezing the funding of terrorist networks and exchanging intelligence in conjunction with the US by setting up an anti-terrorist unit within Europol.
We are also pleased that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have spoken with one voice over the past three weeks, embarrassing slips by Commissioner Bolkestein and Prime Minister Berlusconi apart.
This suggests that European cooperation, both internally and externally, is growing up fast.
The weapon of new terrorism is fear and disruption, and hunger for power.
An effective line of attack protecting the international rule of law must spring from a worldwide coalition against terrorism under the aegis of the UN and on the basis of UN resolutions.
Provided that that coalition is based on international rule of law principles and not, as was the case in the past with the Taliban, by financing future enemies, for that is misguided Realpolitik.
I support a worldwide dignified response, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, proportional across the legal, political, diplomatic, financial, military and economic fields, whereby an appeal is made for extreme caution with regard to innocent lives.
Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the long-term perspective, particularly now.
Let there be no doubt about this: the direct causes of terrorism do not lie in creed or poverty.
In the climate of globalisation, there are certainly links between economic development, contrasting poverty and trade.
For example, the World Bank expects that, as a result of the terrorist attacks, economic growth in the developing countries will drop from 5% to 2%.
The expected effects are enormous, with ten million additional people under the poverty line and between twenty to forty thousand more children under the age of five who will die.
If we fail to formulate adequate responses in the face of this harsh reality, we in Europe will be applying double standards.
Investing in worldwide security means taking safety measures, but it also calls for international solidarity, which is a basis for international cooperation and, along with this, a basis for the worldwide coalition against terrorism.
Mr President, terrorism is a scourge attacking and afflicting our societies.
It resorts to violence and terror in an effort to impose its views by force. At the same time it attacks the very core of democratic systems, namely our system of individual and collective freedoms.
Terrorists are aware that our democratic societies are more open and consequently more vulnerable. They therefore resort to the advantages offered by globalisation.
It follows that the response to the terrorist phenomenon must likewise be a response at global level.
In this connection, I should like to congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on convening the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels and on placing terrorism on the agenda for the next Council.
I think congratulations are also due to the European Commission on the initiatives it has proposed.
On the basis that there is no good terrorism as against bad terrorism, I believe that terrorists the world over need to be aware that there will be international resistance to put an end to this scourge.
I also feel that it is important for us all to appreciate that the existing balance between an individual' s right to safety and the principles of legality and individual freedom which underpin our system of values cannot be altered.
It is very important for us to understand that the horrendous attacks perpetrated on 11 September must not result in the eventual dilution of the culture of freedom in democratic countries.
Mr President, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism.
I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism, but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty, exploitation and oppression.
The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas.
We will not defeat terrorism, whether it be national terrorism, whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind, unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror.
We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it.
This is not an argument for business as usual. It is an argument for avoiding the trap set for us by terrorism.
We have to be careful also not to fall into the trap of seeing Muslims as an enemy.
The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard.
I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi.
It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age, particularly when the country is Italy, which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas.
I would add my voice to others' condemnations.
The question is how do we respond?
The very best response, apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take, is to defend our ideas of freedom, of democracy, of justice and of ending exploitation.
This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem.
Mr President, so much has now been said and written about the tragedy, the crime of 11 September.
I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world.
Yes, we must resolutely declare war on all forms of terrorism, from wherever it comes, the IRA, ETA, the assassins of Claude Erignac, Prefect of Corsica, Osama Bin Laden and his clique and all the others, but without making the stupid and suicidal mistake of lumping them all together.
Our capacity to take in terrorists is now beyond the limit; it is probable that the insane attacks of 11 September were prepared in Europe.
So, let us spring to action and pool our resources, our activities, our objectives in the field of intelligence, justice, security and defence and let us be implacable towards the terrorists, their networks, their support structures, their dirty money.
Yes, the Commissioner was quite right to refer to the obligation to get results!
Solidarity with our friends, our American allies, does not imply mindless alignment.
With its tried and tested experience of the world, Europe can and must play a specific role here.
Others place hope in us, await us, call on us, alas, too often without response.
Let us not disappoint them any longer.
In the Middle East, a constant source of tension, the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states - Israel and Palestine - with absolute security guarantees for both.
Even the Americans are, for the first time, considering this obvious arrangement.
It is up to us to initiate the process of opening the doors.
Let us finally realise that the post-Yalta organisation of the world needs to be rethought to take account of the incredible developments since the last war: the emergence of nuclear powers, whether official or not, the fall of the Berlin wall, more than a billion Muslims around the world desperately seeking recognition and respect, new giants like India, limitless technological developments in every field, developments that are accessible only to the few, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised, respected rather than despised, involved rather than ignored.
There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation.
Mr President, following the attacks on 11 September, it is incumbent upon us to come up with a response appropriate to this tremendous challenge, to ensure justice is done and to prevent further attacks.
Europe' s response must amount to more than the solidarity called for earlier in the House. It must be an active response, defending specific values.
I am not referring, as Mr Berlusconi might, to Western values or to Christian civilisation. I have in mind genuine democratic values.
These must be defended wherever the freedom to do so exists.
Where it does not, they must be established and nurtured. Success can only be guaranteed through long-term support by the governments committed to this fight.
In the face of the serious threat to humanity terrorism represents, we are called upon to take action and to get it right.
We must abide by the rules when taking action against those who have no rules. We have to get it right, but getting it right cannot in this context mean taking spectacular action.
Getting it right has to mean identifying those responsible and dealing with the key figures.
It involves destroying their networks and preventing them from organising new ones.
All this takes time, and calls for cooperation between judges and police at international level, together with mutual political trust between governments. It will be a long and difficult process but believe me, it is the only way to defend democracy from fanaticism and barbarism.
A genuine common foreign security and defence policy for the European Union is called for.
The Union also needs a common approach to legal and home affairs. The European search and arrest warrant will be an essential element of this but by no means the only one.
Clearly, this joint European action requires us to set ourselves high standards.
No European leader should jeopardise the joint response, as Mr Berlusconi' s government has just done. The legislation it has recently endorsed is diametrically opposed to the approach adopted by this House.
It is also in opposition to the 21 September Council resolution we all applauded here today.
I should like to put some questions to the Council and the Commission.
What action will the Council take to ensure that it speaks with one voice, as Mr Michel was saying this morning? Also, how does it intend to deal with that thorn in its flesh, namely the Berlusconi doctrine?
Mr President, in light of the seriousness of the terrorist attack of 11 September, there are several important questions to be discussed and clarified, relating to our intention to resolutely fight terrorism.
The first question is the need to find effective means to combat terrorism, which do not necessarily entail legislative reform on matters of security.
It is worth recalling clearly that it is not effective, and never has been in democracy, to curtail freedoms in order to fight the enemies of democracy itself.
Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere.
It is not only the lack of legislation at national or European level, or the lack of coordinated policing at international level.
The problem has much to do both with hesitancy and weakness in the fight against terrorism, which manifest themselves in laxity towards activities of a terrorist nature, in the hope that terrorist acts would always be carried out in the country next door, or in the slow deterioration of methods of defence and security, police forces, information services and armed forces.
European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot, of course, talk loudly about terrorism.
The second question concerns political awareness of the times in which we live.
If we denounce what happened in New York and Washington merely as a criminal act, we will from the start be limiting the scope, the meaning and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism.
What happened is in reality an act of war, no doubt of a war different to previous wars but, unfortunately, all wars are different to previous wars.
They are usually more deadly, affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre. They are increasingly total wars.
To classify what happened as an act of war is not a mere question of semantics.
It has had major implications, starting with the right of the nation or nations affected to respond with military actions, if necessary, in relation to the country or countries shown to be responsible for supporting or carrying out terrorist acts.
At present this is a basic condition for effectively fighting terrorism, which cannot attain the magnitude of the attack of 11 September without the support of one or more States.
Unfortunately, there has been little discussion on this subject, but it is necessary to know the position of the Council, Parliament and the Commission concerning the need for military intervention against States which perpetrate or support terrorist acts.
Mr President, we all understand how fragile our society is when civil aircraft with people on their way to meet others are turned into bombs targeting citizens of the world in the metropolis of New York, a city in which people, at the start of their working day in the service industry or finance, become innocent victims of fanaticism and fiendishly well-organised terrorism which will stop at nothing to vent its hatred of the open, civilised and diverse society in which we live.
At the same time, however, all democrats throughout the world have realised that this open society is worth defending and that we have to work together to combat terrorism and lack of freedom.
US President George W. Bush has therefore, to his credit, been successful in creating global coalitions for freedom.
The UN, NATO and the EU have acted vigorously in this common struggle.
The common will in the European Union must manifest the ideals of the open society.
Let us not panic and introduce legislation which eliminates the principles of a state governed by law.
Do not let the protection of human rights be seen as incompatible with the fight against terrorism.
Do not let the prevailing mood be exploited for the purpose of closing borders or increasing prejudices between people.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, make sure that Ghent is used to strengthen the EU' s ability to promote the open society.
Trade is increasing links and understanding between the people of Europe and the rest of the world.
It is therefore disgraceful that certain countries in the EU are at present outside the common currency, which is one of our best tools for increasing partnership.
It is therefore also foolhardy of the Belgian Presidency to play the anti-globalisation game by bringing up the Tobin Tax, which would directly counteract economic recovery and increased trade.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe' s best long-term contribution to a more open, freer and safer world will be in terms of obtaining concrete results now on the reuniting of Western and Eastern Europe through enlargement.
You must not only handle an emergency and increasingly clear threats, but you must also fulfil the EU' s most important and historic task.
I wish you the best of luck in Ghent.
Mr President, I believe it to be clear in the aftermath of this terrorist attack that we need a far more integrated policy, not only as regards its European scope but also in respect of its content.
We must combine foreign and home affairs policy so as to take into account the worldwide nature of the enemy and their presence in our towns and cities.
Mrs Carlsson is quite right; we must not do it at the expense of abandoning the liberal state under the rule of law.
Another issue is that of how the causes of terrorism around the world are to be fought.
We know very well that none of these three aspects can any longer be coped with by the Nation State. Rather, it is only as a European community that we can get to grips with them and, to some extent, only together with the Atlantic Alliance and with our friends in North America.
I believe that we cannot be content with mere slogans, but, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that we must, through the post-Nice process and by pressing on, in Ghent and Laeken, with enlargement and so extending the zone of stability, create the practicalities, instruments and preconditions for, in time, casting what would have been mere slogans into durable forms enabling us to comply with these requirements.
It is for this reason that the preparation for Laeken, with a rationally conceived Convention, is of such decisive significance.
We must see clearly that in these fields too, technology is extraordinarily important.
We must ensure - and I am sure that you will take the right direction in your role as Belgian Presidency - a Convention that is workable and represents the necessary legitimisation, on the basis of which to present to the Heads of State and Government a document that will facilitate the really great reform of the European Union over and above the agenda laid down in Nice.
Please permit me a final word to the chairman of the PSE Group.
There is a difference between a person who is a Prime Minister and one who, like Mr Nielson, is a Commissioner and thereby subject to the European Parliament's immediate right of control.
If someone is directly subject to the European Parliament, it must be possible to express clear criticism of him here in this House and to call him to account if he talks nonsense, as he has done.
I have to tell you that the situation in Afghanistan, especially for the Afghan refugees, is tragic.
If we close our eyes and think of the impact this situation will have on millions of people, we, as the European Union, should really take action.
I believe it is of the utmost importance for the Council too - and I am addressing Mrs Neyts at this point - together with Parliament, to consider the question as to what we can do to make more resources available.
Mr President, if our humanitarian aid efforts do not run smoothly, we will create a new breeding ground for the Bin Ladens of this world.
It is therefore crucial to get it right.
I would like to denounce the statements made by Commissioner Bolkestein.
It is now the umpteenth time that he has acted beyond his remit.
He makes statements and gives an analysis in the Volkskrant of 29 September in which he says that the Arab world is indignant and feels weak vis-Ã -vis the West, partly as a result of the Gulf War.
But they are quite welcome to supply oil, he says.
Mr President, this analysis is not shared by Mr Patten.
Mr Bolkestein goes on to say that the EU' s asylum policy is not coming off the ground.
In my opinion, that is a direct attack on Mr Vitorino' s policy.
I would like to ask Mr Barnier to consult the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the matter of Mr Bolkestein adhering to his remit, being the internal market.
We cannot end up in a situation where the Commission as a whole would ultimately be harmed because it is judged on statements by Mr Bolkestein.
That is inopportune under these circumstances.
I think it is useful and necessary for the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Mr Bolkestein to hold a discussion, with a view to the latter concentrating on his own task.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I fully share the sentiments of Mr Van Velzen concerning Mr Bolkestein.
As far as the debate on terrorism is concerned, I share the views of Messrs Van den Berg, De Rossa and others who have recommended a broader approach.
But since I was absent during the last debate, I would like to come back to it.
Following on from the debate on terrorism, I would like to add that we in Europe too must prevent grounds for frustration from developing or continuing to exist.
This is also relevant to enlargement.
Commissioner, it is vital for the political criteria of democracy, human rights and rights of minorities to be just as much respected as the quantitative aspects of enlargement.
With enlargement will come a number of small countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States.
We therefore wonder what, in future, the place and rights of the constitutional regions will be, some of which see themselves as nations equivalent to others that have their own state.
They must be given their place.
Not only Flanders, but also Scotland, Wales, the Basque Country, Galicia and others spring to mind.
I am thinking of all those constitutional regions which might feel obliged to apply for Member State status, simply because Member States are the only States acknowledged within Europe.
In other words, if we fail in a future debate to give regions and nations a place in Europe, we in fact further separatism.
That is not what I want.
I would like regions to be able to help build a federal Europe, a federal Europe that is often curbed by the Member States themselves.
I would therefore urge you to include a paragraph on regions.
Mr President, at the close of this debate let me thank all the speakers, although I will not be able to reply to each one individually in the few minutes that remain.
Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, that I was touched by the support several of you gave to the work we are doing during these difficult and serious times, side by side with the Council and the European Parliament.
Turning to the most important issue, which almost all speakers addressed, the fight against terrorism, let me remind you of the spirit in which we are undertaking it.
We, and in particular my colleague and friend Mr Vitorino, take account in our activities of the important work done by Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs under its chairman Mr Watson.
In fact we were working with that committee this morning on the final text submitted to you on freezing the assets of organisations linked to terrorism.
At this point, I can confirm that the Commission, like the Council, is prepared to take on board any suggestions or proposals from Parliament where at all possible.
To echo Mr Poettering's concern, let me repeat what I said in my statement this morning about the fight against terrorism.
That fight certainly involves all the states; in no case can it be reduced to some kind of conflict between the different civilisations of the world.
As Mrs BÃ©res and Mr Salafranca said, we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism.
Let me also point out - in response to a number of speakers, Mr Lannoye, Mr Michel and Mr Di Lello - that we are most concerned during our activities with steering the best possible course between the need for freedom and the need for security.
Perhaps, as Mr Michel advised, it would be a good idea to carry out regular, careful evaluations to ensure that we remain on course.
I listened carefully to the recommendations of several Members, in particular Mr Collins, who called for determined and vigorous measures; I also noted the encouragement offered by Mr Berthu, calling on us to continue to work towards an objective that has clearly emerged since Amsterdam and since Tampere: a common judicial area, with the necessary cooperation between Member States and between all the services - and let me say to Mr Dupuis that I certainly mean all the services - and the necessary harmonisation or communitarisation in some areas.
Nor am I forgetting, just as you must not forget, that in Amsterdam and Tampere we also looked at ways of tackling illegal immigration.
Finally, on terrorism, as part of our collective action, we, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must implement our common foreign policy by establishing a political dialogue, by preventing and stabilising all the regional conflicts, by giving marked support to development.
A number of you discussed this in relation to long-term action.
I am thinking here of Mr McMillan-Scott and Mr van Velzen.
And then, of course, in the shorter term, there are the support and cooperation measures to help the refugees.
Overall, looking at this serious challenge of fighting terrorism, let me emphasise what Mr Klaus HÃ€nsch and, in a sense, Mr Nassauer said a moment ago.
We are facing a moment of truth and it is likely that the European Union will emerge stronger from this crisis in terms of the values and rationale of the European project.
As I said myself, it is also likely that we will have to step up the pace and find additional reasons for taking this European project further.
Ladies and gentlemen, even if it is difficult to explain this to you at this time of the day and with all this hubbub, I believe there is a link between, on the one hand, the political lessons we have to learn from this crisis and from the tragedy of New York and Washington, which tell us to speed up, to intensify, to prove once again the value of European integration and, on the other hand, that broad debate that began after Nice and is due to conclude in 2002.
There is a link with the activities the convention will have to undertake.
Speaking of that convention...
Ladies and gentlemen, it is appalling that Commissioner Barnier should be forced to end the debate on terrorism under these conditions.
It is a matter of responsible behaviour and manners. I therefore invite you all to take your seats and listen quietly.
I am sorry to be so harsh but this behaviour is truly unacceptable.
Mr President, unfortunately it was not I who chose the moment for my replies.
I have tried to be as precise as possible and to keep to the speaking time.
I will come to a close soon.
Nonetheless, turning to that convention, may I, following on from Mr Michel, establish that there is a link between the political debate that is beginning and the new dimension, the new gravity it has acquired as a result of the lessons we have learned from these tragic attacks.
I believe that the candidate countries must be given a place, the best possible place in this convention.
I believe the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions must be given a place as active observers.
I believe, as Mr Belder also suggested, that we must work as quickly as possible to bring this convention and the IGC that will conclude it to a close no later than the beginning of the year 2004.
I believe we will have to find a structured link between the citizens' forum with civil society and the activities of the convention.
Lastly, I believe that this convention must not confine itself to setting out the options but must be authorised or take it upon itself to make proposals.
Finally, addressing Mr Bonde, I do not share his fear about the convention.
I do not see why he should have any fears about its activities.
We have to learn from earlier weaknesses or failures.
I am speaking of the weaknesses of the intergovernmental method; indeed we saw its limitations before Amsterdam and before Nice.
We are fortunate to have time between now and 2004.
We are also fortunate to be able to work more openly with the four institutions, the four sources of legitimacy, in order to make the future Intergovernmental Conference a success.
So I believe that through that convention, the Ghent Summit, followed by the Laeken Summit, will confirm both our political ambition and our use of more transparent methods.
I apologise once again, Commissioner, for the conditions under which you were forced to speak.
Mr President, I think we should apologise to Commissioner Barnier, because it is intolerable, when we are discussing such grave matters, to see our Parliament not conducting itself in a courteous manner or listening to a particularly important statement.
I profoundly regret this and I would appeal to my colleagues' sense of responsibility.
The same has happened under other circumstances.
When we are holding such a weighty, such a serious debate, I think at the very least Members could keep quiet and show respect for the Commissioner by listening to him.
I believe we have a real problem of dysfunctional behaviour within this Parliament.
(Applause)
It is a question of irresponsible behaviour as well as poor administration.
Mr President, my card has disappeared.
I put it here on my seat and when I came back it was gone.
Someone has taken my card, meaning that I cannot vote.
Mr Patakis, you will have to go and get another voting card.
Mr President, the accusations made in this Chamber against the Italian Parliament by certain Members of this House represent an extremely dangerous precedent, in terms of both the democratic nature of this Parliament and the credibility of its decision-making process before the European public.
A Parliament which becomes a vehicle for accusations and a political campaign against another democratically elected parliament is nothing more than a forum for subversion, political racism and the intentional dissemination of inaccurate information.
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Mr President, for the whole week we have been unable to hear the original sound out of this system.
The acoustics in this Chamber are very, very poor.
This is not a new thing, though.
To add to that, we have been getting a terrible noise out of the loudspeaker today, which interferes with everything.
Because of the noise from the loudspeaker, we cannot hear anything.
Somebody must do something about this sound system.
I am sure your comment has been heard by all those who need to take action to resolve the issue as well as me.
I hope that they will do so without delay so that there will be no need for further speeches on the matter tomorrow.
Announcement by the President
The House has been requested to approve an extension of the deadline for the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors. The Council submitted the names of the candidates it has proposed for appointment as members of the Court of Auditors in two letters dated 22 and 28 June 2001 respectively.
These letters were received on the 27 and 28 June 2001 respectively, that is, just before the summer recess. For practical reasons, and to enable both the candidates and the members of the committee responsible to prepare the necessary hearings, the hearings were planned for 11 September and 8/10 October 2001.
Rule 35(3) provides that the vote in plenary is held within two months of receipt of the nomination, unless Parliament, at the request of the committee responsible, a political group or at least 32 Members, decides otherwise.
In view of the fact that the debate and vote in plenary are planned for the October II part-session, that is, after the two-month deadline laid down in Rule 35, the committee responsible has submitted a request that the House be asked to approve an extension of this deadline.
Are there any objections?
Then it is decided to postpone the deadline.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
Mr President, this first vote on our order paper today relates to the request from the Commission for urgent procedure on the measure you have outlined.
In exceptional circumstances, following the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs met this morning and approved, without report, the proposal submitted to us.
I understand that we will also receive, following this morning's Coreper meeting, a request from the Council for urgency, to add to that from the Commission.
It is the recommendation of the committee, which I have the honour to chair, that we accept that amendment.
If that is approved by the House, I hope you will confirm that would give the political groups until 6 p.m. this evening to submit amendments to this proposed measure.
Are there any objections?
Mr President, I was present at the committee' s meeting this morning, and I would therefore like to add to what the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said.
There was substantial concern regarding precisely the request for urgency - there were even three votes cast against the motion and three abstentions - because we are being asked to approve an urgent procedure not on the mechanism for identifying money launderers but on a list.
It is with regard to this fact that we expressed our opposition.
(Parliament adopted the request for urgent procedure)
Mr President, I too should like to protest in the strongest terms against the uproar during Commissioner Barnier's speech and to say that I share Mrs GrossetÃªte's indignation.
However, this is not the first time this has happened and I should like to propose a practical solution to the problem, because otherwise there is nothing left for us to do but apologise to the Commissioners.
I think there should be quarter of an hour's break between the end of the debate and the vote.
Mr Marinos, what you are saying has already been said by Mrs GrossetÃªte.
There is no need to repeat it.
If you have a precise, practical suggestion, you should write a letter to the President and it will be considered by the President and the Bureau.
You cannot bring the matter before the House for we are currently here to vote, not to open a debate on the way the plenary is organised.
Thank you for your contribution, however. Please would you send your proposal to the President.

Recommendation for second reading (A5-0296/2001), by Mr De Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise [6660/1/2001 - C5-0245/2001 - 2000/0194(COD)]
(The President declared the common position approved)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0298/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment [6760/1/2001 - C5-0246/2001 - 2000/0033(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs McNally)
Mr President, I had expected to recommend the House to adopt this draft regulation unamended at second reading.
That depended, however, on a statement from the Commissioner last night.
Unfortunately, the statement by Mrs de Palacio was insufficient.
However, I would now like to ask the Commission again whether it will undertake to bring in measures complementary to this agreement in the first three months of next year.
This is the only commitment which we will accept as reasonable, otherwise I will ask the House to vote for the amendment and to invoke the conciliation procedure.
I therefore ask the Commission to clarify its position on supplementary measures.
In any case, Mrs McNally, I should have asked for the Commission' s opinion on the amendments tabled.
I therefore now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Mr President, last night at the close of the debate and on the basis of the supporting studies, Commissioner Bolkestein clearly contradicted those who say that prices rose after the introduction of the Community exhaustion system.
On the contrary, in some cases they fell.
Those who pretend they are defending the consumer are in fact protecting the parallel import circuits that pose a threat to quality, innovation and jobs by promoting counterfeits.
Hence the three amendments I tabled.
They seem to worry the rapporteur.
In fact the PPE-DE Group has called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments to check how its members are voting and the undertakings given by certain coordinators.
I fear that once again pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken.
Mr BerniÃ©, you requested the floor to tell me whether you are withdrawing the amendments.
This is not the place for political reasoning or an explanation of vote. Please would you tell me whether you withdraw the amendments or not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drafting European law should concentrate on fundamental issues rather than pointlessly wasting time and energy on details.
This was written by Mr Prodi in a guest column in the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' on 27 July this year.
I indeed hear this gospel, but I have no faith!
The Miller report is evidence to the contrary, defining things that are self-explanatory.
It tells us, for example, what a floor is, what is meant by 'behind' and 'in front' and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass. The whole thing is actually absurd, but - and here I refer back to the quotation from Romano Prodi - Europe's citizens will rightly ask themselves whether we have nothing more important to occupy us.
It was therefore with extreme annoyance that I took part in this brief vote on the Miller report.
In many spheres, the imagination of regulators is positively inexhaustible.
Yet there is a lack of real political will where really explosive legal issues are concerned.
It will not be in that way that we will bring Europe and its citizens closer together.
The freedom of movement on which this European Union is founded is daily denied to our continent's 37 million disabled citizens.
There is no more important question in the campaign for comprehensive human rights for disabled people than the pursuit of accessible public transport.
The directive finally agreed today, is a historic step forward in that campaign.
It shows that the cost of access for industry is affordable, if only designed-for-all principles are included at the beginning.
It shows that European regulation really can make a difference in enforcing rights for disabled people.
Above all, it shows that eleven years of tireless campaigning by the disability movement, by Buses for All in my own country the UK, was absolutely worthwhile, necessary and ultimately victorious.
Congratulations to all of you.
I am proud that the European Parliament has helped deliver your demands.
de Roo report (A5-0296/2001)
Mr President, the report by our Green colleague, Alex de Roo, will no doubt mark a milestone in the European Union's environmental legislation.
Until now, we had an almost total legislative silence about the environmental damage caused by noise.
Our parliaments lent a deaf ear, although this in no way reflected the real-life experience of the citizens of the Union.
More than a quarter of them, one hundred million, believe they are the victims of noise and the economic repercussions of this noise in the environment oscillates at between EUR 10 and 40 billion.
So we can only welcome the pioneering measures set out in this report.
We do indeed need to introduce noise mapping. It is as necessary and salutary as the mapping of dangerous sites, which we now realise, all too late, is a vital measure.
This information is useful only if it is given to the public quite transparently.
It is meaningful only if it is constantly updated in terms of geography and choice of indicators.
Lastly, identifying these noise nuisances will only be useful and effective if it is accompanied by penal and coercive measures against the noise-makers, be they civil, public or military.
Over and above these practical imperatives, we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level.
We therefore continue to call for common European standards.
Noise respects no frontiers; noise penetrates every wall, resounds through every space.
We therefore urged all our parliamentary colleagues to support this report and we welcome the outcome.
Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment.
Noise is not as black as oil, or as acrid as chemical waste; yet it is just as harmful, in condensed form.
I hope therefore that the demands set out in this report will not be regarded simply as sound and fury but that the European Union will manage to make them resound for a long time.
- (FR) We voted for all the amendments calling for limits to noise pollution caused by road, rail or air transport or for imposing binding and uniform noise ceilings throughout the European Union.
At the same time, we reject the arguments about competitiveness put forward by transport firms.
The crucial factors must be safety and limiting noise levels, not competitiveness.
We also voted for the amendments fixing shorter deadlines for implementing these measures.
What is the point of deciding to take measures in the interest of society if the implementing date is put off to a more or less indeterminate future time, to enable special interests to find a way round them?
- (FR) We know what an impact noise emissions can have on the daily life and the health of our fellow-citizens.
But Europe must not come along and act as a kind of noise extinguisher to make up for mistakes in land use planning.
I am not calling the general objective into question; but if our action is to be effective, it must be pragmatic, like the action we took on air quality.
It is not up to Europe to introduce unilateral standards and impose them on everybody throughout its territory with no regard for specific local conditions.
Europe is already intervening in relation to tyres, aircraft engines, road surfaces...
It is important for the measures to take account of these territorial disparities.
Europe must do more to make the Member States aware of their responsibilities here, it must urge the local authorities to take the necessary measures on the basis of the local situation, rather than deciding on their behalf.
In this case I subscribe to the principle of subsidiarity.
Let us take airports as an example: it would be ineffective to set uniform noise limits for all airports.
Conditions vary widely from one airport to another.
Each airport is unique (runway configuration, distribution of traffic and so forth).
The impact of aircraft noise differs from one airport to another and it would make more sense to take measures to reduce noise emissions at national, regional and local levels.
Moreover, it seems quite incredible to find no distinction drawn between international and regional airports!
Nor should we forget that airports are important to the area concerned.
Air transport infrastructure is a vital factor in industries' choice of where to locate their plant, and therefore vital in terms of jobs too.
Let me also remind you that the title of the directive is 'Noise evaluation and management'.
So evaluation comes before management.
How can one think of fixing limit values without first carrying out a precise, horizontal study, based on agreed, common evaluation criteria?
Furthermore, the first stage would be to set up a system for evaluating noise levels in the different Member States and to draw exact noise maps region by region.
Only when this information is available should Member States be encouraged to formulate an effective action plan, working together with all the local authorities and elected representatives.
. (NL) In densely populated urban areas, the traffic noise and the noise around airports, in particular, is a disaster.
People' s night rest is increasingly being threatened by continuous noise.
Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission' s standpoint still harks back to the first half of the twentieth century, a time when cities, traffic and the economy were on a much smaller scale and growth was still welcome.
That is apparent from, among other things, the fresh attempts to protect the position of airline companies.
Instead of tackling overcapacity by imposing a tax on fuel, thus removing the competitive edge compared with more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, there is now a renewed attempt to reduce the tax burden for the sake of continued growth in air traffic and airports.
Mr De Roo is right - also at second reading - to adhere to previous choices made by Parliament with regard to the restriction of night-time pollution, short terms, clear definitions of noise pollution, and daughter directives on noise emissions of lorries, buses, motorcycles, trains and aircraft.
It is now only the need for a majority of 314 votes to break the opposition that threatens to lead to a long-term stalemate.
- (FR) I wanted to explain just why I voted for this report as amended.
Firstly, I believe it adopts a balanced position and takes account of the well-being and health of the citizens who are, indeed, being more and more exposed to noise pollution.
With regard to the substance, I agree with the Commission's idea of harmonising the noise indicators and the methods of evaluating ambient noise.
Next, thanks to these common indicators and evaluation methods, it will indeed be possible to compile information on noise exposure, in the form of 'noise maps' without, at least for the moment, fixing noise limit values for the entire European Union.
Moreover, I wanted to continue excluding military airports from the scope of the framework directive.
I am glad no amendment calling for their inclusion was tabled at second reading.
I am also satisfied with the deadline for incorporating the directive into national law (30 June 2003) and for proposing the daughter directives that will ensue (namely three years after the entry into force of the framework directive).
However, let me emphasise that the subsidiarity principle must be respected fully and that Member States must have some margin for manoeuvre, based on common indicators and methods, so that they can take account of special factors (different geographical situations, for example) especially in relation to airports.
Joint resolution on the accident in Toulouse
- (FR) While expressing our indignation at the accident at the AZF factory in Toulouse and its terrible consequences, as also our solidarity with the victims and their families, we have not associated ourselves with the joint resolution, to show that we do not condone the hypocrisy of discussing this disaster without implicating the TotalFinaElf trust, the owner of that plant.
This trust puts profit first, that is, the profits of its shareholders, to the detriment of safety. It did not take all the necessary measures to avoid an accident happening or, at any rate, to prevent it having such tragic consequences for the factory workers and the local population.
Furthermore, we refuse to join in the congratulations addressed to the French authorities.
These authorities, from the town council to the government, were not able or not willing to take steps to check the AZF factory in Toulouse properly, as is also true of the many other high-risk sites, and to force the TotalFinaElf trust and its ilk to take the essential precautions.
As for providing 'appropriate aid...to the populations affected', even after the accident, that assistance did not match the scale of the damage.
The sum of one and a half billion released by the government will cover only a quarter of the damage caused.
How long will those who have lost their homes and are living in precarious conditions have to wait to be housed?
However, quite apart from the fact that this aid is inadequate, the taxpayer was supposed to pay it.
Why should the taxpayers have to use their money to pay for the damage for which TotalFinaElf is to blame?
That company should pay for this in full, including of course the total wages of the workers forced out of work, both at AZF and its subcontractors and in all the local firms that had to shut down.
.
(EL) The catastrophe in Toulouse, a tragic accident indeed, should give us an incentive to overhaul the Community directive on highly dangerous installations and ensure that it is applied more strictly.
We all know that numerous Member States of the EU have not applied the revised 'Seveso' directive, even though they should have been doing so since 1999.
Even worse, a number of countries are clearly not even applying the original 'Seveso' directive properly.
I am delighted that our joint resolution calls on the Commission to publish a table, within the next three months, of all the industrial plants in the EU which are highly dangerous and are located in residential areas and which, were an accident to happen, could cause damage on a scale similar to that caused by the accident in Toulouse.
One such plant, Petrola Hellas plc, is located a stone's throw from the densely populated areas of Elefsina, Aspropyrgo and Mandra and has already applied for planning permission to extend over a 130 hectare plot of land located in the buffer zone between the current Petrola plant and the Pyrkal munitions factory.
I should also like to point out that, according to witnesses working in the factory in question, the factory operator has not provided the public with the safety report or the emergency plans setting out action to be taken in the event of an accident, as required under the Seveso directive.
Other factories in the area are guilty of similar practices (no plans, failure to inform local authorities and the public).
The usual procedure is to send a very basic file to the ministry and ignore the rest of the provisions of the Seveso directive.
Just how interested and concerned the Greek authorities are in preventing major disasters and limiting their impact is obvious from the environment Commissioner's reply to my question on the matter.
The Commissioner replied that he had written to the Greek authorities on 7 June 2000 asking for information on the extension to the Petrola plant but that the Greek authorities had not yet replied to the letter in question.
- (FR) Following Monday's statement by Mrs Christine de Veyrac, Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I want to express the sympathy and solidarity of the entire French delegation of the PPE-DE Group towards our compatriots struck by disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, and, in particular, towards the victims and their families.
Let me also pay tribute to all those who responded with such extraordinary courage and provided help, medical care and assistance to all the many victims.
Information to date suggests that this was an accident, although it is too early to be entirely sure.
If that is indeed the case, we will have to check whether all the necessary safety measures and precautions were taken, given that this factory was classified as presenting a major industrial risk.
The real question is to find out whether the provisions of the 1982 and 1986 Seveso directives, which provide for all the necessary procedures and all the danger scenarios, are being observed on such sites in the European Union and to check whether the risk reports are updated on a regular basis.
We also need to check whether the plans are operational and tested, whether the national administrations have the means of inspecting all these installations and whether the no-construction zones are being respected.
Above all, we must learn from this tragedy that has struck the inhabitants of Toulouse, to ensure that in future the people of the European Union are protected once and for all from such terrible explosions.
Evans Robert J.E. report (A5-0304/2001)
I voted in favour of this report, but I am disappointed that some of the most important aspects were rejected.
It seems that Parliament does not accept the common definition of a refugee, based on the full inclusive definition, which would cover gender-related persecution, include both state and non-state persecution and take account of the applicant's fear of further persecution.
I cannot see how people can justify voting against such principles.
In relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere.
For certain people in certain sections of society, there is a danger in any country.
In Ireland we have signed a bilateral agreement with Romania and Nigeria and we are planning to sign more such agreements in the future so that we can speed up the procedure of deportation.
This really falls short of what we are required to do under international law.
Individuals are not being treated as individuals, they are being treated as groups coming from the country concerned.
The idea of a safe country, the idea that governments can actually claim that certain countries are safe, is quite incredible.
We have to remember that there is no such thing as a safe country for certain people.

- (FR) We voted against the Evans report, which echoes the main Commission position on the common asylum procedure. Like the Commission, the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want 'to find safety'.
We already established, at the last part-session, what practical consequences this policy would have, when we considered the Commission's proposal on minimum standards for the procedure for granting refugee status.
It quite simply overlooks the fact that today the right of asylum is being distorted and manipulated to such an extent that it has become a if not the prime source of illegal immigration.
How many applications are unfounded?
Probably nine out of ten.
The Commission forgets these figures, just as it minimises the total number of applications, which it puts at 200 000 for the entire EU in 2000, while according to the figures we have it was as much as 375 000, counting only 10 out of the 15 EU countries!
This underestimate is made deliberately.
It allows the problem to be minimised.
In fact it is immense.
The member countries must not accept the Commission's proposals, for they would constrain them to observe a common procedure that would start out flexible, only to become increasingly rigid, as is clearly stated on page 8 of the communication.
That procedure would end up by granting unlimited rights of asylum and, in addition, broaden the concept of 'refugee' set out in the 1951 convention by extending it to other forms of temporary protection.
All this is totally ill-timed.
The Commission would do better to present us with proposals for establishing a policy on the return of applicants whose claim has been rejected.
It would also do better to present us with proposals aimed at giving priority to assisting refugees in their region of origin.
- (DA) The report' s detailed requests to the Commission and the Council are based upon an appealing ambition to improve legal protection for asylum seekers in relation to the rights applicable under the Convention and particularly with regard to the procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.
The proposals could therefore mean a long overdue strengthening of legal protection in our own countries.
We also find it encouraging that the proposal seeks the reasons why refugees are persecuted.
Even though we are able to endorse by far the majority of the report' s recommendations, we have not been able to vote in favour of the report, partly because quite a few of the proposals are too vague and partly - and especially - because the proposals are based upon asylum and immigration policy' s being defined supranationally by the EU.
These policy areas are a part of the Member States' own area of responsibility and ought not to be (mis)used to construct a supranational policing and legal system.
- (FR) First of all I want to thank both Mr Robert Evans, our rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the committee as a whole for the quality of the work they have done and for the courageous social choices they have asked us to make today.
In my view, voting for this report means, above all, endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the Tampere European Council, namely not just the statement that 'in the longer term, Community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union', but also the commitment of that same Tampere European Council to the 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention.
In other words, to vote for this report means to support the idea that a common asylum policy must adhere to high standards for the protection of the refugees, include a common definition of the concept of 'refugee' and give a full and inclusive interpretation of the Geneva Convention, taking account of persecution both by state and by non-state agents, as well as the asylum seekers' fear of future persecution.
I therefore believe it is important to draw your attention to the fact that the common, 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention must include the possibility of granting asylum in cases where the persecution is not carried out by the state.
The Member States take many different views on this particular point.
In other words, the further development of the common policy calls for further harmonisation of procedures throughout the Union.
We must, however, note that while it is important to encourage this kind of single procedure, this must not restrict the possibilities for the individual to obtain refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
In my view, voting for this report also means emphasising the fact that the use of concepts such as 'safe third countries', 'safe country of origin', 'accelerated procedures' and 'procedures for manifestly unfounded applications' must only be used where justified and include legally binding guarantees.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(EL) The two reports, one on the procedure for granting asylum to refugees and the other on ÃU immigration policy are in fact both an attempt to deal with the same problem.
The problem of the influx into the Member States of the ÃU of people who have lost everything, of people who are in danger in their own country, either because they are being politically persecuted or for reasons of economic survival.
Reports and other EU documents on the matter always contain a paragraph referring to the need to combat the causes of asylum-seeking and immigration.
Of course, what they fail to mention is the criminal responsibility of imperialism, which has exploited the natural and human resources of third world countries for centuries and which has no hesitation in setting up and bringing down what are usually authoritarian governments in order to serve its economic interests.
The furious struggle of the imperialist forces to overturn Socialism, the war which they ignited in the Balkans and the recent tragic example of the war planned against their own Taliban and Bin Laden resulted and will continue to result in millions of unfortunate people hanging about in the countries of the ÃU and elsewhere, looking for a place in the sun.
Consequently, we should have no delusions about the fact that, as long as imperialism prevails, asylum-seeking and immigration will live and rule.
So the question is, how can we manage the problem better?
In this respect, the Evans report on granting asylum contains a number of positive points and proposals.
However, it is still a wish list.
For example, it quite rightly points out that the concept of 'safe' countries of origin or 'safe' third countries is very fluid and the danger here is that people will be deported to countries in which they are at risk, that is, they will literally be sent into the lion's den.
A typical example is Turkey, a candidate country, which the ÃU considers has made steady progress in the field of human rights.
In reality, as we all know, people are imprisoned in Turkey for their ideas, hunger strikers and other people fighting for democracy are murdered, parties which represent millions of Kurds or opponents of the regime (such as the Communist party) are banned, trade unionists are arrested and so on. And yet there are countries in the ÃU, including Greece, which deport opponents of the regime to this 'safe' country.
As far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned, a typical example is Greece, where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens, deprived of even the basic necessities.
Likewise, the report quite rightly highlights the huge delay in processing asylum applications and the fact that the Member States are unwilling to grant asylum.
In Greece, for example, an average of 5% a year are approved and only this year did this rise to 7%.
We shall vote in favour of the Evans report because it proposes improvements to the current system of protection for refugees.
However, we feel that only solidarity and a united fight by both refugees and workers in the Member States of the ÃU in a bid to claim dignified living conditions for everyone and, more to the point, wipe out the reasons for refugees and poverty will provide a definitive solution to the problem.
.
(NL) Huge discrepancies between the rich and poor in the world encourage migration, which only solves the problem for a small number of people and not for humanity as a whole.
It is often the best educated and the most privileged who manage to enter Europe, often at the expense of useful roles they could be playing in their countries of origin.
Such individual solutions, however, are necessary to those whose only chance of survival is to flee from war and suppression.
It is not acceptable to send people to their deaths by establishing quota and to refuse access to others.
Neither is it justifiable to send people back before the problem in their country of origin has been solved.
Moreover, some refugees will want to stay on because their children and grandchildren have meanwhile been raised in the new country of residence.
Some EU Member States admit many more refugees than others.
It is remarkable that both those in favour of restricting and those in favour of extending the permits have for years been calling for a more centralised and standardised European policy.
I can only agree with this if it means that the EU Member States will be more generous in applying minimum standards than those agreed in the Geneva Convention.
It is easier to organise and supervise the protection of refugees on a small scale than by a remote bureaucracy.
- (FR) According to Article 1 of the Geneva Convention, refugee status applies to anyone who rightly fears being persecuted on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political opinions, is outside the country of his or her nationality and cannot, or because of that fear will not, seek the protection of that country.
It is time that the Member States of the European Union applied that Convention in full.
Yet France, in its hypocrisy, refuses to grant that status to Algerian refugees.
In the same way Europe refused, at the height of the war in Kosovo, to give refugee status to Serbian deserters or to the Kosovars who were being persecuted.
How many Bosnians are still mouldering in refugee camps in Turkey because the Union has refused to take them in?
How many Afghan refugees are flocking to Sangatte in the hope of getting to England because they know they have no chance in the Schengen area?
However, despite these reservations, because the text proposes minimum standards for receiving asylum seekers (a minimum level of assistance, such as the provision of full legal aid, at public expense, to each applicant, or justification, by the authority or by the court, of any rejection of a refugee' s application, as well as specific aid for vulnerable persons), we shall be voting in favour.
Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
I voted against this report. It sends out the wrong signals.
It suggests that Europe will take in the people it wants, the people it needs; in other words, human beings are being classified as commodities that certain Member States will want.
This goes against all the international principles of basic human rights.
It suggests that people who have a certain trade or a certain profession can come in, but other people who may desperately need to get in are not allowed in.
This whole policy is completely restrictive.
In relation to the idea that we all have to share the burden of quotas, that immigrants are a burden, that we must all spread this burden, that immigrants are not people at all, that they are basically problems, this report sends out completely the wrong signals.
It establishes the concept of a fortress Europe whose door will be open to a privileged few.
Mr President, I share some, if not all, of Mrs McKenna's reservations on the Pirker report.
However, I voted in favour of this report on a common immigration policy, but with an extremely heavy heart.
I did so because although the report as amended is, as we would say in English, all over the place - some points do not correspond with others and there are contradictions left, right and centre - there are a few (and I am sure Mrs McKenna will look at them) but significant positive aspects to the report.
For example, it recognises the right of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union to free movement in Europe.
Equally, it gives the right to vote in local elections.
However, there are negative aspects.
I doubt whether all the people who voted for paragraph 35 could have read it, because it restricts the right of residence, accommodation and education.
That is inherently racist and we should oppose it.
However, to have rejected the report would have placed in jeopardy the positive points; hence my support, although with the reservations I have expressed clearly here.
Mr President, the Pirker report is extremely important because it includes certain declarations of principle which we consider to be fundamental and to clarify the issue: firstly, the principle that immigrants are expected to respect the Community of values, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and to have a genuine desire to be integrated into the society of the Member States.
Today, let us grasp the full extent of the now tragic dimensions of the danger represented by different 'values' which are opposed to the values common to our societies and to our traditions, which have been introduced and disseminated, so to speak, by illegal immigration linked to Islamic fundamentalism within our societies.
Among these values, I would like to focus on those relating to family relationships, family rights, and I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the tragedy of two Italians - mother and daughter - who were forced to take refuge at the Italian embassy in Algiers and approached Parliament, asking us to protect their fundamental rights, violated precisely by those people who adhere to the opposing principles of Islamic law.
Furthermore, another principle: the recognition that every State has the right ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
. (EL) New rules for the waves of immigrants heading for the European Union, calculating the needs of the countries of entry and procedures for integrating third country nationals into society in the European Union are, without doubt, moves in the right direction.
However, the Commission communication on an 'immigration policy' contains omissions and additional objectives need to be promoted. To be specific, we need:
to clarify the difference between the terms 'working immigrant' and 'economic immigrant' and avoid the risk of creating new forms of discrimination based on the narrow interests of the job market in Europe;
to accept family reunification in general and not as a special characteristic of certain categories of immigrants;
to extend mobility within the ÃU for immigrants with a legal resident's permit;
to combat human trafficking gangs;
a strategy to facilitate the return of specialised immigrants in order to strengthen productive capacity in their country of origin;
to abolish discrimination between immigrants on the basis of sex, age, sexual orientation or disability;
to create a European network for immigration as an observatory and census mechanism.
This being the case, I voted against the report.
The Pirker report on Community immigration policy has just been made worse by the adoption of Amendment No 17 which claims voting rights for foreign nationals in local elections.
In any case, despite Mr Pirker' s laudable efforts, this report is ambiguous in the way it is worded in general, because it does not dare to say clearly that the Commission' s approach, in its communication on immigration, is wrong.
First of all, to a large extent it hides the phenomenon of illegal immigration, and it proposes only partial or distant solutions.
In particular, the approach involving co-development with the countries of origin will no doubt be of value in the long term, but it does not mean that we do not need to strengthen our border controls now.
Moreover, the Commission is more or less opening the floodgates to legal immigration.
It says that European policy should be based on the fact that migratory pressure will continue (page 14), and from this it draws the conclusion that legislation should be designed so as to facilitate, rather than hinder, the admission of economic migrants (page 19).
We, however, do not draw that conclusion at all.
On the contrary, we believe that a quota policy should be adopted, with quota levels determined by each Member State on its own behalf, and in our opinion those quotas should be filled, as a matter of priority, by nationals of countries in Eastern Europe, who will soon be members of the Union.
On the subject of the integration of immigrants, the Commission invites us to recognise that integration is a two-way process requiring adaptation by both the immigrants and the society that receives them (page 21).
This is not our opinion either.
The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it.
It is obviously in the immigrants' interest to adjust to our way of life and our values.
To take the opposite view would be to do them a great disservice, and it would also, in return, do a great disservice to the countries of Europe.
. (PT) The report comments on a Commission communication on immigration, adopted in November 2000, which considers the issue from a mainly economic perspective, linked to job prospects, which may create the conditions for establishing immigration quotas in the European Union.
It appears that the European Union is only interested in using labour from third countries to meet the needs and shortages of European capitalism, indifferent to the obstacles this may create to those countries' own development by depriving them of vital human resources.
It is, therefore, crucial that we find a new perspective on cooperation and development policy, particularly with third countries, in order to contribute towards greater support for their development and provide their populations with decent standards of living, something which the report, unfortunately, does not touch upon.
With regard to immigrants, it is important to guarantee and respect all their rights.
Hence the proposals we submitted on upholding the legalisation of all immigrants, our insistence on the need for recognition of civil and political rights, namely the right to vote in local and European elections and the guarantee of equal treatment in terms of economic, cultural and social rights.
- (FR) I voted in favour of Mr Pirker' s report and I would like to draw attention to the quality of the work carried out by our rapporteur.
I am glad that Parliament is finally taking a decision on such an important subject.
For almost twenty years, immigration as a subject of public debate has been treated only emotionally or unrealistically.
How could it have been otherwise, when the subject has virtually become a major stake in the internal policy of every Member State of the European Community?
It also has to be admitted that, in the eyes of the public, the policies being followed are, on the one hand, inefficient when it comes to combating illegal immigration and, on the other, unjust in the case of proper immigration which is legal and useful to the development of our society.
It has now become vital to make a clear distinction, both in law and in practice, between proper immigration and improper immigration, and finally to define criteria and then stick to them.
While several international and European organisations all emphasise the risk of shortages of qualified workers in Europe, we must learn to adapt, like certain Anglo-Saxon countries, and open up European society to the immigrants that it so badly needs in several sectors, including informatics and new technologies.
To conclude, real courage consists in campaigning for deep-seated change in the world economic order.
Justice and ethics would then count for much more than they do in the moralising extremism of those who would like to demand total freedom to live and work in Europe, like those who would like to turn our European Community into a mere sanctuary.
- (FR) In the light of the recent dramatic events of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, the fight against illegal immigration into Europe should, more than ever, be our chief concern.
It is time to stop letting all these illegal immigrants in and put an end to the free movement of traffickers and terrorists within the Union.
We must show some instinct for survival.
Terrorist cells have recently been identified in various Member States of the Union, in particular in France and Belgium, among illegal immigrants.
Since the opening up of borders and the Schengen Agreements, some immigrant communities have systematically organised themselves into networks of religious and ethnic infiltration, and as a result they are a fertile breeding ground for terrorism, and also for delinquency, trafficking and violent crimes of all kinds.
Yet what, in the face of all this, is Brussels' policy?
It closes its eyes and ignores the evil.
At the very best it feebly condemns the constant increase in international crime.
So what are its solutions?
Encourage immigration, legalise illegal immigrants, give identity papers to all those who have entered our territory illegally, create and allow the creation of no-go areas where the law does not apply, such as the Sangatte Centre in France.
Broadly speaking, that is what is being preached by the report that we are voting on.
It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit. Europe needs manpower, so in order to meet that need we must have a global and voluntary immigration policy.
The National Front DÃ©putÃ©s have for years been constantly denouncing this irresponsible and suicidal policy coming from Brussels.
The fight against illegal immigration must clearly be based on the principle of zero tolerance.
Illegal immigrants must be sent back to their country of origin.
Our borders must be re-established, because proof has finally been given to all signatory parties to the Schengen Agreements that those borders are an essential element in the security of our countries.
Therefore, before committing ourselves to a Community immigration policy, let us start by establishing a Community security policy.
We are critical of parts of the report.
In our opinion, there is too great an emphasis placed on what should be done to limit immigration, instead of highlighting the positive and necessary aspects of increased immigration, including the immigration of labour.
In several cases, we should like to go further with regard to becoming more receptive to increased labour migration.
We are particularly critical of Paragraph 15, which states that 'immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate into society in the Member States' .
We do not currently require the citizens of Europe to respect the community of values referred to in the report.
The question is how this paragraph will actually be interpreted.
A wave of anti-Muslim sentiment is currently sweeping across Europe.
In Sweden and in several other Member States, Muslims have been harassed.
Politicians in individual Member States have, in our opinion, made some astonishing statements.
Our concern is that the wording of Paragraph 15 is in danger of providing further scope for intolerance and xenophobia.
There is a risk that the diversity of Europe could be lost.
- (FR) The debates that have just taken place in the present session on the Pirker report, and indeed on the Evans report, represent a double departure from the debates previously held within the European Parliament on the same subjects.
The first of these departures is the new tone of firmness and rigour demonstrated both by the presidency and even by the Commission.
The events of 11 September have something to do with that.
The ideology of 'fewer and fewer controls' has given way to the realisation that terrorism feeds on our laxity.
It is not by chance that the Europe of the Fifteen, the European Union, has emerged from the inquiry into the killings of 11 September as being the privileged location for the organisation, preparation and mounting of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
It is necessary now for the good intentions just expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission to be translated into action and sustained in the long term.
It is, in fact, high time that the fight against illegal immigration and the fight against the abuse of the asylum procedure should no longer be mere formulae to be bandied about, but should become policies to be implemented with determination.
The second departure is more distressing.
This is the obvious discrepancy that has appeared between the new tone of the Council and the Commission, which is a positive signal of awareness, and the persistence of an ideological attitude among most of the Members who have spoken, which continues to confuse control with violation of freedoms, and which wants to increase the number of guarantees to the benefit of those who are abusing our reception and asylum procedures, to the detriment of the security and protection of our citizens and the interests of those who, because they really are being persecuted, ought to find asylum here.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to clarify the reasons why my group voted in favour of the Pirker report.
In our view it is of the utmost importance that the Commission' s communication be favourably received.
The Laeken Council has the political duty of revitalising the process launched by the Tampere European Council.
As evidenced by the data supplied by EUROSTAT, the citizens believe that the European Union must adopt a common immigration policy.
Amongst other provisions, our group has included the right of long-term residents to vote in local elections. We have also contrived to build in clearly defined responsibilities for the European Union.
For all these reasons, and also to express our strong support for the Commission, we have voted in favour, even though our views differ markedly from some of those expressed by the rapporteur.
We trust the communication will be favourably received at the Laeken Council.
We regret that some right-wing Members have referred to terrorism and immigration in the same breath during the debate. This gives rise to mistrust of immigrants and Muslim refugees.
Evans report (A5-0304/2001) and Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Evans' s and Mr Pirker' s reports.
We agree that, in the longer term, the EU should develop a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for persons granted asylum.
Moreover, the EU' s immigration policy should be adapted to developments in the world.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the communications relate to an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and do not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position.
- (FR) We voted in favour of the Evans report because it contains a certain amount of progress as regards the position of refugees and because it ought to go without saying that on this subject all the countries of the Union should apply the same procedure.
However, this joint situation should be in line with the country that is most favourable to refugees, which is far from being the case.
Moreover, the wording leaves several loopholes for those Member States who like the rules to be applied more restrictively, which limits the actual scope of measures which are a step in the right direction.
On the other hand, we voted against the Pirker report on immigration, which justifies a policy of immigration quotas based solely on the interests of the bosses in the countries concerned.
This report tries to provide a legal basis for the activities of traffickers in modern slaves, allowing them to seek the workers that they need in poor countries, and giving them the right to turn people away as soon as there is no longer a demand for them.
Titley report (A5-0309/2001)
. (EL) The terrorist attack on the USA gives us an incentive to look at the problem of arms exports in a new light.
Having said which, the Titley report, despite containing a number of positive, albeit general, pointers, does not I think, come anywhere near to responding to the demands of the times.
It is unacceptable for the European Union to base its code of conduct in arms exports on the criterion of the 'needs of the European defence industry' , because this negates any substantive measures which might be mentioned.
The European Union should move to get the USA, Russia, China and all the other major arms exporters to adopt binding rules of conduct and their unwillingness should not be a reason for the European Union to relax or otherwise fail to act properly.
At the same time, we need an observatory at European level, we need records and transparency on arms exports so that we can put an immediate end to the scandalous practice of selling arms to forces of crime and destabilisation which have no hesitation in using terrorism to turn their arms against the European Union and its citizens.
This is why I feel that the motion falls short and I did not vote for it.
- (DA) The idea of regulating politically the production and export of arms has our complete backing, but we reject Mr Titley' s report with the following justification.
The report does not reflect the fundamental conflict between the interests of the arms industry and an ideal and peaceful world order.
To introduce a report on codes of conduct on arms exports by, in paragraph 1 d), proclaiming that the EU' s policy on arms exports should 'meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry' is self-contradictory.
In the same way, we are opposed to the goal of making arms exports policy into a tool for developing a common defence policy, as intimated in paragraph 1 e).
We acknowledge that positive changes have been made and also support a number of the individual wordings.
. The Verts/ALE Group welcomes the fact that the report by Mr Titley on an EU code of conduct on arms exports is a major improvement on his previous reports on this issue.
We can fully support the vast majority of this report and we welcome many of its recommendations.
However we regret that many of our members felt they had to abstain from the final vote because the amendment to delete section 1 (d) "... Reiterates its belief that European policy in arms export must: (d) meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry" was not adopted.
Had this section been removed we could have supported the final report.
But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms.
We feel that an ethical code of conduct on arms exports should not be dictated by the needs of the European defence industry.
. (NL) The sale of instruments which facilitate the killing of people can be very lucrative.
Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September in America, the profit expectations of the arms industry have risen.
The only possible justification for producing weapons is in self-defence against external enemies who aim to take over, suppress us or wipe us out.
The production of arms as an economic activity, to make profit by means of exporting to regions where people want to buy those weapons, means that money is considered more important than human life.
Against the wishes of Parliament, last year, the Council pressed ahead with lifting the arms embargo against Indonesia, despite the violence in East Timor, the Moluccas, Aceh and West Papua.
Mr Titley' s proposal contains only a non-legislative reference, but includes a number of improvements on the current situation, such as the legal enforcement of the Code of Conduct for arms exports, and its application to candidate countries.
He is right to request that permission from the Member States be required by European companies to transfer licences for the production of military equipment outside of European territory.
I support him in his aims of a worldwide agreement, annual reports on the application of the Code of Conduct and a refusal to allow the supply of weapons to countries that do not provide information to the UN conventional weapons register.
Langenhagen report (A5-0288/2001)
- (FR) The GALILEO Programme is being presented to us as enabling progress to be made in various fields (the management of land, air and sea transport, road traffic, the organisation of life-saving at sea) thanks to radio-navigation by satellite.
We are told that GALILEO testifies to a desire to ensure the independence of Europe from the United States which, with its Global Positioning System (GPS), has launched a similar programme.
In fact, what it really does is provide an enormous market for European businesses, in other words a new source of profits for their owners and shareholders.
For it is they who will be the primary beneficiaries of GALILEO - indeed they already are - whether in the telecommunications sector, the transport sector or the space sector, since GALILEO involves the launching of a network of thirty satellites.
Public funding amounting to almost EUR 2 billion has already been budgeted for and to some extent released by the European Union and the European Space Agency.
As for private investors, they are reluctant to pay a single penny.
Yet the European Union is not planning to call for their financial involvement until the final phase of the project, after it has been launched and guaranteed by public money.
According to the reporter, however, the private investors who have been promised responsibility for managing GALILEO and therefore 'possible revenue flows from GALILEO services' , are unwilling to take any 'economic risk' .
They are waiting for a 'positive signal from the political side' of Europe. In other words they are waiting to be told that the political side will take on responsibility for all the costs, leaving the investors with nothing to do but collect the profits.
Though the European authorities are revelling in the supposed virtues of private initiative, the capitalists, for their part, want paying with more than words.
They want guaranteed profits, without any risk, and they know that they can count on both European and national authorities to give them what they want.
We have therefore voted against this report.
- (FR) I am pleased to be able to express my opinion of the GALILEO project at a time when the events of 11 September are forcing us to review our capacity to handle crises.
Remember that the GALILEO project is intended to deploy a set of satellites orbiting about 20 000 km above the Earth.
All those satellites would be linked to a network of control stations on the ground.
Cover would thus be worldwide, making it possible to improve considerably the management of air, sea and road traffic and to support search and rescue operations.
This technology already exists in the USA (the GPS system) and in Russia (the GLONASS system).
It is currently financed and controlled by the military authorities in those two countries.
The quality and continuity of its use for civilian purposes are dependent on those authorities who may, at any time, discontinue or downgrade the signal.
In Europe, on the other hand, the GALILEO programme will be managed and controlled by civilians.
It is proposed that the system should be developed in four stages, namely a definition phase in 2000, a development and validation phase up to 2005, a deployment phase up to 2007 and an operational phase after that.
Ideally then, the GALILEO system should be operational from 2008 onwards, thereby responding to the wishes expressed at the European Council in Stockholm and to the European Union' s urgent needs in this field.
This, at any rate, is what emerges from the report by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
On the question of financing, it seems to me to be important to clear up the question of how this will be organised before coming to a final decision.
I also deplore the fact that some Member States are reluctant to lend their support to this project.
I therefore invite the Commission to take the necessary steps to break down this reluctance.
It will then have the task of defining a general financing structure, and that will have to be done between now and 15 November 2001 if we want to be reasonably sure of meeting the 2008 deadline.
The European Parliament will have to be consulted on the Commission' s draft.
Once this draft has been approved, it should be possible to encourage the involvement of European industry in the financing of the later stages in the medium and long term.
- (FR) First of all I should like to thank both our rapporteur from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mrs Brigitte Langenhagen, and also the whole of that Committee, for the high-quality work that they have submitted to us and also for the fact that they have strongly emphasised both the advantages and the difficulties that could result from the implementation of the GALILEO satellite navigation programme.
Let us remember, briefly, that the GALILEO satellite navigation programme is an ambitious project which provides for the deployment of an arrangement of satellites in orbit at a distance of about 20 000 km from the Earth, linked to a network of ground control stations.
This definition shows us how important it is to vote in favour of this report, as I shall be doing. The implementation of the GALILEO project will enable us to have world coverage which can be used not only for controlling air, sea and road traffic but also for supporting search and rescue operations.
However, although it is necessary, for the above-mentioned reasons, to vote in favour of the report, thereby allowing the EU to develop a system which the European Council in Stockholm considered was important enough to be launched 'without delay' , we should do so while bearing in mind those areas - highlighted in the report - which may prove to be problematical in future.
It is, in fact, extremely important that we should remain vigilant regarding the possibility of such a system being used for military purposes. It is possible that the system might be misused, and it is up to us to be aware of this and to ensure that such a thing cannot happen.
In addition, it should be noted that the immediate funding of such a project will not be without its problems. Member States, or at least some of them, are reluctant to lend their financial support to the implementation of GALILEO, and private investors do not seem to be particularly enthusiastic about the idea of participating in such a project either.
In other words, before coming to a final decision, the budgetary authorities of the European Union need to have an accurate understanding of the financing involved, which means that the Commission will have to prepare proposals for the management structures for the GALILEO project.
(Speech shortened under Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) Our vote expresses the conviction that it is worthwhile having a European project that functions properly and is independent of military and defence activities, including that of third countries, which is not the case at present, given Europe' s dependence in this context on the United States of America.
It is crucial, however, that the implementation of the project respects citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, namely their privacy.
Its creation may be an advantage for the mobile telecommunications services, which can use it for localisation applications requested by users if the financial cost does not render such use prohibitive.
It is also necessary to take the cost of financing it into account, especially the share that may be demanded of countries that do not participate directly in its creation, in order not to hinder its implementation in the various Member States.
. (NL) GALILEO will not come into being until American competition has cornered the European market, which will be too late.
Such a navigation system by satellite might have become part of a strategy to make Europe less reliant on the US.
There are plenty of reasons for this.
America is threatening us with increased global warming, again with an anti-missile shield dating from the 'Star Wars' period, with meat containing hormones, noisy aircraft, the ECHELON tapping system, a monopoly of patents and with a dollar which, as international currency, has for decades passed on the deficits of the American balance of payments to the outside world.
At the moment, it is even threatening to drag us into a war against the third world.
Restricted access of American products manufactured under poor working and environmental conditions to the European market might force America to pay more attention to labour, the environment, public health, animal torture, human rights and peace.
Only in a confrontation of that kind could we possibly have a need for GALILEO.
As long as such a confrontation is not forthcoming, the GALILEO project remains a contribution of the European taxpayer to industry in the field of electronics and space travel, and that industry is largely subject to military interests.
It would be preferable to spend the money for GALILEO on environmental care and useful collective facilities.
RÃŒbig report (A5-0234/2001)
- (FR) Deploring the fact that the European Union is lagging behind the United States and Japan, the report proposes a series of measures claiming to encourage 'innovation promotion and progress in research' .
All the proposed measures are centred on the idea that it is the task of the public authorities to finance the research, directly or indirectly, but that it is private interests who will profit from it.
This ranges from subsidies to what the report calls 'innovative enterprises' to measures to encourage 'synergy between businesses and universities' , which means that as far as research is concerned the latter will be subordinate to the former.
In its explanatory statement, the report not only preaches the promotion of 'entrepreneurship at the educational level' but also says that 'obstacles to mobility arising from social security systems should be removed' .
The title of the report is 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' .
It would be more accurate to talk about the subordination of knowledge, research and public money to the interests of the bosses in a profit-driven economy.
Since we are opposed to both the spirit and the letter of this report, we have voted against it.
- (FR) The reception given to this Commission Communication on 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' has been largely positive.
It sets out the European scoreboard for innovation, drawn up on the basis of statistics available at European level.
An analysis shows that despite the efforts made by Member States to promote innovation, Europe' s performance is still trailing behind that of its main competitors.
Yet innovation was one of the strategic priorities identified by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000.
Consequently, the Commission makes several recommendations to Member States with a view to improving their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises and support for innovation throughout the whole of the economic and social fabric.
The Member States are invited to improve their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises, removing obstacles to initiatives and innovators, encouraging private investment in research and innovation, and improving the rules governing the use of the results obtained by publicly funded research.
Naturally I support these proposals.
I believe that the projects that are covered by this philosophy will be able to obtain funds as part of the Sixth FRDP.
The rapporteur has identified three key sectors in which Community intervention and Member States' commitment are necessary. These are the creation of entrepreneurship at the educational level, the promotion of the training of workers, and the promotion of innovation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
He also emphasises the need to take into consideration the needs of the SMEs, since they represent 60 million undertakings and 60% of jobs in the European Union.
Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs.
I agree with him there, of course, but I have to admit that we have been hearing the same speeches for years, all about the essential role of the SMEs in the European economy and the need to remove the many obstacles to their development.
Alas, little progress has been achieved.
I took this into account when I drafted my report on the Sixth FRDP, and as far as possible I tried to guarantee the SMEs access to European research and development funding.
. Madam President, I warmly welcome my colleague Paul Rubig's report which promotes research and innovation and backs a Commission initiative to promote innovation.
Time and again the EU has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of technological innovation and is sorely lagging behind its American counterparts in this field.
The EU should do more to exploit its potential to innovate in this field and this was recognised, as the report outlines, in the Lisbon, so-called, dot.com Summit.
European Member States need to collude and pool their separate specialisms and create a system of 'benchmarking'.
To supplement these measures the report rightly calls for more high quality education.
This will do much to boost the EU's Lisbon Strategy.
Lastly, these innovations cannot progress unless there is a loosening of bureaucratic regulations.
If we decrease the amount of red tape which currently hinders European innovation, then we will go some way in becoming more able to compete with America. This will promote more start-ups and new ventures.
Mayer report (A5-0311/2001)

- (FR) Yesterday evening, at the end of the debate, and quoting various studies in support of his argument, Commissioner Balkestein clearly contradicted those who claim that prices have risen since the introduction of the Community exhaustion system. On the contrary, he maintained, prices have even fallen in some cases.
Those who claim to defend consumers are in fact protecting parallel import circuits which threaten quality, innovation and employment and encourage counterfeiting.
Hence the three amendments which I tabled, and which seem to be worrying the rapporteur.
In effect, the PPE-DE called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments so as to ensure, right to the end, the control of its members and the commitment of certain coordinators.
I am afraid that, yet again, pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken.
In order to avoid any useless multiplication of the costs represented by these requests for roll-call votes, we withdraw our first two amendments and retain only Amendment No 3, which we believe is enough to demonstrate the sad reality of the situation.
That the international exhaustion of rights conferred by trade marks has been an energetically discussed topic in recent months, is shown by this report, which has dragged on for months and has been thoroughly revised, as is clear from a comparison with the first draft report.
The exhaustion of trade mark rights affects all branded products.
As President of the Wine Intergroup, I would like to concentrate on the consequences for this sector.
The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink, as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) at the Commission's request.
European consumers could indeed be put at a disadvantage in the longer term by our industries' losing the opportunity to develop new products and to offer the consumer new services.
Should yields decrease decisively through parallel imports from third countries, there will also be a decline in motivation to invest in new markets.
In the event of the international trade mark rights becoming exhausted, complex distribution networks will come into being and it will become more difficult to put a stop to trade mark piracy.
There is no doubt that disadvantages will result for the consumer and for the manufacturer of branded goods, for example with regard to consumer health protection.
I am therefore speaking out against the international exhaustion of trade mark rights.
However, in view of events since the report was drafted, I will not be voting against it.
Joint resolution on racism (RC B5-0605/2001)
. The UK Conservatives voted against this motion for resolution since it repeats the errors of the Durban conference.
We cannot support the undue emphasis on the Middle East, and are not convinced that it might not have been better had the conference failed to reach a conclusion.
In many respects, the Durban conference belongs to an age that came to an end on 11 September.
There are three reasons underlying any racist behaviour: firstly, ignorance about the other person, which may lead to fear and thus rejection; secondly, the bad faith and arrogance of those who want to feel superior, maybe subconsciously prompted by an inferiority complex; and thirdly, the political, economic or religious ambition of those who want to acquire as much power as they can by dominating other people.
Therefore, while it is clear that large-scale, incisive cultural measures need to be taken to teach all people respect for others and acceptance, it is equally clear that civil society must use every tool available to it to fight those political, cultural, economic and religious systems which breed and are based on racism.
Respect for diversities must include, however, constant, enlightened action on the part of civil society so that the objective of respect for human rights and dignity is achieved throughout the world.
Therefore, the behaviour of those civilised Western - and other - cultures which are fighting against religious or ritualistic practices, for example, which physically or psychologically damage a person, cannot be considered to be racist.
In being subjected to these practices, women continue to be treated not as human beings entitled to exercise all rights but as objects subject to customs which prevent or limit their participation in society and politics.
The entire history of mankind has, I am sad to say, been marked by collective and individual racist behaviour.
In condemning the racism of the past, the political world must avoid falling into the trap of fresh racist behaviour now.
Indeed, we cannot disregard the fact that there is a form of political racism currently in existence: the racism indulged in by those who condemn the ideas of others merely because they are the expression of a different political hue.
That is why we call upon Parliament, the Commission and the Council to take much more effective action both within and outside the Community than they have done thus far, to promote a culture of mutual respect among people and governments, which, if it is to be genuine, must not tolerate attitudes, ideas or behaviour which fail to respect human dignity, whether they are based on religious, cultural, economic or political ideals.
For these reasons, I voted for the resolution.
- (FR) The MPF Members abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Durban Conference as a sign of their very strong disapproval of the highly ambiguous conduct observed in this House by European Union representatives.
In fact, here we have a conference convened under the aegis of the United Nations allowing itself to be overrun and exploited by a grouping of Islamist NGOs, with the active or benevolent complicity of a significant number of states, mainly in the Arab-Muslim world, some of which are usually described as 'moderates', a conference that goes so far as to suggest an untenable equation of Zionism with racism, while our representatives go on sitting there as though nothing had happened.
In face of the attitude of the United States and Israel, whose departure from the conference was a sign that the threshold of the unacceptable had been crossed, the European Union, by remaining, and however much it denies this today, ran the risk of appearing to support these shameful equations and intolerable excesses that the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut summarised as follows: 'In Durban, anti-racism has taken over anti-Semitism and the denial of humanity'.
The Europeans should have left for the sake of their honour and dignity, which would have sent out a strong and salutary signal to the UN and its General Secretariat and encouraged them to take a firm stance in face of the attempt by Islamism to impose its ideological influence, and genuinely to represent the interests and values of the international community.
Any show of complaisance towards the kind of equations proposed in Durban can indeed be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part and of encouragement towards those who have set themselves the objective of destroying our values.
. I voted against the resolution in relation to the World Conference against Racism in Durban to make it clear that this conference has done the gravest possible disservice to the promotion of good race relations.
The conference was hijacked by those whose sole objective was to attack the state of Israel and to ignore the fact that it is the one nation in the Middle East based on democracy.
Israel was singled out by countries and organisations which have an appalling record on human rights.
Even worse the language and the tone of the attacks had more in common with 'Der StÃŒrmer' in the Germany of Adolf Hitler.
And yet despite this no condemnation of the United Nations or the conference for allowing this to happen.
The United States made it clear that it would take no part in these proceedings.
The European Union should have taken a similar view.
That it failed to do so was a sad reflection on its failure to learn the lessons of history.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.39 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say what a pleasure it is for the presidency to welcome the delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to this House. This delegation is led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, who is visiting us for the ninth time.
In welcoming Mr Rachidi and the members of his delegation, I would like to highlight the importance we attach to such meetings. They provide an opportunity for both Parliaments to reaffirm their common commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy.
As you are aware ladies and gentlemen, Morocco has joined with us in condemning the recent criminal attacks on the United States. In addition, Morocco has expressed its solidarity with the United States and all freedom-loving countries in no uncertain terms.
Morocco has also made its commitment to the global fight against terrorism quite clear.
Along with its southern Mediterranean neighbours, the European Union is intent on playing its part in the building of a stable, strong and democratic region within the framework of the Barcelona process. This process is essential to the future of Europe and of its nearest and dearest neighbours.
We are facing difficult times.
I should like to emphasise, Mr Vice-President of the Moroccan Parliament, that we shall maintain our commitment to these common values throughout. We shall also maintain our strong opposition to any attempt to identify terrorism with the Arab-Muslim world.
In this connection, we have committed ourselves to act resolutely and nip in the bud any consequences for nationalism, racism or xenophobia.
Mr Vice-President, it is my earnest hope that the conversations you are to have with the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Maghreb and with other colleagues will serve to strengthen existing links between European Union countries and the Kingdom of Morocco. I hope too that these contacts will help us to continue making progress in our common quest for peace and prosperity for all countries bordering the Mediterranean.
(Applause)
Growth and Stability Pact - Informal ECOFIN of 22/23 September in Liege
The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the Growth and Stability Pact, and also on the informal meeting of ECOFIN ministers in Liege on 22 and 23 September.
I shall give the floor first to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, who will speak on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have great pleasure in welcoming a delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to the gallery.
It so happened that my duties had taken me to Casablanca when the tragic events of 11 September took place. I was leading a Belgian economic mission to Morocco.
I was at lunch with ten members of the Moroccan government, including the Prime Minister of Morocco, and we heard the tragic news together.
Together we shared the distress caused by these horrific events, and the subsequent reactions you are aware of.
I too would therefore like to welcome the delegation which is here with us today.
(NL) As far back as the introduction of the single currency, it was decided to bring about reinforced, economic coordination among the then eleven, and now twelve, Member States belonging to the eurozone.
This coordination materialised via the Eurogroup which Belgium is chairing throughout this year and in which finance ministers of the Member States which have adopted the euro are represented, together with the European Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary matters, as well as the President of the European Central Bank.
As you know, this reinforced coordination has an informal and structural dimension and does not prejudice the responsibilities assigned to the ECOFIN Council by the Treaties.
For the first few years when the single currency came into being - and I am talking about 1999 and 2000 - the bulk of the activities were aimed at the development of, and familiarisation with, this reinforced economic coordination among the Member States taking part in the eurozone.
Pursuant to, and with due respect to, the subsidiarity principle, this coordination faces the most important challenge of marrying the practice of economic authorities of each individual Member State involved, with the common monetary project to which these Member States have subscribed.
It is the task of the European Central Bank to adopt an independent monetary policy, the key objective of which is to maintain price stability.
The decentralisation of the economic policy and the centralisation of monetary decisions are, as it were, a basic contradiction in terms within the Economic and Monetary Union.
The Eurogroup' s first task in this reinforced, economic coordination, is to outline the mainstays of the eurozone' s economic policy.
In fact, the message which was formulated in Nice last year by the Heads of State and Government is very much along the same lines.
In its conclusions, the European Council is delighted at both the improved operation of the Eurogroup and the reinforced coordination of the economic policy of the Member States in the eurozone.
All efforts by the Belgian Presidency of the Eurogroup are channelled into reinforcing the role, the visibility and the credibility of the Eurogroup.
In addition, the Belgian Presidency is also drafting a reference framework and the working method for the coming years, especially in connection with the coordination of the economic policy of the different Member States.
The key instruments of a macro-economic policy, especially the monetary and budgetary policy, must be combined in an optimal policy mix, as it were, to achieve the pre-supposed objectives, such as promoting price stability and bolstering economic activity.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the Eurogroup it is important firstly to develop an effective and lasting budgetary policy for the entire area, and also specifically for each of the Member States.
This must be done in line with national constraints and special considerations.
This budgetary policy must dovetail with the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
However, it will not be easy to finalise the details of this type of budgetary policy for several reasons. Firstly, the results of any budgetary policy depend on the time scales established.
For example, in the short term, pro-cyclical budgetary policies should not be used.
In the medium term, the objectives of the Growth and Stability Pact to establish a balance or surplus of public finances should be maintained.
In the long term, it will be essential to ensure the viability of public finances. This should take account of the different elements involved, including the difficult and important problem of the ageing of populations.
Ladies and gentlemen, what I have just said clearly demonstrates the extent of the challenges before us. Do I really have to highlight just how difficulties with planning and methods, and the inevitable economic uncertainty, make it very difficult and complicated to define and implement budgetary policies?
We are confronted by statistical problems, the uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts, even in the short term, and the diversity of the many situations. There is also the fact that the effects of budgetary policies are only felt after a certain period of time.
All this makes it difficult to determine a budgetary policy ex ante.
The long-term analysis of budgetary policy is also an essential part of structural policies. The strategy combines a number of approaches as regards the ageing of our populations.
The strategy aims to step up the reduction of public debt. It also promotes the adoption of measures to increase employment levels.
This involves the gradual elimination of obstacles to employment, particularly by reducing the fiscal burden on employment. Lastly, the strategy provides for the in-depth reform of pensions systems, in order to ensure their viability.
The Belgian Presidency is seeking to examine public finances in greater depth on an ongoing and long-term basis. Particular attention will be paid to examining public finances in relation to the stability and convergence programme.
Member States and the other interested parties agree on the long-term objectives and the instruments to be used.
However, as regards the short and medium term, recent economic deterioration has created some confusion.
Clearly, we need to hold an in-depth debate on this matter in order to define and establish a strong common position.
We must hold such a debate during our presidency.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must keep to the terms of the Growth and Stability Pact.
Member States stated this commitment during the informal meeting of ECOFIN at LiÃšge on 21 and 22 September.
Therefore, there can be no question of Member States being faced with deficits in excess of the convergence criteria of 3%.
The Extraordinary European Council of 21 September also reaffirmed its commitment to the framework, regulations and full implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact.
However, budgetary balances do not necessarily have to be set in stone.
