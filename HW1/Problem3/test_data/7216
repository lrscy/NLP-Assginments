However, this does not necessarily mean that impact assessments must be carried out by external experts who do not belong to the institution.
It is also necessary that the impact assessment board helps develop a common methodology for all impact assessments.
Furthermore, I would suggest a special project within the impact assessment procedure - so-called 'social benchmarking'. This project should focus particularly on sensible target groups, for example disadvantaged people, women, ethnic minorities, parents raising children, the elderly, and permanently ill and disabled people.
In summary, I should like to emphasise that better regulation aims at more simple, clear, citizen-friendly regulation, with continuous impact assessment, with a special focus on those vulnerable groups that cannot defend themselves.
Clarity, transparency, simplicity, cutting red tape are perhaps the key elements of my report.
Mr President, I would like to take up Mrs LÃ©vai's excellent argument.
It is a good thing that we take time in Parliament to consider the quality of legislation and regulations at least once a year.
Our regulations and legislation are the visiting card of the European Union.
They form the framework within which our citizens work and live and within which companies have to operate.
This means that we have to place a great deal of emphasis on their quality.
How are things at the moment?
They are moving in the right direction.
The Commission has unfolded a number of initiatives.
An Impact Assessment Board has been set up and it is doing a great deal of good work.
However, that is not enough.
I have said it before many times: we need greater transparency and I make the case once again for an external expert panel to evaluate whether the impact assessments of the Commission have been drawn up in accordance with the right methodology.
We need a review, not bureaucracy.
Mrs Frassoni always cries: 'You want more bureaucracy', but I do not want any bureaucracy at all.
I only want more transparency and I think that every form of transparency is a virtue in government.
An additional advantage is that when impact assessments are carried out of amendments in Parliament itself - and I have to say, they have still not been a great success - we can look at whether we could put them to an independent body of this nature, rather than the Impact Assessment Board of the Commission.
The fact that there is to be an expert panel for the problem of administrative burdens is an important step in the right direction.
That is a very positive development that should have a role to play in the area of red tape.
Of course, who will sit on that panel is very important.
It must not become a procession, of course; it must not be a kind of pseudo-parliament, but a small committee of experts: so no captains of industry, no civil servants, no politicians, but ordinary professional people who know what an impact assessment is, who know what red tape is and who have plenty of experience in this area in their national contexts.
The Commission has set a clear target: administrative burdens must be reduced by 25% by 2012.
That is a very good thing but it should, of course, be a net target.
This means that a reduction of 25% from now should, in fact, be achieved and that new administrative burdens should be included in the calculation and deducted from the result, otherwise it will just be a waste of time.
I would like to highlight one more point that warrants special attention from the Commission.
We are discussing reducing administrative burdens now, but in the future we will also need to work on reducing compliance costs.
Compliance costs are the costs that companies and citizens are forced to incur in order to comply with legislation and they are extremely high.
When we are discussing the costs of regulations, we must also concern ourselves with the compliance costs, which are ignored at the moment.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2006 the Commission adopted a working document, an initial report, on progress made in the strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment, which is a follow-up to another communication of October 2005.
This is an important development that, as Mr Doorn has rightly said, continues a process that we ourselves initiated with a view to achieving simplification that equates with transparency and is a transparent, comprehensible method of law-making.
The working document has been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has taken stock of progress achieved in implementing the simplification programme introduced, as I said, in 2005.
In particular, the programme will include 43 recasts, and I would like to give the House the following figures: 12 codifications, 8 repeals and 46 other measures relating to substantive simplification.
In addition to these, 500 new legislative initiatives have been included in another rolling programme specifically dedicated to codifications, some 200 of them in 2007 alone.
At this point I should like to single out a few points, naturally very briefly, which form the crux of my report, so as to inform the House of the actual situation on the ground as well as the overall thinking of the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole.
I have three clear messages for the Commission.
I believe it is important to make perfectly plain that there is a need, firstly, to systematically include simplification initiatives, from now on, in a specific part of the legislative and work programme; secondly, to indicate therein what priority it intends to give to each individual simplification initiative; and thirdly, to avoid the proliferation of documents containing lists of simplification initiatives, in order to have as clear a reference framework as possible.
I would therefore stress once again that the Commission needs to be consistent, in relation to the simplification aims it has highlighted, too.
Likewise, recasting should become, once and for all, the standard legislative technique.
Overall, as Chairman of the committee to which our colleagues Mrs LÃ©vai, Mr Doorn and Mr Medina belong, I believe I can say that these four regulatory initiatives cover the situation comprehensively and that the Commission is duty-bound to reflect on them.
It would thus always be possible to have the regulatory text in its entirety, even where there are specific amendments, with a clear indication of the new parts and those that remain unchanged.
This is a crucial draft text for Parliament, as it would result in making Community legislation more readable and more transparent, which is what everyone wants.
The Commission working document in fact proposes using the initial summaries of its proposals to better explain the aims of simplification.
This initiative could prove counterproductive, however: whereas a summary may be justified for a discursive text such as a communication, the same does not apply to a regulatory text, the initial summary of which might contain some uncertainty.
Very careful attention needs to be paid to this point.
Finally, the report seeks to highlight the strong signal of goodwill given by the amendment of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure relating to the improvement and introduction, respectively, of the codification procedure (Rule 80) and a new ad hoc procedure for recasts (Rule 80(a)).
These are the matters that Parliament must consider, I hope in a consensual manner and overall without amendment, so that the House will be able to signal its approval of this important matter tomorrow.
Mr President, my report is a contradiction because I have used a contradictory expression: 'soft law'.
Law is not soft, law is coercive.
The thing is that EU jargon tends to use this expression: 'soft law instruments'.
What does this mean?
It means primarily documents drawn up by the Commission: some of these are interpretative, others are implementing acts, while others are merely preparatory documents.
The problem posed is that given the confusion and lack of knowledge about the nature of Community law in many jurisdictions, including the Court of Justice itself, legal force is accorded to 'soft law' documents.
This is a breach of the basic legal principles of the EU Member States and the European Union as a whole.
The only current legitimacy for issuing compulsory rules with a legal basis stems from the wishes of the people at both national and EU level, and the wishes of the people are normally expressed through representational bodies such as, in this case, the European Parliament, elected directly by the people, or the Council, composed of governments that depend on and are elected by the people in their respective countries.
Obviously the Commission has a major role to play in the application of European law as the guarantor of application of the Treaties, but it must do this in conjunction with the legislative bodies, and it certainly cannot replace the legislative powers conferred by the Treaties on Parliament and the Council.
Our concern in the Committee on Legal Affairs is, firstly, that we have no wish to hamper the Commission's right of initiative, we have no wish to hamper the executive functions that must be carried out by the Commission, we have no wish to curtail the possibilities of development, but we do feel that it is important to establish a conceptual difference between the two types of instrument, and that when the Commission feels that it must avail itself of this kind of action, it ought to establish cooperation at least with Parliament, and certainly with the Council, so that preparations for such action do not give rise to misinterpretations or interference.
What law certainly cannot be is what has been termed the 'open method of coordination'.
The open method of coordination may be an extremely effective instrument in achieving the objectives of the Treaty, but it may only establish obligations among participating parties.
This would be tantamount to contracts between parties, between social agents, for instance.
In the same way as an agreement between trades unions and business, for example, may be binding on the parties involved, the open method of coordination may be used to draw up this kind of contract, but it is subject to Community regulations and can never replace them, and the European Union as a community based on law requires the adoption of legal texts.
Thus we cannot merely say 'we intend to use the open method of coordination' because it is an effective instrument for achieving EU objectives.
It is not an effective instrument because the European Union can only operate as a legal system.
The European Union has no army and no police force, and has operated on the basis of acceptance by the Member States of a number of obligations met by their institutions, compliance with which is supervised by the Commission and the Court of Justice.
The open method of coordination, however, is not a legal method, it is not a legal instrument for producing general laws, and the two concepts cannot be confused.
As Mr Gargani said earlier, the Committee on Legal Affairs is worried about this anti-law tendency within the EU.
The European Parliament wishes to work alongside the Commission on attaining its objectives, on its executive functions and on its functions in the drafting of legal texts.
However, it cannot and must not condone the use of techniques that are at odds with the development of the rule of law, with development of the construction of the EU as a legal entity, a community that must have a clear hierarchy of rules: a set of Treaties - which I still call constitutional, despite everything - laying down the fundamental laws, and EU legislation covering all areas where the EU must play its role, while naturally observing the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity but maintaining the Union's competences and establishing the legislative action to be taken, reserving for the purposes of execution instruments such as this open method of coordination or any other instrument the Commission may feel has to be adopted to achieve the EU's objectives.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, better regulation is a highly political project.
At the last major debate on this issue here in this House in April last year, I emphasised that we want to achieve two objectives: firstly, we want to increase citizens' confidence in the entire system of European integration, and secondly, we must establish clear and dependable parameters for the European economy so that it can provide jobs and growth.
Since then, we have made good progress.
According to the polls, public endorsement of European integration is higher than it has been for a long time, our economic position has greatly improved and is looking bright, and we have a broad consensus for continuing the course embarked upon, based on our partnership for growth and employment.
As part of this policy for jobs and growth, better regulation is a key pillar.
Although the overall political situation is currently very favourable, we must not slacken our efforts now; on the contrary, we must utilise the current momentum.
After all, the mood can turn again just as swiftly, and we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that the European Union's image has already fundamentally changed.
People still have it firmly in their heads that everything that comes out of Europe is irrelevant, overblown in scope and centralistic.
This accusation is undoubtedly exaggerated, but it is important to recognise that this is the European public's perception.
We therefore have to work hard to counter this reflex.
We want a Europe of results.
We want a Europe which brings security, prosperity and environmental protection to all spheres of life.
That must be expressed in all our practical decisions in every area of policy, whether it be in chemicals law, in the pharmaceuticals industry, in information technology or in agriculture.
Make no mistake: better regulation is not an image campaign.
We have completely overhauled our policy style and the way in which we prepare and review legislation.
I say again: better regulation must not be viewed in isolation but as part of an overall strategy, a fundamentally new direction in European politics.
Similar attempts have been made in the past, but this project which we are talking about today has two very special features: its scope and its sustainability.
In the past, we have focused on ad hoc adjustments.
Now, however, we have extended the scope of the 'better regulation' concept to encompass the entire European legislative process, from assessing the need for a law, with strict subsidiarity checks, to broad consultation with stakeholder groups, assessment of economic, social and environmental policy impacts, to the issue of the best possible application and implementation of Community law.
However, better legislation not only relates to new initiatives; we are also in the process of reviewing the existing acquis in its entirety to determine where and how it can be simplified and updated.
The second new aspect is sustainability, which we are pursuing with this approach.
This is not a one-off campaign; as some of the rapporteurs have already said, this is a process which is both deep and far-reaching and is being pursued consistently.
All the initiatives tabled which have not been adopted by the legislature will be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, withdrawn.
One such review is currently taking place with a view to the work programme for 2008.
Our simplification programme will be continued in 2007 and 2008 as well and we will be unveiling a range of new initiatives here.
The outcome will be progressive coverage of all the European Union's areas of legislation.
We are deploying all the methods at our disposal, as outlined and supported by Mr Gargani in his report.
Half of the initiatives envisaged in the simplification programme have already been successfully completed, and we will pursue this work intensively until 2009.
This will lead to direct and tangible benefits for companies, public authorities and individuals.
Our goal is to achieve a situation in which our legislation is, in every case, clear, comprehensible and user-friendly and also takes account of technological progress.
For the purposes of quality control and impact assessment, we have set up the Impact Assessment Board, which operates independently of the relevant Commission services and is already making a very positive contribution.
I am most grateful to Mrs LÃ©vai for pledging her full support for this body in her report.
However, I would also like to make it very clear to you that we are committed to reviewing this system next year and that we will take appropriate steps, as required, based on the findings of this review.
I would like to emphasise that in light of the important points raised by Mr Doorn.
One of the major priorities this year is reducing the administrative burdens arising for companies as a result of EU rules.
To that end, we have already unveiled 10 'fast track actions', and thanks to the European Parliament's prompt support, two of them have already been implemented successfully.
Further proposals will follow.
We are now in the process of implementing comprehensive monitoring of the current burdens; this monitoring is taking place in 10 major economic sectors, which in practice covers around 85% of Europe's entire economy.
This is to enable us to identify the reduction potential.
The target - as has already been stated - is to reduce these costs by 25% by the year 2012.
I fully endorse what Mr Doorn has said.
Of course it is important to ensure that having reduced burdens in one area, new legislation does not create other burdens elsewhere.
That is a very important point and I am most grateful to Parliament for drawing attention to it.
I hope that the Member States will set equally ambitious goals before the end of this year, for this project can only be successful if it is pursued jointly at European and national level.
Naturally, stakeholder groups have an important role to play in this project, and we need their support.
That is why a high-level independent panel of experts will be established, representing small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers and environmental organisations, whose role is to advise the Commission on potential reduction measures.
The Commission is extremely grateful, as I am, to the European Parliament for its broad support, expressed in the reports we are debating today.
The Commission is especially pleased that Mrs LÃ©vai's report urges the Council and Parliament to undertake systematic impact assessments of proposed amendments having potential significant impacts.
We had already agreed on this in November 2005 in common interinstitutional approaches.
The Commission would also ask the Council and Parliament to endorse the proposal made by Mr Doorn and further adapt their working methods so that certain tasks relating to the simplification of legislation can be carried out swiftly.
It does not help us, after all, if projects remain in the pipeline.
In relation to the various instruments summarised as soft law in Mr Medina Ortega's report, the Commission wishes to emphasise that classic legislation is not always the most appropriate solution.
I would like to underline the principle yet again: laws should only be adopted where absolutely necessary.
We have other instruments whose application is clearly regulated by the Community Treaties, as well as those which serve solely to pave the way for future legislation.
On behalf of the entire Commission, I truly can promise you that in all the instruments that we are applying, we completely respect the rights of Parliament and will keep Parliament fully informed in the interests of mutual respect between our institutions.
Let me conclude by reiterating what President Barroso stated, in this House last April, to be the basic principle.
European legislation is indeed the unique and defining feature of the European Union, for we are a legal community.
European integration is based on the law.
Only the law can guarantee the freedoms that Europeans enjoy today, and only the law can provide the economy with dependable and fair parameters.
The citizens of Europe have a right to expect not just better legislation but the best legislation that is humanly possible.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur on better regulation in the European Union, Mrs LÃ©vai, and the Committee on Legal Affairs, for accepting a number of the proposals made by my Committee, which is very much appreciated.
This is an area in which it is very easy to agree on our goal.
However, that is not what the debate is about: it is about how to achieve results.
The role of the Commission in this must be underlined.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed that the Commission conduct an annual follow-up on the results of reducing the administrative burden by 25% by 2012.
The role of the Commission is also important in enabling choices to be made when discussing legislation or, for example, self-regulation or mutual recognition, and in ensuring that we have some such legislation and - something which the Commission has also done - in withdrawing legislation that is not consistent with the Lisbon process.
We would like the Commission to see the Lamfalussy process as a good experience that has opened up financial markets in harmony with reality.
However, we would also like to underline the Commission's own responsibilities, in its direct relations with citizens, to secure simplification and better regulation regarding research funding, grants, state aid, subsidies of various kinds and procurements.
The Commission does have a role to play on its own in this area.
We would also hope that the Commission will come back to the idea of giving citizens the right of action when Member States do go in for gold-plating.
It is important to have a counterbalance to the ever-increasing bureaucracy of all our local and national authorities and, one might also say, of the institutions of the European Union.
One way of doing this would be to give citizens the right of action.
Madam President, the regulatory environment in which businesses operate is a determinant of their competitiveness, of sustainable growth and of employment performance in terms of creating more and better jobs.
As I also said in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we naturally support the exercise of weeding out superfluous legislation, but we must make sure that the legislation we are eliminating is indeed superfluous.
From my point of view as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the answer will depend on whether the quality of jobs in Europe worsens or improves.
I support better regulation only if the intention is to make legislation more transparent and flexible, and not if it really means deregulation.
What is crucial is that it is done without impairing worker health and safety.
The 25% reduction target laid down is open to doubt, however, as it was chosen at random.
If the legislation is superfluous, we should not be stopping at 25%.
On the whole, however, I fully agree with the objective of the exercise, and I recognise that the EU's unnecessary administrative burdens undermine the effectiveness and credibility of EU legislation.
I would invite the Commission to also increase the use of the social dialogue, an important tool for achieving the objective of better regulation.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Madam President, I speak specifically on Mrs LÃ©vai's report.
I congratulate her and the Committee on Legal Affairs for its excellence and thank them for incorporating so much of both the spirit and letter of our opinion into it.
Although the ultimate responsibility for conformity with Community legislation belongs to Member States, the actual meeting of the requirements is largely tasked to other bodies, such as regional and local authorities and specialised agencies.
This may mean ensuring their own compliance and/or that of others with regulations and directives alike.
Furthermore, where certain directives are concerned, the constitutional regions have a role to play in the transposition process.
The Committee on Regional Development wishes accordingly to stress the importance of widespread consultation at all stages of the legislative process, including the preparation of impact assessments to allow national, regional and local variations to be taken into account.
We stress, too, the importance of disseminating information.
We call in particular for advance guidance on the transposition of directives and for the provision of implementation guidelines where regulations are concerned.
The Vade Mecum on State Aid produced by DG Competition is a model of the latter.
We call also for the use in legislation of clear and comprehensible language and for the provision of correlation tables in the transposition of directives, so that the risk of gold-plating is diminished.
With these and the other measures advocated in the report - indeed, in all four reports - we believe that we should do much to achieve better regulation in the EU.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with an apology.
I was not aware that the previous speaker was absent and that the speaking time had been changed.
Thank you for permitting me to speak now.
I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and after in-depth deliberations, the committee adopted this position by consensus.
I would like to point out, first of all, that there was agreement within our committee that soft law - or whatever we want to call these measures which are now being applied increasingly frequently in European law but also in national legislation - has become a very common practice which offers the opportunity to respond flexibly and therefore swiftly to new developments, which is why it should not be criticised per se.
We also agreed to some extent that the Commission - to turn to the European level - uses soft law in individual cases as a means of circumventing the opportunities for the participation of the legislator as provided for by law.
This, in our view, is a major problem relating to soft law.
We discussed, too, the fact that Parliament endorsed the complaint against the Commission in one case because we ascertained that such circumvention had indeed occurred.
We believe that the legislator encounters soft law in such diverse ways today that we must always make a clear distinction between what genuinely only comes on to the market in the form of a green paper, on the one hand - in other words, it is simply planned as preparation for further legislation - and on the other, what is genuinely necessary for flexible legislation in the framework of soft law.
As members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we do not identify any legislative, any direct impact of such green and white papers, but we believe that when new legislation is adopted, the legislator must always adopt a new decision as well.
The debate, after all, not only focuses on soft law but also on other benchmarks for better law-making, and I believe that in many areas, we certainly have not made as much progress as citizens now assume from the media, which is why all the institutions involved - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have a responsibility to make faster progress in this area.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I wish to begin by making three statements to set the context of this debate.
Firstly, we must not forget that one person's red tape is another person's vital piece of legislation.
Secondly, we should not forget, as Commissioner Verheugen has said in the past, that 50% of the administrative burden relating to EU legislation is added by Member States.
Finally, the most important thing is that the European Union is itself a simplification process, because by having one set of rules instead of 27 we have cut business costs enormously in comparison to what life was like before many European Union laws were passed.
Having said that, legislation has to be clear, easy to understand and to enforce, and adaptable to changing circumstances. That has not always been the case in the past, and sometimes one wondered whether the overall effort of producing and enforcing a piece of legislation did not outweigh in some ways the benefits to be derived from it.
That is why I would support what the Commission has been trying to do in its drive for better regulation and simplification, and in particular the establishment of an impact assessment board.
It is important that all the institutions realise their role in this.
It is all very well for Parliament or the Council to pontificate about better regulation, so long as, when it comes to amendments, we ourselves look at the impact of those amendments.
Parliament also has a responsibility to look at existing legislation and analyse it in depth to see whether it has had the effect it wanted.
We tend to agonise for months over this or that amendment, but often put no effort into finding out whether the legislation has had its desired effect.
I would hope therefore that we, as a Parliament, might step up our own efforts to participate in this process.
- (NL) Madam President, I would also like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs for their extremely interesting reports.
It is very important that Parliament pays a great deal of attention to this issue and I entirely share the view of the Commissioner that many citizens in Europe have the impression that all bad laws come out of Brussels.
National parliamentarians claim far too often that they cannot help it, that it is Brussels that is imposing them upon them.
We must do all in our power to refute this as soon as possible.
This is the first time that I have spoken on an issue from the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I am speaking in this debate firstly because the topic interests me greatly.
I myself am a member of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Last year in the Committee on Budgets we approved a proposal that I had written to create a body, a pilot project, to assess administrative burdens independently of the Commission.
That means, therefore, that Parliament felt that the internal assessment in the Commission was not sufficient.
I completely agree with Mr Doorn that we have to have a body outside the Commission that will assess the effects of legislation.
The text in the budget that has meanwhile been approved by the Council and Parliament should be the guide for the Commission to take further action.
The Committee on Budgetary Control also prepared a report that was adopted in plenary in July.
We support the target of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens and naturally - and the Commissioner and Mr Doorn have also confirmed this already - laws that we have just repealed must not be allowed to come back in through the back door as new legislation.
It is important that we review all legislation before 2013 to see whether it is redundant or not.
The Commission should publish regular reports or other announcements stating what has been achieved.
The Commission's actions and the measures taken to reduce administrative burdens should be transparent.
An internal reorganisation of the Commission may prove necessary.
Finally, to conclude what I have to say, I would like to thank Mr Verheugen for the outstanding cooperation I have had with his departments on developing the pilot project that was adopted by this House last year.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, in taking the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate on better law-making in the European Union, I should like to draw attention to the following issues.
Firstly, the authors advocate better law-making, aimed at increasing the efficiency, effectiveness, cohesion and transparency of Union legislation.
Consequently, the process should comply with the following conditions, and I support this view:
it is essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to work together on the matter;
there should be broad and open consultation on the matter with all interested parties, including entrepreneurs, local authorities and non-governmental organisations, and I would like to emphasise the importance of such consultation;
Community bodies should be given more responsibility for the law-making process and the overall transparency of the process should be improved;
every assessment of legislation aimed at its simplification should, however, ascribe equal importance to economic and social issues, and take account of issues relating to health and environmental protection;
in addition, the process of simplifying legislation should not lead to a lowering of the standards enshrined in the Union's current acquis.
Secondly, the authors also point out that unnecessary and unclear expressions should be avoided when drafting legal provisions.
The language used should be straightforward and easy to understand.
At the same time, the terminology should be precise and legal certainty ensured, so that the Union's legislation can be understood by its citizens, who now number almost 500 million.
Thirdly, the decision taken at the 2007 Spring Council to achieve a 25% reduction of the administrative burden resulting from Union legislation by 2012 should be warmly welcomed.
We can but hope that this objective is more realistic and has a greater chance of being achieved than the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
Fourthly, it should also be pointed out that the reports contained proposals for alternative solutions regarding the introduction of new legislation.
The former included self-regulation or mutual recognition of national provisions, and even the option of not undertaking any legislative action.
All these proposals merit detailed consideration in view of the dramatic increase in Union legislation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work and raise another matter.
Although this is a highly political issue, as Commissioner Verheugen said, it is also awkward and often technical; handling it is particularly complicated, especially when it comes to asking what the term 'better regulation' might mean for citizens in practice.
I wish to say very briefly that, as concerns the reports by Mr Gargani and Mr Medina, my group agrees with virtually everything.
However, on the subject of alternatives to legislation I wanted to point out, as did the Commissioner, the need to make it clear that their application is extremely unsatisfactory, and I am referring above all to self-regulation and co-regulation.
As Mr Medina indicated, the main thing is to focus on the legal and legislative value of acts.
Mr Doorn is well aware that I and my Group have doubts about the idea of concentrating all our attention on subsidiarity and proportionality, that is, on the initial topic of his report, and on administrative costs.
For us, the question of administrative costs is a minor problem compared with that of the overall capacity of our regulations and our institutions to produce legislation that is clear, can be applied in a fair and balanced manner, is unambiguous and, above all, is not open to varying interpretations.
Discussing these aspects is at least as important as discussing cost.
Moreover, as Mr Titley has already said, the existence of high administrative costs is obviously something that depends mainly on the Member States, and in my view not enough attention is being paid to these factors.
For example, I would like to know one thing: how much will it cost, Mr Verheugen, to do everything that is being asked of you?
Committees, reports, monitoring: all of this costs money, and if we really are to go down the road of setting up this huge structure, we must know how much it will cost.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I consider it a very positive step that we are discussing together all the reports connected by the common theme of creating and revising the Community's secondary law.
I would like to comment briefly on Mr Gargani's report.
I believe that the report is very good on the whole and I therefore recommend that the House adopt it.
I fully agree with the proposal that the strategy of simplifying the legal environment should have political priority.
In that regard, however, I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process.
What I have in mind here is that Parliament should have the same law-making initiative as the Commission, which would undoubtedly have a positive effect on the process of simplifying and improving the quality of the legal environment in Europe.
I would also like to voice my reservations regarding the targets set by the Commission, which stipulate that not only Community but also national legislation should be reduced by 25% by the year 2012.
The schedule of simplification for the years 2006-2009 provides for 43 revisions, 12 codifications, 26 other measures and 8 repeals.
But at the same time 500 new legislative initiatives are expected in the area of codifications alone.
This makes me think that the Commission's plans for reduction in the secondary Community legislation are not realistic.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur for a sound report on 'soft law' - a dirty word that fortunately does not exist in Danish.
I am the rapporteur on the same subject in the European Economic Area Joint Parliamentary Committee, and we fully endorse Mr Medina Ortega's conclusions.
In 2005 the Commission's internal market experts issued a recommendation on copyright protection for composers and authors.
This was coordinated with the Directorate-General for Competition in cases against rights agencies.
The Danish copyright society KODA has been constantly threatened with a fine of 10% of its turnover since 1973.
I would call on Commission President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso to intervene and defend cultural diversity.
The recommendation and competition case together amount to hard law and expropriation - which constitutes an infringement of EU law, as that effect can only legally be produced by means of legislation.
An unelected executive cannot legislate and expropriate by means of recommendations and competition cases.
Instead, it should be putting forward a proposal for a directive on artists' copyright and rights agencies, as we requested in the LÃ©vai report.
As elected representatives of the people, we represent music consumers, artists, radio, TV and many small and medium-sized enterprises that make a living from varied cultural provision.
We reject administrative legislation for the benefit of a handful of multinationals.
Elected representatives should always be consulted before the Commission issues such recommendations.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, of course less bureaucracy and more legal clarity are desirable, and of course it is high time we got rid of old and obsolete regulations and directives.
If we take the 'Sunshine Directive', for example, this was principally designed to limit workers' exposure to UV radiation, but anyone who denies the ordinary citizen a modicum of common sense from the outset should not be at all surprised by the accusations about the EU's regulatory madness and excessive bureaucracy, currently reflected in the plethora of EU agencies springing up everywhere.
The citizens are undoubtedly smarter than the EU establishment gives them credit for, and they also notice that alongside the regulatory zeal - the proverbial regulatory madness - a kind of deregulatory madness is occurring, namely when it comes to the rights and security of citizens themselves.
So that no one can be accused of discrimination, for example, Muslims and other immigrant groups are constantly being given almost carte blanche to break the law, and at the same time, the demand for non-European skilled workers is putting the labour market under more and more pressure in order to circumvent collective agreements and other social rights.
That really is unacceptable, in my view.
The citizens are also rightly aggrieved about a Constitution that was negotiated behind closed doors and has now been cosmetically enhanced, and about their lack of a voice in the various rounds of EU enlargement.
Action under the slogan of taking the EU closer to the citizens cannot distract from the real problems, in my view.
Brussels must learn to accept it when citizens say 'no', and must learn to base its decisions on the will of the people.
The aim must be a federal Europe of subsidiarity, a Europe in which democracy, the rule of law and transparency prevail, a Europe with which the citizens can finally identify once again.
(SK) Firstly, I would like to focus on the need for codification.
There are countless legislative regulations within the European Union; these affect a vast range of social relations.
Since there are so many of them, they are too complex and not easy to navigate.
The EU's legislative acts are not meant only for lawyers: ordinary citizens of the European Union work with them as well.
There is a problem here and it relates to the links between these acts and the national legislative acts.
Even if citizens of the European Union look up a given law, they often have no idea that there are other EU acts fundamentally linked to it.
That is why I propose to address in detail the issue of codification of laws so that research and their subsequent practical application are easier.
Secondly, I would like to focus on the amendments tabled in the European Parliament.
In my opinion, it is not practical to 'enrich' the original EU text with amendments that are often nonsensical.
Some of them have no fundamental impact on the topic in question, being simply linguistic alterations.
Some broaden the scope of the future law to such an extent that there is duplication of legislation and ensuing confusion.
The solution to one problem should not be provided in several Community acts since this makes the situation less clear.
As a result, by the time it leaves the European Parliament an amended legislative act can often be almost twice the size of the European Commission text; this does not make things any simpler or any clearer.
Codification should be based on the principles of effectiveness, efficiency, accountability, transparency and continuity.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to make just three comments on points of principle.
The first concerns impact assessment for legislative proposals.
I recognise that significant progress has been made since 1999, when Parliament took the initiative on this issue, and since 2003, when an interinstitutional agreement was adopted, which was negotiated by our Chairman, Mr Gargani.
However, there are still deficits.
Parliament is demanding - as it has done before in numerous resolutions - that impact assessments of legislative proposals be conducted on a more independent basis.
I make no secret of the fact that to my mind, we should be thinking about whether we should adopt the US model of an independent agency which is established outside the Commission and undertakes impact assessments of legislation in line with a standardised procedure not only for the Commission but for all other institutions as well.
However, another key point based on our experience in the Committee on Legal Affairs is that impact assessments are not actually being carried out as standard on every Commission proposal.
I can cite two specific examples from the Directorate-General for Justice and one from the Internal Market Directorate-General that have remained in my memory.
I also think that it is important to give serious consideration to the possibility of carrying out impact assessments in comitology procedures too, as it is often here that the bureaucracy arises as a result of the comitology decisions and the associated burdens.
As to soft law, Mr Medina Ortega's report has my full backing.
Indeed, in the Committee on Legal Affairs we increasingly have the impression that the European Commission is misusing the instrument of soft law in order to circumvent Parliament's codecision rights.
It is not acceptable for the Commission to make decisions as a legislative body at the proposal of the Directorate-General for Competition on which it consults Parliament, yet this is not the case for recommendations relating to the internal market.
As my final point, I would like to draw attention to the issue of simplification. We need an institutional agreement on simplification as a matter of urgency, as we have in other areas, in order to ensure that we have an efficient procedure.
We do not want to open a Pandora's box and instead of simplifying matters, end up with even greater complexity.
(PL) Madam President, it is pleasing to note that in recent years the European Commission has become increasingly concerned about the quality of the Union's legislation.
The Commission is striving to ensure, on the one hand, that legislation is transparent and accessible, and on the other, that it is effective and has a positive impact on the citizens and on entrepreneurship.
Better laws increase the benefits derived from modern and effective legislation whilst simultaneously reducing the cost of its implementation to a minimum.
The Commission's communication of 14 November 2006 on a strategic review of better regulation in the European Union, together with the stated objective of achieving a 25% reduction of the administrative burden by 2012, represent a key first step on the way to resolving the problem at both European and national level.
The communication also emphasises the need for the Council and the European Parliament to provide regular impact assessments concerning the main changes to the proposals, and for greater importance to be attached to the proposals concerning simplification of legislation in the framework of codification and repeal of outdated legal acts.
In this connection, it is particularly important to set up a special Council to deal with impact assessment and strengthen implementation of Community legislation through preventive actions undertaken by Member States from the earliest stages of implementation of Community legislation.
As part of the ongoing work on better legislation it is crucial for the European Parliament both to become involved in the interinstitutional debate, and also to act as co-legislator in the adoption of the legal acts derived from such a process.
It is important to emphasise the new principles of comitology in this House.
They strengthen control by the European Parliament and Council of the Commission's executive powers, thus contributing to simplification of Community legislation.
Regarding the role of the Commission, the latter should require rather than recommend Member States to submit correlation tables for inspection, particularly in order to facilitate checking of the process of transposition of directives in each of the Member States.
The Commission should also be urged to introduce easily comprehensible and transparent language into the legislative proposals submitted, whilst retaining legal certainty and accuracy of terminology.
(PL) Madam President, better law-making is very relevant to the harmonisation of action within the European Union.
I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on excellent reports.
Thanks are due to Mrs LÃ©vai, Mr Doorn, Mr Gargani, and Mr Medina Ortega.
A tendency to deal with as many problems as possible through legal regulation has become evident in many national parliaments and also in this House.
It often results from a belief that issues can be resolved by devising a provision.
In so doing we try to take account of all the arguments, of lobbyists and of the special interests concerned.
As a result, legal provisions lack transparency and are difficult for the citizens, enterprises and the administration to understand.
They end up as huge documents that lack transparency and are difficult to transpose into the legislation of all countries.
Better law-making should involve the use of legislative instruments with a view to achieving the aims laid down in the Treaty.
Co-regulation and self-regulation may be used to supplement legislative measures, but only when they provide for better or equal scope than the methods involved in application of legislation.
Better law-making and refraining from dealing with as many matters as possible through legislation are not new issues, but they need to be dealt with as quickly as possible.
Assessment of the legislative implications, ensuring terminological precision and legal certainty, limiting recourse to abbreviations and unduly lengthy recitals should result in better, more modern, rational and effective legislation.
The action undertaken will significantly reduce the administrative costs incurred by Parliament, interested parties and those affected by the legislation introduced.
The application of so-called soft law based on Community practice represents a further challenge.
Soft law does not guarantee full legal protection; it is not binding and gives rise to legal reservations.
It must not be used instead of legal acts in areas for which the Community has legislative powers.
The issues covered in the studies are of great practical significance and call for further swift action.
The success of better regulation will depend very largely on the European Commission, working in cooperation with Parliament and the Council.
Madam President, this joint debate encompasses four reports supposedly compiled to outline better regulation in the EU.
That is surely a contradiction in terms!
Despite the many words written and spoken on this topic, the crux of this issue has been entirely overlooked.
Mr Doorn's report best sums up the blinkered stance taken towards this notion of better regulation.
After all, that report states that the Commission's action programme to reduce administrative burdens by 25% by 2012 'cannot [...] be equated to a deregulation, nor lead to a change in the policy objectives and level of ambition contained in Community legislation'.
Therefore, not one single report considers the possibility that less regulation - or, even better, no legislation - is what is required.
This concept will not be grasped by this talking shop simply because, if this logic were pursued, then Euroland would be forced to admit what we have known for many years, which is that the EU is bad news for business.
Mr President, as we debate better regulation, we should first recall the scale of the problem.
No one imagines you can run a modern economy without regulation but, equally, excessive regulation can be hugely damaging, and the Commission's own figures prove it.
In an interview with the Financial Times last year, Commission Vice-President Verheugen said that he had made a new estimate of the annual cost of regulation to the EU economies, and that it amounted to an extraordinary EUR 600 billion!
That is around 5.5% of the EU's GDP.
But what about the admitted trade benefits of the single market?
Here again we can turn to the Commission's figures.
The Commission has estimated the trade benefits at EUR 160 billion a year.
In other words, the cost of EU regulation exceeds the benefits of the single market by more than three times.
The EU's regulatory system is making us all poorer and damaging our competitiveness in the face of globalisation.
My fear is that all the talk of better regulation is coded language for 'more of the same'.
We do not need better regulation, we need less regulation.
I have a practical proposal: let us agree to pass no new legislation in the next parliamentary term.
Instead, let us unleash the full power of the EU institutions on the task of deregulation.
Let us do the impact assessments, let us consult with industry and then let us dismantle the legislation which is holding us back.
Thank you, Mr Helmer.
As far as I am aware, when I got up this morning I was still female!
(EL) Mr President, I should like to focus on the amendments that I have submitted to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that have been incorporated into the text of the Committee's opinion on the use of 'soft law'.
'Soft' or 'permissive' law is a widely accepted dialogue-based form of European common regulatory policy involving coordination, cooperation, negotiation and hierarchy.
My main observation is that soft-law instruments, which do not take on a legally binding nature but nevertheless produce certain indirect legal results, have proven adequate for the effective regulation of certain areas of Community activity - within the framework of the Community treaties, of course, and subject to the requirements laid down in those treaties.
I am also of the opinion that soft-law instruments should be used as preparatory instruments for binding legislative acts.
They are superseded when formal legislative acts come into force, and they contribute to the interpretation and enforcement of Community legislation.
However, I should like to emphasise that excessive recourse to soft-law instruments would signal a change of the single European Community model into a traditional international organisation.
Soft law should not be a substitute where it is essential to adopt binding Community legislation - subject, of course, to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
As I have stressed in one of my adopted amendments, the Commission should make a special effort to guarantee transparency, visibility and public accountability in the procedure for approving non-binding Community acts, and guarantee increased use of impact assessment in the decision-making process.
(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, the Spring European Council proposed to reduce Community and national bureaucracy by 25% by 2012.
Member States should develop a plan for quantifying and reducing administrative costs, by avoiding overregulation in transposing Community legislation into national law.
To ensure better regulation, the proposals for simplifying legislation, reducing the number of normative acts and retaining only the very necessary regulations should have priority.
Non-mandatory legislative (soft law) instruments should be developed with the cooperation of democratic institutions, used very carefully but without replacing the Community law, when needed.
For legislation that is easy to understand and apply , impact studies and consultation of the relevant parties are essential, especially with regard to the social impact of the legislative proposals.
Information technology should be used in order to reduce administrative costs and to ensure the transparency of the legislative process.
The future European Treaty will enable European Union citizens, by means of the national parliaments, to exercise scrutiny over observance of the principle of subsidiarity within the context of legislative proposals.
(PL) Madam President, dura lex, sed lex is a Latin maxim that most lawyers are probably very familiar with.
It translates as hard law but law nonetheless.
Today we are focusing on soft law, which identifies a particular approach, but is not a legally binding act.
It is an expression of political declarations, resolutions, Council declarations, Presidency conclusions, but such provisions are not binding.
Soft law may also be applied by the European Court for the interpretation of provisions, however.
It is therefore a type of law, although the Court states that it is not intended to have a legally binding effect even in relation to the persons to whom it is applied.
In practice, however, the national courts are required to take account of recommendations when resolving disputes.
The former assist in interpretation of national law adopted, guaranteeing its implementation and supplementing binding Community provisions.
The rapporteur has provided a very critical analysis of non-binding legal provisions.
In particular, their implementation by the Commission is deemed inappropriate.
The rapporteur emphasises that in a situation in which the Community has legislative authority it would be appropriate for a body such as Council or the Parliament to adopt an act, taking account of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
I agree with the rapporteur that the only way to guarantee the possibility of applying and implementing the law is by adopting provisions in the framework of institutional procedures laid down in the Treaty.
(SV) Madam President, as the basis for cooperation within the EU the Member States have signed several treaties laying down the basic rules governing what the EU is and what the EU must do.
This is called primary law and the EU institutions are not permitted to take decisions which are not based on primary law.
I wish to draw the Chamber's attention to the resolution by the rapporteur Manuel Medina Ortega in which he urges the Commission to avoid the expression of soft law.
As we all know, soft law is non-legally binding documents presented by the Commission to clarify directives in different policy areas.
It is fortunate, not regrettable as Mr Ortega puts it, that the Member States have voting powers in areas where full harmonisation of the law is merely an impossible dream of the federalists.
Community law is binding only in areas where the Member States themselves have delegated decision-making rights to the Community.
(PL) Madam President, I welcomed the fact that, for the first time, initiatives concerning simplification of legislation have been included in the Commission's work and legislative programme for the current year.
A better regulatory environment and clear and effective legislation are essential conditions for ensuring better implementation of the law.
This will in turn impact on the rate of economic growth and job creation, thus making a valuable contribution to the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
It should also be borne in mind that in many cases, the way in which Community legislation has been established to date has resulted in the emergence of a notion of a remote bureaucratic structure amongst citizens of the Member States.
This structure has been perceived as being uninterested in resolving the problems experienced by ordinary people or in making their lives easier, a situation which the Eurosceptics are busy exploiting.
Clearly, simplification cannot be confined to the European level.
It must also take place at national level, so that the benefits of Community simplification are not squandered due to national regulations.
I strongly support the calls to the European Commission urging it to monitor this process at national level too.
On its own, however, simplifying legislation does not guarantee that it will be of a better quality.
We need to determine whether so-called soft law does represent an effective instrument in the context of the Community.
We are all aware that the current model of soft law imposes the requirement to undertake transposition into the national systems.
Not only is this linked to higher costs, but it also has a significant impact on the clarity and effectiveness of legislation precisely at national level.
In addition, this leads to serious problems in the area of case-law, as it increases waiting time because of the need to address prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice.
I agree with the statement that so-called soft law all too often amounts to an ambiguous and ineffective instrument that can have a negative impact on Community legislation and the institutional balance.
It should not be used as a substitute for desirable but unadopted legislation.
An effective system of assessment of the impact of legal acts is a sine qua non for ensuring high quality and effective Community or national legislation.
I believe much still remains to be done in this area, and I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to emphasise how important it is for the institution charged with carrying out impact assessments to be entirely independent.
Better law-making must also mean the involvement of the European Parliament both in interinstitutional debate and as a co-legislator.
(PL) Madam President, I welcome the fact that we are paying increasing attention to the quality of appropriate European Community legislation.
The latter is the subject of scrutiny in terms of its transparency, accessibility and effectiveness.
It should, however, be borne in mind that better law-making includes all aspects of the legislative process, from the initial concept through to its introduction and implementation.
Accordingly, when discussing better regulation we should also consider every level of administration.
The administrative structure must not be allowed to grow unnecessarily, with all the burdens that implies.
This applies not only to the European administration but also to the administration at Member State level.
Accordingly, both the European Union and the Member States should launch an ambitious strategy to reduce administrative burdens, bearing in mind that such burdens arise out of both European and national legislation.
It is incumbent on the Member States, however, to devise and implement programmes to simplify administrative actions and provide more systematic assessment of the social and economic effects of implementing Community legislation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I did not think I was going to get to make this speech, I thought I would have to send it to you later, but I very much wanted to participate on behalf of my group.
Clearly, these are four very important reports that we have been discussing on better law-making.
Although it is rare, I have to say that I have some sympathy with our colleagues from the right of the House when they say that four reports on better law-making is a bit of a blockbuster, is it not?
Could we not perhaps have had one clear, simple report?
I would like to concentrate my remarks on the issue of soft law and Mr Medina Ortega's report.
Soft law is a worry.
It can be a very useful process to use soft law but it can also lead to fuzziness, unclarity and difficulties.
Mr Medina Ortega tries to be very clear in his report and I applaud that, but there will always be a wish amongst legislators to use, as it were, alternative regulatory methods other than black letter law.
We have to admit that the state cannot do everything, but if we admit that, we also have to be very clear about the dangers of using soft law.
First of all, soft law, as many of my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs have already said, has a propensity to bypass the legislator, to bypass Parliament, to bypass democracy - and that is entirely unacceptable.
We have to be aware of this danger and make sure that it does not happen.
We have seen one very clear example with a very important project to do with European contract law, which absolutely should be discussed and discussed politically, but because of the way in which it was dealt with it came before us as a soft law instrument.
There is also a further difficulty when we use soft or alternative methods to do with justice and access to justice.
If we use alternative methods - we often talk about alternative dispute resolution systems at European level - these, again, are not backed by a state structure.
A constituent of mine recently returned from a holiday in another EU country.
He had lost out on car rental and was forced to use an alternative system, and the car hire company would not participate.
That is when soft systems not backed by black letter law fail our citizens and do not deliver justice.
If we want an EU that delivers justice both in the law we make and the way it is accessible through the courts, we have to be very careful about soft law and make sure that it is still backed in some way by the state.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful for the broad consensus which has emerged in this debate, but I would like to clarify a few points.
First of all, better regulation is not the same as deregulation.
I must refute that very firmly.
This is not a Deregulation Commission: as I have said, European integration is based on the law, not on the abolition of law.
Better regulation is precisely what the name says: it aims to improve regulation, and to make it more modern, simpler, more transparent and above all more responsive to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We often subject them to the same burdens as major corporations, and that is unfair.
In particular, I would like to confirm what Mrs Frassoni has said: it is not about lowering standards.
If you look at the many initiatives proposed by the Commission so far, you will see that there is not a single case in which the Commission has proposed lowering a standard or weakening the level of European integration that has been achieved.
The aim is only ever to achieve the objectives which you - the European Parliament - regard as politically necessary, but to do so by simpler, more up-to-date and cheaper means.
I would like to make that very clear.
There seems to be a great deal of confusion surrounding the statistics.
I am really quite surprised.
Let me try and clarify.
As regards simplification, this is an ongoing programme which is being constantly enhanced.
The Commission is currently working on 143 simplification initiatives of which around half have already been adopted; 67 initiatives have already been adopted.
These initiatives naturally cover a large number of basic acts with subsequent regulation.
So if we say that we have 143 simplification initiatives, this means that several thousand acts are affected.
Here, the aim is what I have described: to review the existing legislation and determine whether it is still appropriate for today.
It is quite clear, after all, that after around 50 years of European integration, this has to be done.
On the issue of costs, it is a rather different matter.
Mr Helmer's frequent repetition of his assertions does not make them correct.
I assume that he is not here, but I would like to make that clear once and for all.
Administrative burdens for companies are defined as costs incurred by European companies as a result of their record-keeping, and statistical and information obligations, and as a result of European, national or regional legislation.
They amount to 3.5% of Europe's gross national product in total, although this covers all three levels: European, national and regional.
We already have a breakdown of where these costs arise: around 35% of them are directly attributable to European legislation, 15% come from the transposition of European legislation into national law, and the rest - 50% - arise purely at national level.
It is of course quite incorrect to assert, as Mr Helmer does, that the EU costs the economy EUR 350 billion and the internal market does not bring that many benefits, so the cost of EU regulation exceeds the benefits of the single market.
With respect, that is sleight of hand and is targeted at people's ignorance; it ignores the fact, for example, that if we did not have EU law, we would still have national law, even in the United Kingdom, and indeed in particularly large quantities, as we know.
It would certainly be more expensive.
Let me give you one example of how much scope for massive simplification and savings potential is afforded by European legislation.
In Europe we had 1 400 different pieces of technical legislation on wireless systems in 27 countries.
That means that a company in the United Kingdom which produced specific wireless systems had to be familiar with 1 400 items of national legislation.
In line with the Commission's proposal, this Parliament adopted legislation which simplified these 1 400 provisions and turned them into one single item of legislation.
You could work out the precise savings that this entailed for companies, but the overall message is clear.
The 25% reduction is absolutely achievable.
With the proposal, we have supplied you with the 10 fast-track actions to show you that, technically speaking, it is fairly straightforward.
All you have to do is look through the existing regulations to see which statistical, information and record-keeping obligations exist and whether we actually still need them to this extent, based on current practice.
In many cases, we find that they are not needed at all to the same extent, or that modern information and communications technologies are making it all very much easier.
We will achieve this 25%, and this will lead to a productivity gain for the European economy of 1.5% of GNP.
This naturally has a macroeconomic dimension, for there are not many economic programmes in the European Union which have a positive economic effect of 1.5%.
I would just like to say in passing that if everything goes well, we will also achieve a very high growth effect if the new transatlantic cooperation - removal of trade barriers in transatlantic trade - is brought to a successful conclusion.
We felt that it was important to provide you with this clarification so that we know what we are talking about.
I underscore everything that has been said here in regard to impact assessment.
This is the be-all and end-all and the Commission's rule is this: no new proposal without a comprehensive impact assessment, and no new proposal without an impact assessment which has been scrutinised by the Impact Assessment Board.
If this rule is occasionally infringed, the European Parliament has the absolute right, in my view - indeed, if not a duty - to draw critical attention to it.
Without impact assessment, the legislator is not in a position to assess the practical outcomes of its action.
Even if an impact assessment reveals that a new proposal will entail costs for the economy or for citizens, this does not necessarily mean that the measure will be shelved, for there are some things which are more important than costs.
When it is a matter of protecting our environment, combating climate change, reducing our dependency on fossil fuels or promoting the health of our citizens, it is not about costs.
In such cases, we have to do what is necessary.
Nonetheless, the Commission feels obliged to fully inform Parliament about the social, environmental and economic consequences of any new proposal.
That is why impact assessment is so important.
We will look very carefully at the proposals which have been made here.
The most important point which has been made several times in this debate is something which I fully endorse: all this can only be successful if it is a community project.
It will not succeed if we view it as a conflict between the institutions.
It will only work if all three institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - jointly support it and make it their priority.
That is the only way for this endeavour to succeed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
EURES activity report 2004-2005: Towards a single European labour market (debate)
The next item is the oral question (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=OQ&reference=O-2007-0038&language=PL" - B6-0136/2007) to the Commission by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the EURES activity report 2005-2005: Towards a single European labour market.
author. - (SV) Mr President, earlier we talked about the importance of mobility for growth and employment in Europe.
Then we were talking about mobility for workers who undertake further training, look for new jobs in their own country, change professions through further training and about geographical mobility within countries, but also cross-border geographical mobility.
If we look round Europe we can see that it is important for growth.
Some of the countries that have the highest mobility also have the highest growth and employment in Europe.
This is very important.
What is the situation in Europe?
Well, the situation differs quite considerably from one country to the next, but at the same time we can see improvements.
We have seen improvements in recent years.
I come from a border region between two Scandinavian countries where mobility was not very extensive to begin with, but it has increased sharply in recent years.
It is important for growth and employment that people on one side of a national border can move over to the other side of the border.
Perhaps they could not find a job at first but found work on the other side of the border.
This increases growth in the entire region and is good in the long term.
We also have many obstacles.
I have seen this in this work.
There are obstacles in different social security systems, taxes and so forth, and in the lack of information.
As regards information on this subject, we have our cooperation on employment services, the EURES cooperation.
EURES cooperation has developed in recent years.
Partly with the special limits, but perhaps above all through its portal, which individual citizens can access to find information on what jobs are available, but also on the social security situation.
What is the situation as far as taxes are concerned?
What do I need to do if I am going to cross a border?
In the most recent budget in the European Parliament we pushed through an increase of EUR 2 million for EURES cooperation.
That is why we are tabling the oral question and the resolution.
We can see a number of needs that exist with a view to increasing mobility further.
In our oral question we focus on nationals from third countries.
It looks to the future.
We know that Europe needs more workers, not least nationals from third countries.
They already exist and we should increase cooperation - in particular with neighbouring countries that we have neighbourhood cooperation with - and create greater opportunities for them to obtain relevant information on the employment situation, social security schemes and taxes.
The second part relates to seasonal workers.
There have been seasonal workers in the Union for a long time and seasonal workers also need better information on the situation, social benefits, and the rules that apply.
This can be obtained from the EURES portal.
Lastly, I would also like to raise the question of whether the Commission has ideas about improving mobility in other respects.
We had a big discussion on transitional rules and mobility between new Member States and old Member States.
There are still a number of countries in the EU that are applying the transitional rules.
I hope that this period will be as short as possible and that we will soon be able fully to apply free mobility so that all the transitional provisions disappear.
It is also important for us to try to look around and see what the situation will be in the event of greater mobility for the countries that have not applied any transitional rules because mobility is not particularly extensive.
It is not extensive and there are probably reasons in general to improve information.
If hopefully the transitional provisions now disappear, we must also improve information for individual workers on job vacancies and on what is needed, what must be contributed in terms of social security, taxes and so forth.
These are the questions we have put to the Commission.
I know that the Commission has the same aims as the European Parliament, but what is the Commission planning to do?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before answering each of the questions you have asked, I would like to remind you what the EURES system is.
It is a system, a unique system, whose great advantage lies in combining a network comprising over 800 qualified advisers with an efficient portal, facilitating easy data access and interactive data exchange.
Since 2006 the EURES portal has offered easy access to all of the job offers in the European Union as well as to the national public employment services in the countries belonging to the European Economic Area in 25 European languages.
On average the portal offers access to more than 1 200 000 offers.
At the same time the EURES advisers are on hand to help workers and their families who are planning to make use of the opportunities that mobility offers.
I would now like to answer your questions one by one.
I will start with your first question concerning the possible expansion of EURES to third-country nationals.
As you know, EURES was originally introduced to benefit the citizens of the European Economic Area by helping them to find work outside their own countries and thus increase mobility.
At present the Commission is planning to make the EURES system accessible to workers from other countries as well: this will not only meet their expectations but also benefit the Union.
In view of the ageing population and demographic decrease in Europe we must be ready for shortages in the European workforce in the near future, which will affect key sectors of our economy and our lifestyle.
Apart from that, the EURES system could also contribute to a more global solution to the problem of migration from third countries.
As a result, a new direction was added to the general EURES principles for the period 2007-2010, which provide for the possibility of widening the scope of information offered through the EURES network to cater for the needs of workers from third countries.
Following the Commission's action plan on legal migration we now want to analyse in detail the possibilities of expanding the EURES system in that direction.
In the initial phase we could consider supplementing the existing sections providing information on 'Living and working conditions' with information tailored to the needs of citizens from third countries who want to enter the European market, and provide that information in the languages of those countries as well.
Your second question concerns the inclusion of seasonal and short-term temporary job offers in the EURES system.
It is true that the initial analyses that were carried out for the EURES system did not indicate the need and level of demand for short-term work abroad.
The statistics at our disposal covered only the minimum span of one year and the demand for seasonal work or work experience and study placements was not taken into account.
However, following the recommendation of the European Parliament on the increase of the EURES budget for 2007, research was carried out within the system to determine the need for, and feasibility of, introducing such a service.
The reaction of a number of countries was very positive.
Some partners had already experienced this type of service in the areas of tourism, building and agriculture.
In future, when plans for further development of the EURES system are being developed, the possibility of extending this service will be automatically considered.
As far as your third question is concerned, the Commission also believes that both professional and geographical mobility can play a positive role in improving how the European labour market works, and therefore it is important to support and enhance that mobility.
To that end, the Commission is developing an action plan based on the results of the European Year of Workers' Mobility 2006, which aims to increase mobility within the European labour market and do away with the main obstacles to its further development.
This action plan will recommend reinforcing the role of EURES, making it the main instrument for supporting worker mobility throughout the European Union and increasing awareness of it.
It will have three main objectives:
1. enhancing the strategic dimension of EURES by reinforcing its analytical potential as regards mobility flows and changes in the European labour market;
2. enhancing the quality of its services by offering mobile workers and their families a more comprehensive service;
3. increasing its operational coverage by reinforcing its relations with other providers of similar services - or with the private sector - and gradually opening up its activities to workers from other parts of the world, as I already explained in my answer to your first question.
Your fourth and final question concerns the EURES cross-border projects and their role in helping the Member States to do away with temporary measures.
Dealing with the specific problems that arise in cross-border relations has always been an important priority for EURES.
We now have as many as 20 cross-border cooperation projects, the latest being the projects between the Czech Republic and Germany and between Slovakia and Hungary.
Apart from that, 14 feasibility studies are being conducted at the moment with a view to identifying new projects and services, be they between the 'new' Member States or between the 'old' and the 'new' Member States.
However, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come to abandon the idea of 'old' and 'new' states: in a certain sense Spain is undoubtedly a new state, and so is Greece, and I could go on.
I wonder how much longer we are going to use this kind of classification for equal Member States of the European Union.
In any case, 14 feasibility studies are being carried out with a view to identifying new projects.
These are all practical projects designed to facilitate citizens - employers and cross-border workers - in their everyday lives.
The partners could consist of trade unions, employers organisations, public employment services or any other participants working at a local or regional level.
Through these projects we hope to facilitate the exchange of workers between the partner states and encourage them to take the necessary steps concerning temporary measures.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by pointing out another important aspect of the EURES work, and that is limiting the possibility of social dumping.
It is obvious that people who are well informed when they arrive in another country are in a much stronger position than those who lack that information.
In this regard, too, EURES is a unique and very efficient tool.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, may I start by saying that I agree substantially with the comments from my colleague, Mr Andersson, on the opposite side of the House, but I would ask that this would not be regarded as a precedent for future occasions.
It is worth recording that there was substantial support for this resolution in committee.
We, as a group, are not tabling any amendments to this resolution and I hope that colleagues from all political parties and all nationalities will support something that is worthy of support, which is the principle that the EU is about people and about providing more opportunities for more people, and EURES has a particular role to play in fulfilling this concept.
However, I have two subsidiary questions which the Commissioner could either answer in his follow-up remarks or by letter.
They are two small points, but hopefully not insignificant.
One concerns the actual use of the portal.
If you key in 'job mobility in Europe' you go straight to the EURES portal, which is a very good portal and easy to navigate.
However, in order to get there you must have the key works 'job mobility'.
If you simply key in 'jobs in Europe', you get a whole list of other portals, such as Eurojobs, Jobpilot, Topjobs, Careers in Europe, etc. They may be very worthy, but the key is to connect into EURES.
Therefore, my question is: can anything more be done to make certain that the EURES portal is more widely available to those individuals who do not necessarily go through job search centres, but just want to access the net themselves.
My second point is that I see that one of the aspects of EURES - which I also applaud - is the subportal about life-long learning and there is a portal within that called PLOTEUS.
I was intrigued to hear about PLOTEUS because this, for the benefit of colleagues who may, like me, have been ignorant until today, is the portal on learning opportunities throughout space.
Wow, this is really a big endeavour, not just in Europe but throughout space!
I was looking at this because, whilst a lot of the mobility issues are to do with giving opportunities to our friends and colleagues in Eastern and Central Europe to move west, I also believe more attention should be paid to opportunities from the west to move to Eastern and Central Europe.
One of the blockages - and I speak clearly as an Englishman - is language learning and adaptability to languages, and anything that the PLOTEUS project can do to encourage language learning is, and I hope the Commissioner will agree, a very important part of job mobility.
What I am saying in both these points about PLOTEUS and access to the net is: by all means think about opportunities in space, but bring this portal down to earth so that it connects with real people on more occasions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, EURES has tremendous potential, but much of that potential has yet to be realised.
It still has a number of limitations.
Our question says that the portal should become a one-stop-shop for workers' geographic and occupational mobility, but we should be honest in accepting that it has a long way to go before it could become such a thing.
It should, however, be possible to build such a one-stop-shop in this advanced electronic age.
Workers planning a move across the EU in pursuit of work need access to detailed and localised knowledge to give them the confidence to move with their families - detailed information right down to the level, for example, of schools to be found in a particular locality, the performance of those schools, student numbers and vacancies.
The same applies to healthcare, housing and a host of other issues.
The portal includes information under these headings, but it is of a very general nature and gives only a brief national snapshot.
It might seem like a huge task to build detailed and localised information into the portal, but that is not necessarily the case.
A lot of this detailed information already exists on the websites of local authorities, health authorities, local education authorities and government departments.
Web links to these sites can be embedded in the portal to take users requiring more detailed information to those sites.
Increasingly, information being made available at local level is also held in a range of languages.
In my own area, for example, we have everything from information on how to register to vote to finding accommodation available in Polish and a range of other languages.
Finally, that information is often held in a range of languages of third countries, which ties in with the point addressed by the Commissioner.
Inward migration from third countries cannot solve the difficulties demographic change poses for the EU, but it can help.
I have therefore been pleased to hear what he said about the plans to equip EURES to play an important part in that process.
Free movement of workers is one of the four conditions essential for the existence and successful functioning of the EU Single Market.
The single labour market, which is not yet developed, would enable jobseekers to gain new skills and experience and would provide them with an opportunity to choose a job and realise their skills, and employers would be able to choose from a larger number of employees in order to secure the specialists required.
The EURES (European Employment Services) network is an instrument aimed at creating a single labour market by facilitating the movement of workers in the EU, the countries of the European Economic Area and Switzerland (I will not mention third countries here).
National employment services, trade unions, employers' organisations and regional and local authorities cooperate in the network.
Their activity is coordinated by the European Commission.
The role of the EURES network is to inform, advise and assist potentially mobile workers on opportunities to work abroad and on the living, working and studying conditions in the countries of the European Economic Area and to help employers wishing to recruit workers from other countries.
The EURES portal was launched in 2006 and offers one million job vacancies across Europe.
To date, 8 000 employers and 184 000 jobseekers have registered on the portal.
Although the right of free movement while seeking to live and work abroad is one of the basic rights of European citizens established in the Treaty of Rome, many of the old Member States still apply transitional periods for the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.
Germany is planning to extend the transitional period for opening the labour market until 2011 owing to the high level of unemployment in the country.
Some sources of information state that we are facing a shortage of labour in the EU but others report a high level of unemployment.
There are one million job vacancies on the EURES portal, but at the same time free movement of labour is restricted.
How effective is EURES?
I will give the example of my country, Lithuania.
According to official statistics, 34 000 workers left Lithuania within four years, but only 405 did so within two and a half years with the assistance of EURES services.
The media often present staggering information about the slavery of migrants in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, where workers from the new countries encounter inhuman working and living conditions.
Is this not a shortcoming of the EURES system?
People do not receive sufficient information about working and living conditions and do not know where to turn when they encounter problems.
Activities in 2006 indicated that new obstacles to the free movement of labour have emerged; these are practical problems, accommodation, language, employment for a partner or spouse and psychological difficulties while adapting to a new country and planning to return home.
It is gratifying that that the Commission will start implementing an action plan for mobility in 2007, which will help to solve the problems that have arisen.
An information system on geographic and professional mobility based on the one-stop-shop principle would also contribute to this.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I promise that unlike Mr Bushill-Matthews, the previous speaker, I shall not speak about cyberspace and the opportunities that navigating around it could open up for the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe.
The draft resolution is full of praise for EURES, the European Employment Service.
We should be aware, however, that for some observers EURES is an example of overgrown European bureaucracy.
As my fellow Member from Lithuania pointed out just now, barely 8% of Lithuanians who went abroad to work used the instruments offered by EURES.
This amounts to very few indeed.
Perhaps this is not actually a case of overgrown bureaucracy, but the matter would be much more straightforward if the European labour market were eventually fully liberalised.
Europeans would then be able to go job-hunting in the normal manner, and would not necessarily use EURES.
Of course all methods should be supported, including official information about vacant jobs for seasonal or temporary workers.
This should concern citizens of the Member States of the Union in the first instance.
Citizens of third countries should come second, including nationals of countries working with the Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Two years and two months ago, as we adopted the guidelines on employment policy in the Member States we emphasised the need to remove all obstacles to the free movement of workers in Europe as envisaged by the Treaties.
It is unfortunate that Germany, Austria and certain other Member States failed to heed that appeal and still retain barriers preventing access to the labour market.
This is contrary to the fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based, as my fellow Member stated.
Free access will eventually come about, but much time will have been wasted in the interim.
We should discuss general solutions hic et nunc, not half-measures.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my fellow Members are absolutely correct to say that EURES is creating a European success story.
Without the EURES network, geographical and occupational mobility in Europe would not be possible to the extent that it is today and would not be available to workers who know their rights and are therefore able to exercise them.
The European Union's fourth freedom would only exist on paper if EURES did not exist.
Therefore, I do not understand, Commissioner, why you are not showing more commitment in order to improve EURES, in other words, creating more centres and improving quality, e.g. through best practice models in the border regions.
Really, they should be shooting out of the ground like mushrooms in order to pursue your objectives in the European Year of Workers' Mobility and increase geographical mobility in Europe.
More commitment really is needed here.
Regions affected by a shortage of skilled workers would benefit particularly if mobility were made easier in Europe.
However, it is of course the Member States, first and foremost - and the Council is notable for its absence here yet again - which are applying the brakes.
Mutual recognition of social security systems still has a very long way to go before it achieves the level which would enable workers to take up employment in another Member State without forfeiting some of their social security.
It is even more difficult for workers in Member States - such as my own country - which still insist on restricting mobility for a transitional period.
In these countries, mobility takes place in illegal and fragile employment conditions; the black market determines wages and security.
However, the battle against social dumping can only take place on the basis of legal mobility.
For that reason, I am mystified as to why governments such as Germany's on the one hand make the shortage of skilled workers a hot topic, but on the other, do not have the courage to allow people from the Eastern Europe countries to exercise their freedom of movement, thereby also defusing finally the sometimes absurd situation at the borders.
I also appeal to the social partners to do more for mobility in the various countries and to impose public controls to bring to light the black sheep and stop them from profiting from social dumping.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Europe comprises a widely diverse geography, terrain and climate, giving rise to a wide variety of lifestyles and economies.
In particular, there has always been a variety of working practices, and labour laws have developed differently.
Different people work in different ways.
Variety is the spice of life.
You tamper with this at your peril, for it is at the heart of full employment and of labour laws.
The Employment Committee is properly known as the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and surely the greatest social benefit of all both for the individual and for society is for people to have jobs.
In April 2005, Germany had 10% unemployment, while the UK figure was 4.5%, but then the UK has taken less of the EU's labour laws.
Many Eastern European countries have high unemployment rates.
They have made progress, they have improved somewhat, but the last thing they want is to exchange the Soviet command economy run by the unelected commissars for the centralised rulings of the unelected EU Commissioners.
Europe does not need the EU to impose a common set of labour laws on all.
A straitjacket like that can only result in rising unemployment, leading to the kind of social unrest we have seen before.
I hope none of us wants to see that again.
(HU) There has been much talk about growth in geographic and occupational mobility within the Union as a key factor in reducing unemployment and increasing economic competitiveness.
The 27-Member Union has a very large labour reserve, yet because of the unequal regional division of jobs available it cannot provide employment opportunities for a significant proportion of career-starters and employees over the age of 50.
As a result the acceleration of the inward migration of workers arriving in several Member States from third countries, even though there is a suitable and skilled workforce available within the Union, is now an urgent issue.
The EURES network plays an outstanding role in the relationship between supply and demand but it is unfortunate that it has not, even yet, been given the appropriate support from the EU resources available for development purposes.
It is very clear: I have heard that there are 700 EURES advisors, while Mr Å pidla mentioned 800 - if we consider this number in relation to 20 million citizens unable to find a job in the 27 Member States, then this is obviously a trifling figure in comparison.
Only 25-26 advisors per country, a mere drop in the ocean, and in no way sufficient for the task in hand.
Another issue I see as problematical is that while information on job-seekers is accessible on the portal, there is much less information on companies providing job opportunities.
There is a total of 11 000 companies represented on EURES, according to the latest information.
There needs to be a much bigger information campaign if the economic players are to be more involved than at present.
I feel that the development of the EURES network and portal and the stimulus for it is a common European interest and so I would urge that the proposals be adopted.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the EURES programme is very important and is working well, but it needs to be improved.
I want to deal with a specific issue relating to mobility, which we all agree is necessary and is good for Europe.
The problem I refer to specifically is that of EU citizens who come to Ireland and have a spouse who is not originally from an EU country.
In the last number of weeks, the Irish Government has issued deportation orders for 120 such spouses.
I know that many more have been informed by the Irish authorities that their application for residency has been suspended pending the outcome of a court case, which is not likely to happen until 2009.
This is clearly an obstacle to mobility in Europe for those European Union citizens who want to move to Ireland to take up the work that is available there, and who find they are restricted because they are married to non-EU citizens.
It seems to me that this is unfair to those who might want to move, but it is doubly unfair to those who have already moved and are living - in some cases for a long time - in Ireland with their spouses and who are now being deported. I would urge the Commissioner to make contact as a matter of urgency with the Irish Minister and urge him to withdraw the deportation orders and to allocate interim residency to the families concerned and to end the uncertainty that they currently face with regard to their future.
If we are serious about mobility in Europe, then these kinds of issues should not arise.
I am convinced that the current Irish law that is operating in this regard is in breach of the European Union Directive of 2004 on mobility and on residency and also in breach of European Union anti-discrimination laws, because this is being applied only to the spouses of non-Irish EU citizens.
These are two serious issues, and I would urge the Commissioner to make immediate and urgent representations to the Irish authorities, specifically Minister Brian Lenihan, to have this matter resolved without delay.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to two issues in the course of this debate.
Firstly, it is necessary to fully implement one of the fundamental freedoms underpinning the European single market, namely free movement of the labour force.
In the case of workers from the new Member States, this freedom is being severely restricted, for instance by Germany and Austria.
Clearly, this situation is detrimental to the mobility of workers across the territory of the European Union.
Secondly, strong support is needed, especially for new Member States, in order to bring about an increase in the employment rates in those countries.
For example, in my country, Poland, the rate is 51% for men and barely 46% for women.
By way of comparison, in the United States and the Scandinavian countries, for example, these indicators already exceed 70%.
Mr President, I think there is widespread understanding of the importance of increased mobility and all the experiences are extremely good regarding workers, researchers - you can look everywhere.
The success is very much in the mobility and European cooperation and we know it is important for the quality of employment, for the efficiency of labour markets, we know it is truly a European idea and we also know it is of utmost importance for the opportunities of the individual.
But, having said that, we are still facing a number of obstacles.
It is important to support EURES and to ensure that it can do a good job.
But at the same time we must ensure that the obstacles, for example the transition rules, are removed as soon as possible, because it is a paradox that one side tries to increase mobility and the other side accepts that mobility is hindered.
The second thing that I think is important to say in this respect is that even when we remove these obstacles we still have too little mobility.
That goes for our domestic labour market as well as across borders.
I think that EURES could be used not only in order to inform and improve the security for those who would like to move to another country and another labour market, as Mr Andersson pointed out here earlier today, but it could also be used in order to inform all the decision-making institutions of the remaining obstacles we have in the European labour markets because the gap between vision and theory on the one hand and the reality is quite big.
And I think EURES could have an information role in two ways: to those who are trying to move to other labour markets but also to all of us and the Member States in order to make it much easier in reality to move.
That is the challenge that we could discuss further here tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the debate has clearly shown that EURES is a good tool, which has a function and is useful: it genuinely contributes to the free movement of the labour force, helping mobility, helping people to find out about the labour market across the European Union and find out about their rights.
On the other hand, and this was also highlighted in the debate, we have not reached any perfect or definitive situation and it is necessary to continue to develop EURES further.
There were some issues raised in the debate that I will not comment on individually at this time because they are of a very specific and organisational nature, and I believe that each and every one of them is worthy of an expert assessment as to its merit.
What emerges clearly from the debate is the fact that the Commission's general idea of developing this portal and the European Parliament's general vision of the purpose and development of this portal are more or less identical and afford us the opportunity of truly efficient and beneficial long-term cooperation and mutual inspiration.
I would also like to point out that there were many ideas voiced here that went beyond the scope of this parliamentary question, for example the issue of national legislation, but these are questions that I have certainly noted and I will give them further consideration.

The Single Market Review (debate)
The next item is the report by Jacques Toubon, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Single Market Review: tackling barriers and inefficiencies through better implementation and enforcement.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an own-initiative report suggested by our political group which, after several months' work, is supported by a very large majority in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I must welcome that very wide support, because if it is confirmed by Parliament in plenary we shall be able to participate fully in the work currently being done by the Commission on drawing up a communication for next autumn on internal market strategy for the twenty-first century, and to influence that work to the full.
The internal market has been the main achievement of the European Union in over 50 years.
It is at the heart of European integration and now the Lisbon Strategy.
It is, however, a constantly evolving process and we need above all to approach it from a political standpoint. That is, in my opinion, the most original feature of the report I am submitting to you.
Europe is going through a very unsettled period and it is important to realise that the internal market cannot be developed if it continues to face widespread scepticism and indeed hostility from the public, who often see the internal market and competition policy as the root causes of many of the social problems our citizens are experiencing.
Any internal market strategy must therefore be aimed at turning that lack of belief and that hostility into confidence in the internal market, partly by drawing attention to its benefits and partly by, at the same time, pursuing the aims of openness and competition and of social cohesion with its various components: the environment, employment, culture, access for the vulnerable.
In our report we have tried to strike that balance and I think that the reason it has received such wide support is that it has largely succeeded.
That is the main recommendation we want to make to the Commission: the internal market cannot be extended and developed if our fellow citizens do not support the policy.
So we have suggested three approaches: restoring confidence, reducing burdens and, finally, placing our internal market policy in an international context.
That is why we have placed an emphasis on all the aspects, such as the environment and consumer protection, that affect the quality of life of our fellow citizens.
We have asked that the national parliaments should be more closely involved in our work in that respect, that they should have a better understanding of the advantages of the single market.
An important amendment that I have drawn up, which will, I think, meet with general approval, is the revised Amendment 12.
In that amendment, which is based on the European Council decisions of 21 June on the mandate given to the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to including a paragraph on public services in the new amending Treaty, we call upon the Commission to clarify the position of the public services, SGIs and SGEIs, because we believe that those services play a very important part in a successful internal market that enjoys public support.
We already realised that when we were discussing the directive on the internal market in services.
We have also placed a great deal of emphasis on SMEs and on vulnerable persons, especially the disabled.
As regards the development of the right to consumption, we note that there is very little cross-border consumption, around 6%, which is obviously too little.
We are naturally including energy policy and action against global warming in the internal market policies, as well as the opening up of network industries.
One of the main - and controversial - proposals is to incorporate an Internal Market Test in any new legislation.
That was all I wanted to say in my brief speech.
If we are successful in combining the inherent strength of the internal market and the commitment of producers and consumers to this policy, I think that will be a real boost for prosperity, employment and preservation of the European social model and will, at the same time, give Europe a strong economic position in the world.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it is my task to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and for once, if I may say so, with pleasure. The draftsman we had selected decided not to submit this report in his own name, because he did not agree with the fact that, as a result of the vote in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , emphasis was laid on the tax conditions for a harmonious internal market.
To put it plainly, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee considers that, in order for an internal market to work harmoniously, certain initiatives are needed from the Commission to prevent tax distortions.
I can only endorse the view expressed by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
There are two other points that I think should be emphasised today.
The first is the operation of competition policy.
Recent events, especially those involving rating agencies, have again shown us, if we needed to be shown, that a single market needs a strict competition policy applicable to all sectors of the market.
The other aspect, which the rapporteur has mentioned, is the international dimension and the ability of the European Union, in the operation of its internal market, to make it a vehicle for international standardisation.
That is even truer nowadays in the financial markets and I hope that, in that case too, the Commission will be able to take the initiative in proposing the international standardisation we need in order to make progress on supervision.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, since the Commission published its interim report in February, we have had some very productive discussions on the single market review.
Now the work moves into top gear, with the Commission expecting to publish to its conclusions in November.
I would like to thank the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, particularly the rapporteur Jacques Toubon, for assembling an impressive package of recommendations and proposals.
I would like to thank members of Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their clear and constructive contribution to the report.
The Commission is also grateful to the political groups, which have been closely engaged, and produced policy papers of high quality.
As with all good reports, I also note that on some issues there are differences of opinion or emphasis.
Let us briefly consider what is at stake.
The single market is home to 500 million citizens and over 20 million businesses.
Since its inception in 1992 the single market has raised Europe's output by over 2% and created nearly three million new jobs.
Europe's prosperity and its external influence are great achievements.
To sustain these we must keep moving the single market forward.
It would be a mistake to take any of this for granted.
We must maintain Europe's competitive edge for Europe's businesses and especially for its citizens.
We cannot sustain a Europe which provides high-quality public services in health, education and social care without an economy which is fundamentally sound.
So at this point let me spell out our central theme: the need for all of us - the Commission, Parliament and the Member States - to show leadership and courage in our reforms.
The review of the single market is an essential part of the efforts of this Commission to deliver a Europe of tangible results and deliver its 'citizens' agenda'.
Big challenges remain in the single market.
Let me give some examples.
On postal services we are moving towards a final package for full market opening.
In the field of energy policy, Commissioner Piebalgs will shortly present proposals to build a single European energy market.
Commissioner Kuneva is leading a wide-ranging review of Europe's consumer protection laws.
We are working with you and the Member States to create a framework for a European patent.
Piece by piece each single market reform matters, but taken in the round their importance is even greater.
The single market of today - this vast, dynamic, open market - is the product of all these difficult reforms, all these difficult decisions we have made.
In short, the continued success of the single market - its potential to improve the living standards and social conditions of all Europe's citizens - requires us to show leadership and courage not just in setting a vision of the future, but in making the very real, and often difficult, policy choices facing us today.
But let me return to the review itself and pick out a few highlights: first, on how we work - how we deliver single market policy - and, second, on our shared policy priorities.
In terms of how we work, we all know - and your draft report makes this clear - that we must strengthen partnership and ownership.
So Parliament's call for stronger networks of cooperation is music to my ears.
The single market is a joint undertaking and we must work together to deliver it, always conscious of the needs of citizens.
This means building on successful projects such as SOLVIT and offering citizens better assistance in solving the cross-border problems that they encounter.
It also means pressing ahead with new tools such as the Internal Market Information System to strengthen cooperation between the Member States.
I firmly believe - as you do - that close partnerships will be the key to our success.
Let me welcome an interesting suggestion in your report - the idea of an 'internal market test' for all new measures.
This is an element that is strongly present in our 'better regulation' mechanisms, the importance of which cannot but be underlined.
If we find that new proposals will actually hinder the flow of people, goods, services and capital - and thereby jeopardise the single market - then we must acknowledge this and ask whether we need to change course, before anyone gets hurt!
Now let me move on to our shared policy priorities for the single market.
In its interim report to the Spring European Council, the Commission highlighted a number of directions for the future single market.
Let me choose examples among the areas which I know best.
Your report rightly points to retail financial services as an area where the single market can go further.
I believe Europe can help citizens to get a better deal across the board: in mortgages, insurance, payment cards, bank accounts and elsewhere.
On 19 September, the Commission will host a hearing in Brussels to find out more about the priorities of all stakeholders.
I invite all of you who are interested to attend.
Let me also introduce a new issue to the debate, and one which should feature in the Single Market Review, which is e-government.
All Member States are delivering more services electronically, reducing costs and making them easier for citizens to access.
But while this creates opportunities, there are challenges we need to confront.
Let me give a couple of examples.
Firstly, on e-procurement.
We must ensure that national authorities, in adopting technologies and security standards, do not create purely national e-procurement markets.
Similarly, in preparing for the implementation of the Services Directive, Member States must have common systems so as to be able to exchange information securely.
A final word on the international dimension, which, I was delighted to see, is prominent in your report.
This Commission is committed to maximising Europe's global influence and building strong ties.
So, as well as broadening and deepening our dialogues with the United States and Japan, we are also holding summits with China, India, Russia and Brazil.
These global dialogues allow us to learn more about our partners, to advocate our values and standards and to resolve issues of bilateral interest and create new commercial opportunities for Europe's firms.
In short, the external dimension is a vital part of our internal market policy.
So to sum up, I am in the happy position of agreeing with you on the priorities for the Single Market Review - both on how we deliver the single market, and on the policy areas that will most benefit citizens.
And of course I would be delighted to return here once we have adopted the Single Market Review to present our conclusions and discuss with you the way forward.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr Toubon's report this morning, not just on behalf of my group, as coordinator, but also on behalf of my colleague, our Vice-Chairman Mrs Thyssen, who sadly is not able to be with us this morning because she has had to rush back to Belgium, where her parents are not at all well.
I welcome this report on behalf of all the Members of our group.
One of the most important aspects of Mr Toubon's excellent work is the way that he has taken a very all-embracing and very comprehensive view of the single market, as he identified in his speech.
In a real sense, the single market touches the lives of every citizen in the European Union.
The problem is, that single market and its success and its future development are far too often taken for granted.
As Mr Toubon said, it is absolutely right to issue a strong call to all of us and particularly to the Commission in its work on a new strategy to come up with some radical, new ideas and particularly to raise the whole political profile of the single market and its importance to all of us.
It needs the Member States and the Prime Ministers at their summit in March, when they will look at this document, really to take advantage of that.
The second point - and I am pleased that you reinforced this, Commissioner - is the whole global dimension.
It is absolutely clear that a fully functioning single market is a massive competitive advantage for Europe in the global economy.
It is the responsibility of all of us, all colleagues, to maintain that decisive competitive advantage on behalf of all our citizens.
We are only going to achieve that by clear, far-sighted advocacy of the benefits and of the policies to keep moving the single market forward on behalf of all our citizens, as is done so well in this report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PSE Group has just adopted an important contribution on revision of the internal market.
I shall be pleased to let Commissioner McCreevy have a copy later on.
We see the internal market as the greatest economic achievement of the Union, together with the euro, but, unlike the Commissioner, we are not market fanatics.
The market has been the natural place for trade between human beings since they moved on from the gatherer stage.
The market is useful, it even has its virtues, but it is not in itself a model for society.
The market economy is fine, as long as we do not end up with a society where everything is for sale, where human needs like education, culture, social welfare and health are entirely dependent on market forces.
What we are advocating is a social market economy in which the necessary competition is still subject to rules, consumers are protected and efficient public services make up for the shortcomings of the market.
In the United States, the health sector accounts for over 15% of GDP, twice the European average, but 44 million American workers do not have health insurance.
To avoid two-speed healthcare in Europe, we would like to see European support for health services.
We urge the Commission finally to comply with the request by the European Councils in Nice, Laeken and Barcelona and to put forward proposals for a Community framework allowing national, regional and local authorities to offer efficient public services with full legal certainty.
We ask the Commission to work to achieve a high level of social protection within the internal market.
Any legislation aimed at completing the single market should be coupled with a study of its impact on employment in the sector concerned.
We want safeguard clauses like the Monti clause, protecting the right to strike and collective agreements.
In our view, maintaining a high degree of social protection requires ambitious directives on working hours and temporary work arrangements.
Social protection is not incompatible with economic efficiency.
Indeed it is the States with the best-organised social dialogue, such as the Scandinavian countries, Germany, the Netherlands and a few others, that have the most successful economies in the European Union.
In short, the PSE Group is in favour of competition that stimulates, cooperation that strengthens and solidarity that unites.
I have just quoted Jacques Delors.
I shall leave it to my colleague, Evelyne Gebhardt, to comment on the Toubon report, which I think I can say is generally positive.
(Applause)
Mr President, I should like to start by commending Mr Toubon on the very fine job he has done.
I think that we have achieved a perfectly reasonable outcome with which we can be very satisfied.
I am also obliged to my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, especially Mr Harbour from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for their constructive cooperation.
We now have a report that, in my opinion, contains a number of sound liberal proposals.
I should like to emphasise first of all the liberalisation of the postal market, which I consider extremely necessary and important, and also the increased competition on the energy market and general improvements in competition policy.
These are all proposals that will safeguard and improve the four fundamental rights of the Single Market.
The objective is clear: we want to see a barrier-free Single Market.
After all, there is a constant need to improve the Single Market and to better equip Europe for globalisation, to make its economy even better and, not least, to ensure that consumers enjoy wider choice, lower prices and higher quality.
After all, that is the essence of the Single Market.
Fortunately, this report has vision, and attention should be paid to that vision.
The report represents a stimulus to the Commission, a contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, a call for Europe to go up a gear if we want to join the top level and withstand competitive pressure from China and the United States in particular.
Therefore, if the Commission wants the best for Europe and its citizens and enterprises, Commissioner McCreevy will take account of this report in the Commission's working process and will follow in Parliament's footsteps.
That way, I am convinced that the Single Market will go from strength to strength, to the benefit of our enterprises, large and small, and also of citizens.
A barrier-free Single Market will generate more jobs and growth, which is a precondition for our ability to fund the European welfare state - and the European public will be the real winners.
It is not only the Commission who must read this report, however. Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel should also study the report very, very carefully.
If we advocate a barrier-free Single Market, we cannot, and should not, accept a situation in which two major countries continue to hinder, not to say undermine, a free energy market.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the first 10 years of the internal market added EUR 877 billion to the EU economy and it helped to create over 2.5 million jobs, so I do not think anybody could argue against the idea that the internal market has definitely worked.
For the next 10 years I believe that ensuring global competition will be vital for Europe.
I cannot, therefore, support the view that a common consolidated corporate tax regime will not hamper EU competitiveness and that is, unfortunately, one of the reasons why, as the rapporteur on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I had my name removed from this report.
I believe that the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which is harmonisation of tax by a different name and through the back door, will undermine competition, inward investment, growth and employment in Europe.
We need competition in tax, not harmonisation.
If we are to make sure that Europe continues to grow and in the future is a dynamic economy globally, then I believe we need competition in this area.
Therefore, I call on the Commission to produce as soon as possible the impact assessment of the CCCTB on the internal market.
I believe that Europe needs to strengthen its efforts in the field of international dialogues on financial markets not just with the US, Japan and China but also with other emerging economies, like India.
In fact, in comparison with other countries, Europe is at a standstill in respect of development and investment in R&D. I believe that the Member States need to encourage greater cooperation between technology-intensive goods and services in order to create markets for knowledge.
Finally, I should like to say once again that what we need in tax is competition, not harmonisation, if Europe is to be a dynamic economy in the future.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation and for the open and transparent manner in which he prepared this report.
It tackles important questions.
Building people's confidence in the internal market is a crucial task and, as well as addressing economic concerns, it will mean taking greater account of environmental and consumer issues.
We had another example of shortcomings in that regard during the summer when Mattel, the world's largest toy manufacturer, had to recall toys for the third time in just under a year.
Members of the public rightly expect a rapid reaction here from the European Union and the European Commission, and we want to see a review of the Toy Safety Directive.
The report addresses the main issues including the role of fiscal policy, and here my position is very different from that of the previous speaker.
I think it is right to flag up the risk of distorting competition if we cannot achieve closer tax harmonisation.
This is another subject on which we are entitled to expect proposals from the Commission.
In our view, there are also problems with the statements on energy policy.
Apart from the fact that the question of separating networks and consumer services is so centrally important - and has not been addressed here - we are sorry to see nuclear energy playing such a major role.
The many unresolved safety questions in relation to nuclear energy, highlighted just this year by accidents at reactors in Germany and Sweden, are completely ignored, as is the continuing failure to tackle the problem of nuclear waste disposal and the fact that subsidiarity remains an issue.
Member States have decided to get out of nuclear energy and I therefore think it is wrong that the European Union should intervene here with financial support.
Deregulation of postal services is another area where we find a lack of balance.
We do not believe that the question of financing a universal service in small Member States and in remote areas has been properly tackled.
Yet access to a universal service is crucial in terms of restoring people's confidence in the internal market.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mr Toubon concedes that 'the citizens of all Member States are having their doubts about the internal market and the other common policies'.
He allows that the EU has not succeeded in overcoming a crisis of confidence.
Then he refers to the very document - now known as the 'Reform Treaty' - which has precipitated this crisis, by saying patronisingly that involving national parliaments will help them better understand the advantages of a single market.
These poor benighted parliaments, by the way, are only the democratically elected sovereign legislators of 27 European nations, unlike this absurd consultative assembly which does not and cannot represent anyone but the Commission and its associated elites.
With that, this report launches into a plan to undermine national responsibility for universal services by changing the definition of universal services and including health services, to take control of intellectual property rights, which we all know will include patents on software, to adjust business taxation without representation, to set up a sort of King Canute's throne on an isotherm in order to grab power and money through carbon trading.
As for small companies, we all know that the EU, its economic partners and the World Trade Organisation will continue to crush them.
Mr Toubon, a crisis of confidence?
Oh yes, oh yes!
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (RO) Mr President, we cannot but welcome an analysis of the evolution of the single market - this major target of the European project - 50 years after its beginnings.
However, it is not certain that significant progress has been made; the project is seriously delayed compared to the proposed schedule.
The situation is regrettable having regard to the fact that this important instrument of solidarity including the four fundamental freedoms (free movement of persons, goods, capitals and services) does not consistently contribute to the achievement of the European project.
Without approaching the issue of building the single market very analytically, I would like to say that the achievement of this target will face some difficulties because of at least three reasons.
The existing gap between the different levels of functionality and efficiency of national markets: theoretically, all economies based on free market relations are functional; practically speaking, market functionality is conditionned by a series of political, economic, social, cultural and, especially, historical factors that give the character of a more or less functional market; this gap has unfavourable effects on the construction of the single market.
The protectionist measures set up by certain states, especially those with a developed economy, do not allow less developed markets to advance and this abuse of economic power significantly reduces their rights to the benefits of the competition effects, which is an essential democratic element of the single market.
Finally, the absence of common legal provisions, especially in the taxation field, has negative effects on the single market project, bearing in mind that heterogeneity in taxation could generate tensions between Member States.
I support the report but I think that to ensure a greater degree of consistency, an analysis should have been carried out of the national markets in the States with less developed economies, especially in new Member States, such as Romania and, following the results, approximation measures to the developed economies should be put in place, as this is a sine qua non condition for the construction of the European single market.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, without any doubt the common market is the cornerstone of the competitiveness of the European Union and of consumer satisfaction.
The report we are debating today states clearly, and in my opinion quite rightly, that this market, of which we can be proud, has been built on the principles of economic competition.
That is why I would like to point out that the single market is now in danger.
The Reform Treaty adopted under the Portuguese Presidency represents this danger.
According to the mandate of the German Presidency, undistorted competition should be completely eliminated from the Union's fundamental goals, which are always crucial in solving possible disputes.
All that is left is the creation of an internal market by the Union.
Economic competition thus disappears into some supplementary protocol that completely lacks the force of the Reform Treaty.
Once the Treaty is adopted, defending the principles of undistorted competition within the Union will be even more difficult than it is today.
This will not enhance either the Union's competitiveness or consumer satisfaction.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, the first thing I must do is to thank the rapporteur, Jacques Toubon, who was also responsible for working out our own position in the EPP-ED Group, in close cooperation with representatives of Member States in northern, southern, eastern and western Europe.
We had a good exchange of views and we are agreed that the positive aspects of the internal market extend well beyond what is in the realm of general public knowledge, and also beyond what has been recognised in certain debates here in Parliament.
We are also agreed that the Commission and its public relations services will have a major role to play in making working people more aware of the market's inherent advantages.
In my view, in the light of the merger between Suez and Gaz de France, the Internal Market Test - which is proposed in this report and which we in the EPP-ED Group support - could very usefully be transposed into national legislation.
It would also be entirely reasonable to ask whether mergers such as this, or other developments at Member State level, might not usefully be subject to a similar test, in order to check their impact on the internal market and to explore whether or not, within that market, they bring advantages for ordinary people.
We also inserted into the report a passage on services of general interest, which undoubtedly now makes sense in the light of the new legal basis created by the Reform Treaty, as already mentioned.
We are agreed, too, that the internal market is Europe's key asset in the process of globalisation.
Only a properly functioning internal market can afford protection against certain developments in international markets.
For we cannot rely solely on monitoring systems, Ms RÃŒhle, relevant though they may have been in relation to some toy manufacturers' recalls: we also need to appeal to the pride and the characteristic quality of our own European manufacturers because we shall never be capable of monitoring everything.
We are keen to see what the Commission will propose in response to this report, in the Single Market Review this autumn, and we hope we shall be in a position to take further decisions about the right course for the internal market on the basis of the report which the Commission adopts at that stage.
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Social Democratic Group, I too would like to thank Mr Toubon for a report which, overall, we can support because it contains a great many positive aspects of particular importance to the members of our Group.
That is as it should be, for what we are talking about here is the future of the internal market; we are talking about answering the questions that people who live in the European Union are asking; and we are talking about confidence in European Union policies.
To Ms Riis-JÃžrgensen, I would say this: it is not good enough to read only those passages of the report that give one particular personal satisfaction; the text needs to be considered in its entirety.
Nowhere does it say that free competition, the internal market and deregulation are the only priorities.
Quite the opposite, in fact, for a great many social democratic aspects have been included.
To take one example, in paragraph 8 we have spelled out the importance of impact assessment, which is particularly relevant in terms of social rights and labour law.
That is the key to achieving the much repeated aim of ensuring that people come before the economy, and not the other way round - and that has to be the priority in any policy in which we invest our efforts.
Another aspect of this report that is very positive for us as Social Democrats is the move to extend the scope of harmonisation, as opposed to simple mutual recognition.
Mutual recognition in itself is not bad, but harmonisation is better.
In effect, we have come up with a response which not only offers an effective form of protection, at a high level, for members of the public, but also makes it clear that we cannot have a scenario of competition between Member States' social systems; what we want is cooperation between the different social systems, based on the highest possible values.
This is an extremely important point and we have done very well to get it across.
Another particularly important achievement for us as Social Democrats was the last-minute agreement on services of general interest.
I welcome the fact that the European People's Party has moved forward on the basis of the text currently in preparation for the Treaty on European Union.
It is right that defending services of general interest should be one of our priorities and that we should address the legal uncertainties currently facing such services in the European Union, with a view to protecting the public and meeting demand in this area.
There is one point, however, on which we as Social Democrats must withhold our approval, and that is the 'Internal Market Test'.
Nowhere in the text, Mr Schwab, is there a stipulation on this Internal Market Test, and I would suggest that you need to read the text more closely.
For us as Social Democrats, an Internal Market Test is not a yardstick that we want to apply - or at least not until similar emphasis is placed on other tests such as gender mainstreaming or social impact, which follow from the Treaties.
Until tests like these, which are required by the European Union Treaties, are routinely conducted, we cannot give our approval to a test that is not even provided for in the Treaties.
This is another point on which our position has to be very clear.
(DE) Mr President, the internal market is certainly working if we measure it in terms of overall economic growth.
It is certainly working, too, if we just accept the fact that what we have been experiencing - since we have had an internal market in Europe - is the greatest redistribution of wealth that this continent has seen in peace time.
Yet in terms of people's acceptance of it, the internal market is certainly not working.
Why not?
Precisely because we have this huge range of wealth levels, because unearned income is growing far faster than wage packets - and that is why, 15 years after Jacques Toubon, this report will come to be seen as a powerful testament to the failure of the Socialists and Social Democrats.
If you read the draft amendments to this report, you will find no surprises.
There are calls for effective regulatory mechanisms, for a review of internal market strategy, for initiatives to reinforce the social agenda and for a social safeguard clause.
The Social Democrats were in the overwhelming majority in Europe for such a very long time, and 15 years down the line we will find out that they accomplished nothing and that they are responsible for increased radicalisation on the political fringes in Europe.
Mr President, I am delighted to see that most of our Group's contribution to the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been incorporated in Mr Toubon's excellent report.
The realisation of a full single market is essential to Europe's economic success.
More specifically, the various legislative measures adopted recently in the wholesale financial services area have gone a long way towards establishing a single European market in this area, with high regulatory standards and trickle-down benefits for the customer.
In several cases these are becoming global standards, and the next stage is to ensure that the regulation governing this area is properly implemented and evenly enforced across the European Union.
We will, of course, resist further unnecessary regulation.
Yet there are many cultural, traditional, legal and tax barriers that still inhibit the single market in financial services at the retail level.
Therefore we look forward to reviewing the Commission's White Papers on retail financial services and mortgage credit to see how improvements can be achieved with the least possible intrusiveness.
I would like to mention the Lamfalussy process, because so far it has helped much with adapting the basic legislation in financial services to the real world of market operators and regulators.
The process is still at the learning stage, but a large amount of legislation has been handled and early indications are positive.
Although most of the Economic Committee's amendments are in Mr Toubon's excellent report, I am sorry that the ones relating to the Lamfalussy process were not incorporated.
One area that is the responsibility of the Economic Committee and still impedes the functioning of the single market is the tax system.
Whilst fully recognising the unanimity rule in this sensitive area and the sovereign right of Member States to set their own tax rates, the current VAT and excise duty systems clearly prevent full realisation of the single market and of its benefits for consumers and businesses.
We, therefore, urge the Commission to come forward with practical proposals for facilitating EU citizens' full rights to the free movement of goods, in particular concerning the tax regimes for Internet and cross-border shopping.
Mr President, as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon, particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market, which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today's debate.
I want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular.
More involvement of national parliaments to better reflect the diverse views of Member States and their citizens is a very important proposal.
Equally important is the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions of the internal market, and of course the internal market needs to continue to deliver more choice, better quality and competitive prices for our consumers and small businesses.
Reducing administrative burdens and boosting innovation, while protecting our intellectual property, will enable us to compete in the global arena.
Consumer confidence in the internal market can only work when citizens are able to see the benefits and enjoy the rights and opportunities they have as members of the EU.
Therefore, I hope that we will go beyond simply protecting our consumers to making sure we have remedies for them when things go wrong.
In that regard, I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres.
These informal, practical networks provide quick solutions to very complex problems in what is perceived by our citizens as a bureaucratic environment.
One of the reasons why they do not want to shop across the border is because they do not trust that they will have a remedy when something goes wrong.
The Commission should therefore strengthen these networks as an essential element of the review process.
I think, Commissioner, we share the same objectives: to achieve an internal market that is relevant and responsive to all - you said that in your introductory comments - and I think that we want now to work together with you to ensure that our citizens continue to achieve the level of access to the internal market, the benefits and indeed the protection with remedies and redress.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three points.
The first is a word of thanks to Mr Toubon and the way in which he has directed the whole process.
I think everyone on the right and the left of the House has actually been quite pleased with the way in which things have gone.
I think that the report is very good and balanced.
My second point is about selling the internal market.
I think that this paper tries to sell the internal market and we really need to do it.
Mr Goebbels, you referred earlier to the so-called 'Nordic model'.
Well, let me tell you that the Nordic model yes, on the one hand is about social welfare, but on the other hand it is also about economic openness.
These are the countries that are completely abiding by the rules of the single market - free movement of goods, free movement of services - with Polish plumbers! - free movement of money and free movement of people, with people coming in from other countries to work, so these are also open economies at the same time.
My argument is that we should not put down the single market because it is probably the best thing that we in the European Union have ever done.
Finally, I want to give you an example of how the single market does not work.
This is a real life example.
A Finnish Finnair captain bought a car in Italy, I shall not mention what kind of car, at the beginning of the summer. Half an hour after he drove out of the shop he was stopped by the police.
They took away his interim licence plates which were legal, bought in Germany, and they confiscated the car and they will not give it back until they have gone through a legal process in December.
It could very well be that he loses his car, and here we are talking about an internal market where there should be full and free movement of goods.
So my point is that this report is great and it shows that we really have to keep on improving and working with the single market with a nice balance of free competition and social welfare.
(RO) Mr President, dear colleagues, the development of the single market is an essential factor in European integration.
However, it should not be seen as an end in itself in front of which the social consequences do not matter.
With the last enlargement of the European Union, it became more economically non-homogenous than in the past.
This lack of homogeneity may be considered an advantage for certain neo-liberal policies, but not for all citizens.
Competition is for companies, solidarity is for people, as Jacques Delors stated.
Beside its undoubted qualities, the Toubont report has some weaknesses from this point of view.
Theoretically, we all support the Lisbon Strategy, a knowledge-based economy and high-quality jobs, where the comparative advantage cannot be a cheap labour force.
The report also states that a major way for increasing business competitiveness is worker mobility, which should be encouraged.
As socialists, we think that the removal of all barriers in light of the free movement of persons and the labour force is a fundamental right established by the treaties.
Encouraging mobility for exclusively economic reasons already generates serious social consequences in the workers' countries of origin: beside real revenues, there is the loss of specialists and qualified labour force, depopulation and decrease in the active population, thousands of children living without parents and needing special educational and social services.
The long-term social and human costs are not yet known.
Therefore, we ask for a survey on this particular issue because the economic measures should never undermine the social aspect.
(Aplauses)
(ES) Mr President, first please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Toubon, on the content of his report and for having the skill to kindle a broad base of support for its adoption in this plenary.
A reaffirmation at this point that much progress has been made in the construction of a Single Market in the European Union is to state the obvious, yet nevertheless it is also important to reiterate, obvious though it may be, that there is still a long way to go.
I believe that experience shows us that open economies are the economies which grow the most and that increased competition always translates into benefits for consumers in the quality and price of goods and services competing on or appearing in the market.
In a globalised market such as the one in today's world it is impossible to believe that progress can be made using protectionist measures, and of course the European Union, as an economic stakeholder at world level, will only be able to have a strong economy if it continues to pursue measures to liberalise, construct and deepen the Single Market.
On many occasions people have depicted increased competition and the liberalising measures in the European market as a relinquishment of the European social model or as a relinquishment of the protection afforded by social rights.
I believe the exact opposite is true, namely that for the European social model to continue to move forward, for European citizens to continue to enjoy social protection measures and good social services, it is important for the European economy to grow and that growth will only, I stress, be possible if we deepen the European Single Market.
I said that a great deal of progress has been made but there is still some way to go, and one of my colleagues has just given some specific examples of this.
I believe that it is important to remove barriers so that small and medium-sized undertakings can work throughout the European Union.
It is also important, as stated in the report, to investigate and develop the market in retail financial services, and especially intellectual property rights.
I would like to ask the Commission to call on national governments and on the Council to ensure that Community provisions are duly transposed into national legislation.
(DE) Mr President, we are in favour of removing restrictions on the internal market in order to promote its positive effects, such as sustained growth, and in that process it is important to pay adequate attention to social safeguards for ordinary people.
Because of their particular importance, the services of general interest - what we term 'basic' forms of provision - cannot simply be left to the free play of the market.
In the health and social fields especially, they need a specific set of rules.
I am sorry to see the quite unnecessary mention of nuclear power in paragraph 16.
This is indisputably a high-risk technology which puts the population in danger.
So, on that point I cannot back the report.
It also has to be said that diverging national interpretations in the transposition of EU law are creating uncertainty.
As numerous studies have shown, this is a considerable obstacle to the completion of the internal market.
Finally, I should like to mention the international importance of European standards.
The current controversy about faulty toys from China is a good illustration of how important it is, in dialogue with external trade partners, that we should have internationally recognised standards.
Even if countries like China do feel overburdened by a long list of quality requirements, we nonetheless need measures to improve product and food safety in the interests of protecting European consumers.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, the internal market is one of the most important building blocks for cooperation within the European Union.
The cooperation is based on mutual trust and respect between the Member States.
It is therefore also crucial that everyone contributes by quickly and effectively implementing the EU legislation that has to transposed into national law.
SOLVIT is a good way of monitoring observance and can be developed.
We politicians who work at European level in Parliament or in the Council are responsible for ensuring that the legislation is pro-competitive and does not create unnecessary administration and that it meets the needs and resolves the problems that still exist.
To that end we must create a political consensus and a broad understanding of the importance of the internal market, to which both Mr Toubon and the Commission have made good contributions.
