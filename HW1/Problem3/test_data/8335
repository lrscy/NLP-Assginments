We should not act in a hypocritical manner, and we should not be afraid to say ânoâ to Turkey...
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Toubon has asked what sort of Europe we want.
Those who want an integrated Europe, the Europe envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty, cannot accept Turkey as a full member.
Turkey is an important partner, and we want it to remain one in future, but in a privileged partnership and not as a full member of the EU.
Turkey claims that it has been promised full membership for the past forty-one years.
That is not the case.
The 1963 Ankara Agreement had a customs union as its objective; one was promised, and it has been in place for nine years.
Even before accession negotiations have been set in motion, Turkey is now demanding of us full membership without any ifs or buts.
That is extortion.
That may be how you do politics in Turkey, but it is not how it is done in the EU.
The Copenhagen criteria apply to all candidates for accession.
The major problems Turkey has with democracy, freedom of opinion, human rights, the rights of minorities, with its neighbours in Armenia and Cyprus, and with the Kurds, have caused it to be decided that Turkey must fulfil the political criteria before negotiations can start.
There is no doubt that, even today, these conditions have not yet been met.
The Commission says so too.
Why it is that negotiations are to be opened despite that is a secret known only to the Council and to the Commission.
We do not want full membership, but a privileged partnership with a special status that both parties â the EU and Turkey â can cope with.
If accession negotiations are opened even though they go against our better judgment, they must be open-ended and capable of resulting in an alternative outcome in line with what we want.
To offer such a thing to Turkey is honest, sensible, politically far-sighted and forward-looking.
Turkey is not a European country and will not become one; that is why the demands of Europeâs and Turkeyâs future together are best met by a privileged partnership.
Â Â  â Mr President, in December 1999, the European Council in Helsinki sent a clear message to Turkey in its decision on Turkey's actual rather than notional candidacy and by creating a clear framework of terms, preconditions and criteria which Turkey had to implement.
This unanimous EU policy has made a decisive contribution over the last five years to important reforms in Turkey.
It would be a mistake for us to disparage the progress achieved, just as it would be a mistake for us to create an idyllic picture because, although it is commonly accepted that there has been an improvement in the human rights and minority rights situation, that an important amount of legislation has been passed, that the situation is not the same as in the past, as Leila Zanna also confirmed to us in the European Parliament, there is still a serious deficit in the implementation of European principles and the .
However, as in 1999, the present motion which the European Parliament is being called on to adopt and the decision which the European Council will take must also contain a clear message: a message concerning the opening of accession negotiations in accordance with the decisions taken by the European Council in 2005, with the final objective of accession to the ÎU if Turkey completes the negotiations successfully.
However, this message should not be seen as .
On the contrary, it must include a clear European agenda and a roadmap with a specific timetable for the implementation of Turkey's obligations.
We must not, under any circumstances, give the impression that Turkey can negotiate '' and have its own agenda.
Within this framework, what is of decisive importance is Turkey's obligation to respect minority rights, the rights of the Greek minorities in Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos, to respect the ecumenical character of the Patriarchate, to re-open the Halki seminary immediately, to respect international law, to help resolve operational problems on the basis of a specific timetable, with referral to the International Court of Justice in the Hague and, finally, to proceed with the international recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and the gradual withdrawal of the occupying army.
In particular, as far as the question of the diplomatic recognition of Cyprus is concerned, I should like to hear the opinion of the Dutch Presidency and of Mr NicolaÃ¯ as to what the position of the Dutch Presidency is in the run-up to the European Council.
Our decisions need to make clear that it is the European Union which lays down the framework, not the candidate, not Turkey.
Turkey needs to overcome its fears and reconcile itself with its historic past, even with the negative aspects, which it needs to have the courage to acknowledge.
In return, however, certain political forces in Europe should not cultivate fears for internal reasons or fabricate catastrophic scenarios.
To close ...
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Vice-President.
For many years Turkey has been our neighbour, ally and partner.
For many years it has also been a candidate with a successful market economy waiting for the date to begin negotiations.
In that respect it is very different from Ukraine.
Turkey is like a long, heavy train that moves with difficulty but since its move to democracy many years ago, the train has begun to move more quickly and more safely.
We are allowing the Turkish European train to enter a tunnel.
Not even the Orient Express has room to manoeuvre in there.
Trains do not slalom.
They cannot turn round in tunnels.
Turkey must move forward to democracy and into Europe and there is no other possibility.
I support the enlargement of the European Union and the europeanisation of Turkey.
No other mechanism of the European Union will bring more stability, more vision and more development to the East than the announcement of the date for Turkey.
Turkey would readily recognise Cyprus if the whole of Cyprus was in the European Union.
When the whole of Cyprus is in the European Union, there will no longer be any Turkish troops there.
This is the way to achieve strategic changes and strategic goals.
This is why I support Europe and why I give my support to Turkey.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  I wish to thank the rapporteur for a balanced report.
Turkeyâs cultural roots are more diverse than most of us realise.
They are also to be found in the cultures of Europe, the Caucasus and the Mediterranean.
Turkeyâs accession would enrich our culture.
We now have to fulfil the promise Turkey was given during the Finnish Presidency.
This would be a logical extension to the founding and enlargement of the European Union to strengthen peace.
The counter-arguments are illogical.
If Islam were a barrier, we would be declaring that the 15 million Muslims, three times the population of Finland, who now live in EU countries are second class citizens.
Those who recall the military campaigns by the Ottomans might well want to remember Swedenâs military campaigns, for example, in centuries gone by.
It is important, however, that Turkeyâs membership only comes about if the country meets the criteria that relate to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and a respect for the rights of minorities.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Council will set an exact date for the start of negotiations, in the knowledge that that date will mark the beginning of a long journey, the outcome of which will largely depend on the additional transformations that take place in Turkey during that time.
We must reject all forms of racism from those who are trying to make religion a basis for discrimination.
The coexistence of religions and cultures is the only future for a democratic and multiethnic Europe.
A solution to the Cyprus issue, full respect for human rights and political acknowledgement of the ongoing conflict in Kurdistan, as well as a commitment to finding a peaceful solution and an immediate, and obviously bilateral, cessation of hostilities should all be at the core of the negotiations with Turkey.
We have actually been asked to start the negotiations by the Kurdish democratic organisations and the human rights associations in Turkey â which are still suffering on a daily basis and are witnessing terrible injustices â so that they can involve the whole of Europe in their battle for democracy and respect for human rights.
In fact, while we acknowledge the changes that have been made so far to the constitution and the criminal code, there can be no doubt that they are not enough.
There is still a great deal to do, such as cutting back the power of the army, which must be brought under the control of the executive and legislative powers, amending electoral law and allowing the Kurdish language to be spoken in official proceedings.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall only utter a few words to say that Turkey should not join the European Union because Turkey is not in Europe!
Â Â  Mr President, the possibility of Turkeyâs eventual accession to the European Union brings us face to face with a historical responsibility.
It is a fact â and let me repeat this â that neither geographically, politically, culturally nor economically speaking is Turkey a European country.
Moreover, it is an Islamic country where, as in all Islamic countries, other religions are barely tolerated, if at all.
It is a country that fails to meet any of the accession conditions.
The historical responsibility that we bear is in respect of those European citizens who â quite rightly â do not want this Turkish accession, and who should not be forced to swallow an undemocratic decision.
Furthermore, our society is already paying a high toll for the fact that on our Continent, millions of people of non-European origin sometimes find it very difficult to coexist with the indigenous population.
Turkeyâs accession, with free movement for 70 and, soon 100, million Islamic, non-Europeans, will only exacerbate these problems exponentially and can lead to much worse.
We therefore demand a referendum in which the European citizens can speak out in favour, or rather against, this potential Turkish accession.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ Eurlings, on his excellent work and on the spirit of cooperation which he has demonstrated throughout the procedure.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we say yes to Turkey's European prospects.
At the same time, however, we would remind you that these prospects are connected with compliance with the political and financial criteria analysed in the texts of the conclusions of the European Councils from Copenhagen to Helsinki and in Brussels in a few days' time.
Examining the report, I should like to comment in particular on certain paragraphs, such as:
- paragraph 37, which creates the framework for the defence of and respect for the rights of minorities among which, of course, the Greeks in Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos are the most important;
- paragraph 38, which lists the preconditions and, more importantly, what Turkey has to do in relation to Cyprus: mainly, to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to withdraw Turkish forces from the northern part of Cyprus;
- paragraph 40, which presents a multi-dimensional methodological approach to the resolution of any outstanding disputes with neighbouring states and, of course, which mentions the obligation to abstain from threats and provocation.
This paragraph also covers relations between Greece and Turkey.
Finally, I recommend that the House vote in favour of the Eurlings report.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to add my congratulations to MrÂ Eurlings on his report.
It is no easy task.
I used to be the rapporteur on Turkey too, but of course that role has now become even more difficult.
The European Union would be making a grave error if, after many years of promises to Turkey, it were now to turn round suddenly and say no at a time when Turkey is taking its mission seriously.
We have helped Turkey a great deal in the past few months and years, and we shall have to continue that assistance.
Nevertheless, let me say that the crucial question, in my view, is this: will Turkish membership make Europe stronger or weaker?
We should say quite openly and in all honesty that what is at stake here is the Europe we as Members of Parliament must fight to achieve.
If, as Mr Schulz said today, Turkey reforms itself, if it changes its position on human rights, on Cyprus, on the border issue, on regional cooperation â if that Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, it will make Europe stronger.
It is quite interesting, by the way, to observe how the initial American euphoria which greeted the recommendation that Turkey should indeed become part of the Union has waned somewhat, because the United States of America is now no longer certain whether it really wants to see the European Union strengthened in this way by the addition of an independent Turkey that thinks and acts for itself; be that as it may, if Turkey does accede to the European Union, it will have to shed some of its nationalism.

I am very much in favour of backing the report and also of launching the negotiations.
We must, however, tell Turkey that it will be a long and difficult path.
Turkey has made enormous strides over the past two to three years.
I am certainly in a position to judge that, and I congratulate Turkey on it, but it will take many years before Europe can rest assured that a new Turkey, a different Turkey, is joining the European Union.
Â Â  I support opening accession negotiations with Turkey and if Turkey fulfils the accession criteria, I support Turkeyâs accession.
I know that Turkey is far from this goal, but I sincerely hope that it will be able to meet the criteria, as it is in everyoneâs best interest.
I support Turkeyâs accession on meeting the criteria even though I know that it would have significant consequences for Europeâs future.
We are accustomed to a Europe consisting of a community of values based on a common cultural heritage, a common past and common traditions.
The Europe that includes Turkey will be a different Europe.
That Europe will be a community of political goals based on common interest.
But I believe that we need this.
Turkeyâs accession is of paramount importance if Europe really wants to act on the stage of world politics and if it wants to rid itself of the role of a spectator.
Turkeyâs membership is also indispensable if we want to influence Middle Eastern, central Asian or Caucasian processes.
And if we do not exert influence on these regions, then these regions will exert a very negative and dangerous influence on us.
Turkey has an important value for all of us: its accession is of great interest and therefore I support opening the accession negotiations.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate about Turkey has always been awash with duplicity.
That duplicity was already being practised in Helsinki back in 1999, when Turkey was given applicant status, and so many had no wish whatsoever to see it in the Union; the same situation has obtained ever since.
The present progress report from the Commission bears detailed testimony to the fact that Turkey is not fulfilling a single one of the Copenhagen pre-accession criteria.
So what conclusion does the Commission draw?
It recommends the start of accession talks.
That is absolutely schizophrenic and irresponsible.
Now this European Parliament is poised to do precisely the same thing, to make exactly the same mistake.
Why?
Is it driven by national interest or party-political considerations â in other words, by self-interest â or is one of its motives quite simply fear?
Do we really want to negotiate with a country in which fundamental human rights are not respected, in which women are second-class citizens, in which virginity tests, forced marriages and honour killings are normal occurrences and bigamy is tolerated?
These things expose women to lifelong torture, and it is irresponsible to negotiate with such a country.
In that country, in that Turkey, the prevailing mentality surely has to change first; something has to happen in peopleâs minds.
This cannot be done by compulsion.
People have to be persuaded; they have to be won over by a convincing political case.
This is the way to achieve a permanent change of mentality.
It cannot be quickly engineered within ten years.
It takes at least two to three generations, so why can we not give this country the time it needs?
Besides, we all know that we simply cannot afford Turkish membership with its impact on the integration, the finances and the security of the Union.
The political European Union would not be able to digest the addition of that country, and therein lies the duplicity of the whole discussion to date, and particularly of the Commissionâs proposal to make Turkey a second-class Member State.
With a second-class Member State, with different grades of membership, our political union would eventually cease to function.
We would be digging our own grave.
The only honest offer we can make to Turkey is a privileged partnership, a special neighbourly relationship, and I urge the House to support that approach.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2002 the Heads of State or Government entered into an international commitment to Turkey, which they must honour on 17Â December.
The negotiations must begin, not only to sustain the reform process in Turkey but also for the sake of the international credibility of the European Union.
It will not, however, be a day of great rejoicing.
For the first time in the history of the European Union, there is widespread public opposition to the accession of a state.
People are not convinced that Turkey can become a truly European country.
In the parliamentary debate too, whenever I hear anyone cite one of the benefits of Turkish membership, it is saddled with far more ifs and buts than are normally raised in connection with such a momentous decision.
Moreover, no convincing argument has been advanced to demonstrate that Turkey would strengthen rather than weaken the cohesion of Europe.
Some see Turkish accession as part of a global strategy to combat terrorism.
The intention is to turn the collision of two cultures to advantage, but this bold strategic design underestimates not only Europeâs own powers but those of Turkey too.
There is certainly one role that Turkey could never perform as a Member State of the EU: it could never be a bridge to the Middle East.
It must be a pillar of the West in the Middle East; as a member of the EU, it would be a party to negotiations, not a mediator.
One thing must be quite clear: if Turkish membership were to erode the European Union, that would be too high a price to pay â and not only for the Union, by the way, but for Turkey too.
That price must not be paid.
On 17Â December, the European Council should lay down with unmistakable clarity that the decisive criteria will be not only Turkeyâs readiness for membership but also the capacity of the Union to accommodate Turkey and preservation of the momentum of the European integration process.
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for his efforts.
A great deal has already been said about the Copenhagen political criteria.
Let there be no misunderstanding.
I am not, in principle, opposed to Turkeyâs accession, but I refuse to endorse the view that opening negotiations with Turkey is necessary in order to further improve, for example, the protection of human rights and of minorities.
To do so is, as far as I am concerned, to put the cart before the horse.
The enlargement process is generally characterised by conditions and criteria which are forgotten on the .
Although, as one of the Members of this House remarked, I do not want to turn human rights as such into an instrument, I would like to adhere to the agreements made.
The question that is before us is whether Turkey meets the political criteria of Copenhagen, and the answer is no.
I consider opening negotiations nonetheless as a starting shot for a journey as we have with Romania, namely that of a train that is hurtling along and culminates in accession, where the negotiation chapters are closed artificially and the criteria no longer have a bearing. This is bound to weaken the Union sooner or later.
It therefore matters a great deal to me that this House should stick to the agreements made, and finally put an end to the arbitrariness, or double standards, that characterise the enlargement process.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for the very difficult job which he has completed so efficiently.
We shall know the results of the procedures for Turkey to accede to the European Union when the European Council takes its decision on 17 December 2004.
The two alternatives, either the exclusion or the full accession of Turkey, do not suffice.
There also needs to be a third alternative: the option of a special relationship with Turkey.
If the Council decision inclines towards yes, internal problems will arise in the European Union.
If the decision inclines towards no, it may provoke a crisis in relations between Turkey and the European Union, something which needs to be avoided.
Our special relationship should be the golden option which helps both Turkey and the European Union.
However, Turkey should not accede to the European Union while Cyprus is partitioned and occupied, without recognising the Republic of Cyprus.
If its relations with the Republic of Cyprus are to be normalised, the colonists and the forty thousand occupying Turkish soldiers need to withdraw from the island and be replaced â why not â with a small European force based on the Bosnia model.
Of course, the best guarantee for the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots is the application of the laws and principles of the European Union.
That is why the solution to the Cyprus problem must be purely European and must be based on full respect for and the application of the and the principles in general on which the European Union is founded.
With such a development, you can be sure that the Greek Cypriot Christians, who account for 82% of the population of Cyprus, and the Turkish Cypriot Muslims, who account for 18%, will be a perhaps unique example of peaceful coexistence, cooperation and progress and Cyprus will become a real bridge of peace and cooperation between the European Union and the Arab nations and Israel, with which Cyprus has always maintained excellent relations.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin, as other Members of this House before me have done, by thanking Mr Eurlings for the balanced report that he has presented to us today.
It is a report that, moreover, gives continuity to what was previously proposed by Mr Verheugen.
Like most of you, I have been witnessing for some time now a semantic debate between accession and privileged partnership.
I am somewhat surprised by this debate, but it merely typifies the irrational and subjective nature of our relationship with Turkey.
To my mind, the only questions that need to be asked are: âWhat have we done in the past?â and âWhat must we do in the future?â
For more than 40 years now, European politicians from all sides and from all countries have been saying that Turkey belongs in Europe and that such continuity is a source of pride for both them and us.
There are those who feel, however, that, at the end of this long engagement, marriage is no longer on the agenda.
The planned process is long, difficult and demanding, however, and requires responsibility and prudence; as such, Turkey has an obligation to provide us with the guarantees needed for accession to take place.
The natural consequence, however, of the demands that we are making is accession.
A privileged partnership will not encourage Turkey to accept such demands.
We must firstly, therefore, be consistent with ourselves and with our previous commitments, so that everyone is treated equally.
As a non-religious person, I have no intention of upsetting any religion or creed.
When the world speaks of the âclash of civilisationsâ, when the Bush Administration pits the forces of evil against the forces of good, when Muslim fundamentalists use any excuse to give sermons carrying a message of violence and exclusion, it would be dangerous for Europe to be swept along that route and to endorse such thinking.
Furthermore, I should like to reiterate all of the demands on womenâs rights, union rights, human rights and the recognition of minorities, to which I would add the Armenian question and the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.
Nevertheless, raising those questions, crucially important though they may be to a Europe of values, cannot be a prerequisite for opening negotiations.
As a committed and progressive citizen, I do not see a world frozen in time, in which the situation as it is today would, as a matter of course, be the same in ten or fifteen yearsâ time.
Such a view of politics does a disservice to the way in which human beings and societies evolve and to peopleâs intelligence and ability to live together.
As regards the positive developments in Turkey in recent years, which have been driven by the will of the people, it would be a serious mistake to reject the opening of these negotiations.
As a federalist, I sometimes hope, I sometimes dream, of a politically-integrated Europe.
The notion of a privileged partnership would be no more than a commercial super-partnership, which would be a triumph for âliving alongsideâ over âliving togetherâ â the business-based concept of an unjust world.
I personally hope ...
Â Â  Mr President, I will not repeat what has been said already but will limit myself to one general point which I feel has not been adequately covered so far, and that is the accession costs.
The exact cost of Turkey's accession to the EU is unknown.
Some, including the Commission, estimate it to be about EUR 20 billion per year.
Others put the cost much higher.
A very rough realistic approximation would be about EURÂ 400-500Â billion, i.e. approximately EUR 1Â 000 per European citizen at today's prices. This includes every child born in the European Union during the next 15 to 20Â years.
Such a child will owe EUR 1Â 000 as VAT towards the cost of Turkey's accession.
What happens if â as is quite possible â at the end of the day, Turkey does not achieve accession?
All this money, which could be used to build hundreds of hospitals and schools, would have been totally wasted.
In my opinion we must consult our citizens first and have a referendum: let them know the real facts and then take a decision.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I wish to express my support for MrÂ Eurlingsâ report and acknowledge the large amount of work that has gone into it.
A lot of speaking time and energy has been deployed on emphasising all the obstacles to Turkish membership of our European Community.
I always prefer to focus on the positive agenda.
Throughout the Cold War, Turkey was a steadfast ally on the side of the West.
Communism was kept at bay, partly thanks to Turkish loyalty towards the NATO Pact.
That is something we must remember in this House today.
There are substantial benefits to be had in terms of security policy from speeding up Turkeyâs integration into Europe.
In my view, Turkey is the country that can build a bridge to the Arab world.
I would therefore call upon us to act in the forthcoming process on the basis of Turkeyâs being âa friend of Europeâ.
Turkey is an asset to Europe and not a burden upon it.
Some people have expressed reservations about accepting such a large Muslim country into the EU.
I do not share those reservations.
The EU is not a religious club; the common denominator is democracy, not religion.
Many people, including some in this House today, argue in favour of Turkeyâs having a specially privileged partnership as an alternative to actual membership.
In actual fact, Turkey has already obtained every possible agreement prior to actual membership.
If such a proposal were supported, it would therefore side-track Turkey, and the EU countries would thus be abandoning all the promises we have previously given Turkey.
We must ask ourselves: âCan we bring ourselves to do such a thing?â.
There is no way forward other than that of full Turkish membership.
What can be said to an applicant country?
That it must fulfil the whole of the but that it cannot have a Commissioner, voting rights in the Council and seats in the common Parliament?
That does not make any sense.
We must open negotiations with Turkey, as we have promised to do, and give Turkey a fair chance.
Whether or not Turkey ultimately becomes a Member depends upon whether the Turks themselves are prepared to implement the far-reaching changes to their society that are required if Turkey is really to become a Member.
There is plenty here to set to work on, especially when it comes to human rights.
Let us be open and unprejudiced in our encounter with the population of Turkey, and let us join together in combating intolerance where this may be found.
As I say, I support MrÂ Eurlingsâ report, even though there are points on which I do not fully agree.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to start by complimenting the Commission on a wise, far-sighted and balanced report, and I should also like to say to the Dutch Presidency that, in my view, they have made a good job of tackling an extremely difficult matter.
As Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should also like to start by expressing my support for MrÂ Eurlingsâ report, which I think is a balanced document, as well as a responsible one in a way that is absolutely crucial.
It is not every day that Parliament adopts a position on such an important matter as Turkey.
There is no doubt that Turkey has made a very great deal of progress such as it would scarcely have made if there had been no prospect â a prospect made use of many times in the Turkish Parliament â of Turkeyâs being accorded candidate status.
Is Turkey to become a Member or not?
I do not think it would be right of us today or tomorrow to take decisions as to whether it will be.
I believe that what is crucial is to begin negotiations with Turkey and to have a perspective, but not to have any automatic arrangement or any guarantee. That leads to the issue to which I wish to devote the rest of my speaking time.
Turkey is faced with having to deliver a long list of results.
That is not without its problems. I must remind the Commission and MrÂ Rehn that, among the problems that exist, is the practical matter, to which I have very recently drawn attention, of union recognition in Turkey.
That is very serious, because the present situation is not in accordance with freedom of expression and organisation, and I hope that MrÂ Rehn will take the matter seriously and inform Turkey that it must come into line.
If it does so, that will be regarded as essential progress along the way.
As I say, I support MrÂ Eurlingsâ report.
Let us now negotiate seriously and with a sense of our historic responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, I too am of the view that we must open negotiations with a clear goal in mind, namely that of full membership, and do so without delay.
Indeed, there are plenty of problems left that have been discussed at great length in this House, but I would urge you to keep the debate pure, and not to base it on fear, prejudice and hypocrisy.
Much has been said about European values, and many people doubt whether Turkey will ever be able to embrace them.
I should like to draw their attention to the fact that, with criminal regimes and dictatorships, all twenty-five of the current Member States have ridden roughshod over those European values at some stage in the course of the twentieth century.
In the Second World War, human rights were trampled on in the most atrocious manner and despite this, we are all Members of the European Union and fully-fledged democracies.
It is arrogant to think that some ethnic groups are predestined to live in oppression, misery and backwardness.
The European Union was set up specifically to guarantee peace, freedom and prosperity in the wake of all the atrocities of the Second World War.
If a modern, democratic and free Turkey joins, the European Union will have accomplished its mission.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Eurlings is to be congratulated on his report, which is a product of careful, hard and objective work.
For many, for Turkey to open negotiations for membership means opportunities â opportunities for further democratisation of the country; opportunities for abolishing torture and other violations of human rights; for respecting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities within Turkey and for full respect of the identity rights of sectors of Turkish society, the Kurds and the Alawites.
It would mean an opportunity for regional stability by changing attitudes and abandoning aggressive behaviour, so that problems like Cyprus and the Aegean can be resolved according to the European spirit of settlement of disputes and respect for international law, Security Council resolutions, the Law of the Sea, etc.
As a Cypriot Member of this Parliament, and in spite of the invasion and continuous occupation of the northern part of my country by Turkey, I am prepared to go along with this opportunity and not oppose the opening of negotiations with Turkey.
At the same time, I expect none of Turkey's obligations, and none of the problems, to be minimised, overlooked or swept under the carpet.
There are enormous problems for Turkey to overcome and important obligations to fulfil.
The EU must demand that Turkey acknowledge the Armenian genocide if historians are to be able to close this chapter of shame in the history of mankind.
Nobody can turn a blind eye to the continuous military occupation of part of the territory of Cyprus.
Turkey's obligation in the search for a settlement in Cyprus does not end with the referendum of last April.
It has an obligation to ensure the gradual withdrawal of its troops and bring an immediate end to the creation of new in relation to private properties.
It also has an obligation to recognise all 25 Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus, when negotiating with them.
Â Â  We are on the verge of an extremely important decision, not only in terms of its impact on all of Europe but also, in this age of globalisation, in its effects on the political map of the world.
Shall we have the intellectual and moral strength to take the decision on the opening of negotiations calmly, boldly and in accordance with the dictates of political logic?
Opponents of the report have once again been trying to restart the discussion on new terms, some of which are based on falsehoods, raising many of the hurdles that have already been cleared and adding many more.
Let me emphasise that I must respect the views of those among us who do not wish to support the opening of negotiations on Turkish accession, but I cannot accept any arguments that are completely divorced from reality or any allegations of the type that have been made over the past weekend by various German Conservatives.
The assertion that Turkey would import terrorism and gangsterism is libellous and an insult to our NATO ally.
The debate must not be dragged down to that level.
Since 1963, the Community and Brussels have acknowledged that Turkey is part of Europe, and in DecemberÂ 2002 the European Union pledged itself to begin negotiations with Turkey once the latter had fulfilled the stipulated criteria.
The credibility of the European Union is at stake.
Political honesty means abiding by agreements and keeping promises.
The scope and impact of the reforms that are currently being enacted in Turkey are unprecedented in recent centuries.
Democracy there is more stable than it has ever been.
The country is registering high economic growth rates.
Turkey will always stand guarantor for the security of the whole of Europe.
A European Turkey will serve as a shining example for the entire Islamic world and hence for numerous crisis-torn regions too.
Turkey ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree that we must do everything to stabilise regions neighbouring on ourselves, but I do not agree with the way in which Turkish membership is intended to be turned into a reality.
We no doubt agree that one of the conditions of a democracy is that everyone must be able to participate in the decision-making.
That also applies to the present Member States which have, for example, linguistic minorities that together constitute 10% of the EUâs population.
If the Member Statesâ seats in the European Parliament are reduced in number without guarantees being given that Europeâs genuine diversity will be reflected in Parliamentâs composition, the minorities will be excluded from Parliament as a result of Turkeyâs becoming a member.
Europe is a cultural and linguistic mosaic that has also given rise to tensions and bloodshed.
It would therefore be unwise to go in for a solution that did not reflect Europeâs genuine diversity.
All EU citizens need to feel welcome in an EU whose power is increasing every day.
It would be unfortunate if, for example, the Balkan states, as future Members, were only to be represented by the largest ethnic group.
The representation of minorities at EU level is of great importance for reducing tensions.
Because the report takes no account of this aspect, I cannot vote in favour of it.
I want a Europe for all EU citizens and not just for a portion of them, no matter how great the historic decisions we face.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate is about nothing more or less than the destiny and the future of the European Union, which is why it is disturbing to see the extent to which confusion reigns in these deliberations.
First of all there are constant references to a promise of accession allegedly given to Turkey in 1963.
Even you, Commissioner, spoke of this promise, but the prospect held out by the EEC in 1963 â by the EEC, mind you â has long since been realised through the customs union. We had that decision on the customs union adopted in the face of opposition from the political group of MrÂ Schulz, who praised the customs union today, because we are friends of a strong and viable Turkey.
Today, however, we are dealing with quite a different matter, namely full Turkish membership of a European political union in which many of what were once foreign affairs are becoming internal matters.
And anyone who seeks such a closely integrated Europe cannot favour full Turkish membership, which would degrade this European Union into a free-trade area.
Commissioner, you are not bound by an imaginary promise of accession; you are bound by the Parliament which elected you and which represents the people of Europe, who are overwhelmingly opposed to Turkeyâs full membership of the Union.
Secondly, it is a matter of the identity of Europe, and this is another respect in which two different yardsticks are being applied.
This is a legitimate concern.
Without Europeans, Europe means nothing.
Europe is not an association of all types of countries in the world that meet its accession criteria, but a union of all the European states that meet the criteria and want to accede.
Of course Europe has an identity and borders.
That identity, MrÂ Ãzdemir, cannot be reduced to Christianity or Islam.
The Muslim Bosnians are unquestionably Europeans, whereas the Christian Ethiopians clearly are not.
Let me answer your point by quoting your party colleague MrÂ Voggenhuber, who said that Turkey is not part of greater Europe but of Asia Minor.
There are limits to everything, including the scope for European integration, and it is realistic that we should take that into account.
There are countries which are partly European, such as Turkey and Russia, and their partial integration â by which we mean conferring special status or establishing a privileged partnership â with the integrated European Union is a sound strategy that will ultimately benefit both parties.
I hear repeated calls for consistency.
It may be a mistake, say many Heads of State or Government, to let Turkey accede or to launch accession negotiations at the present time, but consistency is essential once a promise has been made.
Let me say in reply that there is nothing more consistent than lemmings.
I have no desire to be led by lemmings, nor do the people of Europe.
Even that controversial decision adopted in Helsinki stipulates that the Copenhagen criteria must be satisfied before negotiations can begin.
I cannot imagine that Turkey will manage to fulfil the criteria within the next few days or weeks.
Turkey is plainly not satisfying the criteria, as the Eurlings report and the Commission report also demonstrate, but we must face up to that truth and draw the appropriate conclusions.
Turkey must continue to receive support in its quest to establish democracy and the rule of law and to integrate itself into the Western world.
That is true, but full membership would be more than either Turkey or the European Union could handle, and rejection is therefore in the interests of both parties.
The Heads of State or Government will have to examine two issues in Brussels next Saturday: firstly, is it in Turkeyâs best interests to pursue this approach, and, secondly, can the EU even cope with such enlargement?
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased for Mr Eurlings that his report, after so many amendments, finally appears to be taking shape.
I am also pleased that, together with German Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, Prime Minister Balkenende confirmed today that negotiations with Turkey will be about full membership and about nothing else.
I am therefore somewhat disenchanted that some Members of this Parliament have tabled amendments suggesting something other than full membership.
These are exciting times for Turkey and for Europe, and many exciting years will follow â years in which Turkey will need to improve a great deal in the areas of human rights, womenâs rights, freedom for trade unions and freedom of religion.
Above all, Turkey must learn to deal with NGOs such as the Red Crescent, and learn to see them as being useful for the European integration process instead of a nuisance.
Moreover, those self-same NGOs are urging the EU to open negotiations with Turkey, which many of them believe will benefit the human rights situation there.
Soon, many will celebrate Christmas in Europe, but many, including Turks, also celebrate the Feast of Sacrifice.
I hope that the Councilâs statement on 17Â December will give everyone cause to celebrate, because both Turkey and the European Union can benefit from a fair and open process of negotiations.
The Eurlings report is a first step in the right direction, towards full Turkish membership of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, many people believe that Turkey deserves to be invited to join the EU.
It is the only secular country and the only notable democracy in the Islamic world probably the only one where we can speak of womenâs rights in a European sense.
Turkey has also officially renounced its Islamic inheritance.
At the same time, Turkey is aware of Europeâs promise of an invitation to begin negotiations, since 2009 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderesâs respective request.
Representing a small nation, I believe that there are, however, a number of issues that ought to be resolved before the EU begins negotiations with Turkey.
First, Turkey must recognise the legitimate Greek Cypriot Government.
In fact, there is no alternative, since candidate countries must commence negotiations with all EU Member States separately, and that includes Cyprus.
Also, it is just as natural that Turkey should withdraw its armed forces from all positions within EU territory.
Second, I believe that Turkey must acknowledge the 1915 Armenian mass murder as genocide, which was not planned by religiously fanatical Osmans, but by secular young Turks, many of whom later became Ataturkâs supporters.
And third, why does Turkey completely disregard the fate of the worldâs largest stateless nation, the Kurds?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President, first of all, I would like to note that our colleague Mr Eurlings has carried out an enormous task and deserves our acknowledgement and gratitude.
Having analysed Mr Eurlings' report, it is obvious that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria today, that is, it is not capable of passing the tests which had to be overcome by those European Union Member States which became members of the club after 1993, that is, after the Copenhagen criteria had been laid down.
While listening to the speeches which propose that Turkey be recognised as ready to start European Union membership negotiations, in spite of the violation of minority rights, basic human rights and freedoms in Turkey, one is reminded of George Orwell's âAnimal Farmâ; an order where everybody is equal, but some are more equal.
In other words, we are showing double standards as regards further European Union expansion. This is largely due to the fact that the state which is seeking full European Union membership, but failing to meet the requirements, has a powerful advocate.
Maybe we are ready to review, to revise the Copenhagen criteria, to lower the level of requirements?
Turkey today maybe another Eurasian state tomorrow, for example Russia?
The economic aspect of Turkeyâs European Union membership is also important.
The former European Commissioner for the Internal Market warned that the European Union will explode if it does not reform agricultural and regional policies.
The European Union's ability to absorb new members and overcome the economic challenges of European Union expansion are not infinite.
Extensive European Union expansion undoubtedly has limits and it would be wiser to consolidate the consequences of the most recent European Union expansion, to evaluate the economic results of Romania and Bulgaria joining the European Union, as well as forecast the economic consequences of Ukraine and Moldovaâs European aspirations, that is, matters which should be our priority.
Therefore, I believe that it would be in the European Union's interests to have a privileged partnership with Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, the prospect of EU accession has been the motive for democratic reform in Eastern Europe, and this week the EU will decide if it will be so for Turkey too.
As Mr Verheugen said, there is no more that the Turkish Government could have done.
It is time, 41Â years after the promise was first made, for the EU to honour its side of the promise and for the talks to start.
It is agreed that Turkey should be treated the same as every other applicant country, yet some in this debate seek to suggest that referenda be held in existing Member States, that a new type of status be invented, that permanent 'safeguards' be introduced against EU freedoms, or that big countries should be treated differently from small ones.
No other accession country has been treated in this way and Parliament should reject these amendments.
Indeed, I ask Commissioner Rehn this: if the Council decides to start talks 'without delay', would he indicate in his reply how he would interpret this?
What timescale would he recommend?
No-one denies that there are important issues of concern relating to Turkey and these are well dealt with by compromises in the text in the Eurlings report.
But if LeylaÂ Zana, ten years a political prisoner, came as she did two months ago to this Parliament saying that the promotion of human rights requires us to open the talks, who in this Chamber can with any credibility use human rights objections to support the rejection of Turkey?
The plain truth is that too many people use these arguments.
They talk about European identity and the fundamental character of the Union to hide their true belief that a country with a majority Muslim population should never be allowed to join.
They seek to talk up the clash of civilisations, yet for threeÂ million Turkish people in today's European Union, and for oneÂ million Muslims in my own country, the United Kingdom, the only civilised Europe is one based on the freedom of all religions and of none, of ethnic diversity and of combating racism.
No new preconditions, no further delays.
Vote yes for a better Turkey, but vote yes, too, for a stronger, more prosperous, more influential, more tolerant and more secure Europe for us all.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not a debate for or against Turkey: that would be a huge debate and I do not wish to be part of that game.
This is a debate about our own future as part of a political project and about the legitimate right of Turks to benefit from the kind of growth and stability that can only be brought from Europe.
It is our duty to find new kinds of relationships with our neighbours and allies, so that both goals can be made equally compatible without endangering the success of our own projects and dreams and making them collapse, which is what could happen if things are not done properly.
Membership of the European Union cannot be the only option we give to our neighbours and friends.
That needs to be said clearly.
Other very clear options have to be kept in mind.
Finally, the European leadership has ignored public opinion and the citizens of Europe too often.
This time that neglect on the part of our political elite â treating our citizens as babies â could have catastrophic effects.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating Mr Eurlings on his report, which offers us an accurate portrayal of the current situation in Turkey.
The report reminds us that, despite the significant reforms underway in Turkey, there remain some worrying areas, such as the fact that torture still takes place, the fact that human rights are not routinely respected and the fact that the genocide of the Armenian people has not been acknowledged.
The obvious question, therefore, is whether the conditions are right to begin negotiations with a view to accession.
As regards Cyprus, is it possible, or in any way acceptable, for a European Union of 25 Member States to set up negotiations with a country that only recognises in full 24 of those Member States?
This strikes me as surprising, to say the least.
Lastly, is the EU capable, in any case, of completely integrating Turkey, with all that that implies in financial and structural terms and as regards European cohesion?
A further question: will our external security be strengthened if we acquire borders with problematic countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan and Georgia?
I have yet to even come to the question that ought to be asked first: where will the EUâs borders end up?
I am not speaking merely about geographical borders, but rather of the conceptual borders to which Mr Toubon rightly referred in his speech a short time ago.
Given all of these constraints, Parliament must at least leave the door open to an alternative to full accession, an alternative that takes account of the privileged relations with this great country, but an alternative, none the less.
If this does not happen, Parliament will be making the same mistake as others in the past, namely that of giving the wrong signal, albeit perhaps for the right reasons, to the great Turkish nation, or else tying Europe to commitments that it might later not be able to meet, or might not actually want to meet.
Â Â  The European Council is making a very important decision this week â on opening accession talks with Turkey.
Opponents of accession, and we have heard the arguments here today, say that Turkey is not a European country, that it has different cultural, historical and religious roots from those of Europe, that it is situated in the unstable Middle Eastern region, that human, civil and political rights are not adequately observed in Turkey and that Turkey is not ready either politically, economically or in terms of its socio-economic development.
It is, of course, possible to go along with many of these arguments.
The decision to be made by the European Council, which we are now discussing, however, is not about Turkeyâs accession, but about the opening of accession negotiations.
There is no doubt that Turkey, in its present situation, is not yet ready to join the European Union, but nor is the European Union ready for Turkeyâs accession.
I believe, however, that the decision on whether or not to start such talks with Turkey is a quite separate issue.
As has already been stated, these accession negotiations will run for many years and, during this time, the individual measures, procedures and progress in the different areas will be monitored in detail, whether it be in the field of human and civil rights, political reforms, socio-economic development or whatever. Of course, if Turkeyâs obligations are not met, negotiations may be broken off at any time, and this has been made clear.
I am of the opinion that the European Union should has obligations of its own.
Since Turkey has been awarded the status of candidate country and, according to a report published by the European Commission, has made clear progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, it should be given a chance: the chance to continue with far-reaching political and economic reforms and the chance to fulfil the legacy of the founder of the modern Turkish state Kemal Ataturk and come closer to the West.
It is an ambitious project and it is my view that, if it succeeds, both Turkey and the European Union will benefit.
If it does not succeed ...
Â Â  Mr President, to balance the focus on problems and challenges of Turkish membership, can I just welcome the prospect of Turkey's vibrant and generous culture enriching the European Union, as it already does in North London where I live, not least through the presence of Turkish and Kurdish people as well as the excellent food.
I also regard Turkey's Muslim identity â a secular Muslim identity â as a positive contribution to a harmonious development of the EU as a multicultural society.
But I would just like to stress the paragraph of Mr Eurling's report that invites the Turkish Government to take more active steps to bring about reconciliation with those Kurdish forces who have chosen to abandon the use of arms.
I hope that as part of the accession process Turkey will be persuaded to seek a political solution to the desire of the Kurdish people to express their identity, perhaps through some kind of political devolution.
The PKK's 1999 ceasefire is under strain, and only political negotiations can ensure permanent peace.
Â Â  Mr President, the Eurlings report is a rare phenomenon in this House, in that it catalogues the violations of human rights, minority rights and ethnic rights that have taken place within a particular country.
The main issues are torture, religious freedom, womenâs rights, the constitution and the occupation of part of the European Union or, to be more precise, part of a Member State of the European Union, as well as the question of the Armenians and freedom of expression.
The conclusion that has been drawn â mistakenly, in my opinion â from this catalogue of violations is that negotiations should be launched, as many of my honourable colleagues have pointed out.
A few years ago, negotiations with Slovakia were suspended for far, far less, and now compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is being presented as an optional extra for the future with no hard and fast statement of the Unionâs position.
Turkeyâs democratisation efforts must be supported, but surely their success does not depend on membership of the European Union but rather on a policy of good neighbourly relations and fruitful partnership.
Two thirds of the European population are opposed to the opening of accession negotiations and to Turkish membership of the European Union.
In some countries, such as Austria, France and Germany, this opposition exceeds 70%.
This raises the question why the Commission, many parliamentarians, the Council and numerous Member States are pursuing policies that go against the clearly declared interests, opinions and wishes of the people.
Such action is politically incomprehensible and utterly short-sighted, because it creates enormous difficulties with regard to public opinion as well as jeopardising the future prospects of the European Union.
I am in favour of a privileged partnership, not Turkish membership of the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs report on Turkey is of crucial importance, since the decision taken by the European Council on 17 December has an historic significance which goes further than the political aspects indicated in Mr Eurlingsâs report.
We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy also have an interest in highlighting and applauding the progress Turkey has made in the economic field in terms of the criteria established by the Union and, in particular, we wish to emphasise its compliance with the Community in fields such as energy policy, industrial policy, research and development and telecommunications.
Nevertheless, although the direction taken as a whole is correct, the progress made in each of these fields has been unequal and, therefore, progress must be made in the future on at least four aspects which I am going to mention briefly.
Firstly, it must improve its administrative capacity to complete and enhance the application of the Community acquis.
Secondly, there needs to be more independence in the monitoring of State aid.
Thirdly, it must increase the budget dedicated to research and development as a proportion of its GDP.
And fourthly, the legal framework in the telecommunications sector should be reviewed.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is essentially the content of the amendment that we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are proposing to MrÂ Eurlingsâs report.
Â Â  Mr President, next Friday the Council will make a decision that will affect the future of the European Union â on opening accession negotiations with Turkey.
It must be said that every time accession negotiations have been opened they have ended in accession.
Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to ensure that the amendment that we have tabled, calling for a privileged partnership with Turkey, is taken on board.
The fact is, as I said in this House in November 2002, that there are no grounds for Turkey joining the EU.
Firstly, the Treaties say that the EU is open to European countries; 95% of Turkeyâs territory, of which the capital is Ankara, is located in Asia.
Secondly, the more we enlarge the Union, the more we will dilute it, the further we will move away from political Europe and the less able we will be to pursue common policies.
Thirdly, if Turkey were to join the EU in 2015, it would be the most populous country with 80Â million inhabitants, which would give it the highest number of Members of this Parliament and significant weight in the Council.
Lastly, if we accept Turkey into the Union, what argument would we be able to put forward against other applicant countries knocking on our door at some future date, such as Ukraine, Morocco and Algeria?
For all of these reasons â and not to mention the fact that the Copenhagen criteria have not been complied with, the Armenian genocide has not been recognised and, indeed, an EU Member State is not recognised â a decision must be taken on Friday that goes beyond the accession or exclusion debate.
The solution, I repeat, is privileged partnership.
Let me state clearly that this is not an anti-Turkish position; it is a pro-European position.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Eurlings had a very difficult job to accomplish.
He tried to square the circle.
The evidence which he has set out vindicates the view that Turkey is not ready to be given a date for opening accession negotiations.
On the other hand, however, he has substantiated the yes position whereby, at this moment, judging strategically and studying the situation, Turkey should open negotiations with the European Union.
From everything set out in the report and from everything we know, it appears clear that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria.
Paragraph 7(a)(3) of these criteria is clear: Turkey has deficits both in the area of democracy and in the area of human rights and in the area of respect for minority rights, as well as in numerous other areas.
At the same time, as far as the Helsinki conclusions are concerned, Turkey is violating the spirit and the letter of paragraph 4 by being in a state of constant friction with Greece, given that it continually violates airspace on a daily basis and, most importantly, it continues to occupy part of European territory, part of the Republic of Cyprus, and continues to say that it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus.
It is ultimately a matter of self-respect for the European Union to say that it will enter into partnership with a state which does not recognise one of its members.
It is something which Europe needs to address decisively and dynamically.
We Cypriots are not against the Europeanisation of Turkey.
We want a neighbour which identifies with European values and we hope â and believe â that, through this current procedure, Turkey will end up moving towards Europe and adopting European values.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank MrÂ Eurlings for a skilfully produced report.
Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize in 1995, told us in October to include Turkey in the negotiations or else the Kurds would not survive.
This is a serious argument for talks, but it only means that Turkey will now be included within the observation category.
The start date for negotiations must still be left open, with no deadline.
Turkey needs to fulfil all the requirements of European democracy, including the rights of women.
It is important that the negotiations can be broken off at any time if there is insufficient progress.
For Turkey there are therefore three potential exits: the beginning, the end and right in the middle of everything.
We will not be ready for enlargement for a long time, but we can begin negotiations now.
Turkey is not Europe, but democracy and human rights are, and that is why these concepts should be spread, at least within our neighbouring countries.
Â Â  Mr President, Turkey is a large country straddling the border between Europe and Asia in an area of particular geopolitical sensitivity.
It is in the interests of the Union to integrate Turkey firmly into European structures, and it is evidently in the interests of Turkey to bind itself into those structures.
That is why Turkey applied for membership many years ago.
There are clear criteria for accession to the Union.
These were laid down at the Copenhagen summit more than ten years ago, in 1993.
A candidate for membership must fulfil a set of defined political and economic criteria and must accept the established body of European law.
The Union is likewise bound to do its homework.
It must be ready for enlargement and must not put its previous progress in jeopardy.
A few weeks ago, the Commission presented another progress report on Turkey, recording some remarkable achievements, particularly as regards the applicant countryâs fulfilment of political accession criteria.
Progress has been made towards the establishment of democracy; in particular, the political power of the armed forces has been curbed in favour of the civil authority.
There have also been encouraging developments towards enshrinement of the rule of law.
Corruption, on the other hand, remains a major problem, and people are still being tortured in Turkish prisons.
In the realm of fundamental rights, the report once again made scathing criticisms, stating, for example, that things were in a bad way with regard to religious freedom in Turkey, not to mention the numerous minority issues that remain unresolved.
The Commission went on, however, to conclude from this very mixed progress report that the time had come to launch formal accession talks while conceding that derogations, possibly of a long-term nature, would have to be made from the rules of the common market in respect of crucial membership obligations.
This is a case of applying double standards and speaking with a forked tongue.
Either Turkey has done its homework and meets the political criteria or it does not; and if we have no intention of granting Turkey all the rights arising from membership, we should make that clear without delay and start to consider a privileged partnership instead of obsessively pursuing this notion of accession.
At the weekend the Council is required to take a very important decision on this matter.
I hope it will abide by the rules that the selfsame institution, the European Council, set in Copenhagen ten years ago for this eventuality.
Â Â  Mr President, the Hungarian Socialist contingent congratulates Mr Eurlings on a very good report.
For us, the situation of national minorities is a matter of principle.
Without increased territorial autonomy for the Kurds, Hungary and the Hungarian Socialists will never vote for Turkeyâs accession.
For us, it is a matter of principle.
As chairman of the intergroup for traditional national minorities, I feel that special importance must be attached to the situation for non-Muslim minorities.
Ethnic minorities, religious minorities and, especially, women, must be respected.
This may be the start of negotiations, but we do not yet know the outcome.
These negotiations are an opportunity for both Turkey and the EU, but they do not constitute a guarantee.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic that we are discussing today in this Chamber, and which we have been discussing for years in the European Parliament both in official sittings and in private talks, is a difficult and complex problem.
We Members have assessed the pros and cons and are united in the firmly-held conclusion that it is both advantageous and essential to give the green light to accession negotiations.
To reject them would mean thwarting the efforts that Turkey is making to modernise itself and to develop a democratic system; it would mean consigning that country to the confusion and despotism of unstable regions such as the Middle East and the Caucasus; and it would mean sending out a negative signal to the whole moderate Islamic world, reinforcing the intransigence of the fundamentalists and lending support to those who predict a clash of civilisations.
Today we have an opportunity to narrow the gap between Islam and the West, thanks to a country that has roots in both the history of Christianity and that of Islam.
By opening the doors of the European Union to Turkey, we can send out a strong signal to those Muslim countries that have, amidst great difficulty, set off along the road towards democracy and freedom, assuring them that they are on the right road, and showing that the European Union does not consider Islam and democracy to be incompatible.
I would remind the sceptics and those who are against Turkey that starting negotiations with that country will greatly increase our security with regard to terrorism, which is a threat that we shall still have to face for many years.
That is why we shall be voting for the report by MrÂ Eurlings, to whom we offer our most sincere and heartfelt congratulations on the enormous amount of work he has done under particularly difficult conditions and on his ability to find workable compromises among the highly diverse views that enliven this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be voting in support of the report as I have for other related decisions of the European Union in recent times.
I understand it to be, first and foremost, a message to Turkey that we are happy with the recent democratic reforms there.
At the same time it is, of course, abundantly clear that these reforms do not go far enough and that with regard to the continuation of the process of accepting Turkey into the European Union they should be more meticulous.
Like all the other candidate countries, Turkey is required to fulfil all the conditions.
This is the basic point of my short speech.
I would like to stress that the European Union itself must fulfil the conditions for further enlargement, particularly in the case of a sensitive country like Turkey.
It is bound by the Copenhagen criteria, and I quote, must be âcapable of accepting new membersâ.
In other words it should fulfil its political, economic and social goals.
In order to become more united and more effective, it must first consolidate itself and strengthen itself from within and I consider the ratification of the European Constitutional Agreement to be a vital precondition, if any further enlargement of the European Union is to be contemplated.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the opening of negotiations with Turkey will be a historic event for both Turkey and the European Union.
In the modern world, where Islam is being turned into an instrument of conquest and hatred, and has become a lethal weapon in the hands of fanatics, a meeting of the European Union with Ankara provides a unique opportunity to reverse the course of events and turn confrontation into coexistence.
To those who are currently concerned that as a result of Turkeyâs accession to the European Union we will have common borders with Iraq and other Middle Eastern trouble spots, my message would be that we already have such borders today in the very heart of Europe.
These borders exist between civilisations and cultures, and bear no relation to geographical boundaries.
This is also true in the case of Islam, which is present in Europe in the form of many millions of believers.
I refer to Muslims who were invited to join the European workforce in the 1960s.
They became a major group of our continentâs inhabitants, yet they were not offered a model of integration and coexistence that would have allowed them to identify with their new homeland.
This is therefore a problem that we are already experiencing in the very heart of Europe.
During negotiations, Turkey will need to demonstrate its honesty with regard to the Copenhagen criteria, as well as the approach it intends to take to issues relating to religious freedoms, the status of women, acknowledging the Armenian genocide and opening the border with Armenia. This will also provide an answer to those who suspect that Turkeyâs accession to the EU would reduce the armyâs influence on public life, when the army has always been a guarantee of the stateâs secularity.
The opening of negotiations with Turkey ought to make it apparent to the European Union that Ukraine is an equally important and strategic partner for the EU.
Ukraine should also receive a clear, rapid and credible prospect of cooperation with and accession to the European Union, and it should receive this as soon as possible.
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated a remarkable degree of determination in their commitment to democratic values. They must and should now receive from us an answer commensurate with that determination.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Eurlings has received a great many congratulations this evening and rightly so, because his report is complete and absolutely balanced.
I believe that this report should be supported.
However, it should be made clear that Turkey, just like any country seeking membership, needs to realise that it has not only rights, but also obligations.
The citizens of Europe demand of Turkey respect for international law and convergence with the constitutional, economic, political and cultural .
I would mention the need for full respect by Turkey of human, minority and religious rights and full implementation of the Copenhagen criteria.
Furthermore, I do not understand the paradox of the Turkish stand, which calls for the vote of a Member State which it does not recognise.
Finally, Turkey needs to realise that its European prospects depend, first and foremost, on Turkey itself and on the stand which it will maintain on a large number of issues.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly I wish to thank MrÂ Eurlings for having successfully completed an extremely difficult task.
It is late in the debate.
Most things have been said, and many wise points of view have been put forward.
It is difficult to cover the whole issue in two minutes.
There is no point in even trying, so I am selecting two points in the human rights sphere that are close to my heart, especially because I sit on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Firstly, rapes are committed at police stations, according to Lawyers Without Frontiers.
Women dare not report the rapes because of the risk of worse treatment in the form of reprisals.
The day that Turkey becomes an EU Member, it is imperative that such things no longer occur.
The other area in which I should have liked to have seen stronger wordings is that of education.
In spite of the fact that hundreds of new schools have been started, there are large areas in which, because of male resistance, more than half of all girls aged between seven and thirteen are prevented from going to school and learning how to read and write.
When Turkey becomes a Member, hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of pretty and young illiterate women will become citizens of an EU in which good education is crucial to a normal standard of living.
Their ability to provide for themselves will be extremely limited.
Women must be allowed to go to school now if, in the future, they are to be EU citizens.
There are many good reasons for Turkish membership, but it is up to us â the present Members â to keep up the pressure for reform throughout the whole negotiating process.
Under those circumstances, Turkey will be very welcome.
Â Â  Mr President, what is the purpose of the vote on 15Â December on this report concerning Turkey?
It is not a matter of rewarding the rapporteur, although he merits my highest esteem.
Nor is it a contest between two teams: the unwavering supporters of Turkish accession and those who say that there must be an alternative to full accession and already have one in mind and want to put a name to it.
In such a contest, both teams are always liable to score an own goal.
Nor is it a matter of simply echoing the shouts of the crowd in the stands, since these are largely fuelled by emotion.
It is quite simply the last opportunity of the European Parliament to convey a final message to the Heads of Government in the Council before they take their decision on the start of negotiations with Turkey and to make their decision as difficult as possible.
The point is that the unquestioned desire of the Erdogan Government to enact reforms contrasts with the reality of social conditions in Turkey, resulting in part from political conflicts, whether in connection with the Armenian or the Kurdish problem, and these conditions are incompatible with our objectives and criteria.
It is no coincidence that Kurdish representatives in Paris have chosen this precise moment to demand autonomy for the Kurdish areas in south-eastern Anatolia.
The very prospect of negotiations being launched and of possible Turkish accession to the EU, in other words, could actually fuel the conflict between Turks and Kurds instead of defusing it.
By shifting its frontiers to Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Caucasus, the EU would forfeit the that has always separated it from some of the worldâs most dangerous trouble spots. This is something else the Council must consider.
The Turkish leadersâ accusation that the EU is imposing special conditions on Turkey for the negotiation process must give us pause for thought too, because it is not the EU that is applying to accede to the Republic of Turkey â quite the reverse.
The atmosphere on the eve of the decision on accession talks could not be worse.
A process culminating automatically in accession without any other options would be damaging to both the EU and Turkey itself.
We parliamentarians should take the opportunity to put this message across clearly before 17Â December because, should full accession prove unattainable, there must be other means of integrating Turkey into European structures.
Â Â  Mr President, the Chamber is already almost empty, and the arguments have nearly been exhausted.
I do not wish to return to the issues raised by all the earlier speakers, or to all the previous arguments. One can see both sides to all of the latter.
The situation is somewhat reminiscent of the nature of philosophical doctrines, when if all the arguments are analysed, and an attempt made to find the original source of the philosophical system, it ultimately becomes clear that we all differ in terms of personality.
What happens is that at some point a certain detail of personality or character determines whether one marvellous philosophical treatise comes about or another, equally marvellous one.
In the case at hand, it appears to me that there is a clear division of those sitting in this Chamber.
Some view the possible accession of Turkey to the EU with hope, whereas others regard it with fear, and this is only natural.
Those who regard it with fear use the geographical argument, stating that Turkey is in Asia, for example.
Those who regard it with hope use the rules of the tennis court. In tennis, if a ball hits the line, it is just as much âinâ as if it had been in the centre of the court.
This is indeed one way of looking at things.
For me, the decisive factor regarding this issue has been the opinion of those working for human rights movements both in Turkey and outside.
I have in mind MrsÂ Zana first and foremost, but also many others who stress the negative aspects of the situation in Turkey in their reports, but who also state that membership of the European Union offers a chance for things to change.
This is an absolutely crucial issue, and people inside the country must be asked for their opinion.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not all opposed to Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, and not all countries are opposed to such an accession.
In a survey recently carried out in Poland, 72% of its citizens were in favour of a further enlargement of the European Union.
We are dealing with a fundamental difference.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleague, MrÂ Eurlings, for his excellent report, which takes account of different points of view.
Although I myself am more critical of Turkeyâs accelerated accession, I nevertheless lend my strong support to adopting MrÂ Eurlingsâs report.
What amazes me most about Turkeyâs membership is the great haste in which it is being pursued.
Many experts predict that the political strength to say no to Turkey will not be found anywhere in ten yearsâ time, even if she did not meet the conditions of membership.
This haste could prove to be a big mistake.
In Turkeyâs case, we cannot turn a blind eye to the matter of human rights.
The conditions relating to human rights and those of minorities must be fully met before membership can be approved.
I myself am also worried by how much Turkeyâs membership will cost, and the fact that nobody seems to know this.
External estimates suggest quite enormous sums of money.
The contributions by the current net contributors would grow substantially. This in turn could increase public dissatisfaction with the EU.
After Turkey has joined, the Union will no longer be the same EU as it is now.
For that reason, our citizens should have the right to express their own opinions about the issue.
We should encourage the Member States to organise referenda on it.
I fear that Turkeyâs accelerated accession is too big a mouthful to swallow, and that the EU is likely to choke on it.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for the many remarks I have heard.
The Members of this House have expressed a huge range of opinions.
What virtually everyone in this House believes, if I have listened carefully, is that the decision to be taken by the Council on Friday is a very important one and a very important resolution.
The decision to open negotiations with Turkey is, naturally, important for the European Union, but is just as important for Turkey.
A number of you, including Mr Rocard and MrsÂ Seeberg, have emphasised that throughout this discussion, we should also sufficiently highlight the benefits that will eventually accrue if Turkey joins us. These are benefits for the public both economically and in terms of security.
Many have expressed their concerns as well.
I can say that some of the concerns I have heard here are also concerns that are important in the European Council and are discussed there at great length, as the General Affairs Council, in fact, did this morning .
A much-heard concern, and one that is also discussed in the Council, is the situation relating to human rights, torture, religious freedom and the position of minorities.
Those are concerns that have been expressed from many quarters, including Mr Poettering and Mr Brok, and â if I can put it that way â also from the other side, by MrÂ Schulz and Mr Lagendijk.
It is those concerns, among others, that form the underlying consideration for our hope to be able to reach an agreement on Friday about a new negotiating framework on the basis of the proposals tabled by the Commission for a new way of negotiating which will offer better guarantees for the negotiating process running smoothly.
One of the important new elements in this is the option of suspension, which has also been suggested by some of you, and which can be very relevant precisely in the case of violations of human rights and the other aspects I mentioned.
Mr Duff specifically asked for the procedure to be explained.
He asked whether a single Member State might request suspension or whether this has to be done by one-third of the Member States.
I can inform MrÂ Duff that the presidency suggests â again based on the Commission proposals â that one-third of the Member States be required to submit the request for suspension, that is to say to request the Commission to submit a proposal to that effect.
The Commission should therefore table a proposal which will be decided upon by qualified majority.
I therefore share some of your concerns and would emphasise that the majority of the Commissionâs sound proposals will for that reason be adopted in the proposals which we will now be submitting to the Council and on which decisions will be taken on Friday.
Finally, I would like to repeat what Mr Lagendijk and Mr JaÅowiecki said in this connection.
Many human rights organisations and other civil society organisations in Turkey emphasise that there are indeed many other areas of concern and that a great deal is yet to be done, but that, at the same time, it is of the utmost importance for the positive step to be made now and for negotiations to be opened.
I should also like to mention a concern which I do not share and which, fortunately, has been mentioned by few, namely religion.
I am in total agreement with some of you, including Mr Schulz and Mrs Bonino, who emphasised that the European Union is about values and not about religion.
A European integration project is not a religious, but a political project.
Another concern that I share has to do with the discussion about Cyprus and its recognition by Turkey.
A number of you have mentioned this aspect, including Mr Beglitis, who explicitly asked what the presidencyâs thoughts were on this.
On Friday, the presidency would like to achieve formal recognition by Turkey of the fact that Cyprus is a Member State of the European Union and that it is one of the Twenty-Five countries forming part of the EU.
That can be done by signing the protocol to the association agreement.
Yet another concern that was raised by various Members, including Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr Pahor, relates to the EUâs absorption capacity.
Not only Turkey must be ready, also the European Union must be capable of receiving an acceding country well.
Since I share this view, the presidency will try to include the EUâs absorption capacity in the conclusions.
A sensitive, yet important, point that was mentioned by many is the open-ended nature of the negotiations.
That is an important point, and precisely because of its sensitive nature, it will also be discussed at great length in the European Council, where the final decision will be taken.
Needless to say, I cannot make any predictions, but I can say two things about it
On the one hand, it must be absolutely clear, as the presidency has constantly emphasised, that we are discussing accession negotiations.
The negotiations have no objective other than discussing accession negotiations.
That is an essential element, and should also be reflected in the Councilâs words and conclusions on Friday.
On the other hand, it is, indeed, an open-ended process.
Nobody can guarantee what will be the outcome after all that time, and we must realise that we could be faced with a situation where it transpires that no result has been achieved.
In this respect too, we are mainly guided by the suggestions already made by the Commission.
I should like to conclude with a general observation.
I am positive about the possibility of taking this decision, as it is now taking shape, on Friday, and I think that it will be a positive decision.
It will be a positive one because we will then agree to open negotiations with Turkey. That is positive for the European Union, but also â and I should like to add this â positive for Turkey.
The decision, however, will need to contain sufficient guarantees to accommodate the concerns that have been brought here.
Finally, it is also positive because if we as European Council can take Fridayâs decision in this way, we do justice to public involvement.
Mr Poettering, Mrs De Sarnez and many others have underlined the importance of involving the citizen in this far-reaching decision.
I think that by taking the decision in this manner, we can explain to the citizen that an open and extensive debate has taken place in this Parliament and on many other platforms.
We will be able to demonstrate to the public that the step we are now taking is very important for their economic position and their security, but at the same time, that we have taken their many concerns very much seriously.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you and the honourable Members for a very rich, analytical and multi-dimensional debate, which has covered virtually the whole spectrum of European public opinion ranging from future peace dividends to past crusades and, more seriously, from women's rights to religious communities and their rights in Turkey.
I will touch on a limited number of questions that Members addressed directly to the Commission.
First, there have been numerous requests for rigorous monitoring of legal reforms and human rights in general.
I fully agree with this.
The rigorous monitoring mechanism and the annexed suspension clause are indeed at the core of our negotiation strategy with regard to Turkey in the coming years.
It is also very much in the interests of Turkey because it maintains the strong incentive to implement and consolidate the necessary legal and political reforms.
We will be preparing a monitoring report during 2005 concerning the fulfilment of criteria in the field of human rights in general.
These criteria include the issue of trade union rights, which Mr Rasmussen raised.
He referred to an ongoing court case of which the Commission is aware.
We are monitoring this case very closely.
In our report we consider this to be a serious test case with regard to the depth of legal reform in Turkey, which touches upon trade union rights, language rights and the rights of minorities in Turkey.
This also involves the question of non-Muslim religious minorities, which has been addressed in depth by Mr Eurlings in his report and referred to by several Members here this evening.
I would like to underline that although freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Turkish constitution, non-Muslim religious communities nevertheless face a series of structural difficulties, such as the lack of a legal personality and the lack of full economic rights.
The Turkish authorities are committed to adopting a law addressing these structural problems.
A draft law on foundations is currently being discussed and the Commission has been officially invited to submit its comments to the Turkish authorities on this critical piece of legislation.
We will continue to have dialogue and put pressure on the Turkish Government on this particular subject.
Concerning the enforcement mechanism of the suspension clause, to which Mr Duff referred, the origin of the suspension clause lies in the development of the .
The Union now has clauses in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and in the draft Constitutional Treaty that provide for a procedure to deal with cases where a Member State seriously and persistently breaches the basic principles of the Union.
It is only logical and normal that similar rules should also apply to candidate countries.
In fact, it has always been the case even in the past that such serious situations would lead to a suspension of negotiations.
Thus the inclusion of an explicit suspension procedure is based on a new and the Commission will base its proposal on these principles of the Treaty.
Thus I am fully in agreement with Mr NicolaÃ¯ and with Mr Duff.
On the question of the privileged partnership, the instrument of a special partnership is provided for under the draft Constitutional Treaty.
It is intended to give special treatment to neighbours or other partners representing a strategic interest for the European Union.
The idea of the special partnership underlines in particular the New Neighbourhood policy, which the EU seeks to extend to its eastern and southern neighbours.
This initiative does not apply to Turkey, which has been a candidate country since the Helsinki summit in 1999.
It is hard to figure out how any more could be offered to Turkey than it already has under the privileged partnership.
First of all, Turkey and the EU are bound by a customs union which constitutes a far-reaching instrument of bilateral cooperation in the area of trade and economic cooperation, implying a great degree of economic integration.
Second, Turkey already participates in numerous Community programmes in a wide range of areas such as culture, drugs, justice and home affairs, education, research and development.
Third, in the key area of security and defence, Turkey participates as a NATO member â via both NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy â in the development of EU security operations.
For instance, there are Turkish troops in many countries in the Balkans, and even in the 'European army', as one British newspaper recently dubbed the 'Althea' operation in Bosnia.
With regard to the privileged partnership, and as MrÂ NicolaÃ¯ also said, in my view the clear objective of the accession negotiations will and should be accession if Turkey meets all the criteria for membership by the end of the negotiations.
It would not be wise to set any final target date because we have recently learned that schedule should not override substance.
We should set realistic targets, not deadlines that we cannot meet.
Finally, Mr Howitt asked about the start-date from the point of view of the Commission.
Our mandate is to evaluate whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria.
This is what we did.
Concerning the start-date of the negotiations, we trust the wisdom of the European Council, of the Prime Ministers and Presidents to make the political judgement with regard to when in 2005 they deem it appropriate to start the accession negotiations.
From the point of view of the Commission, I can say that we are ready to start work â in the words of Parliament's resolution â 'without undue delay'.
I only hope that somebody will explain to me the difference between 'undue' and 'due' delay.
Nevertheless, we are ready to work without delay once the negotiations have been made and the process can be started.
Mr Swoboda, Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi and several others made the very important point that if we succeed in this long process of negotiations, it should and will make the EU strategically stronger.
This is the fundamental issue at stake here and the strategic, geopolitical and geocultural crux of the matter.
We can learn some lessons from history â we do not have to apply them blindly, but we can indeed learn something.
During the Cold War, Europe contained Communism and the Soviet Union and cooperated in terms of enhancing security and human rights with impressive results.
We can see this from the significant number of colleagues from free eastern and central Europe who are here among us today as Members of this Parliament.
Now and in the future, the challenge is very much the relationship between Europe and Islam.
Europe must, on the one hand, contain Islamic fundamentalism using all the means available and, on the other hand, it must build bridges and dialogue with those representing moderate Islam.
If, after long and difficult negotiations, we achieve a situation where the rule of law genuinely prevails in Turkey, and where European democracy meets a predominantly Muslim population, then that would certainly be an asset for Europe and a very important crossroads of civilisations.
Â Â  âThe debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  The key question in this report is that of support for officially starting negotiations with Turkey.
Such support is based on a series of conditions and contradictions, which, in some cases, are impositions that go beyond the defence of human rights, whereas with regard to the occupation of Cyprus there is unacceptable indulgence, given that this is an EU Member State with part of its territory under Turkish military occupation.
At this stage, which is not yet that of accession, but merely the opening of negotiations over possible accession within ten years, the important thing to ascertain is whether or not the conditions that we always lay down â in terms of how the situation in Turkey is developing, the interests and concerns of its people and the implications for Portugal â are being met.
If we examine the question of fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees, it is true that progress has been made, yet this is more the fruit of the struggle waged by the progressive forces than of pressure from the EU, so much so that even the positive amendments to certain legislation have in most cases yet to become a reality.
It is true that Leyla Zana and her companions have been released, but, according to information from Turkish and Kurdish progressive forces, around 5Â 000 people are still detained...
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second readingÂ (A5-0056/2004), by Mrs Novak, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single Community framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences, the Europass system.
I shall straightaway give the floor to our rapporteur, Mrs Novak.
Â Â  Mr President, one year ago the European Commission adopted a proposal on the rationalisation of European instruments for the recognition of transparency of qualifications and competences.
Europass is this initiative.
It is a step towards a European learning area, as my predecessor said during the first reading.
Europass will help people make their qualifications and competences clearly and easily understood throughout Europe.
It will thus make it easier for citizens to find a job or move more easily from one country to another for studies or work.
The proposal brings together, in a coordinated portfolio called Europass, five existing transparency documents.
These are the Europass-Curriculum Vitae, which will highlight personal competences; the Europass-Language Portfolio, which provides an accurate description of linguistic skills; Europass-Mobility, which records all mobility experiences for learning purposes and replaces existing Europass training while giving it wider scope; the Europass-Diploma Supplement; and lastly the Europass-Certificate Supplement.
These last documents clarify respectively competences behind a higher education diploma and a vocational training certificate.
Europass is an open framework which in future could include other instruments, for instance to target specific competences such as computer-related skills.
I am pleased to know that this essential feature was endorsed and enriched by Parliament, which stressed its importance, as well as by the Council, which defined a clear procedure to put it into practice.
This illustrates how the proposal, without having been substantially changed, has been improved through the exchange of views between institutions, based on the widespread consensus on both its purpose and content.
I wish to stress the remarkable work achieved first by Mrs Zissener and now by Mrs Novak, in close contact with the Commission and the Council.
This work has allowed us to reach this final stage.
The common position adopted by the Council responds to the concerns expressed by both legislative bodies, integrating the amendments proposed by Parliament with only two minor changes that leave their substance unchanged.
As you know, the Commission accepts this common position.
I am therefore pleased that MrsÂ Novak's report proposes accepting this common position, which would allow its entry into force on 1Â January 2005.
I intend to go further, proposing to Member States and social partners an appropriate instrument to facilitate the transparency of qualifications.
We hope the European Parliament will support the Commission in its efforts.
Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education, for its efforts to speed up the process especially at this second reading phase.
I also express my gratitude to both the Irish and Netherlands presidencies of the Council for all their work.
Europass is a direct service to citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my thanks to Mrs Novak and her predecessor, MrsÂ Zissener.
The Europass is a European record of achievement with which, I am glad to say, we have been able to take a small but important step forward after all the fine words about taking government to the people.
First of all, it creates transparency throughout Europe for all periods of education and training, for skills acquired in all walks of life.
Secondly, it creates credibility through the certification and recognition of occupational and extra-vocational experience, including voluntary work in the realms of social welfare, culture and sport as well as the acquisition of various linguistic skills.
Thirdly, it creates efficiency, because it fosters understanding and recognition of qualifications and skills for an ever-increasing number of young and not-so-young people.
More than ever before, we need to take government closer to the people, and we need fewer eulogies to a technocratic and bureaucratic virtual Europe.
We need tangible instruments, of which the Europass is a prime example.
It is a resource for peopleâs everyday lives.
It lets people experience Europe at first hand on a daily basis, wherever they are.
All measures in the field of education policy, such as Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig, e-learning, the mutual recognition of diplomas and now the Europass, add value to Europe by lending it a human dimension.
This injection of soul into Europe, which puts individuals at the heart of the debate and makes them the focus of decisions affecting their everyday lives, is important.
The Europass is a key element, not only in terms of the comparability and recognition of professional achievements but more especially because it includes voluntary social and civic involvement in the catalogue of acquired skills.
I should like to congratulate the Commission and all of us here for having created this really good mechanism in such a short time â less than a year â and I very much hope that, along with the other improvements envisaged by Commissioner FigeÄŸ, we shall have a good platform from which to launch the Europass next year.
I wish him, and hence our young people too, every success.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, with the Europass we have created a supplementary instrument that can help us in the pursuit of many aims, including the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, which we have been discussing extensively.
We know that this aim has slipped down the list of priorities and that we should present it in a far more progressive manner than is currently the case.
As for this Europass, although it is a âsoftâ form of evidence of qualifications and competence with no binding force, it is still very important and helps young and mobile people on training courses who spend training periods abroad to obtain a transparent and comprehensible summarised record of their achievements, qualifications and acquired skills with more or less full comparability throughout the EU.
This, at last, is a sign of the transparency we are always invoking.
At the same time, the Europass is intended to give future employers within the European Union an overview of a young personâs experience and qualifications.
The extended collection of documents, which, as you know, comprises a curriculum vitae, a mobility pass and other papers, is a standardised supplementary instrument.
This new framework, which guarantees that new documents in the field of information technology, for example, can be incorporated into the Europass portfolio in future, is very important, because education is always full of innovations, and the Europass will have to accommodate them.
I am very grateful for this flexibility.
I should also like to refer to the value of periods spent in other countries, and I believe that the documents should not only record dates and technical details but should also include explicit and retraceable references to intercultural learning experiences and social integration.
The EU stands for openness and mobility.
It encourages and demands mobility.
For this reason, I proposed that people be issued with an introductory guide to mobility.
This proposal, unfortunately, has been watered down by the addition of the phrase âwhere appropriateâ.
May I ask that issuing such a guide be deemed appropriate in very many cases, because that, to me, would be a real sign of government being taken to the people.
Moreover, I believe that the national Europass agencies should be integrated into existing agencies and that these should be developed with a view to pooling the experience, activities and networks of existing institutions.
We should also launch an information campaign.
The first of January will soon be here, and there is still a widespread lack of awareness.
There is therefore an urgent need to mobilise in the cause of mobility.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr FigeÄŸ, we often hear in this House about achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
We also often hear about delays in meeting targets.
We are halfway through the period by the end of which we are aiming to be the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs.
If Europeâs position in the knowledge-based economy is to be cemented, the appropriate conditions must be created.
European systems of education and specialist training must meet the requirements of the new economy and must be able to interconnect.
Opportunities for education and specialist training must be offered in the different Member States and at different stages in the lives of young people, whether unemployed or employed, who are threatened by the fact that rapid technological changes might render their qualifications worthless.
Today, this single Framework for the Transparency of Qualifications and Competences make it easier for citizens to inform Europe of their qualifications and competences.
This framework will make the existing system of using documents better coordinated, more streamlined and more effective for the transparency of qualifications and competences accepted at European level.
Many employers and head teachers are aware of the current problems with the assessment of levels of knowledge and skill achieved within an uncoordinated framework of different qualifications, certificates and diplomas.
The introduction of the Europass will make it easier for workers, students, employers and educational institutions to operate in the European labour and education market.
Â Â  Mr President, the common position for adopting the Parliament and Council decision on the Europass seems eminently sensible, and one wonders why it took so long to achieve it following the completion of the single market 12 years ago.
The difficulty is not in adopting this proposal but in implementing it.
Mrs Novak's explanatory statement helpfully highlights the role envisaged for the national Europass centres to coordinate all the activities laid down by this decision.
But this is not some detailed administrative role.
If the proposal is to have the maximum benefit, implementation entails direct and continuous contact by the national Europass centres both with universities and colleges and also with employers' organisations.
I wonder whether, in his reply to the debate, the Commissioner might dwell on this point and indicate how he sees the national Europass centres successfully undertaking this work?
The other â related â point I wish to raise is the question of monitoring the system.
The initial evaluation period will now take place after three years â originally it was proposed after four years â and thereafter at intervening four-year timescales.
I would have thought it unlikely that after the initial evaluation period radical changes would be made; so what that really means is that it is not until the system has been up and running for seven years that the Commission is going to be able to take a view on it.
That seems rather a long way off.
I wonder whether the Commissioner might dwell on that point as well?
Â Â  MrÂ President, may I add my thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Novak for her excellent, rapid and, above all, pragmatic work.
My thanks are also due to the Commission for its initiative.
This is an area of our activity to which the people of Europe, especially our young people, can relate and from which they can derive many benefits.
With such initiatives we can show young people that the Community makes tangible improvements which affect their daily lives.
It is certainly a good example of the people-centred policy we need to pursue.
The document on the table is the fruit of a lengthy development process, and I should stress that it is not the final word, for the Commission has also stated clearly that the scope and potential for development must be preserved, and indeed the document itself provides for an open-ended process.
Specific initiatives in the field of education, of course, were already being launched back in the sixties and seventies.
The aim was always to enhance the quality and mobility of students and trainees without seeking to harmonise European education policies.
It goes without saying that we must accompany such measures with instruments and incentives to make cross-border education a feasible option.
Particularly for residents of territorially smaller countries with many borders, these initiatives are an important point of entry to the single European market.
The aim must therefore be to introduce further improvements, which means clearing away a significant amount of red tape and, most importantly, involving business and labour organisations and making the system easier and cheaper to manage, especially as regards documentation.
More exchanges of young trainees must be encouraged at every level, with primary importance attaching to financial support.
This is the only way for us to achieve the Lisbon objective and, in particular, to increase public satisfaction with the Community.
In conclusion, let me simply add that more than 200Â 000 young people have already taken part in these mobility programmes in recent years, and this is the direction in which we should seek to progress.
Â Â  . Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to respond to several points.
Of course I should begin by expressing my thanks for the support given to the concept and to the process itself.
EUROPASS is a good initiative and I am convinced that it will bear fruit.
Our actual approach has a deadline of next year but as early as tomorrow morning I am travelling to Maastricht, which is hosting a large conference of ministers of education and vocational training.
This will be followed by a conference with our economic and social partners, the aim of which is to promote still further the Copenhagen process, which is a constituent part of the Lisbon Strategy.
In January, under the Luxembourg Presidency, we want to launch a campaign to apply EUROPASS in the individual Member States.
The current network of so-called experts and consultants for EUROPASS correspondents will be changed to a network of national centres for EUROPASS.
Our agencies in the various countries will be required to prepare for the transition to national EUROPASS centres.
I believe that the resources which the Commission has earmarked for the years 2005 and 2006, although modest, have been directed precisely towards support for the concept of EUROPASS.
The sum of EUR 2 million per annum will not only help us to visualise this possibility but will increase its effect in that it will start to be used as a credible document for the transparency of qualifications within the European Union.
As Mr Beazley said, the single market does indeed demand much greater opportunities for the movement of labour and also for the movement of students, those people who are in the process of gaining qualifications.
I am sure that this further step taken towards the recognition of qualifications other than the regulated ones should not take as long as some of the processes did in the past in building up compatibility in the single market area.
I would also like to add to what Mrs Prets said, namely that support for intercultural dialogue will increase and that anyone who can find their feet in a broader cultural environment and who masters the language and culture of a particular country will have the same comparative advantage.
The enlarged European Union needs all of this to become a reality.
I think I have said enough.
I would like to thank you once more for allowing me the opportunity to participate in this discussion and I would like to wish you and all of us every success.
Thank you very much, .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the Commissionâs strategic political orientations.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the four weeks that have passed since my team was given your support, we have rolled up our sleeves and set to work.
Our main objective has been to draw up proposals for a common vision to govern the activities of Parliament, the Council and the Commission over the coming years.
This vision will flesh out the partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security, which I announced here last July.
It will identify the main economic, social and environmental challenges upon which our success will depend, and it will put forward priorities and solutions.
It cannot be a unilateral exercise, however.
This is why this debate is important.
This is why I am here today to listen to you.
I want to hear Parliamentâs proposals, as they will be an essential contribution to our joint thinking.
I want to hear the concerns and, through you, to get to know the opinions of the millions of Europeans that you represent.
Why is that so important?
Because I am sure that the success of this Commission, of this Parliament and of the European project that we share depends on our showing that the European Union can make a difference, both within our borders and without.
Just as we are now preparing to ratify the European Constitution, we must not forget Europeâs remarkable achievements: half a century of peace and of social and economic development, as well as the recent enlargement representing the reunification of our continent.
We must not, however, underestimate the challenges that we face and that require a Europe-wide response: the increasing age of our populations, the damage done to the environment and the effects of climate change, the need to adapt our economy to the competitive context of globalisation, and the threats to our peace and security.
Today I do not intend to present a detailed account of our work in progress before listening to you; I would, however, like to outline the main elements of our approach.
To connect the European Union with its citizens we must earn the confidence of Europeans every day by providing answers to their concerns.
Their main worries concern the economic and employment situation.
There is no freedom, no future, if you are not able to earn a decent living and to secure the future of your children.
We need a strong, stable and dynamic economy to generate more jobs and more opportunity.
The main question is: how?
We do not need another library of comprehensive studies to answer that question.
The work has already been done.
The Lisbon strategy is both a diagnostic and a list of tasks to perform.
As I said in this House in July and in November, I intend to make it a top priority of the action of the Commission.
A knowledge-based economy will be at the core of such a strategy.
For the time being it may look too much like a catalogue of worthy aims, but the Commission wants to reshape it and transform it into a road map for prosperity, identifying clear objectives and a demanding calendar.
This must be done with the Member States, who share the responsibility for implementation, and in a constructive dialogue with the social partners.
Economic growth is not an end in itself.
Europeans are concerned about the sustainability of our social model â our solidarity mechanisms, health and pension systems.
They care about the quality of life and their environment.
The only way to secure these goods is to generate the necessary resources to that end, and therefore to secure economic growth.
Otherwise this will remain an affordable luxury for only some of our citizens.
Europeans are also concerned about their personal security.
Crime is not limited to the boundaries of our Member States.
Terrorism is the ugly face of globalisation.
We need safer streets and a safer continent.
The Commission will actively promote initiatives to provide our citizens with a better level of personal security and therefore of personal freedom.
What are our means?
We must back our ambition with the necessary financial resources at European and national level.
We will not be a true Union without a vigorous cohesion policy.
We must complete the internal market on the basis of clear and simple regulations.
We need better regulation and have to be ready to roll back unnecessary red tape.
We can also do this by supporting our strategic objectives with a new way of working inspired by the Constitution.
All this must amount to a positive agenda for reform.
But all this will not be achieved in a vacuum.
The Union is not an isolated entity.
It is not a fortress.
A number of states want to join our Union.
We should prepare ourselves to welcome them in the same way as they make efforts to meet our demanding standards.
We also have neighbours and we need to better structure our relationship with them, to tackle common problems and promote stability.
We have partners in the entire world with whom we are united by strong cultural and economic ties.
Europe cannot be selfish.
We have a duty of solidarity with the poorest regions of the world, particularly Africa.
Our values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights imposes on us the responsibility of promoting them worldwide.
Only by strengthening our values will we be able to defend our interests in the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is present here today to listen to you.
The Commissionâs considerations will draw upon todayâs debate, which will undoubtedly be of great assistance to us in proposing strategic priorities for the entire Union and in concluding the preparation of our work programme for the first year of this Commission.
I shall present these proposals to you at the second plenary session of January.
They will then have to be discussed by Parliament and by the Council so that agreement can be reached on the objectives and priorities for the Union during the first half ofÂ 2005.
I should like to say another word or two about my initiative to develop joint strategic objectives.
One the one hand, the concept of multiannual planning is now enshrined in the Constitution.
It has indeed already been put into practice with the Council and the last Parliament.
For the time being, however, we are solely committed to coordinating the planning for the three institutions, without going as far as coordinating our strategic visions for the medium- and long-term future.
On the other hand, although it is true that the previous Commissions presented their vision, this did not always represent the expression of a real partnership with Parliament or the Council.
The practical result was that Europe was being driven without a sufficiently clear roadmap, the consequence being that we were sometimes diverted from our route by external international events and that our priorities changed too much as a result of the political agendas of the different presidencies.
At the very least, therefore, we are duty-bound to do our best to set the medium- and long-term priorities for the entire Union, by which I mean not just the priorities for our institution, but also the efforts that we must make to set priorities for the whole of Europe.
Our joint strategic objectives must act as a global navigation system for Europe for the next five years.
It is clear that we must demonstrate flexibility and show ourselves to be capable of adapting to change.
Nonetheless, our joint objectives will certainly help us to define priorities to be used later to assess the work of our institutions: the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
I am very much looking forward to hearing your contributions and working with you to establish an ambitious agenda for the future of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling our sleeves up.
The difficult and sometimes dramatic weeks involved in confirming the Commission are behind us.
It eventually got a resounding vote of confidence, and our Group voted for it with a large degree of unanimity.
Now is the time to get down to work.
Todayâs debate is a quite new experience, and what makes it so is the fact that the Commission first listens to Parliament.
Mr President of the Commission, I am very glad to hear you say that you wanted to hear what Parliament thinks about the work the Commission will be doing over the next five years.
I am also glad to hear you say that you will be presenting your programme on 26Â January and, in so doing, want to take into consideration as much as possible of what Parliament has to say.
Even as I speak, we are endeavouring to put together this Houseâs common position.
Our Group has tabled a motion for a resolution, which is currently being discussed with the other Groups.
I hope that the House will be able to express an opinion, thus enabling the Commission and â it is to be hoped â the Council, to agree on a five-year programme.
Our group believes that there are five main priorities: if we were able to implement them alone, we would do so, but we cannot, and that is why we always need to be willing to compromise.
The first is economic reforms in the European Union to make for greater competitiveness and more prosperity for the public; the second is to improve security by combating terrorism and crime, securing the European Unionâs external borders, preventing abuse of the asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration.
I might add that this is something that matters also to people who enter the EU illegally, for what is going on in the Mediterranean, with thousands of people dying because the situation there remains unresolved, is a fundamental violation of human rights.
We must join together in attempting to find solutions so that people no longer end up losing their lives in the Mediterranean.
The third priority is a stronger Europe in a safer world, creating greater stability and fostering democracy and human rights.
Fourthly, there is a need to shape a policy that makes a clean environment possible and offers people a better quality of life.
The fifth and final priority is to make the European Union more open, more receptive to new ideas and more democratic, to enable it to work better and with less red tape.
What I ask of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that, whenever putting forward a proposal, you should ask yourself whether it makes for more bureaucracy, whether it contravenes the principle of subsidiarity, and how much it costs.
What I ask, in other words, is that all these things should be taken into account in the Commissionâs administrative practice as early as the stage at which proposals are presented.
There are three aspects on which I would like to focus rather more closely.
It is Europeâs competitiveness that determines whether people in the European Union have work and the wherewithal to live.
Our main concern must be to maintain and create jobs, and we can do that only if we make Europe more competitive.
I would urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to be cautious in the language you use, for the language used in the Lisbon Declaration, according to which the European Union was to become the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1950s and 1960s, wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what became of that!
So let us be modest in what we say, but ambitious in what we do.
If you do that, you will be on the right track.
By far the greater part of our Group takes the view that we must not jeopardise the stability criteria that underpin the Stability and Growth Pact, for new debts will have to be repaid tomorrow by those who are the young generation of today, something that would neither make economic sense nor be in line with the policyâs moral foundations.
Something else that is important is the neighbourhood policy.
I would like to encourage you to have us, during your presidency, taking initiatives in the Middle East, seeing as we do that the Americans cannot manage on their own.
The Middle East is a region that is one of the European Unionâs neighbours, and it is worthy of every effort on our part to establish stability and peace in it for both Israel and Palestine.
We know how important all this is to peace and for the sake of good relations with the Arab and Muslim world.
Our priority must be the adoption of the Constitution, on which the European Unionâs peaceful and democratic action in the twenty-first century depends.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to see Mr Barroso again this morning.
Mr Barroso, I have not had the opportunity of speaking to you for a month, have positively longed to see you, and it is good that you are here to listen for ideas to take away with you.
I am also glad to see Mrs Kroes sitting behind you; I will readily admit that it gave me pleasure to see that the first thing she has done, after all that has happened here, is to submit one of the decisions taken by Portugalâs Government under Mr Barroso to critical scrutiny â a good indication of her independence.
Mr Poetteringâs references to Nikita Khrushchev are getting more frequent.
The reason for this, which I can divulge to the House, is that Mr Poetteringâs doctorate was on Konrad Adenauerâs security policy.
Like much else in his politics, Adenauerâs security policy was guided by the motto of âno experimentsâ.
I can tell Mr Poettering that âno experimentsâ will not get the European Union very far.
So let me encourage you, Mr Barroso, to be cautious only in the words you use, but bold in what your Commission proposes and in the initiatives it takes.
I want now to seize the opportunity to give you, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, three essential messages to take away with you; in previous debates, I have described them as the three key elements in our policy in this House.
Before I repeat them, let me give you â for you are here to listen â some more good advice, which is that whatever initiatives you take will need broad majority support in this House.
I therefore take it as read that you will take what the Socialist Group says on board and that it will also be reflected in the initiatives you put forward.
You will of course understand that any programme from the Commission that is flawlessly constructed and draws on neo-liberalism or conservative thinking while devoid of any social democratic elements will not get any support from us.
Let that be quite clear.
If we want economic policy in the European Union to be guided â as Mr Poettering put it â by economic reforms, then, just so we can make it clear where the faultlines are that divide consensus from conflict, I can tell you â Mr Poettering, Mr Barroso â that such economic reforms, always and above all, add up to one thing.
They must, indeed, help to make the European Union more competitive, but they must also, and above all, help to promote social cohesion in Europe.
The two are different sides of the same coin.
Those who believe that competitiveness demands that Europeâs workers should have fewer rights will have energetic resistance from our Group to contend with.
To take an example, the Services Directive will give you an early opportunity to show us whether this Commission is willing to bring the two together.
Competitiveness must be emphasised as much as possible, but social cohesion is absolutely indispensable as the basis for everything we do.
Mr Poetteringâs second point, in which he mentioned anti-terrorism in the same breath as asylum and immigration, struck me as combining two quite different phenomena in a dangerous way.
Combating terrorism is one of the European Unionâs core tasks, but please do not lump it together with illegal immigration and asylum policy.
I am sure you do not in fact intend to do so, but please make the distinction!
Counter-terrorism has little to do with asylum and immigration, but asylum and immigration form one single task, one of European policyâs pressing concerns.
For that reason, Mr Barroso, I believe that the good proposals that have already been made â years ago, by Commissioner Vitorino as part of the Tampere process â should again feature in your programme.
The Europe we expect â and this is what our group is striving for â is both humane and concerned to guard its citizensâ security, one whose external borders are secured as consistently as possible, but which also treats humanely those who need our protection.
We talk about a clean environment and need a sustainable policy for it, but we also have to set out in plain terms what has again become apparent in Buenos Aires over the past week, that the failure of a sustainable worldwide policy for the environment is not the European Unionâs doing.
One of the Commissionâs core tasks must be to spell out the fact that, for as long as the United States of America fails to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, for as long as it does nothing to help reduce the production of CO2, we Europeans must be tireless in demanding that it should do so.
That is one of your core tasks as President of the Commission.
My third point, Mr Barroso, is another message for you as you prepare your programme; it has to do with Europeâs putting down roots and establishing its place in the world.
A model of democracy founded upon multinationality and multi-ethnic structures, which is what the European Union is, can be a winner when it comes to exporting peace to the world, because balance and acceptance are at the heart of the European Union â the balance between large and small and the acceptance of minorities in particular.
If you base Europeâs international policy on this message that we seek internal balance â as we are at the moment helping to do in Ukraine â and that we seek political rather than military solutions to ethnic conflicts, then you will always have the Socialist Group on your side.
Â Â  Mr President, the ALDE Group supports the Lisbon process as the best way of achieving a competitive European economy and it maintains that sustainable economic development has to be a guiding principle in all future regulatory initiatives.
Cohesion and social development are necessary, but do not take place in Europe today.
A knowledge-based society is necessary, but is not a reality in Europe today.
We have to increase funding for research and development and we also have to do a lot more work on lifelong learning.
Technical development with regard to environmental concerns is necessary, and this does not take place in Europe today â at least not in the way it could and should.
Fundamental human rights, the rule of law and gender equality are what the European citizen want to achieve: that is the sound basis of economic growth.
I therefore urge you, Commissioner, not to mix up the fight against terrorism with human rights and the concerns for human rights.
Furthermore, active participation in the labour market makes a substantial contribution to a decent standard of living, regional development and social cohesion, although investment in education and research, as well as government action in cases of serious market failure, also have a key role to play.
Each minister of finance in Europe today is taken up to the mountain top with all the temptations of undermining the Growth and Stability Pact.
Sometimes the reaction is the same as that of the famous Swedish actress who once said: 'I do not have to be drawn into temptation, I can walk by myself'.
The ALDE Group firmly believes that a robust and dynamic economic environment in the European Union can only come about if the new Commission commits itself to reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact so that it provides a strong bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility, while maintaining the necessary flexibility to ensure that Europe maximises its growth potential without endangering price stability.
The ALDE Group is fully prepared to cooperate with the Commission along this very stony path that we have to walk together, but this must be based on sustainable development.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that during todayâs debate many fellow Members of various political groups, some of them quite unexpectedly, have spoken at length about sustainability.
I believe that such interest is important, since I am sure that this issue will become a genuine priority for the Commission too.
At a time when many citizens have a growing distrust of the European project, the main strategic objective of the new Commission and all the other Community institutions ought to be to return to being visibly effective in improving the quality of life for citizens, to become a positive instrument for democratic growth both within and outside the European Union and to transform the Union into an area of technological innovation focusing on ecological and social sustainability.
We believe that three commitments are necessary to achieve these goals.
The first relates to consistency in terms of the objectives established and the capacity to ensure they are achieved.
Therefore, we strongly urge the Commission to be more determined in taking into account the EUâs key commitments, such as sustainability, social cohesion and gender equality, in all its policy proposals, and to make a real commitment to restoring a balance among the three Lisbon Agenda pillars â economic, social and environmental â in order to avoid promoting inflexible economic objectives at the expense of the quality of our citizensâ individual lives.
We call on the Commission to put forward bold proposals for a coordinated effort to give fresh impetus to investment in environmental technologies and measures to promote employment.
As far as competitiveness is concerned, we would like to see the relevant indicators extended to include qualitative, social and environmental indicators too, such as income distribution, poverty and energy efficiency.
We think that consistency is also measured in terms of the capacity to ensure that the commitments undertaken are complied with.
We know that a very large number of Member States are not complying with the Kyoto Protocol targets and we therefore believe that the ways in which the Commission will help these countries to comply with the protocol are an important ingredient in achieving consistency.
On this point, we would like to relaunch our old proposal for a climate stability pact, which would lay down a joint management system for the Kyoto commitments that would be not merely repressive but also positive.
The second commitment which we certainly must re-evaluate relates to having the courage to reject an easy conformism that ignores the European Unionâs responsibilities in the world; we must, instead, make Europe a point of reference and a model for those in the rest of the world who are fighting to defend human rights and freedom.
This point is extremely important to us.
We cannot refrain from expressing our thoughts on human rights in China and Russia or on the war in Chechnya for commercial and economic reasons.
We will soon be speaking again about the Dayton accords, now reaching their tenth anniversary.
We need to take action on this point as well, and we hope that the Commission will be able to put forward some positive initiatives.
The third and final commitment relates to the ability to truly represent the interests of the European Union as a union, by managing not to be overly influenced by the power relations between individual countries and with the Council in general, and by finding true alliances between those in the European Parliament, the voluntary sector and business who share the idea that the European Union is much more than the sum of the EU governments.
To this end, we call upon the Barroso Commission to reconsider, and perhaps to withdraw, the Bolkestein directive, to defend the REACH directive tooth and nail, to put forward a new directive on services of general interest, to abandon or at least to review the former Commissionâs policy on GMOs and to take a practical and courageous approach to opening legal immigration channels.
Mr President, in conclusion I would like to mention at least four fundamental points in the interinstitutional agreement which we would like to enter into with you.
The first, of course, relates to the code of conduct for Commissioners and a serious approach to the issue of conflicts of interest.
The second concerns the issue of impact assessment.
New laws should not be assessed arbitrarily but in a way that is based on uniformly applied criteria.
The European Parliament is moving slowly on this front.
We know that companies and the economic world in general are much more active in this field.
We must encourage the Commission and Parliament to assess new laws on the criteria of sustainability and social impact as well.
The third point relates to the reopening of the issue of access to documents.
We are extremely dissatisfied with the current situation and sincerely hope that in the coming years we will succeed in obtaining a positive outcome.
The fourth and final point concerns a very complex issue, of which we will no doubt have occasion to speak again, which is the Commissionâs attitude to contraventions of Community law by the Member States.
We are extremely concerned about the delays that have built up and the fact that the Commission now seems to have practically abandoned this priority, particularly in the environmental field.
We very much hope that in the future the Commission will reconsider this priority, since the credibility of the European Union also depends on its ability to ensure that its laws are obeyed.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, given the dominant political profile of the new Commission, it would be foolhardy of my group to ask it to implement a set of strategic orientations corresponding to our vision for Europe.
Nonetheless, in view of the unexpected strength of the headwinds at the time of his investiture, I should like to recommend that Mr Barroso give his less fortunate fellow citizens a few clear signals to show that he has also heard what they have to say.
The first signal could relate to the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, commonly known as the Bolkestein Directive, to which Mr Schulz and Mrs Frassoni have referred.
This text confirms all of the reservations towards the European liberal model held by the social movements, including the European Trade Union Confederation â and with good reason.
At the very heart of the draft lies the infamous country of origin principle, which is intended to allow service providers to apply the social legislation in force in their home countries in all Member States.
This would constitute a social dumping machine, a sort of flag of convenience covering all services.
My belief is that such a measure will not be accepted by our fellow citizens.
My request is therefore simple, Mr Barroso: withdraw the Bolkestein Directive and initiate a broad debate on the subject.
A second signal could concern the plan to set up holding centres for refugees and migrants on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in other countries outside the Union.
This is an appalling plan.
The last Commission legitimised this move, however, by initiating and financing pilot projects.
Here again, my request is simple: put a complete end to these plans.
The third signal should, in our view, involve the interminable and dramatic conflict in the Middle East.
The Union was jointly responsible for the roadmap providing for the creation of a Palestinian State in 2005.
We are now at the end of 2004 and our undertaking is nowhere near even starting to be implemented.
The main obstacle is Sharon.
No other leader, except, no doubt, George Bush, could violate UN resolutions, scorn the Hague Court and snub the Union as he does without reprisals.
The Commission has just proposed that he should form part of what one Commissioner has called a âring of friendsâ and benefit from the advantages of its new neighbourhood policy.
It should be realised that this measure risks being grossly misunderstood by people who no longer support the policy of double standards.
My request in this case, Mr Barroso, would be that you should remove all ambiguity in this area by answering a twofold question: what are you going to require of Mr Sharon and what measures do you recommend if he persists in ignoring you?
Your responses to these three points will certainly be followed very closely.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Barroso, how nice it is for us to be able to continue our conversation that was so rudely interrupted just a month ago.
You talked this morning about leading in Europe, and there is much talk of five-year plans, of the great visions that you have; but it seems to me that you have one or two problems.
There is the problem of legitimacy, and the Commission has the problem of credibility.
On whose authority are you people the government of Europe?
I certainly have never been asked whether that is what I want.
The total failure of the hearings of the Commissioners that went through this Parliament has cast a very dark shadow over your Commission.
You know as well as I do that the gap between what you want and what the ordinary voters want is getting wider.
That is why the turnout in the European elections in June was down to a record low.
People know that the Lisbon agenda is nothing more than a joke and that the economic model in the European Union is simply not working.
Perhaps the Constitution and the referendums that we are going to have offer us both a chance for a solution; but they must be free and fair referendums.
I would like your assurance that any information that goes out to Member States in which there are going to be referendums presents both sides of the argument, so that we can have a free and fair result.
Not to do so is to risk long-term public contempt.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment briefly on several points in the order in which they were mentioned by Mr Barroso.
I will start with economic issues.
The Lisbon strategy is a splendid idea, but it has to be remembered that if Europe is to compete with the rest of the world, its economy must be soundly based on freedom.
Much has been said in this House about the need for a knowledge-based economy and for an economy based on social values, and rightly so.
Nonetheless, unless Europeâs economy is based on freedom, it will be unable to compete successfully with the rest of the world.
MrÂ Poettering seemed to be of the same mind, and I endorse the views he expressed.
MrÂ Farage took the words out of my mouth, and there was sound common sense in what he said too.
We must say yes to economic freedom, and it must have priority over everything else.
You referred to the environment, MrÂ Barroso.
It certainly is crucially important to protect the environment.
We must say yes to environmental protection, but no to ideological .
It is not acceptable to be hemmed in by screens when driving through some beautiful German countryside, yet this is what happens to me twice a week.
The screens have not been installed for the benefit of human inhabitants, but to prevent any possible disturbance to animals.
As a result, I am prevented from admiring the landscape, and that is not acceptable.
The wind generators one cannot fail to notice when travelling through the beautiful countryside in the Black Forest area are a similar case.
These useless loss-making monsters are actually subsidised by the German Government and the European Union.
Quite simply, they are detrimental to the environment.
It is important to bear in mind the visual aspect of the environment and not to equate environmental issues with the defence of all conceivable animal rights.
As regards social issues, it must be remembered that there is more to them than democracy and tolerance.
Moral values also have an important role to play.
I am bound to say, MrÂ Barroso, that you gave in to pressure from the Left when you undertook your reshuffle to come up with a new Commission-designate.
Your actions do not bode well for the future of moral values in Europe.
Turning to foreign policy, its scope has to be broader than Turkey and North Africa, MrÂ Barroso.
I am well aware that citizens of the old Union holiday in those countries.
I also realise that citizens of the old Union meet people from those countries as they go about their daily lives back in Europe.
It must be understood, however, that foreign policy also involves what lies beyond the Unionâs eastern border.
Until recently, that was deemed to be the single huge area of Russia.
