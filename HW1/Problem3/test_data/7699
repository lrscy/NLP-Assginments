Yes to protecting our citizens, but no to protectionism that can only impoverish them.
It also serves notice on our partners: we will not be a soft touch; we will defend the European interest.
That means a level playing field; it means ensuring that openness is a two-way street; it means making clear that we will not water down our high standards of health, safety, environmental and consumer protection.
The paper is equally uncompromising when it comes to our values.
We can prosper in the age of globalisation, but we will want to do it our own way.
Our growth will have to be sustainable.
We have set ambitious targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and using renewable energy sources, and we will meet them.
The meeting will provide an important opportunity to restate Europe's leadership role in the run-up to Bali.
We will use our social models to spread the benefits of globalisation throughout our society.
They are among our biggest assets.
They will help our citizens to adapt and equip them for dealing successfully with rapid change.
The tripartite social summit just before the informal European Council will provide an excellent opportunity to set the scene.
It is clear that, today, the European Union offers a route for Europeans to make the most of globalisation, to provide a continental context that individual countries cannot match.
To deliver this European interest, we have a ready-made tool in the shape of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.
Our economic analysis shows that the Lisbon Strategy is beginning to deliver.
The paper points to a number of policy areas that deserve even greater attention during the next three-year cycle up to 2010: education and flexicurity, including more attention to active inclusion policies and adequate social protection; a fifth freedom for ideas and researchers; eco-innovation; a small business act for Europe to help millions of small companies across the EU to grow and create more jobs.
None of this is easy, but it is achievable.
I know that this Parliament will remain intimately involved in following the progress of the Lisbon Strategy at both EU and national level.
Your views on the points sketched out here will be an essential input for the package, which we will adopt in December.
The informal European Council is an important rendezvous at an important time.
Let us use the opportunity to show Europeans that the European Union is looking ahead, shaping its policies to meet tomorrow's challenges and equipping itself with the right tools.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Elmar Brok.
It would have indeed surprised me if you had taken nine minutes.
The next speaker is the representative in the Intergovernmental Conference, Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the representatives of the European Parliament speak a variety of languages and we belong to different groups, but we are united in the same desire, to move the European Union forward by completing the Lisbon Treaty, a treaty that includes legislative codecision, the unique personality of the Union, progress in the communitarisation of internal and justice policy and external policy, and participation by national parliaments.
We want greater democracy and greater efficiency.
We regret the fact that there is not more transparency, but this is part of the methods of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I have to say that the lawyers - particularly those from Parliament - have enabled us to interpret the hieroglyphics that this exercise has become in a positive way.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to confirm to Parliament something that I understand to be a very clear commitment.
The citizens, who were very unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, have returned to the Treaty on European Union with the wording that it had had since the Maastricht Treaty.
We see this as fundamental, as representatives of the citizens.
I must acknowledge that, in an unusual gesture of political clarity, the President-in-Office of the Council himself told us that this was impossible, but it has been achieved: the first important achievement.
The second one is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the symbol of the identity of European citizens.
Now it is not a declaration - number 11; neither is it a protocol: it is 'the Charter', which we will vote on here next month, formally, with the Presidents of the three Community institutions, before starting the ratification process.
The Charter will be legally binding, and I say this because I believe that it is important for it to be recorded today, because I think that these are absolutely essential conditions for the European Parliament, sine qua non conditions for supporting this treaty.
There are also other elements on which we think progress can be made.
My fellow Member Elmar Brok mentioned the subject of data protection, which is a sensitive subject if ever there was one.
There are some other elements that are very important for us.
One of them is the dialogue between the social partners - which was unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - and another important matter that we believe we are helping with through our support for resolution of confidence problems is to provide security through a declaration, like the Ioannina Compromise, which already exists, but should not go any further.
We do not think it makes any sense in a Treaty on a Union that functions by majority, and qualified majority, to introduce elements of unanimity that would absolutely destroy the process.
I mentioned in Viana do Castelo, as the President will recall, that it makes sense having the atomic bomb if it is not used.
If it is used, it destroys everything.
And I think that this is an important warning.
Mr President, there is a point that is important to Parliament, and I think that I am speaking on behalf of the majority of Parliament, and the majority of the Member States, and very clearly on behalf of those that ratified the Constitutional Treaty, which we sacrificed in order to achieve unanimity, and on this occasion it is very important for us all to work together in mutual loyalty and solidarity in order to achieve ratification.
If not, we would find ourselves in very difficult circumstances.
I think that we all need to remain faithful to the commitment that we have made.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
rapporteur. - Mr President, like my colleagues, I agree that a political agreement is probable at the IGC in Lisbon.
But the thing that concerns us still, of course, is the quality of the agreement.
I have to express concern, at the present stage of the IGC, that we are seeing the emergence of a self-service Europe propelled principally by the British demands for the opt-outs in the field of justice and interior affairs and fundamental rights.
Clearly there has to be a British domestic debate about why British citizens ought to be excluded from the benefits of integration inside all these important fields, but the British should also explain themselves more fully to the IGC.
What is it, precisely, that they are seeking to achieve with all these opt-outs?
Can we be truly satisfied that the arrangements that are negotiated for the management of this pick-and-choose approach will stand up in practice and ensure that common policies in the field of freedom, security and justice will still enjoy proper commonality and the full resources and instruments to carry them out?
Surely the UK and Polish opt-out on the Charter risks subverting the decision to make it binding for everyone else.
I hope that the IGC can be able to examine the question with sufficient care.
Would the Presidency press the British to support the proposal from the Parliament for an escape clause from their unfortunate protocol on the Charter?
The same applies to Ioannina: the Presidency and the Commission should assure us this afternoon that they will not concede to the unreasonable demands to upgrade the Ioannina Clause from secondary to primary law.
Ioannina is the historical descendant of the Luxembourg Compromise; the Luxembourg Compromise was a gentleman's agreement and so it should remain when included alongside the Treaty as a decision of the Council.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to thank Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and Mr Lobo Antunes for their speeches.
The period of reflection and debate to decide the future governance of the EU of 27 is coming to an end.
Have we gained in maturity?
Are we ready to switch from discussion to action?
In June, Mrs Merkel demonstrated a combination of courage, responsibility and political will.
Far from skirting around divisive subjects, we managed to reduce our differences.
The way was finally opened for the European Union to equip itself with the tools necessary to function more effectively.
Three months have gone by and the Portuguese Presidency has kept us on course.
If the roadmap fixed in June is respected to the end, until the European Council in Lisbon, the Portuguese Presidency will be able to secure agreement on the reform of our treaties.
Here I salute the determination of the Portuguese Presidency during the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
For the European Parliament, and in the opinion of our fellow members Messrs Brok, BarÃ³n Crespo and Duff, whom I would like to thank most warmly, the assessment of the IGC is in line with expectations and the agenda set by the heads of state and government has, generally speaking, been respected.
Ladies and gentlemen, though we are prepared to make do with a balanced compromise, let us not forget that it is by default.
Personally, I think it is more worthwhile to highlight the reasons why we support the draft Treaty.
Firstly, we believe that only a united, strong and effective Europe can influence the affairs of a world which is moving so fast, changing, and becoming complex and unstable.
If we support the draft Treaty, it is also because an effective EU of 27 cannot build on the rules of the Treaty of Nice.
Furthermore, faced with the misgivings expressed by European citizens, we have demanded greater democracy and transparency.
We are in favour of a clear division of competences, in favour of increased participation by our fellow citizens in the process of building the EU and in favour of an active role and strong contribution by the national parliaments.
Treaty reform is the correct response to citizens' expectations.
The revised Treaty is a means, not an end in itself.
The form it takes and its name are unimportant.
What counts is its substance and the progress it enshrines for European citizens.
We, the members of the PPE-DE Group, do not want a European superstate.
We only want effectiveness, democracy, transparency and respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
We are demanding effective European institutions capable of making decisions, and as long as national opt-outs are a frequent reality, it is up to us to limit their negative effects to prevent Europe from being paralysed.
Any attempts to block the EU's decision-making process should be ruled out.
Citizens expect Europe to act where it can make a difference: on climate, energy, immigration, innovation, terrorism.
My hope and wish is that this Treaty will enable us to do that, and we will support it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks to Parliament's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Our fellow Members Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, Elmar Brok and Andrew Duff have represented the interests of the European Parliament superbly.
For this I would like to express sincere thanks on behalf of our group.
(Applause)
We have rightly heard from our fellow Member, Mr Daul, that the Portuguese Presidency now has it in hand to bring to a close the necessary work following the abortive attempt at a European Constitution, namely submission of a reworked and revised Treaty, agreeing on the key elements of the reform imperatives among 27 countries in the EU, safeguarding the construction of a united Europe legally and politically at an Intergovernmental Conference now coming to an end, rounding things off at a summit in Lisbon and then bringing them into the intrinsically crucial phase, ratification of this revised Treaty in 27 Member States under the specific legal and constitutional conditions of each country.
I therefore specifically want to emphasise the fact that we can be optimistic about Lisbon.
If we differentiate between what has been achieved at the summit here in Brussels under the German Council Presidency as a mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference, and what was worked out at the Intergovernmental Conference, we can also assume, according to the reports from our representatives, that - with few exceptions - this is almost identical.
As the Social Democratic Group we say: this is how it must be!
As Socialists we cannot and will not accept amendments that date back to before the mandate agreed here in Brussels - this should be clearly stated.
But we assume that we have a draft on the table which corresponds to what was agreed here in June and for which we all commended Mrs Merkel.
When we send this draft on its way to Lisbon, it will be interesting.
The question will then be whether this Treaty will be ratified in 27 Member States and it will then depend on the Members of this House, and we will have a fight on our hands.
We will also have to fight for the construction of a united Europe to be accepted in all the Member States.
I would venture the thesis that a further collapse of this revised Treaty - just as the Constitution collapsed - will be the end of the European Union in its present form.
Anyone who does not want to tread the path of the anti-Europeans sitting here in this House, anyone who wants to follow the path of promoting Europe and its consolidation, is therefore called upon to fight for this Treaty.
I hope, Mr Daul, that all the Members of your group will also do this.
I have slight doubts about this.
I would also tell you what we must keep in mind in this House if the project collapses.
What happens if the European Union does not succeed in its further attempt to secure the revised Treaty?
What lies ahead for the European Union?
Europeans believe we are a large continent of 500 million inhabitants in 27 Member States, a large internal market.
We make up 8% of the world's population.
India has 1.1 billion inhabitants, China 1.3 billion, both these countries together representing one third of the world's population.
If we want to remain competitive in the long-term, if we want to defend what we have achieved socially in Europe, if we want to stabilise the economic base, which is the prerequisite for social justice, then we have to be able to co-exist harmoniously throughout the world.
We can only hold our own throughout the world, however, if this Union is consistent - economically, socially and politically.
It needs this Reform Treaty to do this!
If the EU is broken down into its individual parts, if we follow the nationalists who tell the people we can achieve more on our own than together as 27 countries, then this continent will face bad times ahead!
I therefore hope that what is agreed in Lisbon survives ratification and so we will need to fight.
Anyone who wants peace in Europe, anyone who wants Europe as a factor for peace in the world, anyone who wants economic growth and more jobs and a fairer distribution of wealth in the Union, must strengthen this Reform Treaty, defend it and implement it.
Anyone who does not want this, anyone who focuses on renationalisation, should be told what FranÃ§ois Mitterrand said in this House: nationalism is the opposite of European unity and nationalism in the long-run always means war.
Europe, however, is a concept that grew out of the wounds of war on this continent, and therefore European unity based on a reformed Treaty is the goal of all democrats and progressive powers on this continent.
Good luck, therefore, for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the summit!
But I wish you even more luck for ratification in the 27 Member States.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Prime Minister SÃ³crates must feel like England's Henry V before the battle of Agincourt: hostile governments preparing for a fight, intent on weakening, even perhaps vetoing, treaty reform.
President-in-Office, your Prime Minister must hold firm to Europe's red lines and he must deliver next week a treaty able to underpin a strong, responsive and effective Union.
So it is 'Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more', for what should be the final battle in this constitutional war.
This Parliament will be your foot soldiers.
We know that failure to agree on treaty reform would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.
Why?
Because the status quo has not worked, does not work and never can work.
What Council unanimity means in practice is that essential legislation is either shelved or lowered to the level of the common denominator.
In an increasingly cut-throat, globalising world, where challenges like climate change, migration and terrorism demand radical responses, the lowest common denominator is just not good enough.
It may not be the Constitution but, for all its legalese, the Reform Treaty is a document which can quietly revolutionise Europe.
It develops democracy, putting codecision and qualified majority voting at the heart of decision-making.
It favours subsidiarity, with a clearer division of competences, reinforcing the role of national parliaments and the Union's single legal personality, and it helps transparency, extending the ordinary legislative procedure to cover freedom, security and justice - an area where laws which breach the spirit of a rights-respecting Union have been made behind closed doors for too long.
The draft text of your amending Treaty is not without its faults: the loss of Europe's symbols is a blow to federalists, as is the fudge on voting systems wrought by the Poles.
But we can live with them, so long as the Ioannina Compromise is not anchored in the Treaty for all time.
One thing we cannot live without, however, is a definition of European citizenship in Article 8 of the Treaty of European Union, because citizenship is a symbol which, unlike a flag or an anthem, has a real life, real implications for over 450 million people.
Similarly, calling our Foreign Minister the 'High Representative' is no grave cause for concern, but a High Representative who is merely a puppet of the Council certainly would be.
Parliament and the Commission must unite to ensure that the joint character of the external action service is respected in full, and that the Court of Justice oversees the use of personal data within the common foreign and security policy.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we cannot have two classes of citizen.
That goes entirely against the spirit of European integration and we must do our damnedest to ensure that British and Polish opt-outs are not preserved in perpetuity by demanding a clause allowing revocation without reconvening the IGC.
It is not only opt-outs we must guard against: it is also 'opt-ins'.
If not properly formulated, they could allow governments first to water down, and then to wash their hands of, essential Community laws in justice and home affairs after five years of dialogue and debate.
If certain countries cannot accept reasonable compromise, our message should be this: they should start thinking about an amicable divorce from the Union and cease holding it hostage to their own vested interests, for the interests of Europe must take precedence over these.
(Applause)
So I urge the Council, the Commission and our own representatives, in Shakespeare's words: 'Stiffen your sinews ..., Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height' in defence of our common interest.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, today we are facing the last leg of our work on treaty reform.
If the Lisbon summit is to end in success, we need political imagination.
Those who recognise treaty reform as a priority should ask themselves today especially: is it worth taking a firmer stance on Poland and the United Kingdom; is it worth placing a question mark over the outcome of many years of negotiation?
If we are to believe its advocates, the Charter of Fundamental Rights can only reinforce the binding provisions we already have.
But perhaps those who point to the essentially incalculable consequences of its provisions being used by the European Court of Justice are right.
I have similar concerns, and I therefore entirely understand the reservations expressed by the United Kingdom and Poland.
A major element of the compensation for the losses that Poland has decided to incur along with leaving the Nice system is the Ioannina mechanism and the permanent position of the Polish Advocate General at the European Court of Justice.
The undermining of these settlements is currently raising questions for us about sincerity of intent.
Like any other country, Poland has a right to expect better instruments to scrutinise the EU's legislative process.
The absence of proper legitimation will, after all, bring defeat for the European project in the future.
Lack of scrutiny of the legislative process is not something dreamed up by Eurosceptics or warmongers, as the constantly somewhat agitated Martin Schulz would have it.
It is something that worries sincere Europeans.
The former President of the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe and former President of Germany Roman Herzog asked recently whether Germany was still a parliamentary democracy, considering how many regulations have come into being outside the Bundestag.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days away from the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference we are preparing for the usual night and day of horse-trading, as has always been the case, which will end up, as always, with a compromise tending towards the lowest common denominator.
A look at the various texts - those that we have managed to obtain via pseudo-secret channels, because here very little is done in public - reveals that they are very complicated to read and are certainly user-unfriendly.
The negotiators, however, as we very well know, are not at all interested in being user-friendly, in explaining or in involving their citizens in what ought to be an important time in their democratic lives.
On the contrary, back at the briefing stage we condemned the fact that the argument that 90% of the text of the Constitutional Treaty has been incorporated into the reform treaty cannot conceal the reality of an obscure text, full of annotations and derogations that weaken the European Union, particularly with regard to foreign policy and clarity of law.
This has been a negotiation totally in the hands of the governments, conducted behind the backs of citizens and profiting from the fact that endless linguistic and bureaucratic theorising has prevailed over passion and democratic participation, which for good or for ill had been a feature of the Convention stage and also the referendum stage.
Three of our Members participated in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and followed the work of the jurists, but it cannot be denied that they failed to improve the transparency of the process to any significant degree, and although perhaps they succeeded in reducing the damage done, they were not able to make any specific improvements because they did not have the opportunity.
So, Mr Schulz, Mr Brok, Mr BarÃ³n and Mr Duff, to be honest I do not see the logic behind it.
We ought to act in a considered manner, we ought to consider ourselves jointly responsible for this text and, although obviously I agree that we should try to ensure that the Member States ratify this text - although it now depends on what will happen in the final agreement - why should we go over the top?
According to Mr Schulz, we are supposed to say, even here, among ourselves, that if this text is not adopted it will be a tragedy, because this text is fantastic, because this text here .... this text is horrible!
Anyone reading it can easily see that it is not what the citizens wanted.
Having said that, it is obvious that it is better than nothing.
Having said that, it is obvious that it is better - no Martin, calm down, because I am not saying that I want to reject it - I am merely saying that we ought to be responsible and credible in the eyes of the citizens and that even if this is not by any means a particularly adequate compromise, we will back it.
We cannot lie, though, and we cannot say that this is the best we could manage, because the governments have hijacked this constitutional process from us and have made it what it is today, and it certainly could be much better than it is.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I will not go over our group's general assessment of the new draft Treaty again.
We oppose it, not through nationalism, Mr Schulz, which is something I despise as much as you do, but because none of the basic criticisms that characterised the debates on the old draft Constitutional Treaty - and I am not talking about the symbols of the EU, which we did not have a problem with, but the EU's political thrust - have been taken into consideration.
I get the impression we will pay for this casual approach sooner or later.
Just now, I want to dwell on one specific article of the new draft, which we have already talked about: Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union. There seems to be a broad consensus among us on challenging this, and that is a good thing.
It is, in fact, a sensitive issue: the protection of citizens with regard to the processing of personal data.
Now, the legislative procedure that would apply would not be the same depending on whether these data were being processed within the European Union or sent to a third country.
In the former case, Parliament would have full competence, but in the latter it would have no say at all.
This is a legal monstrosity and a serious denial of democracy.
In fact, it relates directly to the precedent set by the PNR case, where the Council agreed to send the US authorities confidential data on passengers travelling to the United States, despite complete opposition from the European Parliament.
The Council would like to continue with this situation, and is giving itself the means to do so.
This is unacceptable and Parliament should signal this clearly to the European Council.
I will simply add this: this dispute indirectly reveals several facts to which my group has constantly drawn attention.
The first is the little real impact the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have.
In fact, Article 8 of the Charter is devoted explicitly to the protection of personal data, yet this protection is cheerfully violated and will be violated in future too.
Next there is the almost indecipherable nature of some key passages of the treaties, only a very well-informed reading of which reveals this kind of trap.
Finally, there is the deliberate opacity of the work of the IGC, which is as far as it could be from a public, transparent drafting of a text whose purpose is to determine the life and future of the EU of 27 and half a billion citizens.
All this confirms our demand for democracy on two fronts, on the one hand for a major pluralist debate in each country on what is at stake in the treaties, and on the other for ratification by referendum.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, the EU published the new draft Treaty at 5 p.m. on Friday - thus satisfying itself that the media would not write about it at the weekend.
If the objective is to smuggle a treaty in, these are expert media relations - but what scheming, lousy behaviour.
At the last Strasbourg meeting of the Conference of Presidents, the President solemnly promised that all the political groups would have access to all the IGC documents.
We still have not received them.
Three groups have privileged access to the Intergovernmental Conference, whilst five groups are excluded.
This is discriminatory and in conflict with the principle of equality - again, scheming, lousy behaviour.
The new treaty contains 105 new powers for the EU - just like the Constitution.
The right of veto and representative government have been cut in 62 areas as against 61 in the Constitution.
What is new is that 255 pages of changes have now been inserted in 2 800 pages of treaty, making the text unreadable for everyone but nerds - again, what scheming, lousy behaviour.
The new EU constitution will run to 3 000 pages as against the rejected Constitution's 560. This is what came of Sarkozy's so-called mini-treaty.
Imagine going to the people with the issue of a practical mini-treaty and then serving up the rejected Constitution again, but now without a referendum - again, scheming, lousy behaviour.
There is not a single piece of legislation that can be adopted on the basis of the Constitution that cannot also be adopted on the basis of the new Treaty.
The two texts are identical in terms of legal obligations; the difference is the name and the jettisoning of referendums - again, scheming, lousy behaviour.
What wimps!
Come forward with your plans and present them to the electorate.
Sign the petition for referendums at www.x09.eu.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, besides the previous speaker's reservations about the resemblance with a new Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which is being rammed down our throats in a completely undemocratic way, the European Presidency has evidently made it a kind of prime objective to achieve a breakthrough on a common European immigration policy.
The least that can be said in this regard is that such a policy at European level, decided in none-of-my-business cenacles by means of the particularly dubious Commission and Council decision-making with which we are sadly already familiar, would be completely undemocratic.
The immigration problem affects our citizens personally and their private sphere.
Besides, in my view, the transfer of decision-making in this area to European level with no real visibility to anyone is not only undemocratic but plain dangerous.
The Portuguese proposal to 'channel' illegal immigration via legal immigration is too absurd for words.
Illegal immigration must be tackled by means of a 'tit for tat' policy, a firm policy of tracing and expulsion, watertight external border controls, and also European detention and reception centres in the countries, or at least the continent, of origin.
As regards what has been described as the 'absolute necessity' of legal immigration, I should like to point out that Europe already has approximately 20 to 25 million unemployed, among them millions of unemployed immigrants, with all this entails.
A new wave of legal immigration, with all the associated 'family reunifications', would only mean an exponential increase in the particularly serious problems of integration and assimilation.
If it is really only a matter of highly skilled workers - which I dispute - then we are organising a brain drain from the poor countries, which is absolutely scandalous; or is it the intention to keep countries poor and underdeveloped - in which case the Council should just say so?
(PL) Mr President, what is it we are discussing today?
A constitution for Europe.
We are discussing a document under a different name, with different wording, but with the same essential content as the constitution that has already been rejected.
This is an allegedly lower-ranking document, just so that it does not have to be put to referendums.
Here we have the EU's political elites, among them members of this House, the European Commission and national governments, trying to deceive their own electorates and their peoples.
We are supposed to support a Reform Treaty which is in reality the European Constitution, the renamed European Constitution, which the voters in France and the Netherlands rejected in referendums, and a number of other countries failed to ratify within the prescribed time.
Let us recall the words of Angela Merkel, and I quote - use different terminology without changing the legal substance, for example with regard to the title of the treaty, the denomination of legal acts, and the Union's minister of foreign affairs - end of quote.
That is exactly what has been done, and we are being called on to accept this deception.
We must not deceive ourselves and our voters.
(PT) In my speech today, in my own name and on behalf of the Group I represent in this Parliament, I would like to express deep sadness at the passing of Fausto Correia.
He was a man of conviction, but a kind man, a very good man, a man of great solidarity.
He is sorely missed.
Secondly, I would like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has shown determination, and this should be stressed, in not allowing any modification of the objectives of the Treaty, as agreed by the Heads of State and Government.
We are sure it will stand its ground and that we will have a new Treaty before 20 October.
I will therefore say no more.
As regards the Lisbon Strategy, I must congratulate the Presidency and the Commission on having finally realised what we have been saying for ages: unless the Commission is awarded wider powers and responsibilities within the Lisbon Strategy than it was given in 2000, the Lisbon Strategy will not bear fruit.
An appropriate line to take would be to strengthen the Commission's role, making it the pivotal point of the Lisbon Strategy, and we are hopeful that such a fresh approach could eventually bear fruit.
Finally, the inclusion of globalisation in the debate at the forthcoming informal summit is a good sign, because the world in which we live today is about globalisation and we cannot imagine that the summits with Africa or Russia - and we hope they are a big success - or the debate on exchange rates for the Japanese yen or the US dollar do not come under the phenomenon which is globalisation.
It should be pointed out, as the Commissioner did, that it is important to have joint rules in international trade and the opening up of markets, as it is equally important to have reciprocity in our arrangements with other business and trading partners.
That is an important point and for that reason alone, even if that were the only reason, it would be sufficient to sing the praises of this Commission communication.
Mr Lobo Antunes, I wish you every success with the informal summit which will perhaps be one of the most important we have had in recent years in the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, fellow Members, I believe we should commend the Portuguese Presidency for the way in which the negotiations have been conducted: in a very dedicated and targeted manner.
I think it is good that you have adhered closely to June's mandate, with a few exceptions, and staved off the many extra requests, starting with the European Central Bank's request for an article on Austria's desire to limit the number of students from other countries.
None of this is part of the new Treaty and I believe you are on the home stretch.
There is not a great deal now to stop us reaching a consensus on the new Treaty.
The opt-outs are sad.
They give the impression of dissension and inconsistency.
They fragment the EU and are it also takes time to make decisions in the third pillar.
They really are a downer and predominantly what the United Kingdom wanted.
Andrew Duff had talked about a self-serving mentality.
I hope it does not set a precedent.
I believe London's fundamental requests have all been met.
I read with concern what was still being discussed yesterday in the House of Commons.
There is nothing more to be said on this.
It would be totally unacceptable to make even more demands now.
There will be discussion on Poland's request to anchor Ioannina somehow, but the capacity for a blockade cannot be increased.
We do indeed want to increase the capacity to act.
This must remain an exceptional case.
It was a gentlemen's agreement, and it should not become the rule.
I want us with the Commission and Council to be able to proclaim the Charter here in the Chamber with the three Institutions.
That would really be a good signal to send to the citizens.
I would also like see Mrs WallstrÃ¶m's request back again in the Treaty, namely that the citizens are given a right to receive information.
Two thirds of people feel uninformed.
This would be a good addition to the Treaty.
President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the Treaty of Lisbon comes into being.
I thank our three representatives as well as the President who will take care of this at the summit in Lisbon.
Mr President, I note with great regret that citizens' rights are clearly not at the heart of the new Treaty.
Unfortunately, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been sacrificed to the Dutch Government's fear of a referendum.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights must be legally binding in full and for all because the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the application in practice of our shared values.
So, what does an opt-out mean?
Is it an opt-out from those shared values?
Or, does it mean that Poland and the British Government simply pay lip-service to those values but then deny their citizens the means to enforce their rights?
What does an opt-out mean?
Are we not creating a dangerous precedent here?
Let us ask ourselves, will future countries, future Member States, have the same right to an opt-out?
If Turkey, a country that I very much want to join the European Union, asks for an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, will it be granted the same right?
The other issue is that, between the Constitution and the Treaty, an additional, lower standard of data protection has somehow been created - a lower standard that applies to the area of the common foreign and security policy.
I predict that in the future the Member States will try to circumvent data protection rules by labelling, for example, counter-terrorism measures as common foreign and security policy instead of police and justice cooperation.
Finally, I would ask the Commission and the Member States to consider, as soon as the Treaty has been signed, acting in the spirit of the new Treaty and involving the European Parliament as a full co-legislator on matters of justice and home affairs, and rapidly closing the democratic gap that we have been living with for so long.
(PL) Mr President, Heads of State and Government are once again engaged in modifying the way the European Union functions by giving it a new treaty.
This concern for the peoples of Europe and their future is touching.
But we cannot have the decisions of an informal summit replacing the democratic path of referendums held in the individual states on whether to accept the treaty.
It would be a deceit practised on the peoples of Member States who have a right to decide independently on a matter of such importance.
The old constitutional treaty has been subjected to an operation which essentially consists in some slight modification to the text.
This enables the document as a whole to be presented, depending on current political needs, either as an entirely new document, or as the previous treaty with no fundamental changes.
I therefore wish to ask: how do the Council and the Commission define the document in question?
Is this a new treaty, or is it a trimmed-down version of the old treaty, and will the process of ratifying it begin from scratch in all Member States?
(DE) Mr President, anyone who has seen how governments have been attacking the Constitution over the past year, making it unrecognisable and illegible and robbing it of its spirit and European charisma, must acknowledge that all this has nothing at all to do with what the citizens wanted - even those who said no in France and the Netherlands.
Anyone, however, who was able to observe the patience and time spent on what is now happening in the run-up to the Intergovernmental Conference must see that the governments have been attacking the structure of this Constitution like termites with their lawyers and state chancelleries.
Grain by grain, element by element, this Constitution has been dragged out.
I am really wondering why nobody is asking the governments what they are pushing here.
Is it really only their own power, is it really lack of awareness of people's expectations or is it plain nationalism that we see rising again in Europe?
The language!
Today a delegation of Members of the Austrian Parliament asked me: how am I to make your 'yes' to this Constitution comprehensible to anybody?
I cannot read it.
I cannot understand it any more.
I no longer know what the texts, references, footnotes and traps mean.
I believe that at the end of this Intergovernmental Conference a Europe is looming in which for the first time in history people will no longer be able to recognise the political order under which they are living.
And then you will lose a lot of supporters, even those who have fought for this Constitution for many years.
Fundamental rights!
Vice-President of the Commission, you invoke the spirit of compromise.
But why do you not invoke the nature of universal fundamental and human rights, which make it unthinkable for us to form a community of values in which a few states declare 'but I do not belong to this community of values'.
How are we to counter a Mr Putin and tell him: we are a huge community of values in favour of universal human rights - except for a few of us.
This is such a gap in Europe's credibility that we cannot invoke the spirit of compromise here!
This is a completely different spirit.
It is a great political demon that dominates here.
I do not believe that what is happening here at the moment will meet with the citizens' approval, which we no longer intend to seek.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my own sadness, as well as the sadness felt by my group, on the death of our fellow Member, Fausto Correia.
On the subject of reform of the Treaties, the Council Presidency only repeated that it very much hoped to reach a further stage, not the final stage, in the process of recovering the project set forth in the European Constitution.
That is, to take one more step in the process begun at the beginning of June under the leadership of the German Presidency to impose the content of a rejected Treaty by presenting it in another form, trying to move forward by default and against the express wish of the people, which is a real political fraud.
This Treaty is an attempt to pave the way for neo-liberal policies which run counter to social rights and advances gained, serving the interests of the large multinationals.
Federalism is being imposed under the domination of the major powers within a framework which grants legal personality to the Union, where the States are deprived of their powers and the European Union is regarded as a pillar of NATO; that is in order to favour meddling and interventionism in accordance with the interests of the major powers.
It is a Treaty which aims to set up an economic, politico-military bloc with imperialist ambitions.
It is a Treaty which will not overcome the deep and irremediable contradictions of this European integration, but which will, on the contrary, tend to accentuate them.
We, for our part, shall continue to condemn the real objectives of this Treaty, to argue that it needs to be rejected and to demand a broad national debate and consultation of the Portuguese people in favour of a Europe of cooperation on progress and peace between sovereign States which have equal rights.
Finally I would like to express my support for the great demonstration promoted by the CGTP-IN to be held in Lisbon on 18 October next.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whether we rejoice or lament, everyone agrees that the Treaty to be signed in Lisbon is just a recycling of the European Constitution rejected by two referendums in 2005.
As a report yesterday by the House of Commons pointed out, it has everything: the primacy of European law, even secondary law, over national law, even constitutional law; legal personality for the EU, which will allow the Commission to represent the Member States on the international stage; the Minister of Foreign Affairs under another name; the largest transfer of competences in the entire history of European integration; at least forty new subjects; and the vast field of fundamental rights.
Within these walls, where the word 'democracy' is constantly on our lips, I would like to try and appeal to the consciences of you all.
What genuine democracy could think it normal to bring into force a text that the people have rejected in a referendum?
Why should the people be deprived of their right to express themselves on the new Treaty and on any fresh enlargements?
What sort of political regime do you think you are building by subordinating our democracies a little further to a system characterised by no separation of powers, no political accountability on the part of governments and no representation of the people, except of a single European people?
The Italian federalist Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa has already given the answer.
I quote: 'Between the two poles of popular consensus and the leadership of a few governments, Europe has been created by a method that could be defined by the term "enlightened despotismâ'.
He is right!
And the people's no to their enlightened despotism has convinced federalists that they have to proceed once more under cover, because the only difference between the rejected Constitutional Treaty and the one that is coming is that the first one did not lie.
Mr President, on past performance, I suspect that the Council will be an occasion when British red lines will become pink smudges, later to be rubbed out entirely by the federalising European Court of Justice.
Opt-out, opt-in, shake it all about, the British Government will claim victory, others will publicly indulge them, knowing that any apparent concessions are really without any substance.
All this is to con the British public into believing that the Reform Treaty is actually materially different from the rejected Constitution, when patently it is not.
Now that Gordon Brown has bottled out of an election, the need for a British referendum is greater than ever.
No election means Labour's 2005 manifesto commitment of a referendum must stand.
No referendum means no mandate for Mr Brown to proceed to ratification, and that is the bottom line upon which all democrats in the United Kingdom should unite.
Mr President, I want to thank the Council and Commission for their statements.
The Lisbon informal summit is going to be a crucial event, having had the publication of the draft Reform Treaty, which heads of state and government will focus on when they meet there.
But the IGC process has been rushed too much.
Indeed, the British Government says it has only had two days to consider the draft mandate.
The proposals are, of course, as has been said by other speakers, very much the same as those contained in the original constitutional text.
The British Prime Minister has a problem.
It is called trust - trust in what he says.
For the past few weeks, he has encouraged his Ministers to talk up prospects of an election in the UK and then, when the political going got rough, he backed down.
I think his European colleagues, fellow European leaders, should be very careful that whatever he says in Lisbon, he is likely to mean something completely different.
British Conservatives, of course, will continue to demand a referendum on the Treaty.
The vast majority of British people want one, including most of the Government's own supporters.
If the Prime Minister continues to resist that pressure, despite a clear election manifesto pledge, then the British people will have further confirmation that he cannot be trusted.
The leader of my party said that this could well be a blatant breach of trust - one of the greatest and most blatant breaches of trust in modern politics.
I do also wish that Europe would concentrate more on the paths of globalisation, alleviating world poverty and tackling climate change.
These are the lessons that we should, by now, have learnt.
I hope that our Prime Minister will be straight with the British people on the issues that arise at Lisbon.
We want a successful Europe, but it must be a Europe that concentrates on the things that people really do support and understand.
(PT) I would like to begin by thanking you, on behalf of the Portuguese socialist delegation, for all the expressions of sympathy on the death of my dear friend, Fausto Correia.
We are all - Portugal's democracy, the Portuguese socialist party and this Parliament - the poorer for his passing.
With one week to go before the informal summit meeting, I want to be optimistic and believe that good sense will prevail.
I want to be optimistic and believe that each of the 27 Member States will assume its political responsibilities towards the citizens of the respective countries, towards European citizens and towards the world.
I want to believe that on 19 October the European Council will conclude a political agreement and will approve the Reform Treaty, putting an end to this impasse which has existed for too long.
I am optimistic because we are all aware of the need to respond to the European citizens' expectations and doubts and they are legitimately wondering about the global role played by the European Union and about the advantages it will bring for their future.
I want to be optimistic because we all know that the world is watching Europe and waiting for a positive sign.
We all know that the world needs a united and cohesive Europe.
We all know that the world does not stop and that Europe cannot remain imprisoned in its national egotisms.
We all know that it is necessary to overcome the impasse in order to channel our energies towards promoting economic development, creating jobs and combating climate change.
Those are priorities.
The lawyers have reached agreement on the drafting of the text for the Treaty plus its annexes.
Technical/legal difficulties, although complex, were resolved.
The IGC fulfilled the mandate entrusted to it by the Council.
The Portuguese Presidency did everything within its power to overcome the obstacles.
The European Parliament did its work both within the IGC and outside that Conference, where our colleagues Elmar Brok, Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo and Andrew Duff made an invaluable contribution.
That means that to date all have done their duty with a great sense of responsibility and within the time allowed.
It is now hoped that no artificial obstacles will be raised, dictated by short-term national political circumstances rather than by any objective reservations about the Treaty content.
No one would understand if those same Heads of State and Government who approved the IGC mandate were to go back on what they had already said.
That would be to their discredit.
We would then certainly be entering a crisis with unforeseeable consequences.
The text might not be the best, but it is an opportunity and is better than nothing.
Let me end by quoting what Jean Monnet said: 'I have always believed that Europe would be built through crises and that it would be the sum of their solutions'.
Wise and prophetic words.
Let us hope that Europe is able to make history, to write another page in the story of the building of Europe.
(DE) Mr President, we have been fighting with some success for greater democracy and efficiency in the constitutional process - now in the process towards this Reform Treaty - but the discussion cannot really be about transparency.
We could have already read everything that the Council Presidency has presented here by way of a briefing to this House in the press.
A few more substantial statements by the Presidency would have been apt.
The fight for transparency must therefore continue!
Where this Parliament has been very heavily involved - for which I am extraordinarily grateful to our representatives - is in fighting for the greater rule of law.
Data protection in the common foreign and security policy, greater parliamentary participation, the abolition of the third pillar in favour of a common justice and home affairs policy, the legally binding nature of the Charter, these are all subjects which are important even for the Liberals in the centre and based on our common values.
With regard to the opt-outs, let me say the following.
A distinction can be made between those based on home affairs policy and those that concern foreign policy.
In home affairs policy they perhaps concern a legal culture, national traditions, and different notions of social values.
I can even understand, if not actually approve of, the fact that we are voting for an opt-out here.
What I cannot understand or approve of at all is the blockade by a few Member States, particularly the United Kingdom, in the area of common foreign and security policy.
Timothy Kirkhope has just said: we should be developing policy where the citizens support it.
The citizens support a credible common foreign and security policy.
It is an objective necessity in view of the challenges we are facing: combating terrorism, the crisis in the Middle East, fighting poverty, infectious diseases, and migration.
There is a range of challenges here which we can only meet together.
We are therefore wondering quite objectively (and Martin Schulz has done so and I think he is completely right) who will be deciding the world's destiny in twenty or thirty years' time?
The United States, China, India and ... the United Kingdom?
Nobody believes that!
Nor will Germany or France be doing so either.
We will either be doing this together or not at all!
We therefore need a European spirit and we need this Reform Treaty!
(PT) If I might mention lack of transparency, the Charter of Fundamental Rights states that in Europe 'no one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed'.
So far so good, but that is not the full picture.
The basis for interpretation of that article is the framework of the European Convention and that lays down some unacceptable exceptions.
For example, the States may reinstate the death penalty if there is an imminent danger of war.
What kind of a idea is that, ladies and gentlemen?
That same source of law gives law enforcement officers licence to kill in the event of insurrection and even authorises, to quote once again 'preventive detention'.
You will certainly remember Jean Charles de Menezes, killed in 2005 on the London Underground.
Was that an unfortunate mistake or a crime which would be licensed under the future Treaty?
Today in Lisbon JosÃ© SÃ³crates and DurÃ£o Barroso spoke against the death penalty.
What authority can there be for sponsoring a Treaty which now lets it in through the back door?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other Members will confirm this in the debate to come, but I believe that it is right to stress - partly with a view to the upcoming Summit - that a European citizen is somebody who holds citizenship of a Member State under national law.
Thus, a citizen is anyone who benefits from the rights conferred upon him by such status, and especially the right to vote and to be elected as a Member of the European Parliament.
Who have we been working for, for years, when we talk about the right to free movement, to education, to health, to work, to dignity, if not the citizens who have democratically elected us?
I consider it equally important to maintain mutual respect between the Member States: for decades a gentlemen's agreement has enshrined the equal weight accorded to the three largest EU states after Germany.
On the linguistic front, this has already been infringed countless times.
Now, the Lamassoure-Severin proposal sets out to eliminate this parity in terms of political weight too.
If this is the underlying sentiment, then we should not be unduly surprised that it is so difficult to reach an agreement to define a future together.
The European Summit should thus reflect deeply upon the ideas of European citizenship and democratic legitimacy.
(CS) I trust that during the upcoming Lisbon Summit the final agreement on the wording of the Reform Treaty will be reached.
Its signature and ratification will put an end to the institutional crisis caused by the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
The institutional reform is necessary, but is not in itself sufficient for the EU to succeed in the context of a more globalised world, and in relation to its citizens.
The institutional reform is an indispensable part of the solution; it is not, however, in itself, the solution.
Once the Reform Treaty has entered into force, we will need to engage in the fundamental debate on the future direction of European integration.
Answers to Europe's economic, social or security issues will be sought in a rigorous revision of existing policies.
The ultimate objective of the European project and related questions on the borders of the EU must take centre stage in these debates.
Referenda in France and the Netherlands and the complex negotiations on the wording of the Reform Treaty signal that the fundamental debate on the contents of the European project will be much more challenging than has been the case to date.
That is why it is so important to respond properly and without delay to President Sarkozy's proposal to establish a so-called committee of wise men, which would provide the much-needed impetus and direction for this debate.
This body should have a clear mandate, but in no case be composed of representatives of Member State governments.
Rather it should be a select group of eminent scholars, outstanding entrepreneurs, former diplomats and politicians.
They should be personalities who inspire natural authority and respect, not officials with tasks delegated to them by their governments.
The objective of this committee should not be to replace public debate but rather function as a catalyst for debate and come up with concrete proposals on the future of European integration.
Mr President, through the Reform Treaty we will gain perhaps imperfect but necessary working tools, and it is up to us to use their full potential.
Europe's citizens are expecting concrete, tangible results from the EU.
It is our job to fulfil these expectations.
(FR) Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference probably met in the deepest part of the Channel Tunnel to get away from public opinion.
The result, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, is impossible to communicate to the ordinary citizen.
More than 300 amendments buried in 150 pages have transformed the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on its functioning.
As a bonus, there will be 53 declarations and 12 protocols.
In the wake of the symbols of the EU, such as the flag and anthem, other political achievements will also be whisked away.
Social dialogue will no longer be a horizontal obligation for the EU.
The social partners are asked not to bother themselves with economic policy, but only with social policy.
The Protocol on Services of General Interest indirectly enshrines the primacy of competition law over all services provided to citizens by municipalities or regions, however vaguely commercial they are.
National governments, like night watchmen, can only decide on non-economic services of general interest.
We are being lied to about the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Protocol 7 says, I quote: 'for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom'.
In plain language, the European Court of Justice cannot enforce the Charter.
I will skip all the opt-outs that make for a two-speed Europe as far as the euro zone, the Schengen agreement and the rules on justice and home affairs are concerned.
Article 24 is worthy of a totalitarian State, allowing as it does only the Council to set the rules on the protection of the personal data of our fellow citizens and to permit those data to be circulated freely to the United States.
Neither the Parliament nor even the Court of Justice will be able to protect fundamental freedoms.
George Orwell's Big Brother is not far off!
Finally, we are being threatened with the inclusion of a permanent right of veto for governments, derived from the Ioannina compromise.
This is unacceptable, Mr President.
Personally, I am starting to rediscover some of the virtues of the Treaty of Nice.
(RO) The Lisbon Summit will offer the European Union the opportunity to debate and perhaps decide on a subject of major importance for its future and role in the 21st century.
The context of the year 2007, when the European Union comprises 27 countries and the international scene becomes ever more globalized, forces us to question the goals, priorities and the way in which the European Union operates.
It is unquestionable that the European Union's actions in the 21st century should be based on two fundamental principles: democratic legitimacy and a close relationship with the European citizen, as well as an increased coherence and efficiency in its activity, including externally.
First of all, this means respect for and promotion of democratic values, the rights of our citizens, including minorities and, from this point of view, I welcome the explicit mention of this aspect in the proposed Treaty wording.
Secondly, the European Union cannot be only a strategic actor in today's globalized world without focusing its foreign policy on solving disputes and encouraging international and intercultural dialogue, especially in the policy of promoting regional cooperation.
Last, but not least, we should not forget about the propelling force of any development, namely education and the position it should hold in the revised version of the Lisbon Strategy.
Without giving increased attention to the European education and research policy, we will not be able to speak of a reformed, competitive and strong Union.
I hope that the Lisbon Summit will also bring clear answers to the questions we have today.
(DE) Mr President, my fellow Member Mr Goebbels said after his speech that despite his criticism, he would not die for Nice - which I very much hope he will not, and that he will live for a long time.
First and foremost Nice is not a treaty for which it would be worth dying!
I hope that this Treaty which we are getting will at least have a much higher added value than Nice.
I would like to take up where Mr Lambsdorff left off.
Our citizens want a strong European Union, not as an intrusion into daily life, but as an outward representation in order to be better able to represent our citizens.
I now think that this treaty, for all its weaknesses, still represents substantial progress.
It is a necessary, albeit insufficient, prerequisite for us to pursue an active foreign and security policy.
The Kosovo problem is, of course, preoccupying us.
We shall see whether there is the will generally to promote a common foreign and security policy.
Both the Portuguese and the Slovenian Presidencies are having to gear themselves up intensively for what we are doing, should no amicable solution be reached here.
However, it is important that we create the appropriate conditions in the long run.
I would like to bring up two things here: on the one hand, we do of course need a workable diplomatic service, which must be located at the Commission.
It makes no sense to place foreign policy with the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representatives if the diplomatic service then simply has to be organised elsewhere.
On the other hand - something several fellow Members like Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo and others have already pointed out - we must make clear that this Parliament has been involved from the outset in the appointment of the High Representative.
Finally, one further comment to the Vice-President of the Commission: you repeatedly point out how important the negotiation of this treaty is.
The matter will not be settled - as my colleague Mr Schulz has said - with the agreement which will hopefully be reached in the Council and not even with ratification, but our citizens must be convinced during and after ratification that this Treaty will help them by allowing their interests to be represented in this world.
(PL) Mr President, a few reflections on Lisbon.
Recent events linked to the constitutional crisis have made the citizens of Europe aware that there is a need for reform and change.
The essence of a democratic system of decision-making is arrival at a consensus, through majority or unanimous support for some idea, where a frivolous veto is not issued by one partner in important matters.
We are discussing the question of numerical representation in decision-making in the forum of a united Europe, and through this we are touching on the principles for the functioning of a common organism.
This is why it is also important to heed the voice of the minority, which, because of its geographical situation, for example, or its historical experience and political situation, may often express a view of reality that is of relevance to Europe.
The living and dynamic organism that is Europe must not be closed off within a rigid and universal legislative framework introduced by the current Parliament or Commission for good.
A person or a national grouping has an unlimited behavioural repertoire, and life and the ongoing situation demand adaptation of regulations, though not of values, which should remain constant in relation to reality.
We must not underestimate the immediate eastern dimension of the economic, political and energy aspects.
It is not just the west that counts, or Brazil, and I feel that the current Presidency needs to be more flexible in this regard.
And another reflection: the expanded economic perspective which we are discussing and which will be the subject of discussions, should become an element of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, if we wish to catch up with the USA.
And lastly, Mr President: greater involvement of national parliaments elected by citizens will bring EU matters closer to the people.
What this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape, content and future of Europe should be taken by citizens, and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power.
Mr President, may I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the progress they have made towards securing consensus.
But, of course, we have heard from many colleagues today that there is considerable disappointment in this Parliament.
There are many who are disappointed at the loss of the idea of a constitution that would have replaced the current treaties and refounded our Union on a new legal base.
There are others who are disappointed at the numerous changes that have been secured and the special provisions and derogations for certain Member States.
Some of these changes are, of course, unfortunate.
But they are the price that has to be paid to secure agreement of all 27 countries capable of being ratified by all 27 countries.
That is the situation that we are faced with.
There is no way around the fact that this Treaty has to be acceptable to all Member States and ratified by all Member States.
Colleagues should not lose sight of the overall picture.
This Treaty, even in this form, contains many vital reforms.
We need those reforms; the Union needs those reforms.
Anyone who wants a well-functioning and democratically accountable Union should support these reforms.
The alternative to the reformed Treaty is more of the same, but with years more wrangling on the institutions and the mechanics of the European Union.
I would rather secure the reformed Treaty and then move on with a greater capacity for the Union to address the real issues that citizens are interested in: climate change; the performance of our economy; overseas development aid; the environment - all those things for which we need the Union, because alone and separately, we are not effective, but together we can do more.
Let us move on and get these institutional issues settled once and for all.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon brings us yet another important step closer and successfully brings to an end the aftermath of the meetings.
However, Lisbon still does not bring us to our goal.
The ratification process is still ahead of us and will demand everything of us, indeed, of us all.
We shall manage together or not at all to make the European Union more democratic, closer to its citizens, more transparent, more capable of action, inwardly and outwardly.
The Reform Treaty signifies a further step in the right direction.
Only if we do this together will we succeed in anchoring the Reform Treaty in the public consciousness as added value for the citizens of Europe, the European Union and Europe as a whole.
The only thing is that we have still not put egotism, nationalism, protectionism, the EU naysayers and the EU mendaciousness in their place with the Reform Treaty alone. They are the cancer of commonality, the cancer of Europe's future.
The opt-out method is inconsistent with a united Europe.
The opt-out method weakens the community of values.
It creates first and second-class citizens and I am wondering why the representatives of Poland and the United Kingdom want to thwart the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
We want data protection to be controlled by law with parliamentary participation.
We want staffing decisions to be taken after the elections to the European Parliament.
We want the social partners and social dialogue to continue to be anchored and strengthened.
We want public relations work to be carried out on the added value of the Reform Treaty and the further extension of the European Parliament's co-decision-making rights, because only by doing this will Europe become more democratic, closer to its citizens and more transparent.
Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification.
We should remember Denmark in 1992, Ireland in 2001, France and the Netherlands in 2005, and even Sweden on the euro in 2003.
Nowhere is safe from a no vote.
Obviously each Member State is in charge of its own ratification, whether through parliamentary channels or through a referendum, but is it really impossible to coordinate the whole thing?
I think that bringing all the ratifications together would prevent an endless stream of national debates and would allow European public opinion to emerge more strongly.
I can suggest a date, Mr President: the first fortnight in May 2008, because this is the fortnight that saw the end of the Second World War, and sees Europe Day on 9 May, and this year it will be the sixtieth anniversary of the Hague Congress, which set Europe in motion, chaired by Winston Churchill.
For us, the French, it is also the election of a great European, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, on 10 May.
It would help a little if the ratifications were coordinated.
After all, we have got rid of the symbols of the Treaty, but symbols can be put back in a calendar.
Why not write them into certain dates?
Because regardless of what we think of the drafting of the treaty - and our fellow member Mr Goebbels was rather harsh about this - we must at all costs nevertheless ensure that this step in European history is taken.
So I put this suggestion to you: agree on this fortnight!
(Applause)
(PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, Madam President, just as it did seven years ago, the Portuguese Presidency faces some major tasks and major challenges.
I am convinced that the European Treaty will be adopted in a good atmosphere and with consent, providing a basis for effective and efficient management of the EU.
This is the most important matter today; because only then can Europe gradually become a political power and have a positive impact on the fate of the world.
But economic power in the EU is always something essential, and today this is even more true than it was seven years ago.
We are faced with the challenges of globalisation and we wish to become, and I quote 'the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'.
But today we know how difficult that is.
So a social Europe increasing employment and also battling against climate change, which it was not seven years ago, must be a Europe of a completely free market.
An open market, a market free of protectionism and monopolies.
We owe this to our citizens, if we wish to act on the principles of the Lisbon Strategy in the sphere of competition, innovation and progress.
Let us also remember that management of the Strategy's guidelines from a free-market position has worked much better than management from Member State level.
And lastly, a third matter - our success depends to a large extent on relations with our neighbours.
I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the far-reaching rapprochement on the EU's southern borders, but we should not for a minute forget the eastern dimension, especially as the results of fair and free elections in Ukraine have presented us with the chance of a democratic, free-market and pro-European stabilisation of the eastern border of the European Union.
Elections were held just two and a half weeks ago, and it is worth proclaiming this in the European Parliament.
(HU) Mr President, as has emerged from the previous debate, there is a huge amount at stake with the current Reform Treaty, since the operability and credibility of the Union are at stake.
In any case, European citizens do not understand that we have been working on the Constitutional Treaty and institutional problems for years and that from this we, as the political elite, know very well that they are extremely important in the interests of reforming and renewing the Union; at the same time it is a foreign, incomprehensible debate for us.
Ultimately we have to work on the real issues for European citizens, and I agree with Martin Schulz that there should be no more failures in the life of the Union.
There should be no more failures, because the 2004 enlargement was the first that was not prevented by radical reforms or radicalisation.
It is no longer surprising that the British are behaving as they are, and yet, as a representative of a new Member State, I am not pleased that my Polish fellow members are taking a political course that unfortunately does not serve European unity.
There is no alternative to the Reform Treaty.
It is vital in order for the European Parliament not to be a place for quibbling, but for the Commission and the Council to take it seriously.
It is also vital in order for us to make progress with matters such as the issue of national minorities, in which, finally, one of Europe's great problems - we should look at the Western Balkans, or Ukraine and Russia - (sentence unfinished).
Without the Reform Treaty, we will not be able to make any progress in this area either.
Mr President, there is no alternative to the Reform Treaty; it is either the Reform Treaty or the death of the Union!
Thank you for your attention.
We have before us an important occasion to make a more efficient and democratic union out of the European Union.
The new treaty will offer the necessary tools so that the European Union will keep progressing after more citizens have now joined in its midst.
We have a unique opportunity, and together we must see that the necessary compromises that guarantee a better future for European citizens are now found.
Several people have mentioned Poland and England and their opt-outs.
Yes, it is important that everyone keeps national interests present, but it is more important that we keep European Union interests present because we all form of the European Union.
This applies not only for the Council, but also particularly for the European Parliament.
I do not agree that there should be a particular European Union for certain European citizens and a different European Union for certain European citizens in another country.
We must therefore use this opportunity that we will have in the coming days in Portugal to send a clear signal to our citizens that the European Union is not stagnated, and with the new treaty we will guarantee that we will continue to move forward.
We guarantee that after long and difficult years of continuous debate about the future of Europe, we would have found the way of agreement that will lead us to continue to attain more success.
A treaty that should ensure more transparency and as has been said more efficiency.
A Treaty that should help us strengthen the voice of every European citizen.
I note with pleasure that even my country, which I represent, will increase its strength in this Parliament.
The European Union is facing important challenges that we must face as soon as possible.
We must compete in this globalised world and therefore we should have the necessary targets to meet these challenges, challenges like climate change, immigration, how to create more work and better conditions for our workers.
We can meet these challenges only if we have a more efficient and transparent European Union.
(PL) Mr President, I hope that the understanding that was reached in Berlin concerning the most important problems currently inherent in the Reform Treaty will culminate in a positive outcome during the forthcoming summit in Lisbon.
I also hope that the Polish government - bearing in mind that 80% of the Polish people supports our membership of the European Union - will see its way to final acceptance of the draft treaty, and will thus demonstrate that it understands the slogan of 'a strong Poland in a strong Europe'.
One of the most important achievements of this understanding will making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, and I am pleased that the President of the European Parliament, the President of the Commission and the Presidency are planning a ceremony of joint promulgation of the Charter during the plenary session of the European Parliament.
This is evidence of how important this document is, dealing as it does with such problems as dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and the administration of justice.
Consequently I do not understand and do not support the stance of the Polish government, which wants an exemption from the duty under the provisions of Chapter IV of the Charter, entitled Solidarity, where Polish citizens are concerned.
This Chapter contains provisions that are particularly dear to the Polish and European left, relating to employee and union rights.
Any wise government should care about providing the citizens of its country with greater and more effective protection of employees' rights, especially in a country like Poland, whose freedom was brought about by the workers' uprising of the Polish SolidarnoÅÄ.
I therefore call on the Polish government to change its stance on this matter.
(PT) The informal summit in Lisbon could bring to a close a troubled period in which Europe's ambition crossed swords with crisis.
The new Reform Treaty will not have the power to restructure Europe; that would take a European Constitution.
The new Treaty is an under-achievement compared with the lost Constitution; it is a small leap in history, rather than a great leap; it is all it can be, not all it should be.
But it does represent certain progress in terms of Europe adapting its institutions to the new geopolitical challenges and future debate.
We must recognise that the emotional element in the referendum restricted the purely rational element of political representation.
Public opinion was ill-prepared for a visionary and cosmopolitan approach, which brought us to a more timorous and closed process than the process in the Convention which paved the way for a Constitution.
That point should not be forgotten by those who sit round the table at the next meeting of the European Council.
The Council's task is now to secure the unity needed for the Treaty in accordance with a principle of maximum limitation of exceptions; to avoid, in the derogations from the Charter, hidden erosion due to opt-out clauses in the original gentlemen's agreements (such as the Ioannina compromise) and to ensure that the Treaty is of a unitary rather than a fragmented order.
The Council's other task is to stage-manage ratification of the Treaty; that is essential in order to avoid a change of direction in the European trajectory so dear to all citizens.
It is time to accept that the legitimacy of Europe comes above all from the universal values it is upcoming, from the consistency of its democratic institutions, from the shared project to achieve global justice born precisely of excellence of reasoning.
That is the legitimacy of Europe.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to join in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency in dealing with the process of reaching a compromise over the Union Treaty.
This was a very difficult process and really did require a huge effort to bring about an understanding.
This Treaty is not the treaty of our dreams, and it is not a treaty that illustrates the visions and dreams of Europeans today.
Nevertheless, it is what we have at the present time on the road between dreams and reality in the European Union.
I am convinced, and I hope, that this Treaty will be accepted by all European states.
Meanwhile, here in the European Parliament today, I must express my firm opposition to the declaration made by the government in Warsaw that it does not accept the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Non possumus, I am saying this non possumus in the European Parliament as a Solidarity activist from the period of military rule.
Poland pointed the way to freedom and democracy for all Europe, and today the Polish government has the audacity to state that it will not apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights in our country, in my homeland.
I protest against this, in the name of that part of the Polish population, men and women, who will never come to terms with Poland not being bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
(EL) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the determination, speed and proactiveness it has shown.
Thanks to it, we today have a text of the Reform Treaty, which is to be put forward to the Intergovernmental Conference in Lisbon.
I hope that the governments there will rise to the occasion and assume their responsibilities so that we can emerge from the deadlock we find ourselves in.
I would also like to assure the Portuguese Presidency that the overwhelming majority of this Parliament's Members stands by its side and we expect a positive outcome on this issue.
First of all, we need agreement, then ratification by all the states.
I have heard various observations about the efforts being made for the further unification of Europe and I have been surprised by those who hide their anti-Europe philosophy by invoking the better in order to destroy the good.
Let them be honest: if they do not achieve better unification or integration of the EU, then let England, France, Germany, Poland face the challenges of globalisation alone.
Let them come to ensure peace when nationalistic rivalry leads us once again into crisis and perhaps to war.
We must understand that the vision of the EU cannot simply be swept under the carpet; we must promote and realise it.
Our aim should be to maintain constant progress, so that all these states and peoples face a global future rather than a merely European future, on the basis of principles and values.
That is the vision that we must promote, and this European Parliament stands by your side, Prime Minister.
Mr President, it is very nice to have my name on the wall together with a Secretary of State and a Commissioner - it is a big moment!
I would like to make three points if you would allow me.
I have been involved in three intergovernmental conferences myself as a civil servant.
My view on intergovernmental conferences is that, for the past 25 years, we have either been preparing, negotiating or ratifying a new Treaty.
I do not know about you guys - Mr Corbett and the others - I, at least, am getting to the stage of IGC fatigue.
We need to get this over and done with.
There have been too many IGCs; they have been constant.
I am not against change - quite the contrary - but at some stage we need to calm down, and I think, in two weeks, we will end up doing that.
My second observation is that, of course, I would have liked to have had a Constitution, but let us live with the reformed Treaty as it stands.
It is a great improvement on what we have.
Of course, we all have criticisms, not least on the opt-outs, not least on the question of whether it is simplified or actually more complicated.
We all have our qualms, but remember: it is very strong on foreign policy; it gives us a legal personality; it gives us fundamental rights - at least some of us - and it gives us more qualified majority voting.
Of course, there is always room for improvement at the end of the day, but this reformed Treaty is what we have.
So, to the UK and to Poland I say, 'Calm down and accept it'.
The final point I have is that I really do believe that it is time to try to restore trust between the Member States.
We have been on a negative wave ever since the Nice negotiations, when the small were pitted against the big.
Now it is time, I think, to bury the axe and restore trust, the way in which we used to have it before Nice.
It is time to calm the institutions down, settle the issues and focus on real policymaking.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the first place I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their very significant support for the endeavours and the work carried out by the Portuguese Presidency within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference leading to the approval, we hope, of a new Treaty for our Union.
To those who spoke less favourably, or even against, I would like to say that the Presidency will take note, and it is our obligation to do so, of those concerns and criticisms because we regard them all as part of the collaboration in our work and our endeavours, and they must naturally also be taken into consideration.
I think it was Graham Watson who said here that Portugal's Prime Minister must feel that he is preparing his army to fight the Intergovernmental Conference battle on 18 and 19 October.
That is one way of looking at it and I would say that I am a soldier in that army, hoping that many other soldiers also present here will join our army, so that in Lisbon we can actually achieve a new Treaty on European Union.
The Intergovernmental Conference has finished its work of the lawyers and experts.
Now it is the politicians' turn to pronounce at the level of justice and I am sure that the politicians and governments will be equal to their responsibilities.
It has been said here that we cannot fail and the Portuguese Presidency fully concurs with that statement.
We cannot fail and we are going to build an agreement which will, I am sure, have everyone's support; it could not be any other way.
We will pay attention to the sensitivities, interests and concerns of all.
We will not disregard anyone.
As I say, we are therefore confident of success, given the feeling that a debate which has perhaps been running for too long needs to be drawn to a conclusion as well as the perceived urgent need to create a spirit of construction, union and positive energy in order to face many other problems which we shall have to confront in the future and which have been mentioned here: climate change, energy issues, immigration, our own internal reform, which we need to achieve in order to face the more general problems of globalisation.
I am sure that the feeling of urgency with regard to the conclusion of a Treaty, in order to inspire us to win other battles, will be felt in Lisbon and that when we return here for the next Plenary, we shall be bringing you glad tidings, bringing you good news.
I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament once again for the support they gave to our team of lawyers and I am sure that they will continue to support them in subsequent phases, as many speakers have mentioned here.
Just a word about the question of the Lisbon Strategy in order to thank JoÃ£o de Deus Pinheiro for his speech.
We are going to introduce a new element into the debate on the Lisbon Strategy and that is bound up with the foreign policy dimension of that strategy.
It is fundamentally bound up with the need to lay down rules, to regulate, on matters where there are no rules and there is no regulation, in order to achieve effective progress, social stability, economic stability and peace in an ordered and regulated world where the rules and standards are clear for all to see because we must all, so to speak, deal with them so that in fact the world we are building will be a fairer world for all.
As I say, I shall be here with the Presidency.
I know that the Prime Minister of Portugal will also be intending to come here and I shall be with him at the next plenary session; we are confident that we will be able to announce that the European Union has a new Treaty: the Reform Treaty.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this interesting debate.
You always learn a lot of new things and I can, of course, promise that I will report back to the Commission.
I have taken careful notes so that we can follow up also at the meeting that will take place in Luxembourg next Monday.
I have heard three direct questions that I would like to respond to as well as I can.
The first one alludes to Parliament's involvement in the procedure of appointing the first High Representative.
The Treaty here reproduces the 2004 text.
I am sure that everybody will want to find a pragmatic political solution that can satisfy all sides when this moment comes.
You may remember, of course, the precedent of Commissioners appointed after recent enlargements.
There, too, Parliament got satisfaction in practice, although the legal texts were not clear.
I think it is in our interest to make sure that there is a satisfactory role for Parliament in this whole procedure.
The second question had to do with Article 24 of the Treaty, on protection of personal data in the field of security.
Here, at least, I can respond for the Commission, which understands Parliament's concerns on provisions relating to the transmission of confidential data by the Member States.
As it stands now, Article 24 of the EU Treaty allows the Council alone to define the rules in this field, with no possibility of involvement of the European Parliament.
This new provision, of course, stems from the IGC mandate.
It applies to Member States only, whilst the European institutions remain subject to the general regime, and the foreseen procedure complies with the very specific regime that exists on the common foreign and security policy.
Here, it means that the competence of the Court is restricted.
I am afraid that there is little margin to change the substance agreed in the mandate, but, in any event, I want to reassure you that we do not read this article as covering, for example, the EU agreement with the United States on passenger name records.
That agreement currently has a third-pillar legal base and, therefore, in the Commission's view, it will therefore be covered by the normal competence of the EP and the Court in the future.
So this is how the Commission sees those issues.
I am seated so that I can actually watch all our visitors.
I am not sure that we can always explain very clearly what we are discussing here, but I am sure that the visitors have felt the type of frustration that comes from this debate and the fact that some are very happy with this, they say it is a good compromise; others are not pleased at all and say that this is not good enough; others say that we are going too far.
Of course, it reflects the political situation and the difficult political game that comes after a long period of actually having discussed how we can adapt our decision-making procedures to enlarge the European Union of 27 Member States; how we can actually incorporate also the new issues that have emerged lately, like climate change and energy; how we can be more open and effective.
All the visitors also remind me that, whatever the outcome - and we think and hope, with the help of the Portuguese Presidency, that we will have a good outcome, that we will be able to agree a new Reform Treaty - we will have to communicate; we will have to engage with citizens to try to do our best to explain.
I hope that the Commission and the European Parliament will be able to plan also the communication activities together by making sure that we also provide a text which is as accessible and readable as possible; that we can create a debate which is European, so that you can, hopefully, follow the debate in other Member States as well - and with a political commitment from all of us, all the institutions, to engage with citizens: to explain, to advocate and also to listen.
This is our role from now on.
This is only the beginning.
We also have the ratification and the implementation awaiting us.
But, for me and the Commission, we believe that this is a good Reform Treaty - not a perfect one: it is, of course, a compromise; we would have wanted no opt-outs but really good support for what is in there on the Charter of Fundamental Rights especially, but we have a compromise, we have an agreement between all the Member States - and now we will make the best of it.
(Applause)
That concludes the item.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) Hungary has always championed support for the Constitutional Treaty - or, in its new form, the Reform Treaty.
Hungary's interest, and the Union's objective, is that we should safeguard peace and our fundamental interests, and promote the welfare of the citizens of the Union, already approximately 500 million in number.
Europe has changed, and the world has changed.
The new security threats must be responded to with new strategies and new policies.
Europe must prepare for change in all areas.
I believe that the Reform Treaty can help to set Europe's course, and to define its future operating framework, policy and the Europe in which we would like to live and succeed.
I consider it important that the heads of state and government act responsibly at the informal summit on 18-19 October, setting aside their historical grievances, and that they reach a unanimous decision on the final text of the Reform Treaty, which can move the Union in the right direction.
The objective of the summit is to adopt the text of the Reform Treaty, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of the enlarged European Union, and to increase the role of the European Parliament, the only elected body, and also the Union's external action.
The European Parliament has guaranteed and will guarantee its full support for the constitutional process and the creation of the Reform Treaty right up to now, and it trusts that the 27 Member States will ratify it as soon as possible.
The representatives of the parliamentary groups will ensure that the Parliament is present at the Lisbon summit, thereby also reinforcing the creation of the Reform Treaty.
The essential thing is that we need a Europe in which 27 Member States feel a joint responsibility for us to take suitable steps together for a better future.
The time has come, and we have to prove it in Lisbon!
in writing. - (FR) The draft Reform Treaty corresponds precisely to the mandate approved by the 27 in June.
It translates their political commitment to the letter, and should enable the European Union to leave behind the political impasse it has found itself in for more than ten years.
I now ask the members of the European Council to keep their word and stop raising 'off-mandate' questions in extremis.
This is not the time for minor last-minute arrangements, sudden nationalistic reactions, or withdrawal reflexes that are in danger of making this Treaty lose all its coherence, by introducing lots of accommodating opt-outs.
The adoption of this text should respect the timetable envisaged, with a view to the Treaty of Lisbon entering into force on 1 January 2009.
We should now be focusing on raising awareness among our fellow citizens, who are now more demanding and critical of the European Union.
They need explanations, and we should be providing them, showing ourselves to be good teachers.
It is the responsibility of every one of us to share our enthusiasm in this new context characterised both by a return to the European mindset and by the imperative of democratic transparency.
Membership of Parliament
The next item is the report by Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the composition of the European Parliament.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution is a response to an invitation by the European Council in June.
Article 9 A of the draft Treaty states that in future the composition of the Parliament will be a matter for secondary legislation.
This will be a decision of the European Council, adopted by unanimity, on the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent.
The Council is inviting us to explain how this procedure should work.
It wants to see us deal with this hot potato.
For our Parliament, this is a real political challenge.
Are we capable of coming up with a reform that applies to ourselves?
The last time we were asked to do this was in 2000, and Parliament did not manage to do it.
For this reason the vote secured in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is already a remarkable political result.
We obtained a large majority: two thirds in the final vote and three quarters on the main point, the distribution of seats, in terms of actual numbers, between the Member States.
What is the problem we are facing?
We should first remember that the current Parliament of 785 MEPs no longer complies with the new legal position resulting from the amended Treaty of Nice.
It is this system that would apply, based on 736 MEPs, in the absence of any new decision.
Up to now, in the Council and in Parliament, the Member States have been divided into categories: one supersize state, some large ones, some medium-sized, some small, etc. Each category has the same voting rights in the Council and the same number of seats in Parliament.
This is over!
The future Treaty introduces two types of innovation in relation to this system.
On the one hand, there are actual figures: a maximum of 750 MEPs, a ceiling of 96 and a minimum of 6 seats per Member State.
On the other, there is a principle: between the maximum and minimum, the Member States must be represented according to degressive proportionality, and it is our job in Parliament to define this principle today, namely to choose how much proportionality and how much degressivity there is, or how over-represented the least populous countries are and how under-represented the most populous countries are.
Your committee is proposing that this principle should be translated in the following way: firstly, the minimum and maximum numbers set by the Treaty must be fully utilised.
In particular, the use of the ceiling of 750 seats will give us a small reserve -as it were - of seats, so degressive proportionality can be applied without reducing the number of seats of any country.
This is a fundamental political choice, and is absolutely necessary to obtain unanimity in the European Council.
Secondly, the larger the population of a country, the greater its entitlement to a large number of seats, of course.
Thirdly, the larger the population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its Members of the European Parliament.
So at present, a Spanish MEP represents more than 875 000 people, Mr President, while a German MEP represents only 832 000.
Up to now, Germany has had twice the population of Spain.
This anomaly will be put right by the allocation of four additional seats to Spain.
In total, ten countries are affected by the proposed increases.
We are fully aware of the fact that this is only a temporary solution.
It would be desirable to come up with some sort of mathematical formula that would automatically apply to any future enlargements, but the tight timescale given to us did not allow this.
However, the resolution makes some recommendations on this point.
Similarly, we had to use the only population figures available, those from Eurostat, since we did not have any figures from the citizens themselves.
Adrian Severin will say more about this.
Finally, we would warn our fellow members against amendments that contradict the fundamental principles of the report and will have the effect, depending on the case, of giving the large countries an abnormal advantage over the smaller countries or small countries over the large countries, in which case our work will have been in vain, because without unanimity in the Council we will have to stick with the 736 seats of the Treaty of Nice.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please refrain from bidding up your countries.
We have spent the afternoon proclaiming that we are the only democratic institution protecting the interests of Europeans before the other institutions, above national egotism.
Now, today, we have the perfect opportunity to show that our actions are faithful to our words.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - Mr President, our proposals - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - confirmed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, bring a number of improvements to the current practices regarding the composition of the European Parliament.
If adopted, and properly enhanced, there will be no more artificial groupings, no more arbitrary negotiations, no more enlargement at the expense of the efficiency of the European Parliament, which is always growing with the number of Members.
There will be more representativity, based on demographic realities and not on nominal or symbolic legal relations, more solidarity between the big and small states resulting from the digressive proportionality of the representation, and full legitimacy based on the civic representation resulting from the fact that the European Parliament is elected by European citizens.
One should note the difference between the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, which is based on the vote of the European citizens, and national representativity within the European Parliament, which is based on the demographic realities within the Member States.
We, the European Parliament, are representative of citizens and of the states at the same time.
(Murmurs of dissent)
You see, immediately, some say only citizens, others say states.
We are a Bundestag and a Bundesrat at the same time.
A clear separation of this dimension should, perhaps, be considered in the future, but for the time being - once we have accepted that the citizens are voting and that digressive proportionality should take into consideration the size of the communities living on national territories - I am sorry, but we are both.
Of course, within this framework, the concept of European citizenship is still to be clarified, and I hope that this will be done in the near future.
Our report, however, is not provisional but transitional.
It is transitional because I believe the principles we have defined are long-lasting, but progress is needed, and I am sure that in the future we can add to what we have already proposed to you.
Therefore, we have included a number of revision clauses which to our minds - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - will assure flexibility, adaptability and future progress in the way in which Parliament is composed.
Nobody is penalised by this report.
Maybe those with a better demographic policy are rewarded, and certainly it is an invitation for a better demographic policy, including migration policy.
I do not think anybody loses - and, perhaps, nobody wins - in terms of a zero-sum game.
As long as we have a more democratically legitimate Parliament, everybody wins.
We have some amendments.
Some colleagues would like to reduce digressivity in favour of proportionality - more proportionality means more seats for the big countries.
Some others would like more digressivity and not more proportionality.
More digressivity means more seats for small countries.
Therefore, I believe that we have to reject both these extreme options in order to promote the option which is, I agree, imperfect, but which for the time being is the best one.
This is the option proposed by Mr Lamassoure and myself.
Some would look on the basis of reference.
Some would like all their national citizens, irrespective of their country of residence, to be taken into consideration.
Others would like to see all inhabitants in their countries being taken into consideration.
Others are trying to see only the European citizens residing in a certain country.
So we are divided on that.
The only solution is to stick with the actual practices and the actual Eurostat figures.
Finally, there are some who are fighting for political prestige and think that, if we are not equally represented in this Parliament, we are unequal in our political weight.
I think that once we have accepted digressivity - and proportional digressivity - these artificial groupings cannot survive any longer.
If we fail to adopt this resolution, I am afraid that the European Parliament will send the message that it is not able to adopt an important reform and that it has to always wait for the executive institution to decide for it.
I think that the IGC will suffer a first failure before it can even consider the issues on its agenda, and this failure might be a prelude to a total failure.
I am afraid that everybody will go back to Nice and not to illusory dreams.
I am afraid that, then, we will give a message which will mean a split between the big and small countries, and this will undermine any dream of unity, fairness and inclusion.
Therefore, I end with an appeal to all my colleagues.
I make this appeal to our sense of European responsibility and European solidarity.
Hic Rhodus, hic salta!
Here is Rhodes, and let us prove here that we are true Europeans, and not when giving lessons to the Commission and the Council.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the report provides clarification for which I would like to express my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Messrs Lamassoure and Severin.
It makes clear that we are constantly exceeding the stipulated upper and lower limits.
I would like to express my thanks specifically for this.
This clarification is important for us all.
Secondly, there are two outcomes to this report.
Firstly, the less degressive the scale we have, that is, the more we gear ourselves to proportionality, the more genuine authority and legitimacy Parliament has.
The conflict as to how much degressivity we need - how much less, how much more - must be continually managed and it is logical here, I believe, for us to say the less the degressivity, the greater the legitimacy.
As a German, I would also add that it is somewhat problematic, of course, that we as Germans are the only ones getting less than we did on the basis of Nice.
We would like a little bit more support here because the discussion in the German press is very explicit in this regard.
We shall accept this because we too believe that the European aspect is more important than all the others.
Finally, two findings which we ought to utilise for the future.
Firstly, we really ought to be working towards obtaining a logical system in the long-term, which we do not have to be constantly renegotiating.
Secondly, there are two controversial amendments, 2 and 3.
Our Group has decided that irrespective of how the vote goes on the two controversial subjects, in the end the Group will vote in favour of the Lamassoure/Severin Report.
The Council has no excuse.
In Amendment 2, which differs only minimally from the figures in the Lamassoure Report, the outcome would be that the Council is given a message from Parliament for the period 2009-2014.
Hence our Parliament and all the Groups have on balance, as I believe, fulfilled their duties and the Council can decide, if it is willing.
Many thanks for a fair discussion on such a difficult subject!
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to support this report.
My group will be voting for it and we hope that this text that was adopted by a 70% majority in committee can now be endorsed by an equally impressive majority in Parliament as a whole.
The rapporteurs have - sensibly, in view of the legal constraints laid down by the new Treaty, in view of the time constraints laid down now before the conclusion of the IGC - focused on correcting the main anomalies in the current distribution of seats rather than embarking on proposing a radical overhaul of the system, which could only have led to deadlock in the IGC and endangered the approval and ratification of the new Treaty.
In particular, no Member State will see a reduction in the number of seats that it is entitled to under the current treaties where they provide for the distribution of seats from 2009 onwards - except, of course, where it is laid down in the Treaty itself for the Federal Republic of Germany.
With that sole exception, no country will see a reduction compared to what is planned already in the Treaty for 2009.
Now, of course, some of our colleagues are trying to win more seats for their own Member State, sometimes arguing that their country's population is suddenly much bigger than we had all assumed beforehand, bigger than the Eurostat figures that are used by everybody, including the Council.
Others are arguing, for reasons of national prestige, that they should have the same number of seats as another particular Member State.
I must confess that I am very surprised at the attitude of the Italian Government.
I understand that Mr Prodi, and indeed some Italian Members here, have been arguing that it is essential for Italy to have the same number of seats as France and the United Kingdom.
Yet they accepted - we all accepted - the principle of proportional degression: proportional to population.
I accept that my country will have one seat fewer than France although we have always had the same size up to now.
I do not see why it should be so difficult for Italy as well to accept that it has fewer seats than France for exactly the same reason.
And I am surprised that a government from a country that has so often said that it is the example to us all in terms of being communautaire, that it has a strong European commitment, that it is not nationalist, it always puts Europe before its national interests, that now Italy and Mr Prodi is arguing that Italy, for reasons of national prestige, should have the same number of seats as France and the UK, even though its population does indeed differ.
To conclude, may I urge that this House support this report, reject the amendments and send a clear strong message to the European Council.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group will also support the Lamassoure-Severin proposal.
The IGC is asking us to change our composition to suit the terms of the Reform Treaty, and that is a perfectly proper request.
We, as a Parliament, need to send a strong, clear message back that we are able to take such a sophisticated and brave decision.
There is no pure, definitive formula.
Paragraph 6 applies a practicable and sensible definition of degressive proportionality.
Of course, I, too, accept that some national delegations are seeking to improve their position on the league table, but it transpires that all such proposals are mutually contradictory.
All those who seek to alter the system fail.
The D'Hondt proposal would give too much clout to the larger states, and I would say to Mr Friedrich that his proposal breaches the Treaty principle of degressive proportionality.
The square root system gives too much clout to smaller states.
I completely accept that the Italians raise an interesting point about the statistical basis, and we should examine, as a Parliament, the distinction between nationals, citizens, residents and voters.
But the issue is extraordinary complicated, and it treads firmly upon national sovereignty in the area of electoral law and citizenship.
We cannot possibly solve such a problem inside the space of a week before the end of the IGC.
Following the IGC, there will be a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for which I have the privilege to be appointed rapporteur, that can address all these questions and propose a reform of the primary law of 1976.
But all of that is for next year rather than the present state of affairs.
Meanwhile, let us give solid support to the proposal and send a solution, rather than a problem, to the IGC.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the co-rapporteurs for their efforts with regard to what is a very difficult and complex issue.
Ultimately, despite what some colleagues may say, turkeys do not vote for Christmas, so why would any present Member of the European Parliament look to see their seat being taken away?
There is a legitimate reasoning behind the desire of those who seek to have the highest number of seats available to them in each of the national categories.
I would be slow to denigrate that attitude in anybody.
Because, if anything, when we look back over the changes that have occurred since the first direct elections to the European Parliament took place in 1979, there have been phenomenal demographic and population trend changes across the European Union, not least because of the expansion of the European Union into eastern Europe in 2004, which allowed for the free movement of so many people into other countries, which has altered the populations greatly.
I think one of the careful elements that we have to speak about (and we can speak about degressive proportionality till the cows come home) is that there has always been a balance between the different institutions - and also a balance between the larger and smaller Member States - to ensure that no one institution would have total domination over another, or that larger Member States could not dominate medium-sized or small Member States.
That is why it is important to maintain this balance as much as possible.
I welcome the rapporteurs' inclusion, in a compromise amendment, of maintaining that interinstitutional balance.
But, as well as that, when we look at the figures that have been used - and much has been quoted by other colleagues here with regard to the Eurostat figures - out of the 27 countries, the figures that Eurostat for 15 of those countries are using are only provisional figures from the central statistics offices of those countries.
So, decisions are being made on only provisional figures when that could have a lasting impact with regard to the future allocation of seats in Parliament.
We must also keep an eye on further enlargement taking in Croatia, which would also impact negatively.
Therefore, I would urge caution when voting on this issue.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, my Group will not be voting for this report because the proposed system of representation, and the distribution of seats, disregards basic democratic principles, sustains historic inequalities and is contrary to the nature of this House as representative of the citizens and of its electors.
These are not dreams that are not being fulfilled.
Yes, Mr Severin, there are many who are wanting a great deal, but what we should all be wanting is to be getting some idea of what a Parliament is.
A Parliament is not - as the rapporteurs told us in their letter yesterday evening - the representation of the Member States' socioeconomic capacity.
No, it is the representation of the electors and nothing more.
It is the representation of citizens or it is not a Parliament!
It is not a Parliament if there is no demos on which to base ourselves, and it is not true that the term citizenship in Europe has nothing to do with the term under international law or the term citizenship in the United States.
It is precisely the same and I would advise you to look at the existing treaties.
I would advise you to look at the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which the rights of those citizens are laid down.
I would advise you to look at the rules governing access to the European Court of Justice.
I would advise you to look at the rules on how we become voters.
Then you will recognise that it is the easiest thing in the world to find out who is a citizen of this Union and who is entitled to vote for this Parliament.
This is decided every five years.
The inhabitants, the population, these are a symbolic expression of socio-economic capacity.
But we have already failed here once, when we were asked in Nice: dear Parliament, just tell us yourself what you want your composition to be.
We failed on that occasion.
Unfortunately, we have not used those seven years to clarify what this Parliament is.
We are therefore reassessing the historical nonsense and the historical practical constraints that have arisen to date.
These do not have anything at all to do with democracy and thinking on the Constitution.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, there are different views in my Group.
I, however, support the report by Messrs Lamassoure und Severin.
With the report Parliament responsibly keeps its right of initiative to submit a proposal itself on its future composition.
It does so thanks to the intensive work done by both rapporteurs in a genuine European spirit.
The proposal is well balanced, it is based on a clear, comprehensible and transparent system, and can also be sustained for future enlargements.
The proposal follows the principle of diversity.
By using all 750 possible seats, it also ensures that in future Parliament will reflect the whole range of the main political orientations from each country.
The proposal is also based on the principle of solidarity, hence the larger, most populous Member States agreeing to have less influence in order to allow the smaller, least populous Member States to be better represented.
All this helps strengthen the Union's cohesion.
I therefore hope that the Council unreservedly and speedily implements Parliament's proposal before the 2009 elections.
One further comment in conclusion.
All the people who live in the Member State concerned form the basis for calculating a Member State's seats - as with the Council - including third-country nationals living there, because they are part of this society.
However, this is only one side of the coin.
Third-country nationals whose homes are in our Member States must also have the right to vote for the European Parliament.
I have always fought for this and I shall continue to do so!
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the usual thing to do when we have such a report before our hands is to argue what one country should get and what another should lose, which only proves that European solidarity is a myth and national egoism always triumphs.
In light of the recent German aggression by Mr Schulz against the President of the European Commission, let us look at a good method of winning at the zero-sum game.
In paragraph 8, we witness a lamentation that Germany will lose seats.
We hear more and more of this lamentation: that more EU documents should be translated into German, that Germany is the biggest net contributor to the EU budget, that it should have its own seat on the UN Security Council and so on. We could make a whole list of such complaints.
At the same time, Mr Severin is trying to convince us, through his undefined degressive proportionality - which, coincidentally does not affect his own Romania - that when Poland loses three seats, it actually gains one.
I only wish that his concept would work this well in the casino.
But let us get things clear. Only a socialist from Yorkshire could accept that two plus two is five.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lamassoure-Severin report should be scornfully rejected because of its ideological anti-Italian subtext and the superficial nature of the technical arguments versus the political arguments on which it rests.
I will not enter into a discussion of the merits of how much the ius sanguinis weighs with me as compared with the Jacobinism of the ius loci, as this is clearly absent from the thinking of the rapporteurs and those who commissioned the initiative.
I am not a legal expert, nor do I have a major reputation like Professor Manzella, chairman of the Italian Senate's Committee on European Affairs, nor like other fellow Members, who can challenge with equal precision the legal inconsistency of the assertions made in the report.
I believe, however, that it is worth stressing that for the rapporteurs incontestable facts do not count: in politics it is the assessment and the role that Italy has had in the past and still has today in the institution of Europe.
The very poorly Italianised principle of degressive proportionality, redefining the allocation of seats established in the Constitutional Treaty that has been put on hold, has been applied with clear discrimination against Italy.
For some countries brackets have been left in the system, and there are some glaring instances of distortion of the facts, such as the allocation to Estonia of the same number of seats as Malta, although it has three times the population.
We can accept that in the United Kingdom people with the right to vote include residents who are not European citizens, and on this basis the rapporteurs allocate the UK one more seat than Italy, even though of those with the right to vote only a little more than one third voted in the 2004 election.
We can accept that France, which compiles its electorate and fills up its demographic profile with the same variety of birthplaces that can be seen in its national football team, is allocated two more seats than Italy.
We can accept the sloth of the Italian Government and we saw the flight at the time of the preliminaries to the debate in the Council.
There is something, however, that cannot be accepted.
The rapporteurs cling to their debatable sense of citizenship.
They claim that anyone living in Europe, even if they hold passports and citizenships from outside Europe, is a voter.
They exclude from the calculation, however, citizens living outside Europe.
This gives an idea of the gross, manipulative and unacceptable anti-Italian discrimination that we most strongly reject!
(SK) First and foremost, I would like to express my support to the rapporteurs, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, for their report.
We must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the Slovak Republic will lose one Member as a result of the agreed principle of digressive proportionality.
In relation to the proportional allocation of seats in Parliament, this principle should be extended to all areas of EU employment policy.
I therefore ask for an increase in the number of representatives and employees from the 12 new Member States in all EU institutions.
I think that every Member State has a sufficient number of qualified people who can make a valid contribution to the EU.
Equality is one of the principles underlying the EU.
Even the original Member States committed to honour this principle when they welcomed among them the 12 new Member States.
It should apply to all areas and not just the positions of Member of the European Parliament or Commissioner.
I call for the principal of equality to be observed and honoured.
When the new Member States joined the EU they had to fulfil many criteria.
Now I appeal to the EU as a whole to fulfil its commitments towards them.
(SV) Madam President, by supporting Mr Lamassoure's report the European Union can take a historic step.
With this report we can leave behind a time when the number of seats in the European Parliament was distributed on the basis of a system where different countries were categorised in different groups, on the basis of the negotiating skills of different heads of government, and where it is assumed that the EU's Member States have conflicting interests.
If Parliament chooses to support Mr Lamassoure's report, we will leave behind this system and move to one based on the proportionality principle, where a country's size affects its representation in Parliament.
The system that we have had up to now has been very difficult to explain, but the system that we can get with the Lamassoure report is possible to explain.
It is based on a maximum and a minimum level and on account being taken of the number of people in the different countries.
This principle is also tenable looking to the future.
It means that the interests of one country or another are not furthered, but the number of citizens is taken into account.
This is a step forward in the democratic process in the European Union.
I want it to be quite clear what alternative we are facing.
We either support the proposals set out in the Lamassoure report or we go back to the Nice agreement with its arbitrariness and negotiations marked by conflicting national interests.
When I hear the latest speakers from the benches up here and their agitation, I can also hear the national interests in relation to conflicts.
The Lamassoure report should be supported because it is based on a principle.
(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs drawn up by Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin on the future composition of the European Parliament is an important contribution which highlights a balanced and objective solution on a matter which is, politically speaking, highly sensitive.
I should therefore like to congratulate the two co-rapporteurs.
We should remember that it was last June's European Council which promised the European Parliament, by October 2007, a solution to the problem of its future composition so that the solution could be applied in time for the 2009 European elections.
To those who feared that Parliament would be unable to resolve that question due to the prevalence of nationalistic ideology this report is an apt response and demonstrates that this institution is proficient at pinpointing and expressing the common European interest within the national dynamics which tend to complicate intergovernmental matters.
It is important to set out the European Parliament's position for the smooth running of the work of the IGC, which should be completed in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October.
It is therefore essential to acknowledge the political link between this new proposal on distribution of seats in line with the principle of degressive proportionality and the reform package for the Union's institutions, in particular the double majority principle for the definition of a majority in the Council.
I would like to take the opportunity to stress that the institutional aspect of the Reform Treaty needs to be coherent and that, as regards the question of double majority, which will ostensibly enter into force only in 2014-2017, the Treaties should not contain any gentlemen's agreements like the Ioannina compromise, which remain in force but, whilst they are legally recognised in the current framework, would merely serve to block the decision-making process in the Council.
We knew from the outset that the composition of the European Parliament would not merely be a question of mathematics.
Within the limits of the present factors, the solution to be devised would have to meet three principles: the principle of solidarity according to which the Member States with the biggest population accept that they will remain underrepresented, the principle of plurality to make it possible to have representation over the full range of the principal political orientations in each country and the principle of efficiency keeping the maximum number of representatives limited to a level compatible with the role of a legislative assembly.
With the application of the principle of degressive proportionality, the reports will achieve a reasonably consensual proposal.
In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to say that the European Parliament does not need to regard the agreement obtained as perfect before it can give its political consent.
Despite its weaknesses, the current text enhances the European Parliament's credibility and is infinitely better than the irresponsible dragging out of an arm wrestling match between national egotisms, which would cost the Union and its citizens dearly.
On the eve of an important European Council, this House, which represents our citizens although I find it hard to follow the idea that this House also represents the Member States, is putting the European interest first trusting that the Heads of State will do the same.
(SV) There is a large group of citizens who have been ignored in the discussion on the composition of the European Parliament.
I am thinking of the almost 50 million Europeans who belong to a regional or a national linguistic minority.
Today we are only a handful of MEPs who represent these groups.
This is not acceptable and, sadly, it gives a false image of the European Parliament.
It is as if we do not understand the vulnerable position in which certain linguistic minorities still live.
The report by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, which is based on the principle of 'degressive proportionality', is a brilliant display of statistical work and I too will be voting in favour of it, but we must now also dare to begin discussing other substantive issues.
How will we increase the citizens' trust in the European Union?
How will we guarantee that the EU and the European Parliament live up to the aims that we want others to pursue, that is to say how will we ensure that the voices of minorities are also heard?
Ladies and gentlemen, will we MEPs tolerate regional and national linguistic minorities being left at the mercy of the goodwill of national governments which may give them a seat, or do we want those minorities not to be represented in the European Parliament?
The answer should be a resounding no!
So as to ensure diversity it is therefore time to reserve a number of seats in the European Parliament for linguistic minorities.
I myself speak for the Swedish-speaking population of Finland and for the province of Ãland.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the composition of seats at Parliament contains some obvious contradictions, reinforced by the letter sent by the rapporteurs yesterday, as if to justify their position regarding such politically delicate questions, and it distorts the legal concept of citizenship as it has always been codified.
The principle put forward by the report goes beyond both nation states and the treaties.
From a legal viewpoint, European citizenship is the legal status enjoyed by those, and only those, who hold citizenship of a Member State and who are, as a result, in possession of all the rights and duties connected with that status.
It is citizenship, and not residence, which must be the test.
This proposal also distorts the approach taken in the draft of the next treaty, which clearly specifies that the concept of citizenship has nothing to do with residency.
The European Parliament has wasted a great opportunity to demonstrate to the other institutions the capacity to find within itself solutions based on legal principles that are commonly recognised and shared.
I would ask the rapporteurs why they did not even consider the possibility of using, for the purposes of allocating seats, the number of citizens in the Member States rather than the resident population.
Perhaps it was to benefit some states more than others?
Look at the case of the United Kingdom, which grants the right to vote in European elections even to those who are not EU citizens.
Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin: stating, as you have done, that nobody has been penalised as compared with the Nice agreements, seems to me an obvious distortion of the truth, which others will be called upon to remedy.
For this reason, we cannot back this report.
Not only that, but it is also detrimental, not only for our country - my country - but also for the other countries of the Union.
It is also detrimental to representative democracy and the future treaty, which, as you yourselves recognise, contains guidelines and principles on which the distribution of seats at Parliament ought to be based.
We cannot ignore the concept of European citizenship as the basis of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of a decisive role for the European Parliament, which is often argued against, but it seems that the governments wish to use this proposal to manipulate our Chamber.
This proposal for the composition of seats is, in our view, ill-advised.
Italy is being penalised, and that is a cause for concern, but what matters most of all is that the reasons for this penalisation are ill-founded.
A historical parity is being destroyed, and, worst of all, the allocation of seats is being altered in the name of a resident population not granted the right of citizenship.
Those who, like Italy, have given the right to vote to citizens not resident in the country are being penalised.
What we need is something totally different: I think, for instance, that we really need a citizenship of residency, but one that would count not only in terms of the number of Members of Parliament to be elected, but also in terms of the right to vote and to be elected.
We need to guarantee representation for political minorities and small states, setting this out expressly in the criteria to be adopted in national electoral laws, and we need to think about new arrangements that make the most of the European parties and their ability to present themselves as such in elections.
None of this appears in the report, and for that reason I will be voting against it.
(DA) Madam President, the report that Parliament will be adopting tomorrow will effectively halt the accession to the EU of Turkey and other populous European countries.
Germany will have its say in the Council doubled, whilst smaller countries will have theirs halved.
At the same time, some of the larger countries will obtain more seats in Parliament.
On the whole, Germany will continue to be compensated for having had the same number of votes in the Council as Italy, the United Kingdom and France, even though it currently gets maximum value out of every German in the Council.
I do not think that the larger countries will produce such gains again, and the smaller countries cannot produce any more if the electorate is to perceive decisions as legitimate: listen to Mr Lax.
I would appeal to the largest countries to stop and think.
There cannot be both voting according to population figures in the Council and an approximation of the same voting principle also in Parliament.
In the United States, there is equality between states in the Senate.
In Germany, Saarland, with one million inhabitants, has three votes in the upper house of the German Parliament, whilst Rhineland-Palatinate, with a population of 18 million, has six votes; thus the German system is hardly fair.
When my country joined the EC, Germany had three times more votes in the Council than Denmark; now it will be 15 times more.
Previously, Germany had three-and-a-half times more seats in Parliament than Denmark; now it will be eight times more.
That is too uneven, and will never have the understanding of the electorate.
It will destroy the EU - that is the problem.
(NL) Madam President, allow me to begin by expressing my doubts about the timing of the resolution now under discussion.
It is true that the June European Council asked Parliament to present a draft concerning the future composition of Parliament, but we now discover that the whole proposal is based on the Reform Treaty, a text that has yet to be ratified, let alone enter into force.
In other words, we are putting the cart before the horse.
Incidentally, it is not the first time this has happened, and it is really starting to become sickening.
I am speaking here not on behalf of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group but as a representative of a small Member State - or rather a future Member State, as it is no longer a question of if but when Belgium will be split up and Flanders becomes an independent state.
I digress.
I think that the principle of degressive proportionality advocated by this report is the most workable and also the fairest starting point if one believes at least that the smaller Member States and their representatives in this Parliament must be able to go on playing a meaningful role.
In any case, I support a broad interpretation of this principle of degressive proportionality, and therefore intend to support the relevant amendment by Mr Bonde.
In my view, it is in the interests of the European Union that the smaller Member States have the best possible representation in the European Parliament; if not, we shall see a further fall in popular support for the European institutions.
Madam President, I think this is one of the saddest days in our plenary work over these five years because it is the first time I, at least, personally, feel that this has become an intergovernmental body.
This reminds me of the nights in Amsterdam in 1997; this reminds me of the nights in Nice in 2000.
And today in the group, and I think here in plenary, we can see what it is all about.
I really thought that the European Parliament was here to represent the interests of all European peoples, not narrow national interests.
We have three options on the table: one is the Severin-Lamassoure proposal, which I think is a European proposal.
It is an excellent proposal and they have done a fantastic job and should be congratulated for it.
(Applause)
The second option that we have is to go back to Nice.
Perhaps some of us want that; I do not know.
But do we really?
Is that why we are going through this whole debate?
Do we want to go back to Nice?
Does Spain want to lose seats?
Does Poland want to lose seats?
I do not know.
The third option is what I call a provocative option and that is two provocations: one, to give the big states a hell of a lot more and the small states a hell of a lot less.
The other provocation came from the other side, to give the little ones a lot and give absolutely nothing to the big.
Is that what we want?
Is that what we are here for?
I do not think so.
At least, I do not hope so.
Tomorrow's debate is about the credibility of the European Parliament and whether we can take a rational, logical and fair decision.
Are we capable of coming up with a proposal, or are we just like the Member States?
(Applause)
(DE) Madam President, fellow Members, Parliament is providing an input with this Lamassoure/Severin Report.
We will be distributing the seats in 2009, whereas the new formula for distributing votes in the Council of Ministers will not apply until 2014.
We are now ready to introduce this operation for the next period.
The entire proposal, however, only applies if there is a new treaty.
If the new treaty is not implemented, the Treaty of Nice and the accession treaties will remain in force, which means that all countries will have fewer seats.
There should therefore be great interest in backing this proposal in the Plenary tomorrow.
