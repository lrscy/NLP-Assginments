Is the European Union not duty bound to prevent conflicts and crises?
At present, the Council appears to be focusing on what I would deem almost technical questions. Is it not incumbent on the Council to take the initiative politically, in association with the United Nations?
Dealing with issues such as the issue we are discussing is one of the Council's duties.
I really would like the honourable Member of the European Parliament to take account of the fact that it is easy to say that the limits and the tools which the Council has at its disposal should be exceeded here and there in various ways, but there have been a great many discussions, even today, in this House, which demonstrate that the European Union is not a superpower, it is not an agency which can intervene as and where it likes in order to impose its views and its values.
Consequently, what it can do is fight in the way it is fighting and organise itself so that it can strengthen its position on the international stage and raise its profile and exert more influence on the issues of interest to it.
Mr President, thank you for the reply, but let me ask you this, briefly and succinctly: are you prepared to ensure, are you prepared to intervene, so that the thirteen persons - the delegation of human rights activists whose passports were confiscated in Casablanca - are given back their passports and are able to resume their journey to the 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva?
One member of the delegation is a laureate, Mohammed Dadash, who spent nineteen years in prison and who was awarded a human rights prize by the Ravdo Foundation in Norway.
I shall look into the matter.
Whether or not I am prepared to intervene personally is not a personal matter for me.
I shall look into the matter and if the Council can do something along these lines, we shall see to it.
I should like to say that I am from a country which also lived through times such as these at one point and that we are very sensitive to these situations at a personal level.
However, we are not here in a personal capacity, we are here in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council and we therefore have to respect the common view and the common position of the Council and operate within that framework.
Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, I wonder if you have noticed where the honourable Members putting questions to you are seated?
I am aware of the conclusions arrived at by the United Nations Legal Service on this matter, of course. Nonetheless, has the Council considered measures to control the actions of European multinationals, especially oil companies, to ensure the natural resources of Western Sahara are not exploited whilst the self-determination process takes place?
What guarantees can we give the people of Western Sahara, through the Council, that we will not allow their natural resources to be exploited by European Union multinationals during the self-determination process?
Perhaps the honourable Member could show me how to talk into the microphone and look at someone behind me at the same time?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, recently, there are more and more reports of Europeans disappearing between Algeria and Tunisia.
The current figures are four Swiss, eight Austrians, one Dutch, one Swede and fifteen Germans.
Are you aware of these incidents, and is the Council considering taking joint action to free or locate these fellow citizens?
This is something I know nothing about and I reserve the right to see what reply the Council can give.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I am not sure whether my ironic remark annoyed you. In any case, I apologise.
I had no intention of causing offence.
I would ask you please to answer my question.
What guarantees can we give the people of Western Sahara, through the Council, that we will not allow their essential natural resources to be exploited by European Union multinationals during the course of the self-determination process?
I would like to apologise again for any offence I may have caused and add that I did not understand your reply.
The meaning can sometimes vary, depending on the language.
Mr Yiannitsis may reply if he wishes to do so.
I do not know if there was some misunderstanding.
If there was, I am very sorry.
What I understood from the translation was that the honourable Member commented on why, when I am talking into the microphone, I do not look at the person who asked the question and to whom the reply is addressed.
Because, quite simply, when the person who asked the question is over there, I cannot see him.
I am very sorry, but that is what I understood from the translation.
As far as the question of exploiting deposits and natural resources is concerned, the Council, precisely because this stage is a very delicate stage in the negotiations, does not consider it advisable for activities such as these to be furthered.
As I explained, Question No 13 was deemed inadmissible pursuant to the Rules of Procedure. We will therefore now move on to the following question.
Question No 14 by Eurig Wyn (H-0146/03):
Subject: Western Sahara and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
Taking into account the status of non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara over which, according to the UN, the Kingdom of Morocco has no administrative power, as this status could not be conferred unilaterally by Spain in the Madrid Treaty;
Taking into account that at the time of the signing of this treaty, Spain had not extended the jurisdiction of Saharan waters to 200 miles and given that according to the international legal order and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Kingdom of Morocco, as an 'occupying' country, cannot extend the jurisdiction of these waters, nor include in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) these Western Sahara fishing grounds;
What is the Council's opinion on this issue and what measures will it take to respect the Convention on the Law of the Sea in its relations with the Kingdom of Morocco?
The declaration on the competence of the European Communities with regard to matters governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 and the Agreement of 28 July 1994 relating to the implementation of Part XI of the Convention sets out the list of issues for which the Community has sole competence or joint competence with its Member States.
However, defining the limits both of territorial waters and of the economic exclusion zone is not included in the list of matters for which the Community has competence.
As regards the matters set out in the preamble to the question concerning the status of the Western Sahara under international law, the Council would remind the honourable Member that this is a matter for the United Nations Organisation as the international organisation involved in investigating and settling the conflict in the Western Sahara, in keeping with the international rules that derive from the Law of the Sea.
Consequently, the questions raised do not come within the competence of the Council, they come within the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Morocco and the United Nations Organisation.
I would like to ask whether the European Union, in the light of the information conveyed to us, can make representations to the United Nations to at least respond in a constructive manner as to the future status of the Saharan people.
Since the 60s they have been promised a referendum and there has been deliberation and an impasse which is creating a very difficult situation for a large population of people living in refugee camps.
Would it be possible for the European Union, through you, President, to make representations, even by letter, to the United Nations expressing our concern about this very important issue?
On this issue, I must say that I need to consult the Council in order to be able to reply as to whether the Council is prepared to send such an envoy, in the capacity of observer, to the United Nations in order to help in this direction.
Question No 15 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0157/03):
Subject: Preventing sexual harassment in the armed forces
Given the current situation, would it not be worth coordinating and extending provisions on the prevention of sexual harassment in the armed forces, particularly these provisions which have proved effective in certain Member States?
Is the Council aware that Private Dolores QuiÃ±oa, having been raped and abused by her superior officer in 2000, has been sent home with no posting and no compensation for the harm she has suffered?
Is the Council aware that in Spain, where 9.3% of soldiers are women, no 'Coordinating Advisory Committee on women in the armed forces' has yet been set up, along the lines of the one NATO established in 1961?
I should like in particular to point out to the honourable Member that matters of a disciplinary nature relating to national armed forces, such as questions of sexual harassment, come under the jurisdiction and responsibility of the individual Member States.
I should like to draw your attention to the fact, however, that, since September last year, we have had Directive 2002/73 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
This directive introduces a definition of sexual harassment and stipulates that 'harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited'.
The Member States are called on to comply with this directive by 5 October 2005.
President-in-Office of the Council, do you consider it appropriate to adopt measures to prevent sexual harassment in the Armed Forces? Such measures would prevent the situation Dolores QuiÃ±oa found herself in.
She was the victim of an assault but was then powerless against her attacker. President-in-Office of the Council, you must be aware that, in Spain, victims are defenceless against attackers like Lieutenant IvÃ¡n Moriano.
Such individuals can act with impunity. You must take into account, Mr President, the fact that a large number of cases of harassment go unreported because victims are ashamed and afraid, or because they fear reprisals.
Lastly, please note that the number of cases actually made public is very high, and is increasing.
President-in-Office of the Council, you do have competencies on coordination and harmonisation in countries like Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, France, Italy and Belgium.
In Ireland for example, of the 60 women in the Armed Forces interviewed, 28 had been subjected to sexual harassment.
In the United Kingdom military courts dealt with 192 violent crimes in the year 2000 alone. Thirty-four of these crimes were of a sexual nature.
President-in-Office of the Council, coordination and harmonisation are needed with a view to establishing measures to prevent sexual harassment in the Armed Forces. I urge you not to evade your responsibility in this area.
I should like to point out to the honourable Member that, as I said, the jurisdiction and responsibility for such matters lies in principle with the Member States.
There is criminal law and there are all the forms of the law which of course relate to the matter and must be applied.
If they are not applied, then there are international and European bodies for filing charges against the Member States.
At European Union level, as I mentioned, certain arrangements have been promoted which can be used to deal with such situations, but the directive I referred to would not have been of any use in connection with the incident to which the honourable Member referred.
These are completely different situations.
I believe that the facility for the European Union to intervene in such matters, regardless of anyone's and/or the Council's personal preferences, tendencies or wishes, is laid down in the Union Treaties and we must look to them to see what is allowed and, if there is some such facility - and I am not in a position at the moment to say that there is and I do not see where it would derive from - it could be used.

This is one more reason for saying that the review now being carried out in the Convention, human rights and a whole series of similar matters must be finalised and studied at Union level.
Question No 16 by Gerard Collins (H-0160/03):
Subject: Meetings with Ambassadors of the Arab countries
On 10 March 2003 the High Representative for the EU's CFSP met with the Ambassadors of the Arab Diplomatic Corps in Brussels to exchange views on the latest developments in EU-Arab relations, the Barcelona process and current international issues, including the Middle East and Iraq.
Is the Council in a position to provide more detailed information on the results of the meeting and, in particular, with regard to the events unfolding in the Middle East and Iraq?
Mr President, the honourable Member will certainly know that Mr Solana, the Secretary-General and High Representative for the CFSP, maintains constant dialogue with many and varied agents and representatives in the region and meets the ambassadors of the Arab diplomatic corps on a regular basis.
The Council is told about these meetings as and when necessary.
The Council would also point out to the honourable Member that Mr Solana repeatedly reports to the European Parliament on recent developments in the region and will obviously continue to do so.
I suggest to the presidency that, with regard to the many genuine difficulties that exist at the present time between Arab countries and the western countries, there is perhaps a need for a study on how best relations between the European Union and these countries might be improved.
Only recently at the opening of an exhibition in Brussels by the ambassador of one of the Arab countries, he availed himself of the opportunity to tell me how difficult things were for him and his colleagues.
He acknowledged that the meetings with Mr Solana were helpful, but urged more meetings, more discussions and more debate because of the very difficult and strange times which exist at present.
Perhaps the President-in-Office might consider how best we can help to bridge the gap that needs to be bridged, particularly in relation to the Palestinian issue and the lack of progress that has been made there.
I agree with the honourable Member.
I would remind you of the efforts the Greek Presidency has made, of the trips and contacts made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Papandreou, including in cooperation with other Ministers for Foreign Affairs from other countries, in order to arrange meetings with Arab countries and ongoing consultations, precisely on the issues of burning interest to the region.
I thank Mr Collins for asking this question at such a sensitive moment in the Iraq crisis.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office to convey the view of many of our members - including, I am sure, Mr Collins and certainly myself - that the roadmap to peace should become a reality; and also, on our behalf, to inform Mr Solana that we should redouble our efforts to make that a reality, given the sensitivities in the region following the Iraq crisis.
The position taken by the honourable Member is not, of course, a question, but I should like to point out that the Council recently took the position that the question of the Middle East, the Palestine question, should be very high on the agenda for action.
A solution has to be found.
The road map must be publicised and made binding, and efforts must be made so that we arrive at a result within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the road map.
I am in a position to know in this respect that the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Council wish to work to achieve this objective.
Question No 18 by Brian Crowley (H-0164/03):
Subject: Alternative energy research and development fund
Given the high price of oil on world markets, does the Council consider that now is the time to establish a well-resourced EU alternative energy research and development fund and, if so, will it call on the Commission to bring forward the necessary proposals for the 2004 and subsequent budgets?
I would remind the honourable Member of Article 163, Paragraph 3 of the Treaty, which states that, 'All Community activities under this Treaty in the area of research and technological development, including demonstration projects, shall be decided on and implemented in accordance with the provisions of this title', i.e. Title XVIII on research and technological development, especially the multiannual framework programmes referred to in Article 166.
Consequently, research and development in the field of alternative energy sources is conducted and funded within the framework of the framework programme.
The current framework programme was introduced under Decision 1513/2002 for the sixth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and research activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation for the period 2002-2006.
The framework programme, under the thematic priority 'sustainable development, global change and ecosystems', provides funding for research and development of sustainable energy systems in the following sectors: clean energy, in particular renewable energy sources and their integration in the energy system, including storage, distribution and use; energy savings and energy efficiency, including those to be achieved through the use of renewable raw materials; alternative motor fuels; fuel cells, including their applications; new technologies for energy carriers, transport and storage on a European scale, in particular hydrogen technology; new and advanced concepts in renewable energy technologies with a significant future energy potential and requiring long-term research efforts; disposal of carbon dioxide associated with cleaner fossil fuel plants.
A sum of EUR 810 million has been earmarked for these research activities during the framework programme.
I would also remind you that the sixth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community, again for 2002 to 2006, has earmarked a budget of EUR 750 million for research into controlled thermonuclear fusion, which could contribute to long-term energy supplies and consequently to the requirements of sustainable development for reliable centralised basic load electricity production.
Further details on research to be carried out and specific financial allocations are contained in the specific decisions establishing the programmes.
Consequently, the Council, under the codecision procedure with the European Parliament, has I think provided substantial funds for research into alternative and renewable energy sources and energy savings and energy efficiency.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his very detailed answer.
I would have some dispute with you with regard to thermo-nuclear fusion being an alternative energy source, because it already exists.
However, there are three reasons why I ask this question.
Firstly, in the State of the Union address that President George Bush gave in January of this year, he committed, and the Congress approved some time afterwards, USD 7.8 billion to be put aside over the next ten years for research into hydrogen cell-fuelled automobiles.
The road map that they set out is that by the year 2025 the first cars will be in mass production, and that by 2035 they will be in widespread use across the US.
My second reason is, as we have seen in the recent past with the conflict in Iraq, the instability with regard to the price of oil, and the effect that it can have on the economies here in Europe that are so dependent on fossil fuels.
Third is the question of our commitments to Kyoto and to a clean fuel technology, using wind, water, air and solar energy.
Other alternatives can be looked at and a special fund set up to keep us up to speed with what is happening in America in that regard.
Those are the reasons for my question.
I would again point out that there is no new question here.
However, I should also like to point out to the honourable Member that we should not compare spending by the American administration on alternative energy sources with spending by the European Union for the same purpose.
We need to add spending by the European Union to national spending for the same purpose by the governments of the 15 at present or the 25 in the future in order to reach a comparable figure.
Having said which, it is a known fact and everyone agrees on the need to promote alternative energy sources in order to combat the problems of environmental pollution and other pressures on the environment.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on Monday this week, we debated category 3 very intensively under the heading of internal policies, and one area which is of particular concern to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of course intelligent energies.
In category 3, more than EUR 500 million is now newly available.
Do you think that in this area, we could make the development of these intelligent energy technologies a particular priority - also in the ten new accession countries, which have today been confirmed by Parliament? In other words, do you think we could step up these initiatives in this area too?
I think that this issue has to do with proposals by the European Commission as to how these initiatives can be taken into account.
Having said which, as with other issues, unless it consults the members of the Council, the presidency cannot answer yes or no to something which has not been discussed.
As the author is not present, Question No 19 lapses.
Question No 20 by Liam Hyland (H-0167/03):
Subject: Older farmers and the demographic debate
The Commission has indicated its concerns about the impact of ageing populations on labour markets and potential growth issues and says there must be a clear economic incentive for people to stay in the labour market.
The Heads of State or Government have set Europe the goal of becoming a dynamic area by raising potential growth rates to 3% by 2010.
Will the Council state where it believes the farming sector and older farmers fit into this demographic debate?
Taking account of the impact of the ageing of the population on the job markets and its possible impact on the development and sustainability of social protection systems, the Member States agreed in Stockholm to increase the employment rate of elderly workers by 50% by 2010.
The European Council in Barcelona called for a further gradual increase of approximately 5 years in the actual average age of retirement from the job market by 2010.
According to the joint employment report for 2002, all the Member States consider elderly workers to be the most important source of manpower and have started to try either to discourage early retirement or to provide incentives for people to stay in work longer and, at the same time, to create a framework which facilitates gradual retirement from active employment, thereby combining both approaches.
In its contribution to the spring Council on 21 March 2003, the Council included increasing the job supply and the participation of all groups and promoting a longer working life as one of its nine priorities, in order to achieve the three primary targets of the European employment strategy.
The Council is waiting for the Commission to include this priority in the employment guidelines and the Commission expects to submit the employment guidelines in April 2003.
Finally, the Council recognises the importance of maintaining farming activities in order to achieve balanced agricultural development in the European Union and prevent a reduction in the population in rural areas.
I thank the President-in-Office for his comprehensive reply.
I am sure he is aware of the declining age profile of European farmers.
In fact one of the great threats to the continuity of agriculture is the fact that our farmers are getting older and older.
On the other hand, we have an early farm retirement scheme, which is an excellent scheme but which requires farmers who qualify to totally remove themselves from their involvement in agriculture.
In the context of the proposed revision or review of the early farm retirement scheme, I put it to the President-in-Office that perhaps he should consider making it possible for retiring farmers not to have to opt out totally, but to remain in partial employment, because even from a psychological point of view that is extremely important.
It makes no sense to require a farmer retiring under the farm retirement scheme to opt out totally of a career in which he has spent his whole life.
I think the honourable Member has expressed a thought which could be studied.
We all know, I think, how complicated situations are in which you have to try and reduce protection in the agricultural sector without causing an exodus from farming, on the one hand, and decide how to manage the question of the retirement age on the other, because the population is ageing on our continent and this is undermining the foundations of the pension system.
There are various problems in relation to the employment rate, which we are also trying to increase.
I referred in the form of an example to certain situations which are difficult to reconcile.
You have to find the optimum balance, to put it one way.
The proposal made in this respect, as I understand it, takes this approach and I am certain that the Commission could assess it and evaluate it in its proposals for the employment guidelines.
These proposals will also be a major reform of the employment guidelines decided five years ago in Luxembourg.
Question No 21 by SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain (H-0169/03):
Subject: Digital literacy in schools and universities
Having regard to the importance of ensuring digital literacy for all, starting from a very young age, thereby ensuring that everyone has the ability to use the Internet, will the Council state if it has assessed the Commission's proposal for a programme to combat digital illiteracy and promote virtual campuses and virtual twinning of schools, and what does it consider needs to be done by the Member States to ensure that schools and universities throughout the EU can play their full part in making this programme a success, and what does the Council consider the next steps should be?
The Council wishes to state that it is not in a position at this stage to comment on the content of its position on this programme, given that the proposal on eLearning is being discussed at this stage within both the Council and the European Parliament.
I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
However, I am disappointed that there is no further evidence of any development in regard to digital literacy.
Things are happening in this important field.
At this stage I would like the Council to offer some hope in a very important area where there is obviously not enough work being done to promote this important aspect of education.
This whole revolutionary area - as I, being a former teacher, know - has the potential to combat digital illiteracy.
The Council should be very much involved and should come forward in the very near future with plans and with some hope of a definite outcome in this important area.
I understand the honourable Member's concern about education and digital literacy and the need to promote digital literacy in education institutes.
I too am concerned because I still hold my professorship at the University of Athens, even though my ministerial duties prevent me from exercising it.
I could say that the European Union and the Council, within the framework of the overall Lisbon strategy, have a clear interest in increasing knowledge - it is one of the basic objectives of the Lisbon strategy - and, of course, knowledge today is taking the form to which the honourable Member referred.
The Council cannot comment on this specific proposal and programme because, as I said, it is being discussed within the two institutions.
However, what I can say is that, at general policy level, it is, I believe, known and visible from numerous initiatives, that we are interested in promoting the competitiveness of the Union and hence the key factors that strengthen competitiveness, which nowadays without doubt include the factors referred to in the question.
Question No 22 by Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen (H-0172/03):
Subject: UN mandate for the Macedonia operation
On 27 January I tabled a question to the Council for Question Time to ask whether the EU's projected operation in Macedonia had a UN mandate and, if not, whether one would be sought in order to ensure the success of the operation.
Since Question Time at the February part-session was cancelled and the President, on account of point 2 of the Guidelines for the conduct of Question Time, did not place it on the March agenda, I shall repeat the question.
Contrary to the assertions of the President's representative, this question, which I have not had an opportunity to put, was not answered at the March part-session under Item 31.
Minister, you spoke of this and that and in my country we would say that you were talking nothing but wood and hay.
You completely failed to answer the question I put.
I wish that when you come here to Parliament you would read the question and answer what is asked.
I asked whether you considered that the EU peacekeeping operation commencing in the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia had a mandate from the United Nations.
Please answer the question.
. (EL) I stand by what I said.
I think that my reply to the question put by the honourable Member was very, very clear and very specific.
As to whether or not I satisfied him, there is nothing I can do about that.
As the time allocated for questions to the Council has now elapsed, Question Nos 23 to 31 will receive written replies
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0103/2003) by Mr Liese, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells (COM(2002) 319 - C5-0302/2002 - 2002/0128(COD)).
Mr President, I am pleased to be here to discuss the Commission's proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells, submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in June last year.
Let me first express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work on this important and ambitious directive: important, as it covers a very promising field of medicine; and ambitious, since it forms a crucial element in our overall health strategy.
May I also pay tribute to the successful and valuable work of the Council of Europe in the area of tissues and cells.
Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements.
This proposal ensures that the increasing number of patients who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are safe.
It is a logical follow-up to the directive on the quality and safety of blood.
Human tissues and cells have become an important part of health care.
Their therapeutic use continues to increase not only in the number of applications, but in the extent to which they can be utilised.
With advances in technology, this is an area that is developing rapidly.
However, the fact that the use of these tissues and cells can result in the transmission of diseases has focused attention on the need for increased safety measures.
The Commission's proposal sets out requirements for the donation, procurement, and testing of all donations of tissues and cells intended to be applied to the human body.
Quality and safety standards are introduced, whether the tissues and cells are used as source material for transplantation, or for the preparation of medicinal products and medical devices.
When specifically used for transplantation into the human body, the directive introduces requirements for all human cells and tissues at the additional stages of processing, preservation, storage and distribution.
Now let me turn to some of your key concerns.
One of them is how best to deal with embryonic stem cells.
This question has already been addressed in the framework of research.
In the decision on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, Parliament, Council, and Commission have agreed that Member States are free to regulate or ban the use of such cells, and that such decisions are respected at Community level.
Specific decisions to this effect are expected by the end of this year, and this will be the appropriate context to address this issue.
It does not, therefore, seem appropriate to use this public health directive to prejudge and pre-empt this agreement.
Further concerns have been expressed on organs.
They are excluded from this proposal.
This has been criticised by some of you, yet I remain convinced that it is not appropriate to include organs in the scope of this directive.
The problems to solve in the area of organ transplants are quite different.
We should not forget that the severe shortages, which result in many patients dying, remain a key problem.
However, their transplantation requires a different policy approach due to their specific nature.
As organ transplantation is a highly specialised subject in its own right, the Commission is currently conducting a scientific evaluation of the available options.
At this moment we have not yet completed our assessment.
Following the example of the blood directive and this proposal on tissues and cells, we would like to get the science right first, before tabling a legal instrument in this sensitive area.
Let me assure you that it is a matter to which I attach the utmost importance and am following closely.
Further issues of concern are imports and exports.
It must be acknowledged that the import of tissues and cells from third countries is on the increase.
In order to protect the health of patients in the European Union, we need to ensure that high standards of quality and safety are also applied to these imports.
The proposal provides for a mechanism to establish an EU procedure that will allow a coherent approach to the authorisation of imports and exports.
It is equally important to ensure that no 'sub-standard' tissues and cells are exported to third countries.
A certain flexibility to comply with third country legislation might be acceptable, but only if at least the same level of safety is ensured.
The ethical issues relating to the use of tissues and cells are indeed sensitive.
But it is because of their very sensitivity that we must rigorously respect the limits of the Treaty.
However well intentioned our motives, we must act within the Community's proper competences.
Here, I would like to underline a key point.
Article 152 aims to regulate public health issues.
It does not foresee an in-depth regulation of ethical issues.
The Commission considers that a well-balanced compromise has been presented in its proposal, which goes to the very limit of what is legally acceptable given the restrictions of the Treaty.
The relevant Council of Europe documents and the European Group on Ethics have stressed the principle of not-for-profit procurement.
We therefore consider it necessary that the directive does not contradict this principle.
This not-for-profit principle is relevant only for the act of procurement, not for further processing, manipulation, testing, or the manufacturing of products.
For example, it is unacceptable to take a heart valve from a deceased donor and sell it.
However, heart valves are usually treated to ensure the absence of infectious agents and to preserve them so that they can be stored for a longer period.
These and other processes that serve to improve the quality of the heart valve can of course be carried out on a commercial basis.
The Commission's proposal provides, therefore, the opportunity for private companies to be accredited as a tissue bank, just like public organisations.
And apart from procurement, it does not restrict services or further processing to be carried out on the tissues by a private company.
Finally, another major ethical issue is the question of donor consent.
The International Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine requires that the consent of donors must be ensured and that they receive appropriate information.
While this proposal fully respects these established principles, it does not set specific ethical rules.
It is for the Member States to set detailed ethical rules, in line with the requirements of subsidiarity.
I look forward to addressing the Commission's position on the amendments proposed in the report at the conclusion of this debate.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking everyone involved in the intensive debates which contributed to the production of this report.
They include our fellow Members in this House - in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with its rapporteur, Mr Bartolozzi - and everyone who helped us, here in Parliament and in the Commission, to pull in one direction.
We can look back on an intensive process of debate, culminating in a public hearing on 29 January, which involved more than three hundred experts from the EU and the United States.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy supports the Commission's proposal, but also shares the view of many experts, such as the Standing Committee of European Doctors, that the proposal merely points in the right direction.
In other words, the Commission's proposal is good, but it does not go far enough.
We have therefore introduced a number of detailed changes.
This applies, for example, to the issue of voluntary unpaid donations.
We want the Member States not only to encourage this principle - as the Commission proposes - but also to safeguard it.
Compensation for donors should, however, be expressly permitted.
Trade in unmodified cells and tissue should be prohibited, as required by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, we want to make it clear that the work with cells and tissue is a task which must involve both the public sector and industry - as the Commissioner has already explained.
We believe that our phrasing is rather more precise and clear.
We cannot keep industry out of this sector, for if industry upholds the standards, its involvement will promote innovation.
We want to make the wording on informed consent more precise, for only then will it offer the protection that is very important, and protecting people who cannot legally give consent themselves is an issue which is very close to our hearts.
As regards the sensitive areas of research with, and cloning of, human embryos, these are also the subject of proposals by members of the committee.
I have not addressed this issue in my draft report, but I think that what the committee finally adopted is a good European compromise.
For example, the phrasing in Amendment No 30 is exactly the same as that already agreed by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the Sixth Research Framework Programme.
The committee has not adopted any more far-reaching amendments.
After all, the question of what happens to the numerous embryos is still unresolved in the context of the Sixth Research Framework Programme, and requires further debate.
As many of you know, I personally take a very rigorous position on this issue.
I believe that embryonic stem cell research is the wrong route to take, but nonetheless, I think we cannot go further than envisaged by the committee, and that we must leave scope for the Member States to decide whether they want to ban or permit embryonic stem cell research on principle or not.
Amendment No 19 on the Directive's scope of application prompted a great deal of debate.
The issue is whether the Directive should cover, not only clinical trials, but also in vitro research.
The committee is in favour of the Directive covering in vitro research as well, but only as regards the donation and procurement of cells and tissue.
The reason for this initiative by the committee is that we believe that the protection of donors must be viewed independently of the question whether the tissue is to be used for transplants or for research purposes.
The donor must be protected in every case, and his or her rights must be respected.
How can we justify it to the public if we say that the donor has the right to informed consent, and trade in his/her cells and tissue is not permitted if it is intended for transplants, but all these rights can be disregarded if the purpose is research?
We really cannot present that kind of proposal to the public.
Amendment No 19 is therefore a good compromise.
There are individual speakers who say that Article 152 is not an adequate legal basis for the committee's more far-reaching proposals.
I have spoken to many legal experts and my view on this issue is that the legal basis is entirely viable for the more far-reaching proposals that we have put forward, because everything we have proposed concerns not purely ethical issues but ethical issues relating to the health of donors and recipients.
In contrast to the issue of anonymity or reconstruction of the cadaver - issues that the Commission has indeed addressed in its proposal - the relevance to public health can be presented in much clearer terms on the issues that we have addressed.
I therefore request the Commission to reconsider its restrained position on this issue.
We should send out a clear signal to the other institutions and adopt the committee's report.
Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a directive seeks to introduce safety and quality standards to regulate therapeutic activities based on the use of human-derived tissues and cells, which are carried out in Europe every year and now concern hundreds of thousands of patients.
The sector is also certain to expand, not only in the traditional field of transplants - for example, corneal and skin grafts and heart valves - but also, as a result of advances in biotechnology, in those of reconstructive surgery, reproductive medicine and the treatment of disorders such as cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.
It is therefore undoubtedly of interest to research centres and European firms and must be allowed to develop.
Nevertheless, respect for ethical imperatives is vital in the use of tissues and cells of human origin.
The proposal for a directive in question therefore lays down high safety and quality standards relating to substances of human origin, in order to protect health. However, these ethical imperatives need to be still better defined.
The first issue concerns the need to ensure complete safety from the point of view of health, in order to prevent or reduce the risk of disease transmission in the case of human tissues and cells from third countries too. Secondly, respect for the human body must be assured with regard to removal from both living and deceased donors.
In this connection, the requirement for informed consent on the part of the donor, supplied in a specific form either by the donor or by next of kin is particularly important, as is the prohibition of the removal of cells or tissues from foetuses originating from the voluntary interruption of pregnancy or from cloned human cells.
The third issue concerns respect for privacy and protection of the confidentiality of the information collected when tissues are removed. Donation must be anonymous as regards both the donor and the recipient (except for the requirements regarding traceability).
Personal and family data may not be disclosed to third parties (for example, employers or insurance companies); this is also to avoid the risk of unjustified discrimination.
The fourth principle concerns the fact that donation is unpaid.
This represents a voluntary act of human solidarity which may, however, be appropriately encouraged by specific measures and by proper information on the part of the Member States.
This requirement must be retained, not least with regard to imports from third countries.
On the basis of these considerations, I believe that, over all, the directive can be said to represent a step forwards in the harmonisation of Member States' legislation, allowing Member States to provide greater protection for the health of the European citizens.
Mr President, first of all, let me join the rapporteur in welcoming this report from the Commission.
It is an important measure to regulate the quality, safety and procedures for cells and tissues used for transplants.
The key is the protection of human health.
I echo the Commissioner's words in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Liese, who has ably steered a path, strengthening the protection of human health, ensuring informed consent and avoiding most of the pitfalls of previous debates in this area of human endeavour.
When I see amendments put down and signed in the names of both Mr Liese and Mr NisticÃ², I know that this is a measure where there has been enormous effort to bring about a meeting of minds and views.
That will stand this measure in good stead.
The Commission proposal was a good one but perhaps could be improved.
The report to Parliament introduces improvements in some areas but perhaps left some issues needing clarification.
Some of the changes may be unhelpful.
The new amendments, such as the one excluding industry to which the Commissioner referred when he talked about industry's fears that trading activities might be affected or constrained, are also to be welcomed.
I acknowledge that there is an issue over the Amendment 7, which included research in the scope of the directive.
One could express mild surprise that it was deemed to be in order.
It certainly exercised health charities and researchers.
We need to consider whether it has a place in this measure or not.
On the other hand there are issues that need to be clarified in the way that this measure does.
We should not include organs in this measure on cells and tissues.
Organs are for another day.
Equally, this is not the time to permit cloned human embryos or hybrid human animal embryos to have their cells and tissues used for transplants.
The demise of Matilda, the Australian sheep which disintegrated, serves as an awful warning that this is a very young area of science and experiment and, leaving aside the ethical issues, one that should not be permitted now, simply on the grounds of the potential severe and uncertain impact on human health.
Another issue is the question of remunerated donation.
It is a problem that arose in Mr NisticÃ²'s report on blood.
It was recognised then that we have different traditions and needs.
Voluntary donation is preferable but not always possible.
We will have to look again at this to see if we can find a form of words that will cover our many traditions and needs.
I suspect that we will end up not a million miles from the excellent formula that Mr NisticÃ² incorporated in his blood and blood products directive.
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group I welcome this proposal and many of the amendments tabled by colleagues, and those tabled by the rapporteur who has already worked very hard to find a sensible way forward on this.
The proposal is indeed needed to set EU-wide minimum standards on the use of human tissues and cells.
There is a growing and cross-border trade in human tissues and cells across Europe for research in laboratories and clinics and for the production of medical and pharmaceutical products.
We now need to bring forward a European-wide framework in which to control this.
It is currently controlled only by a patchwork of national laws.
But with this increasing trade we need basic standards to guarantee human health, and safety standards on the issues of donation, procurement, compensation and consent.
We need to establish a clear European-wide framework in which the industry can operate and in which people can be confident and public safety ensured.
We can guard against profit-driven markets that might exploit the vulnerable individual and the possible transmission of disease or infection.
We need to operate on a not-for-profit principle and apply that to all donations in all Member States across the whole of the European Union.
There is a danger that some people, driven by financial necessity, might perhaps be persuaded to donate cells, either here within the European Union or perhaps in the developing world, for financial gain.
We must find a way to stop that.
We must get the balance right.
We want to rule out the sale of human tissues for cash, but leave the door open for limited financial compensation for the donor.
It is quite clear to me that if you need two weeks off work for a bone marrow transplant it is not unreasonable for some form of payment to be made to your employer.
These new rules will set the necessary minimum safety criteria for the use of tissues and cells across Europe.
Minimum standards on donation and compensation based on a not-for-profit system are essential.
We should also have clear rules on the issue of stem cell research, including embryonic stem cells but excluding cloning for human reproduction.
If we can establish these minimum standards of donor consent, we will protect the vulnerable individuals who could be persuaded into donating cells under pressure.
However, I cannot entirely support all the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues.
Those amendments seeking, for example, to ban or restrict the use of embryonic stem cells totally are doing the European public no favours.
They are not protecting human health, nor are they protecting the vulnerable.
I wish that MEPs and pressure groups that argue the need so strongly to defend ethical principles were equally vocal in their defence of the sick and the vulnerable, like my young constituent Zain Hashmi, who this week was able with his parents to get permission to utilise these new technologies to protect his life and safeguard his future.
Without these kinds of new technologies, the future for young men like that is extremely bleak.
I sincerely hope that we can take this proposal forward with sensible steps, bearing in mind the key issues of protecting human health and safety and protecting the public and vulnerable individuals from exploitation.
I commend the report to the House, but not all of the amendments.
Mr President, first of all, following the example of previous speakers, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Liese, for the high level of contact which he has maintained, right from the beginning, with all the parties concerned and, of course, with the various nominal rapporteurs, in order to produce this report, which represents an overall balance.
This compromise was difficult to achieve, between the advocates of subsidiarity, the supporters of ethics at any price and all those, including myself, who want to respond to the expectations and hopes placed in us by millions of patients in Europe, without, however, hindering the development of the European biotechnology sector.
Indeed, thanks to the grafting of corneas, heart valves, bones, tendons and skin, the lives of patients are actually prolonged and improved.
Just to give one example, repairing the damage caused by major burns involves nearly twenty thousand European citizens every year, while 60 000 diabetics had to have amputations in 2002 because of the lack of any effective procedure for reconstructing skin.
We must be clear about this: all these people awaiting treatment will either not be treated or will be badly treated if tomorrow the European Parliament adopts a moralistic stance and prohibits, directly or indirectly, research into stem cells, embryos and germ gene therapy.
That is the reason why the majority of the Liberal group is firmly opposed to a good thirty of the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 30, 31, 36, 37, 46 and 50, but I do not propose to list all of them here.
One fundamental reminder is necessary: we are concerned here with a public-health issue, based on Article 152 of the Treaty.
It is therefore a matter of quality criteria, approval standards, qualifications, staff training, traceability tests, and the setting up of a European network bringing together the registers of national tissue banks.
This is what lies at the heart of the proposal, and I have heard very little about it, since ethical issues have overtaken it.
Nevertheless, at the committee stage we did reach a compromise on organ donations, on the highly sensitive question of voluntary and non-remunerated donation, on umbilical cord blood donations and on fair access to the various treatments for all patients.
We are determined not to let all these advances be reduced to nothing here because some people are confused between the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. It is not Europe's objective or ambition to harmonise ethics, and having a conscience in matters of science has never treated anyone.
For all these reasons, the Liberal group, in self-defence, reserves the right to vote against this report and to go back to the Commission's balanced proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Liese, ladies and gentlemen, we are familiar with the development of treatments based on the use of tissues and cells of human origin.
There are hundreds of thousands of such treatments every year.
It was therefore a matter of urgency that the Commission should propose a draft directive seeking to draw up new quality and safety standards in order to increase public confidence in the use of such tissues and cells in and on the human body.
I therefore approve the Commission's action without reservation, and I support it.
Unfortunately, as someone has already said this evening, there are too many amendments, leading in every direction, and this threatens to change the nature of the initial draft, thereby depriving us of regulations which are, however, urgently needed.
This is why this evening, in this debate, on behalf of the GUE/NGL, I should like to remind the House of the three fundamental principles which lead me to oppose many of these amendments.
The first principle is that we must not take advantage of a draft directive, the need for which nobody would deny, in order to broaden its scope so as to include sectors which will have to have special regulations, or which have such regulations already.
Above all, we must not use this draft as a means of opening debates about stem cells, embryonic cells and supernumerary cells, about research into these subjects, or even about voluntary termination of pregnancy.
Many amendments contain these objectives, camouflaged, to a greater or lesser extent, by good intentions, and for that reason we shall not be voting in favour of them.
The second principle is that research and science should be enclosed by ethical rules in order to avoid irresponsible actions which are dangerous to the human species, but they must not be prevented by religious prohibitions, from whatever quarter.
This is a basic rule of secularity.
It is a necessary condition in order to guarantee progress.
Here again, there is no shortage of amendments which should be rejected in the name of this principle.
The third principle is that the human body should not be available for sale, for purchase or for theft.
On this point at least we must all be agreed, and we must also be agreed on the fact that this principle implies, firstly, a real and explicit willingness on the part of the donor and, secondly, explicit protection of the anonymity of the donor and of the recipient. Any exception would be a source of all kinds of abuses and excesses.
However, that does not prevent traceability, which guarantees that the quality of transplants can be controlled.
Thirdly, the fact that donations should be given without remuneration should not even be a matter for discussion: human bodies are not commercial goods.
In conclusion, I repeat that the development of these therapeutic treatments is such that a European directive is essential.
However, this development also makes it essential, at the same time, for the European Parliament, in other words for us, to show rigour and respect for the great principles which very many of us have in common and which we cannot allow to be called into question, even insidiously.
Mr President, we welcome many of the points contained in Mr Liese's report.
In particular we support the amendments which seek to exclude from the scope of this directive tissues and cells originating from human embryos or genetic engineering, insofar as there is no European legislation defining the use of gene therapy.
One compromise, however, is causing us problems, and that is the one concerning voluntary and non-remunerated donations of human tissues and cells.
What we want is a guarantee that such donations will be unpaid.
In order to achieve such a guarantee, it is necessary to define specifically, in this directive, the legitimate and acceptable level of compensation, which in our opinion is the reimbursement of travelling costs and income lost during the period required for the journey, the donation, and any rest period which is necessary, plus refreshments and that sort of allowance, but nothing more.
Otherwise we shall be leaving the door open to compensation - or even remuneration - for such donations, with all the foreseeable abuses in terms of quality and safety, and the risks that would result for both donors and recipients.
As the previous speaker said, bodies are not commercial goods.
Our cells and tissues are not for sale.
Another fundamental principle of this directive is that of anonymity, which must be compatible with the traceability of the tissues and cells.
The proposal by the European Commission, enhanced by the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has succeeded in taking both of these principles into account.
The plenary session of this Parliament should not call into question this fragile equilibrium by adopting amendments seeking to remove anonymity from donors of gametes and therefore of sperm donations, or to make tissue and cell distribution records available to the public, and I am referring here to one amendment in particular.
The transparency argument is ill-advised in this case.
The need to trace tissues and cells destined for transplantation from the donor to the recipient should not work to the detriment of anonymity.
That would be to leave the door open to abuses of an ethical, eugenic or even racial nature.
Finally, we would ask the Commission, which did not want to include organs within the scope of this directive, to propose as a matter of urgency a specific text for establishing quality and safety standards in respect of organs.
I believe that this report is a balanced one.
We should continue to work in this direction, including during subsequent readings.
Mr President, I commend the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his conscientious work on this very sensitive and technical subject.
I know that he has consulted widely with the political groups in order to make his report as reflective as possible of the various concerns and opinions.
I commend the Commission for taking this initiative under Article 152.
This is a relatively new area for EU legislation.
It is important, as with the blood directive, to get things right. It is also important that actions taken in the medical sphere be properly positioned within the ethical framework.
This framework must naturally take due account of national practices.
The Commission is certainly aware of the speed and efficiency with which this proposal was dealt with in Parliament.
I sincerely hope that the very helpful set of amendments proposed by the rapporteur on behalf of the committee will be taken on board.
There are a number of areas in which Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal.
As far as ethical principles are concerned, I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary, unpaid donations of cells and tissues.
There are clear public health risks involved in attracting the wrong type of donors through turning tissue procurement into a commercial activity.
I strongly support the reinforcement of the consent principle so as to give the maximum protection to donors.
In this respect it is important that the use of aborted foetal tissue be excluded.
Similarly I am opposed to the notion of creating human life for the sole purpose of harvesting tissues, after which this human life is to be disposed of.
This would be in total violation of the concepts of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I also endorse those amendments that exclude from the scope of this directive any cells or tissues that are derived from cloned material.
This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning.
I want to ask the Commission when we can expect to see a proposal for a directive on organ transplants.
I call on the Commission to give Parliament a commitment in that regard before we cast our vote on this proposal.
Mr President, I recognise the objections of Commissioner Byrne to having organs covered by this directive as well, but there are also arguments in favour of it.
A tissue is a group of cells with the same structure or function.
Organs in their turn consist of different tissues.
Cells, tissues and organs can all be donated, so the quality and safety standards must apply to all three - to organs too.
The transition between organs and tissues is a fluid one.
Because of the scarcity problem that exists with organs, which in fact is also the case with different tissues, a separate directive is perhaps required, but that does not alter the fact that the same quality requirements with regard to donating, etc., must apply to organs.
In short, will the structure of a directive on organs not correspond closely to the present directive on tissues and cells?
Do I understand the Commissioner correctly that what is requested in Amendments Nos 6 and 62, that is a proposal for a directive on organs before the summer of 2003, is not feasible?
May we hear something more about the timetable for a directive on organs?
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission's representative supported my Amendment No 99 on cells.
The rapporteur has objections.
Therefore Commissioner, I would like to hear from you what you think.
Otherwise we warmly support this directive, certainly because it refers to fundamental ethical principles that trade must meet.
All praise too for the substantial expert work of the rapporteur, Mr Liese.
On the basis of what I have just said, I am prepared to withdraw my Amendments Nos 96 to 98 and 100 to 102 on organs and I have also secured the cooperation of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on this, who at the time tabled these amendments with me.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like, in my turn, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his excellent work on information and analysis, in cooperation with all his colleagues, but also with experts at a very high level.
Cell therapy and tissue grafting are areas which offer the hope of treating incurable diseases which leave so many people in pain and anxiety.
However, mastery of this technique alone is not enough to respond to the expectations of sick people.
That is why we need this proposed directive, the objective of which is to ensure that there is a framework of safety and quality standards for human tissues and cells.
As far as voluntary non-remunerative donation and donor anonymity are concerned, the directive cannot impose obligations on Member States by virtue of the European Treaty, but can only make recommendations.
Donation must be non-remunerative.
How could anyone ever imagine trading in human products?
The saving of a life is a disinterested action, taken with no reward in mind.
Donation should also be voluntary, and therefore requires obligatory informed and written consent by the living donor.
This is why it is essential to inform society about the advisability of these treatments and about the responsibilities of each of us, in a spirit of solidarity, because the health of thousands of human beings can be improved in this way.
The people of our countries are not sufficiently aware of the benefits of human tissue and cell donations.
How many lives have been saved, how many patients treated, by bone-marrow grafts?
The directive should be accompanied by much more detailed information.
This information should be more reliable and should be based on authentic scientific research.
For example, how many times have we been told that embryonic stem cells would treat incurable diseases, whereas so far nothing has been published to prove this?
It would be wrong to say that prohibiting the use of embryonic cells would prevent lives from being saved.
There are other alternatives, in particular techniques involving adult stem cells.
Moreover, this observation makes us wonder just which cells are covered by the proposed directive.
I shall be supporting the position of the French Government on three points.
Under Article 152(4) of the Treaty, it is not our task to regulate the use of cells of any particular type, such as germ cells or embryonic cells, by means of this directive.
That falls within the jurisdiction of national governments, as do ethical issues involving embryos.
Finally, gametes are not included within the scope of the directive.
I shall be voting in favour of this report, but I shall continue to pay great attention to the issue of respect for the dignity of both the donor and the recipient.
Mr President, Commissioner, I hope with all my heart that this report, into which Mr Liese has poured so much energy, will have a natural birth without the need for forceps like the report on blood, which had long been the subject of controversy but for which we succeeded in finding a solution after many years thanks to active, intelligent, enthusiastic cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
I shall mention just a few points this evening - four, in particular.
Firstly, I feel that it is right - as Mr Liese said - that the donation of cells and tissues should be on a voluntary basis and unpaid, a principle already endorsed when the report on blood was adopted.
However, where industry has helped to improve the quality and conservation of cells and tissues, for example by using genetic engineering techniques to make tissues histocompatible, it is right to allow for appropriate payment.
Secondly, I hope that Amendment No 83, proposed by myself and Mr Liese, will be adopted. It calls upon the Commission to draw up new legislation on the use of retrodifferentiation to create stem cells from adult cells as soon as possible.
The retrodifferentiation of adult cells, achieved by transferring their nucleus, rather than to an egg cell without a nucleus, to a medium rich in nutritive elements and other growth factors, could make it possible to overcome the current ethical problems connected with the therapeutic use of stem cells from human embryos.
Thirdly, as regards the use of stem cells for research purposes, I hope that the rules laid down in the Sixth Framework Programme will always remain in force and that we do not let anything in by the back door today that should not be there.
Fourthly and lastly, I support the Commission's proposal that the directive should cover the use of cells and tissues for research purposes where this is carried out on human beings but not where experimental research is carried out in vitro or on animal models.
I would therefore call upon the rapporteur, Mr Liese, should Amendments Nos 7 and 19 be adopted, to introduce more flexibility at second reading to avoid unwieldy administrative procedures slowing down research in Europe in key fields such as pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, for example, whose objective is to develop new drugs which are much more effective and have no toxic action.
Mr President, Commissioner, today, biotechnology offers new health policy perspectives which are very welcome.
This also applies to the use of human tissue and cells.
We should capitalise on the positive opportunities afforded by these new developments as far as possible, even if it is clear that from today's perspective, the prospects are not always as promising as is suggested in some quarters.
However, we should certainly utilise the opportunities.
The use of these new technologies must, however, be measured against the fundamental principles and rules which define the community of values that constitutes the European Union.
A fundamental pillar of this community of values is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Its basic values include, in particular, respect for human dignity, the principle of non-commercialisation of the human body, and the guarantee that cell and tissue donations may take place only on a voluntary basis, without pressure, and with an understanding of all the implications.
Since the Commission's proposal touches only on these issues, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is designated as being responsible for ethical issues in this House, has adopted a number of relevant amendments.
In our view, it is absolutely essential to make it clear that, as in the legislation on donations of blood and blood components, the provision of human tissue and cells should be permitted only on a donation basis, in order to counter any trend towards the commercialisation and objectivisation of the human body.
Let me make it clear: donations of human tissue or cells may only take place voluntarily and without any financial remuneration.
They must also be anonymous, and persons who cannot legally give consent themselves require special protection, for their bodies may not be disrespected, and it must be clear that donations may only be used in the interests of their own health, not for research purposes.
I am thinking specifically of disabled people here.
Let me underline one point in particular: respect for the traditions and cultural differences within the European Union requires that in this law too, Member States must be granted the right to ban the donation and use of cells from specific origins.
This applies particularly to the renunciation of the use of embryonic stem cells in favour of adult stem cells, which have been shown to be just as useful and, indeed, more promising in many cases.
There is, however, a number of proposed amendments which I cannot support under any circumstances, and where I am absolutely of the same opinion as Mr Caudron, who unfortunately has already left.
These are the amendments which try, through the back door, to circumvent abortion, and I think this is something which we cannot accept under any circumstances.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Liese very much for his outstanding work on this report.
I would also like to pay tribute, in particular, to his efforts to include social groups in the work on the report as well.
That is very commendable, for the real task here is genuinely to bring together all the social groups - patients' organisations, but also scientists and others - round the table, and he has been at pains to draw the different positions together.
For us Greens too, it is very important - indeed, I would go as far as to say that it is the priority - to send out a very clear signal to the Member States that embryos may not be used for research purposes.
We do not want to create any incentive for embryos to be produced solely for research purposes.
We also do not want women to be degraded into egg cell or embryo donors.
This is something we must reject, loud and clear.
We must also make it clear that no tissue or cells from embryos in general may be used.
On the issue of embryonic stem cells, too, my position is quite clear: what we are saying is that adult stem cells are just as, if not more suitable.
We cannot awaken any false hopes here.
I would like to mention the damaging reports on gene therapy, which have recently been circulating, in this context.
In this area, far too many false hopes have been awakened for many years, instead of genuinely looking at alternatives.
Science and research without a conscience would be humanity's ruin.
For this reason, the task must be to send out very clear signals here.
It is also important to emphasise in the report, yet again, that the cloning of humans or embryos is not permitted.
In my view, it cannot be stressed often enough, here in Parliament and indeed elsewhere, that we need a very clear limit.
A great deal has already been said about donations without remuneration, and it is clear, as has already been discussed, that the human body is not a commodity.
For this reason, Commissioner, I would urge you once again to respond positively to the demand which we Greens have tabled.
We are calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal before July 2003, for the situation on organ donations in particular is making it increasingly clear that the human body or parts thereof are indeed becoming commodities.
In my view, we need very clear European legislation in this area.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on its proposal and on the speech of the Commissioner presenting it to the House as well.
Mr Liese has certainly striven and is continuing to strive to achieve an acceptable compromise in the House, but I believe that the greatest threat to the quest for such a compromise and to the thorough work of the Commission and many of the Members of the House is the attempt - made by some of the Members - to include issues in the report which have nothing to do with the directive.
In particular, I feel that Mr Bartolozzi's opinion and the position of many of the Members who have attempted and are still attempting to surreptitiously introduce the issue of the interruption of pregnancy and embryonic stem cells into the directive are severely jeopardising the good work which many of the Members are striving to carry out.
For our part, as Radical members of the Emma Bonino List, we can only vote against all the amendments which seek to introduce such issues in this way.
This does not mean - and I am addressing Mrs Montfort and the other Members who have raised the point - that we are claiming that embryonic stem cells are the magic answer to all genetically-related problems and disorders; we merely feel that these research possibilities should not be eliminated and that they should certainly not be eliminated through a directive which is concerned with other matters, which seeks to regulate pragmatically a promising market and an activity which is necessary for the life and health of many European citizens.
We must not become a Parliament which persists in making every vote a vote on a moral principle, as if we were trying to establish a 'single European moral code'.
Let us rather find political, pragmatic, practical solutions to the issues raised by the directive, which, through the directive, the Commission is attempting to resolve.
Mr President, I would first like to draw your attention to the excellent work undertaken by our fellow Member Mr Liese. He has developed and improved upon the Commission's proposal.
I think both the approach and the scope of the Liese report are excellent. Work on this directive began during the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.
It is no accident that in 2002 Spain was the international role model for donations and transplants for the tenth year running.
We therefore have a good understanding of this subject. We are also aware of all the problems involved in the transplantation of tissues, cells and organs.
In recent years, very significant advances in transplant technology have been made, and the public has become more aware of the need to come forward as potential donors.
In this context it is appropriate to establish specific European regulations to control such activities. The regulations are needed to guarantee all these activities can take place within the appropriate ethical, health and social framework in all Member States.
As previously explained, donation and transplant procedures rely on solidarity. They rely on people playing their part in the donation system in an altruistic and disinterested way.
It is therefore very important to ensure people will still volunteer to become donors for no reward.
We must encourage people to come forward and increase the number of potential donors.
Above all, we must ensure families respect donors' decisions when the time comes.
There has been much debate on whether organ transplantation should be included in this directive.
While I believe we need Community regulations on organ transplantation, I think it would be wrong to include the issue in this particular directive. The directive would have to be substantially modified and this could undermine good organ transplant practice.
I therefore believe Amendment No 6 provides a sensible solution to the problem.
It rightly calls on the Commission to present a proposal on the matter in 2003.
On the other hand, I think the Commission's initial proposal, which would exclude cells to be used in the preparation of medicinal products from the directive is improved by Amendment No 21 which does include such cells.
The most controversial aspect of this directive is perhaps the use of tissues and cells from cloned human embryos, because of the important ethical and moral implications.
In my opinion Amendment No 30 establishes a number of basic conditions on respect for human dignity. I think these should apply in all Member States, although some of the latter may wish to take either a stricter or more liberal line on the basis of these common fundamental conditions.
Lastly, as a Member of this House, I would like to convey my full support to those anonymous European citizens who, by donating tissues, cells or organs, offer patients hope and a new lease of life.
They are indeed helping to achieve miracles.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, according to its title, this report claims to deal with safety and quality standards for human tissues and cells.
However, we are well aware that such a text could not fail to mention ethical principles, and that is why a large part of the debate has centred on those issues.
Keen as we are on the concept of voluntary, anonymous and non-remunerated donation, we would have liked to see a firmer stand taken on this subject, and we had already expressed this desire when we had the vote on the report on blood, and had occasion to reaffirm it when we examined the report on organs.
We therefore regret that the objectives of voluntary, anonymous and non-remunerated donation are the subject of mere recommendations, rather than clear commitments, since the absence of any timetable for achieving these objectives means that Member States are not obliged to take all necessary steps to implement projects and policies towards achieving those objectives.
We deplore this and we therefore ask the Commission to carry out a regular evaluation of the progress made in this area at Member State level.
We must not ignore the fact that the safety and traceability of donations will be better guaranteed if those donations originate from a country within the European Union which is subject to our legislation.
Another of our objectives should be self-sufficiency at EU level.
Moreover, trafficking linked to trade in cells and tissues in certain third countries should make us extremely vigilant when we import such products, because if we are not vigilant we might be regarded as passive accomplices in such activities.
In addition, the European Union's Charter of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms states that it is prohibited to make the human body, and parts thereof, a source of profit.
This is why we should vote in favour of Amendment No 77 and Amendment No 1.
With regard to donor anonymity in the case of gametes, and the proposal which has been made, to the effect that such anonymity should be removed, I wonder whether, if this happened, there might be a risk that donors of sperm and oocytes, of which even now there are not enough to satisfy demand, would be put off from entering into such a commitment.
Finally, it seems to me important that the Member States and the Commission should establish a centralised data bank which would receive all available information on approved establishments, on the products handled, and on bio-monitoring.
Mr President, regrettably this directive was not referred to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
The proposed directive 'on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells' is a very important piece of legislation and much to be welcomed.
I rehearsed the full title of this directive because it is important to recognise what it does encompass and what it does not encompass.
Specifically, recital 6 states: 'this Directive does not cover research using human tissues and cells'.
It is a public health measure under Article 152 of the Treaty.
Unfortunately, and quite unacceptably, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's Amendment 7 proposes to change recital 6 to: 'this directive also covers research using human tissues and cells'.
In similar vein, its Amendment 19 to Article 2(1), proposes to delete the limiting phrase 'for application to the human body', thus opening the directive's full provisions to in vitro research in laboratories, or even school rooms, where no application to the human body is involved.
I do not have time to go into all the other problems with this report.
There are technical difficulties concerned with consent by donors, and anonymity of donors.
There are highly questionable forays into areas of ethics which are irrelevant for the purpose and legal basis of this directive.
Even the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has seen fit to insert the legally undefinable term 'fundamental ethical principles' into what purports to be a legal legislative text.
Very importantly, there are attempts to impose European prohibitions on ethical aspects of research and therapy which are clearly the subject of the subsidiarity principle and which it must remain the right of Member States to decide.
I have the greatest regard for my colleague, Mr Liese, and I accept his assurances that he tried to maintain a balanced approach to this subject.
Unfortunately, the result contains many unacceptable points.
Only if these are eliminated between now and the final vote will it be possible for me to support his report.
Mr President, I attach great value and give my full support to Doctor Liese's work in this report, which establishes guidelines for the processing of human tissue in the European Union, which we also call a community of values.
This is a vast subject, so I will just focus on one detail: the processing of stem cells.
It is part of a direct continuum with the work we tried to do in Parliament's Temporary Committee on Human Genetics the year before last.
We got the message: the business aspect was the hottest area.
Investors were in expectant mood.
Expectations were not so much connected with new medical breakthroughs, but mainly the possibility of making lots of money.
The following business hype applies to the field of genetic engineering: you expect to get at least as much for your money out of it as you would out of IT.
In the end what is actually discovered in the research studies does not matter that much.
While we waited for the hype, the fact that there was also an alternative to the cloning of embryonic stem cells - treatment with adult stem cells - was entirely overlooked.
Of course, embryonic stem cells have a greater capacity for differentiating into any sort of tissue.
Recently, however, studies have also opened up promising possibilities in the use of adult stem cells.
The first cells in the human embryo are 'totipotent', which means they can differentiate into any cell type.
Pluripotent stem cells, on the other hand, can differentiate into any cell type but they can no longer be used to create a new human being.
Multipotent stem cells can only produce the cells of a certain tissue type, such as nerve, liver or blood cells.
These are also found in adult cells, and it is those that are more interesting from the point of view of therapeutic cloning.
The latest research points to the fact that some stem cells thought to be multipotent might well be pluripotent.
This would mean that there would be no need to make stem cell chains from human embryos after all.
Mr Liese's report recognises the situation for what it is absolutely correctly, at the same time recognising the ethical problems that are encountered in the processing of embryos.
It is important to say here that a medically sound approach and one that shows ethical wisdom are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
We Christian Democrats say an emphatic 'yes' to research, at the same time wishing to preserve the sanctity of human dignity right from its frail beginnings.
Mr President, the report and the proposal for a directive are important from health and safety points of view.
The rapporteur, Mr Liese, has added some important dimensions by also choosing to address the ethical aspects of a number of points.
Firstly, a new introductory recital on the human body, reading as follows, has been incorporated from the Charter on Human Rights: 'The human body is inviolable and inalienable.
It is prohibited to make the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain'.
Secondly, Amendment No 79 proposes the compilation of a code of conduct, if possible at UN level, for the protection of human dignity.
The amendment states that account should be taken of principles involving, for example, a ban on making the human body or its parts as such a source of financial gain, of the principle of informed consent and of that involving a ban on cloning.
Thirdly, Amendment No 46 points out that the removal of tissues from foetuses originating from the voluntary interruption of pregnancy shall not be permitted.
That is an important position if it is not to be possible to use a distorted utilitarian argument to put pressure upon someone facing a possible decision concerning abortion.
Fourthly, Amendment No 31 contains requirements for regulating, in particular, the use of germ cells, embryonic stem cells and foetal stem cells.
The use of cells that are of sensitive origin from an ethical point of view needs to be specially regulated, if that is not already the case, in the Member States.
Amendment No 82 addresses the issue of donor consent.
Clarification is needed of what should apply in the case of donation and of what is entailed by the obligatory requirements relating to consent.
There are important clarifications of what should apply in the case of persons who cannot legally give consent themselves, as well as in the case of deceased or, as the case may be, living persons.
Sixthly, Amendment No 41 makes important clarifications and addresses the voluntary nature of donations.
At the same time, the Member States are given responsibility for devising more detailed rules.
I can sincerely recommend Mr Liese's report.
Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner, and I congratulate Mr Peter Liese.
After the committee adopted Amendment No 30, I felt a real need to add here that the Member States should, at the least, uphold the ban on research involving the destruction of human embryos.
You see, I would now like to exercise one of the great achievements of our European continent.
I would like to exercise the achievements of freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. Please do not try to make matters easy for yourselves by claiming that we are not here to preach morality!
What else is at stake, then, when embryos are destroyed?
We do not need to harmonise at all, for we all share a common set of ethics which states, at least: you shall not kill!
I respect your opinion, but please respect the opinion of others who say: I will not kill!
Someone once told me that at the very moment when the egg and sperm cells join, a unique person is created - not just anyone, but a person with a specific hair colour and individual qualities - in other words, a human being.
I know there are the famous fourteen days, Mr Purvis. I am afraid that we do not entirely agree on this issue.
Has individuation occurred or not?
Am I not already killing?
Please recognise that people are afraid of having to kill.
Yet perhaps we are discussing all this quite unnecessarily.
Let me tell you that a few days ago, Professor Huber of Vienna University presented his most recent research achievements and findings.
In many years of work on blood obtained from umbilical cord, he has achieved massive successes which give him the justified hope that in a few years, he will be able to generate organs from it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I spoke at the start in my capacity as rapporteur, and now I have a further three minutes of speaking time on behalf of my group, which gives me the opportunity to address some of the points raised by my fellow Members.
Let me come first to Mrs Ries.
Unfortunately, she was unable to stay for the rest of the debate, but as I have already told her in person, it would be a great shame if, due to the 10% on which we disagree, the Liberal Group were to vote against the entire report.
I think that many of Mrs Ries's amendments which have been included in the report are worth adopting by this House in the end.
I therefore appeal to the Liberal Group to reconsider whether they really are prepared, ultimately, to vote against the entire report.
On Mr Bowe's points regarding a case from his own constituency, where stem cells offer hope for a boy suffering from a serious disease: after he spoke, I went to him and tried to clarify this issue, as it is very important, in my view, to make it clear that these are not embryonic stem cells but adult stem cells from bone marrow.
The experiment nonetheless raises a number of serious ethical questions.
However, it does not involve embryonic stem cells. This point is very important, to my mind, because at the hearing too, it was made clear that embryonic stem cells have not been transplanted into any patients anywhere in the world.
Apart from the ethical issues, the associated medical risks are simply too great.
In response to Mr Caudron, I would like to say that I am aware of this and I also appreciate the fact that he is so consistent in defending his position that research on human embryos and embryonic stem cells should not be ruled out.
In fact, the committee's report does not do so anyway.
Amendment No 30 is the compromise which Mr Caudron negotiated with the Commission and the Council on the Sixth Research Framework Programme, and Amendments No 86 and No 92 go beyond that.
In my heart, I am with Mrs Flemming, and I endorse her arguments.
However, my head tells me that the compromise identified by the committee is possibly better and forms a better basis for the European Union and the European Parliament.
We should therefore certainly support Amendment No 30, and on Amendment No 86, I recommend as rapporteur that we respect freedom of conscience so that everyone can vote as his or her conscience dictates.
Finally, let me make one comment about the legal basis.
I have difficulties explaining to the citizens of Europe that the Commission considers it feasible for us to ban tobacco advertising in regional newspapers but does not ban the trade in cells and tissue running into thousands of euros.
That is not a very coherent position.
Commissioner, I gave you my full support on the ban on tobacco advertising, although on one or two points, I felt that it went too far.
Nonetheless, I was in favour in principle and therefore supported you against a great deal of opposition in Germany.
I therefore ask you to reconsider this issue.
Perhaps you are not yet able to make concessions to us today, but you may be able to do so in the coming weeks and months. I would like to be able to defend the Commission in Germany and the other Member States, and I do not want to have this lack of coherence which I can no longer defend.
Mr President, this interesting debate has highlighted the importance and the sensitivity of this proposal.
I note that many of you, including Mr Liese, are disappointed that the Commission has not offered to go further on the ethical issues.
This is not because we do not consider ethical standards to be important - quite the contrary. It is precisely because ethical standards are so important to our citizens that we must not overstep the mark.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
We have to respect the advice of our legal service - advice also echoed by the legal service of the Council.
As I said in my opening address on this point, the Commission's proposal aims to take to the very limit what is legally acceptable, given the constraints of the Treaty.
We simply cannot push this any further.
That said, I would ask you to consider that if we discount those amendments that go beyond the scope of Article 152, we can accept, fully or partially, a majority of them.
I am pleased to note that most of those amendments substantially improve the directive.
Article 152 still allows us to take all necessary precautions to enforce the central requirement of the European Group on Ethics, namely in the protection of the health of the recipient.
I now turn to the detail of the amendments before us today.
On the scope of the proposal I can accept some clarifications, but the wording has to ensure legal clarity.
A series of amendments aimed to limit the use of certain types of cells, such as cells derived from cloning or abortion.
I share many of your concerns with regard to these issues.
However, with this proposal we seek neither to mandate nor to prohibit the use of specific types of cells because the EU does not have the competence to do so.
It is neither legally possible, nor appropriate, for the Community to act in an area where it is best left to the Member States.
I wish to emphasise that decisions on the use of any specific type of cells and tissues - whatever the type - are a matter for our Member States.
If, however, any particular use of such cells is authorised in a Member State, then the directive kicks in, to require the application of all provisions necessary to protect public health.
As regards the exclusion of organs from the proposal, I reiterate that the Commission does not intend to drop the subject of organs from the agenda.
I attach the utmost importance to taking forward a legislative proposal based on sound science, and will follow it closely.
We are presently engaged in the acquisition of the information and the scientific advice to enable us to bring forward legislation along these lines.
This will take some time.
I appeal to Members of the House, particularly to such distinguished Members as Mr Blokland and Mr Ã Neachtain, to think twice before holding this piece of legislation to ransom and perhaps even taking the step of voting against this report and legislation because the Commission cannot move at a speed that people believe is more appropriate.
As representatives of our various institutions, we both respect the other's institution.
No-one respects the rights of this institution more than I do myself.
But I seek the same respect for my institution, which includes the right of initiative.
It is one of the fundamental requirements of the Community method that we all enjoy and support.
One of the justifications for the retention of this right of initiative is that the Commission brings forward a proposal when and if it is ready - but in this instance, when it is ready.
I have said I will, but I cannot do it now.
I cannot give a promise that I will have a legislative proposal before this House before this summer.
If, with that information, you feel it necessary to vote against this legislation, so be it.
But I would ask you not to do so.
Incidentally, the issue of organ trafficking is being addressed by a new initiative of the Greek Presidency under Title 4 of the EU Treaty.
This initiative, which I support wholeheartedly, aims to make organ trafficking a criminal offence in all Member States.
In addition, we hope that a conference on organ transplantation, organised by the Italian Presidency in Venice this September, will help us to determine the way forward in this area.
In the meantime, the Commission is compiling information on the current situation with regard to organ transplantation in the Member States and applicant countries.
Once again, I appeal to Members to look to their own responsibility and not to hold this particular piece of legislation to ransom because of the views they have about the speed of bringing forward this piece of legislation.
Returning to ethical issues, I have made clear that because of the legal position that has been underlined repeatedly by the legal services of the Council and the Commission, I cannot agree with a large number of the amendments on the table today.
These amendments concern, in particular, voluntary unpaid donation, the principle of not-for-profit procurement and the requirements for donor consent.
The question of voluntary unpaid donation was discussed at length during the codecision procedure on the blood directive.
In the light of this experience, and also in view of the results of the debate in the Council health group so far, I believe that it would save a lot of crucial time if the Council and Parliament did not seek to re-open this debate, but instead stayed with the blood solution, as a number of speakers have already said.
On donor consent, I pointed out that the proposal states that the use of human tissues and cells should take place under conditions protecting the rights and health of all parties, and that the consent of donors and recipients should be given, following the International Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.
With these basic principles in our proposal, we adhere to international standards.
It is then for the Member States to introduce detailed rules.
I do not recommend going any further than that.
Provisions on consent vary across the Member States.
For example, if the donor is deceased, some presume consent whereas others do not.
On the other hand, consent issues are well regulated in all Member States and applicant countries, so the added value of binding provisions at EU-level is, in my view, very doubtful.
In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to accept, at least in principle, the majority of the technical amendments on the table today.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament.
I trust that this will be included in the minutes of this session.
This dossier is one of the Greek Presidency's priorities as regards the health sector, which we hope can achieve a common position in the Council, following Parliament's opinion.
Through this proposal the Community can establish significant new standards for the health of our citizens.
I thank you all, once again, for your efforts on this dossier.
I trust that you all share my desire to see this through to a satisfactory conclusion.
Protecting and improving public health is, after all, at the very centre of our citizens' concerns and expectations.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow Thursday at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0102/2003) by Mrs Evans, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal-health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC (PE-CONS 3610/2003 - C5-0061/2003 - 2000/0221(COD)).
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Evans, and the Conciliation delegation, for their invaluable work paving the way for final agreement on this sensitive dossier.
I recognise the major efforts made by both Parliament and the Council towards finding a satisfactory compromise.
The result is a balanced text taking into account the differing positions and interests of each party towards the goal of progressive harmonisation of the veterinary matters raised by the issue of pet movements.
The final obstacles preventing agreement were removed by the Conciliation Committee on 18 February.
However, as regards the amendments concerning comitology, the Commission takes the view that these do not conform to Decision 1999/468/EC, as Article 8 of that Decision should only cover implementation measures aimed at public health objectives.
The Commission therefore wishes to make the following declaration.
'The Commission considers that the wording of Article 24, paragraphs 2(1) and paragraph 3(1) of this regulation, is not in conformity with Decision 1999/468/EC, as Article 8 of that decision should only cover implementation measures aimed at public health objectives.
As a consequence, the Commission reserves the right to take appropriate action'.
Coming back to the favourable outcome of the conciliation procedure, I repeat that this regulation is excellent news for pet owners.
The agreement reached by the three institutions on this regulation represents a milestone in the establishment of the internal market and probably the most sensitive one in the animal health area, due to concerns in some Member States in relation to rabies.
Progress has been facilitated by the spectacular success over the past decade of our efforts to eradicate rabies within the European Union.
Indeed we are now nearing total eradication.
To conclude, this regulation will have a huge impact on millions of European citizens who will now be able to travel with their pets, thus bolstering their perception of a united Europe by responding directly to their wishes.
Mr President, the agreement reached on this report in the Conciliation Committee at the end of February is indeed very good news for all pet owners, who will soon be able to travel more easily with their animals throughout the European Union.
What has been commonly labelled the pet passport scheme will make it simpler to cross borders and at the same time ensure high safety standards and the protection of public health.
It is worth mentioning again that the Commission brought forward this proposal as a result of the remarkable success of measures taken to control rabies in recent years.
Due to vaccination campaigns the number of cases of rabies in cats and dogs dropped from nearly 500 in 1991 to a mere 5 in 1998 and, as the Commissioner says, it has almost been eradicated.
This success has enabled the Member States to adopt a set of common rules on pet animal movements which is very welcome.
Whilst there are exceptions for the so-called sensitive Member States - the UK, Sweden and Ireland for five years - in the other 12 EU countries proof of a valid rabies vaccination in the form of a passport document will be the only requirement for taking cats, dogs and ferrets between Member States as long as they also have an electronic microchip for identification, although some Member States may continue to use tattoos for an eight-year transition period.
After that time, only microchips will be allowed as it is a more humane and also a more effective method.
In addition to that, microchips enable details of the pet owner to be recorded so it will be easier to trace lost animals and help combat illegal trade in pets.
It is very important to be able to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial movement of animals.
The UK, Sweden and Ireland can still use quarantine for animals coming in from countries outside the EU where rabies is endemic, but for EU countries and countries where the disease is under control they will require vaccination and a follow-up immunity test before travel.
I would like to highlight briefly a couple of the key points that were raised during the discussion of this report.
One is the OIE International Animal Health Code which Parliament wished to use in its entirety when drawing up the list of third countries deemed to be free of rabies.
This is the position that Parliament has stated in earlier discussions.
However, many countries are now moving away from use of this code and away from the strict rabies-free status; so adopting the code could actually unnecessarily exclude some countries from this pet travel scheme.
But, more importantly, it could actually be less effective in stopping the spread of rabies.
We must adopt the wording used in the common position.
Similarly, although Parliament expressed concern about the inclusion of animals younger than three months in the scheme, as they could not have been vaccinated, we have been assured that this will not present a danger to public health and can therefore agree to that for 12 of the 15 countries.
There has also been a great deal of debate on the role of Parliament in agreeing any extension to the five-year transitional period for the UK, Sweden and Ireland.
I am pleased that agreement was reached on this point, as it is of paramount importance that decisions relating to a report which has been adopted under the codecision procedure should themselves be subject to codecision when being amended or reviewed.
The Commission will have sufficient time to consult Parliament and the Council following the scientific assessment of this scheme which will be carried out in 2008.
Similarly, comitology is now limited to implementation measures which Parliament could accept, and the delegation noted the Commission's statement on this.
A controversial issue earlier on was the inclusion of ferrets in the scheme.
The original Commission proposal included ferrets as a category of pets which would not require any specific animal health requirements, and the common position then changed this by putting ferrets in a separate category, so they will require vaccination and identification.
While many Members have expressed surprise that ferrets can be classed as pets, I can assure them that in Wales, which I represent, there are many ferret owners who will be delighted with this agreement.
This regulation has changed considerably since the Commission first published its proposal, including several aspects relating to animal health and affecting the legal basis used, but we have the basis of a good and effective scheme and one which everyone will welcome.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues in the other groups for their cooperation: the animal welfare intergroup for their support; several other organisations which have provided information and advice; and also the Commission and the Council for what turned out in the end to be a straightforward conciliation.
We now have to ensure that people are aware of what the scheme means, and of how they can prepare in advance to take their pets with them when they travel.
I look forward, on my travels back and forth, to seeing many pet owners taking advantage of these new rules which will benefit everyone.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Evans has just said everything I wanted to say, and given the late hour, we should perhaps depart from the noble principle that everything has already been said, but not by everyone, so I will refrain from repeating everything all over again.
Let me just make two brief comments in addition to what the rapporteur has said.
Firstly, many thanks to the Commission and the Commissioner.
The conciliation procedure was a real pleasure.
We were very pleased to note, in our group, how much effort was made to make concessions to Parliament here, and since we have often said unflattering things about the Council and the Commission yesterday and today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my warm thanks for this truly outstanding conciliation procedure.
Secondly, I would like to say something in the interests of the dogs themselves.
I have a dog myself, and he has told me that he does not want a microchip or a tattoo.
It is no fun at all for dogs to be dragged about the place.
You see these poor dogs on aeroplanes, barking, whining and whimpering, stuck in those awful cages and having to endure a long flight, and I really do think that anyone who gets a dog or cat should realise that they have acquired a living creature, and if they are not prepared to take proper account of its needs, they should not get an animal in the first place.
Mr President, politicians are often told of the old actor's advice that you should never go on stage with children or animals.
I fear, Commissioner, that you and I one way or another are on a stage with animals the whole time!
This, however, has been a variant on the kind of health concerns and maladies with which we are only too familiar, and on behalf of my group I want to thank Ms Evans very warmly for the skilful way in which she has negotiated the process of codecision.
She very modestly says that this was straightforward.
No codecision that gets to that stage is ever entirely straightforward.
You need to know when to advance, when to yield a little, and when to see that there may be further room for compromise.
I cannot say that I was entirely happy about the way every part of this procedure went.
I was not entirely happy about the secure position of the ferrets.
I have been very insecure in the presence of ferrets.
I was not entirely happy about the provisions with regard to animals under three months old.
One has some misgivings there about the rationale for what we have done; but equally the Commission was probably uneasy to some degree about the fact that we have extended into the codecision procedure any further consideration of the exemptions for the UK, Sweden and Ireland, which will follow after five years.
In other words, a standard piece of give and take, the kind of thing that until a few years ago, until we had the present Commission and the present Parliament, was not possible.
It still only works when you have skilled rapporteurs who can go through these shoals.
It has added modestly to the sum total of human happiness as well.
There are many people, lonely people in particular, who are very dependent on the animals with which they share their lives.
If we dare to believe that animals are sentient beings, it is also the case that we have added to the sum of animal happiness as well.
That certainly is the view of my dog, which is the proud owner of two human beings!
Mr President, it is not better animal welfare that is on the agenda at present.
On the contrary, it is the convenience of animal owners, which is being promoted at animals' expense.
In the EU, there is otherwise a lot about the need to improve animal welfare.
Having a larger number of pet animals being moved around is not in the interests of animal welfare.
On the contrary, it may give rise to unnecessary stress.
Fido and Kit are best off at home.
At worst, transportation may result in illnesses such as rabies being spread to countries that, until now, have been free from rabies, possibly including new EU countries.
The proposal would harmonise EU regulations.
Sweden, the UK and Ireland at present have stricter requirements governing the import of pet animals.
They will now, after five years, be forced to withdraw their sensible requirements.
It makes sense to impose veterinary requirements in connection with the transport of animals.
The EU should adopt a set of minimum regulations and call upon all the EU countries to follow Sweden's, the UK's and Ireland's example.
This would take the form of a proposal that puts health and animal welfare above animal owners' freedom of movement.
It is wrong in principal to demand that EU countries with high standards in this area should relax their requirements in order to promote freedom of movement.
On the surface of it, it may seem to be a minor matter, but it is an important matter in terms of principle.
By voting in favour, Parliament would be adopting the principle of harmonising down to a level corresponding to the lowest common denominator, at the same time as abolishing Sweden's, the UK's and Ireland's right to be pioneers.
I have therefore requested a roll-call vote on this matter.
I would call for the proposal on freedom of movement for pet animals to be voted against.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
May I begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in particular its rapporteur, Mrs Auroi, for the positive approach adopted towards the Commission proposal.
This proposal consists of only one amendment added to the last item of the relevant Article of ten Directives on the marketing of seeds and propagating material.
The aim of the proposal is simple - to create a clear legal basis for financing Community comparative trials.
This initiative is in line with the European Parliament proposal to increase the transparency of the Commission budget.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's positive intention is to tidy up ten directives, the first of which dates from 1966, concerning Community comparative tests and trials for various conventional seeds and propagating material.
As the Commission has confirmed over the past twenty-five years, agricultural crops such as cereals, fodder crops, and oilseed and fibre crops have been subject to Community comparative tests on the basis of the applicable legislation.
Over the last few years, this exercise has grown in importance following new legislation on the marketing of propagating material of fruit, vegetables and ornamental plants, which lays down detailed rules for implementing the Community comparative tests.
This post-control system for seed and propagating material marketed in the Community is recognised as being an extremely important tool for the harmonisation of marketing by Member States.
The planned tidying-up exercise, however, would be neither complete nor relevant if the comparative tests funded by the European Union were limited to currently certified seed and plants included in the Union's common catalogue.
The Commission's proposal must take into account the recently adopted legislative provisions in the area of processed products, as regards the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified seed in conventional varieties of seed.
Moreover, it seems to me that in order to update these directives properly three objectives have to be achieved.
First of all the proposal must cover all existing seed, so as to have a complete range which takes into account, in addition to traditional seed, the special requirements of biodiversity, and the effects of introducing biotechnology via GMOs.
Secondly, it must include within its scope the so-called 'amateur' varieties, covered by Directive 98/95, which is still not taken into account by all Member States.
Thirdly, for the sake of democracy, it must enable Parliament to be involved in the decision-making process right the way through from beginning to end.
In this sense, the sensitive issue of the risk of contamination of traditional seed by GMOs must be included in the series of directives concerning the marketing of seed with which we are dealing here today.
This issue cannot be dealt with by the committee procedure, because that would exclude Members of the European Parliament from the debate and prevent them from making proposals on this subject.
If I may return briefly to my first point, the comparative tests funded by the European Union should not be limited to the species included in the common catalogue.
Conservation varieties and seed originating in organic farming should benefit from these tests.
They have to be tested in conditions which correspond to these farming systems and they therefore require more funding.
It should be pointed out such seed is not allowed to be coated and must be absolutely free from any trace of GMOs.
Tests of the same type are necessary for plants at risk of GMO contamination.
In effect, this proposal for a directive provides an opportunity to settle issues regarding the proven presence of genetically modified seed in conventional seed.
The Commission has been working for some considerable time on a directive which would legislate on additional conditions and requirements regarding the presence of genetically modified seed in batches of seed, planting sites, and details of the marking of such seed.
Unfortunately, the draft of the latest directive does not sufficiently take into account Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, which has come into force in the meantime.
To come back to my second point, it is important that the conservation species and varieties referred to in Directive 98/95 should be defined and tested for marketing in accordance with special criteria, and that will require an implementing regulation, something which we are still waiting for.
In the same way, farm-saved seed or seed of local origin ought to be able to benefit from special flexibility and should be the subject of special contracts linked to Directive 98/95.
When it comes to my third point, this is where the democratic debate plays an important role.
In the modified articles it is important to decline, as I have tried to do, to make any reference to precise traceability.
It is therefore important to say, for each type of seed individually, that if accidental or technically unavoidable traces of GMOs are present in that seed, it is possible to set a threshold level, below which the seed can nonetheless be placed on the market.
The level of that threshold should be established in accordance with Article 21 and set at the lowest possible level allowed in accordance with state-of-the-art scientific knowledge.
Moreover, appropriate measures must be taken during the transport and storage of traditional seed, so that the accidental or technically unavoidable nature of any GMO pollution can be proved.
In fact, although the directive already lays down that genetically modified seed must be labelled, it does not provide a solution to the problem of the risk of traces in traditional seeds, the rule being that such seed must not, in principle, contain any GMOs.
This rule is extremely important to farming, because the spread of contaminated seed may have unforeseeable economic consequences, both for farmers and for food producers.
Finally, the directive already lays down that the Community may make a financial contribution to the carrying out of the tests laid down in Paragraphs 1 and 2.
The same treatment should be possible for the special comparative tests needed for seed and plants produced and cultivated for organic farming and for the utilisation and conservation of genetic diversity in plants.
For the sake of transparency, therefore, it will be necessary in future to establish a clear legal basis for a financial contribution, of whatever kind, and it is therefore necessary to make provision for Community financial measures which will be applicable to these comparative tests and which will include the necessary obligatory Community budget expenditure.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for being present in this debate.
As Commissioner Byrne has said, this is about the marketing of seeds and I am rather disappointed that Mrs Auroi has decided to bring in GMOs.
This report is about the marketing of traditional, conventional seeds and to bring in GMOs is really not part of the topic that we are debating today.
I say that to Mrs Auroi as a seed producer and a seed grower.
We spend much time and effort making sure that the product that we produce is completely free from any contamination and this is the way that conventional and traditional seeds are grown.
To bring the issue of GMOs into this piece of legislation is wrong.
It is also wrong because in fact the next piece of legislation to come from the Commission will be one on GMO seeds, after the two reports that are to go through Parliament, one of which is Mr Trakatellis's report which is currently before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and of which Commissioner Byrne is well aware.
Therefore I see little point at the moment in bringing that up and that is why I hope this Parliament will endorse my amendments while agreeing with the principle stated by Mrs Auroi that we must be aware of the situation with contamination of GMOs.
I have tried to bring a little bit more of what I call a more pragmatic approach into this legislation and I hope this House will support my amendments on Mrs Auroi's report which, while supporting in principle what she said, will in practice enable the Commission to bring in the proposal that is due to be submitted after the two reports in Parliament.
Therefore it is quite important that we look at these.
I say to Mrs Auroi that, yes, we are all aware of the risk of GMO contamination but it has not happened yet and there is no certainty that it will happen in the future; everyone involved in seed production is concerned about it, but please wait until this legislation comes from the Commission, when we will be able to take a decision on it.
Mr President, quality assurance in food production poses major challenges to all those involved in the production chain.
One of the tasks is to utilise those resources which safeguard transparency and traceability for all market participants, and, of course, for consumers.
Seed production is a broad-based business; marketing is regulated in the various countries by official supervisory authorities, and the factors such as varietal purity and certification of origin are confirmed.
This report is intended to close the gaps.
To this end, financial support in the sum of EUR 1 million is available, but as I have already said, this is a broad-based business.
The provision of EUR 1 million illustrates, to my mind, how long it will take to be able to carry out comparative tests in this area.
Labelling has always been required for the genetically modified varieties, and it is a matter for the countries themselves to deal with the thresholds.
The problem of multiplication of sowing seed on individual farms, which is addressed here, will and should be regulated flexibly through special replicate licences, a solution which I can only endorse.
Here, there have been - and continue to be - substantial gaps.
The EU should deal comprehensively with the entire complex issue of GMOs within the framework of the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan, also as regards seed.
I wish to call, at this point, for competition law and competitive freedom of choice to be maintained, not restricted, in agricultural production.
This report does not do so, but I would like to highlight this issue once again.
Mr President, it is correct that the Commission did not wish, by way of this amendment of the Directive, to address the issue of genetically modified organisms.
However, when a new proposal for a directive is presented, we have every right to bring in our own ideas - for, after all, we in the European Parliament have no right of initiative.
The burning issue at present is not comparative tests, but coexistence between seed containing genetically modified organisms and seed for organic farming, which cannot contain GMOs by law.
It is this coexistence that is the problem.
It was not so difficult as long as there was no contamination, no transfer of genetically modified organisms.
Indeed, the scientists had told us that this was not possible - until one of their genes escaped.
The problem facing us now is that we cannot protect organic seed.
This is the problem that we are seeking to address.
In advance of this process, the Commission is putting forward proposals which we do not find satisfactory.
However, we want to put this problem at the heart of the debate, and we have used the report for this purpose.
Mr President, tidying up the rules, as the Commission intends in the present proposal, deserves the support of this Parliament.
Instead of ten directives, there is going to be just one new one.
In this new directive, account can also be taken of the latest developments in the field of seeds.
Unfortunately, the Commission's plans fall short.
The rapporteur rightly argues that the new directive is incomplete if it takes no account of the specific requirements of biological agriculture.
In this form of agriculture, seeds may not contain any GMOs or pesticides.
Non-genetically modified seeds that are contaminated with GMOs must be kept off the market.
We consider the introduction of GMOs undesirable as a matter of principle, but apart from that the EU is obliged to ensure a lasting GMO-free line of crops.
For the threshold value below which contaminated seeds may nonetheless be put on the market, the most recent state of the art must alone be decisive.
Finally, we all know the effect of one coloured sock in a white wash.
Mr President, not only am I Right-wing in orientation, but I also sit on the right.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my fellow Member Mrs Auroi, for this report.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the Community comparative tests.
For twenty-five years, comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions.
The scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years.
This system of follow-up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the Member States and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market.
These comparative tests must not, however, be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the Union's common catalogue.
There must also, in my view, be a quite specific way of dealing with seed designated for use in organic farming.
With this Directive, however, we should not only be looking at organic agriculture.
I believe we should also be taking a look at conventional farming, and so I personally wish to support Mr Sturdy's amendments.
A clear threshold for GMO traces in seed must be laid down in accordance with the latest scientific knowledge and research, not ideological criteria.
If the traces lie below this threshold, it should still be permissible to place the seed on the market.
The presence of genetically modified organisms in seed, at least in the lower batches, is generally adventitious and often technically unavoidable.
What is required here is genuinely feasible detectability in order to draw conclusions as to whether the seed should be placed on the market.
With this Directive, we must therefore create a clear legal framework for agriculture as a whole - both for organic and conventional farming - and for food producers.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the open market, the free internal market, is one of our European Union's greatest achievements.
However, it is also one of the most difficult chapters, as open market access must not distort competition.
We need harmonisation of the marketing conditions in the Member States.
This sounds quite simple at first, but it is actually extremely complicated, not only because there is a large number of products to regulate, but also because we must focus on upholding the same conditions as regards cultivation, care, and not least, quality definition.
For twenty-five years, comparative tests have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions.
I myself was a rapporteur on the amendment of Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine.
The report was adopted by Parliament on 24 October 2000, and today, two and a half years later, the Commission is still only at the stage of discussing the contents of Annexes I to IV.
With the tighter provisions envisaged here, I see a risk that the report's intention, namely to simplify, will be pursued ad absurdum.
The virus tests which are called for, for example, would result in very high costs, which could lead to a reduction of clones and thus a depletion of genetic resources.
This clearly conflicts with the Directive, whose content aims, in the long term, to abolish standard material while maintaining genetic diversity.
I therefore ask the Commission this: firstly, why is the work here progressing so slowly?
Secondly, can the Standing Committee on Seeds really amend a Commission proposal - one that Parliament supports - so radically?
The resultant question for all of us is how effective our cooperation is.
Today, however, we are discussing the financial contributions made by the Community for the comparative tests.
I support the Commission's proposal to create a clear financial basis for this support.
Mr President, I wish to start by twice expressing my thanks: first to our rapporteur, Danielle Auroi, for her work on this report, which reveals her considerable efforts to try to synthesise and extend the scope of these directives.
Secondly, I wish to thank the Commission, because I greatly welcome the fact that it has presented these proposals to provide a clear and transparent legal basis for funding comparative tests and trials for seeds and plants.
I therefore think that we are all on the right track and that this is precisely what is needed.
The fact is, however, that there are some differences of opinion on how far this work should go.
On this I agree with various fellow Members who have spoken and with the rapporteur herself on the need to take a broader view of the entire issue of testing seeds and plants.
We must therefore address this issue in a way that better reflects the reality of the situation.
Of course, we can then disagree on the issue of whether or not to regulate the issue of mixing pure seeds with seeds containing GMOs.
My views on this matter are not based on ideology and like Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I also believe that we must accept what science has to say and that we must adopt a limit that entails no risk of excessive contamination.
I also agree, however, with the need to ensure that we have pure seeds that are, as far as possible, uncontaminated by GMOs.
For this reason, it would perhaps be worthwhile providing for special funding only for seeds not containing GMOs, covering organic farming, of course, but also traditional farming, which uses traditional regional and local seeds and varieties that are not sold on any large scale but which ought to be safeguarded from the point of view of genetics.
The Commission appreciates the broad acceptance of its proposal, and has examined in detail all the amendments proposed.
I should make clear from the start that many amendments go beyond the scope of the original Commission proposal.
The request to ensure the inclusion in the Community comparative trials of organically produced seed, and seed falling in the area of plant genetic resources deserves consideration.
However, the proposal to take specific measures in these areas has to be carefully considered to avoid any risk of overlapping with measures already in place.
For this reason, Amendments 2, 4, 5, 6, and the relevant parts of Amendments 12 to 17, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 are acceptable - subject to re-wording.
The compulsory indication of Community financial allocations laid down by parts of Amendments 12 to 17, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 can be accepted only as a general recommendation to the Commission, again subject to rewording.
Concerning Amendment 22, the Council has already adopted the legal base for the implementation of measures for the marketing of seeds and plants for the conservation and diversity of genetic resources in Europe (for example, Article 21 of Council Directive 2002/54/EC on the marketing of beet seed).
Hence the principle is acceptable, but not the amendment as such.
I should add that this is an area to which the Commission is paying particular attention.
Amendments 7 to 11 cannot be accepted.
The reference to financial and to other commitments of the Member States should take into account the specific competencies of the Member States.
Allow me now to turn to the important issue of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in seeds of conventional plant varieties.
This is a totally different matter to the issue of comparative trials that we are discussing here today.
It is therefore being addressed in another proposal, in the context of the directives on the marketing of seeds.
A proposal for a Commission directive is being prepared, which will aim to set thresholds in this regard.
As a consequence, Amendments 1, 3, 23, and the relevant parts of Amendments 12, 13, 18, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 cannot be accepted.
In relation to Amendments 24 to 29, they are not accepted on the basis that they repeat exactly the Commission proposal.
I have explained on a number of occasions how the Commission intends to proceed with this file.
As the seeds thresholds for GMOs are based on the food labelling threshold, and as the labelling threshold will be discussed again in the next few months in Parliament during the second reading of the proposed GM food and feed regulation, the Commission will wait for the outcome of these discussions before proceeding with the question of GMO thresholds in seeds.
As Parliament is aware, there is draft legislation in preparation at the moment in relation to that issue.
On this issue I should refer to the points made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in relation to coexistence.
This issue has been dealt with by my colleague Commissioner Fischler, who is bringing forward a communication to the Commission within the next number of weeks on that issue which I expect will deal with that situation.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament.
I trust that this will be included in the minutes of this session.
Finally, I would I reiterate my commitment, prior the adoption by the Commission of any Commission Directive on the subject, to listen to the views of all concerned, in particular the European Parliament.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0049/2003) by Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs (COM(2002) 375 - C5-0341/2002 - 2002/0152(COD)).
In July 2002 the Commission adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs.
The main objective of this proposal is to authorise two new sweeteners that have received a favourable opinion by the Scientific Committee on Food: Sucralose and the salt of aspartame and acesulfame.
Furthermore, the Commission proposes to reduce the intake of cyclamate, as an already authorised sweetener, for which the Scientific Committee on Food has considerably lowered the acceptable daily intake.
To this end, the Commission proposed to reduce the amount of cyclamates permitted in soft drinks and to prohibit their use in a series of other foodstuffs, such as confectionery, chewing gum and ice cream.
The Commission also proposed to decide in comitology whether a substance fulfils the definition of a sweetener as laid down in the directive.
Such a decision is of technical nature and can already be taken by comitology for all other food additives according to existing legislation.
It is necessary to have a formal tool to bring certain substances under the scope of the food additive legislation.
This is in the interest of consumer protection.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank my colleagues and the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and also the staff of the appropriate Directorate-General, for their excellent cooperation.
As the Commissioner has just explained, the European Parliament is being asked to vote on the second amendment to the 'sweeteners' directive since its adoption in 1994.
The Directorate-General responsible is therefore proposing that two new sweeteners, namely sucralose and salt of aspartame-acesulfame, should be added to the positive list of sweeteners already approved in the European Union.
This proposal follows the favourable opinion on these two sweeteners issued in the year 2000 by the Scientific Committee for Food.
As part of this second revision of the sweeteners directive, the European Commission has also proposed that the use of a third sweetener be revised, namely cyclamic acid.
Following a re-evaluation of this sweetener by the Scientific Committee, the Commission proposes that the cyclamate thresholds contained in certain foods and drinks should be reduced.
Studies, in particular those carried out in Denmark, have shown that a child weighing fifteen kilos or less might very rapidly reach the threshold of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), which could involve a risk to that child's health.
New studies being carried out in several Member States would seem to confirm this opinion.
Finally, the last amendment proposed for this directive by DG Health and Consumer Protection is concerned with the committee procedure.
The Commission, as you have just reminded us, wants to be given the power to decide whether a substance falls within the 'sweeteners' category, without going through the process of approval by the European Parliament.
On this point, the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy showed a very clear refusal to transfer that power to the Commission alone.
Even though Members of the European Parliament are aware of the technical nature of this type of decision, your rapporteur believes that the European Parliament's prerogative should be retained, since scientific expertise may be subject to controversy.
Moreover, this amendment will be proposed again when the framework directive covering sweeteners is revised.
Your rapporteur would prefer to wait for this more general revision.
In any case, the absence of amendments on this point would seem to indicate that Members of the European Parliament would also prefer to put it off until the forthcoming general legislative revision.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted in favour of the request for the authorisation of the placing on the market of the two new sweeteners, but it also voted in favour of the adoption of an amendment requiring a re-evaluation of these two substances three years after the entry into force of the revised directive.
Your rapporteur is aware of the provisions of the directive, particularly as regards the monitoring system, but I would prefer to remind the European Commission and the Member States of their obligations regarding the monitoring of sweeteners and the collection of data.
The collection of information on real consumption in the European Union and on the possible effects of the consumption of sweeteners on human health must be organised as soon as the products containing those sweeteners are placed on the market, so as to enable a re-evaluation of existing information to be carried out within the time limits laid down.
It has to be admitted, however, that Member States are not doing enough to collect this information, and the European Commission does not always have the means to ensure that Member States observe the provisions contained in the directive, particularly with regard to reporting to the Commission.
Your rapporteur is well aware of the gap which exists between the adoption of legislation and its implementation, and I believe that the work of Parliament also includes reminding those responsible of the need to apply the law.
As far as cyclamates are concerned, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted in favour of adopting a stronger position than the one recommended by DG Health and Consumer Protection.
In effect, the committee is proposing to reduce cyclamate levels to 250 mg and to extend this provision to cover all drinks.
This extension is necessary because drinks containing cyclamates may easily be served to small children, owing to the very nature of those drinks.
Moreover, this greater reduction is also necessary because it takes more account of the switch from a temporary ADI to a lower permanent ADI adopted by the Scientific Committee.
On this basis, your rapporteur supports Amendment No 9, tabled by Mrs SchÃ¶rling.
Before I finish, I should like to mention the issue of fine bakery products.
Two amendments have been proposed.
I shall not attempt to conceal my preference for the one that I and my political group have proposed, because it is the result of collective work and because I believe that consumers ought to know what ingredients or products the foods that are sold to them contain.
However, I am also prepared to accept Amendment No 12, with an oral amendment which will be proposed tomorrow.
It enables us to find a solution as far as this category of foods is concerned, and I believe that these two amendments propose an acceptable solution.
I hope, therefore, that Members will vote in such a way as to enable us to propose a solution on this point to the Council.
Having spoken about the technical aspects of my report, I shall now conclude my presentation of that report by referring, in broader terms, to the question of consumer protection, which in this case is linked to public-health issues.
I am well aware, of course, that sweeteners can bring some comfort to people whose state of health requires them to follow a special diet.
However, the existence of products containing such sweeteners must not be allowed to hide the very serious public-health problem of obesity.
This public-health issue is of course linked to that of eating habits, and of nutritional and health education.
It is also linked, therefore, to new kinds of consumption and to the presence on the market of increasingly sweetened products, consumed in excessive quantities by children, which are often the subject of false advertising.
This is why I am anxious to draw the Commission's attention to this problem once again, although I know that Mr Byrne has already confirmed that he is very much aware of it.
Before other speakers take the floor, I just want to say that I very much hope that we shall reach an agreement with the Council at second reading, and I hope that tomorrow's vote will enable us to do this.
Mr President, you are obviously in a generous mood tonight.
I hope your generosity will extend to the daunting task that I have of replacing Mrs Oomen-Ruijten - because of her sad illness - as the shadow rapporteur on this measure.
I start by thanking the rapporteur for her remarks and for her work in committee.
I have to say that many have questioned the need for some aspects of this measure.
Where we need this measure, it is important that our directive is based on science.
It is not for us to second-guess the scientific advisers to the Commission.
They say these products are safe and the Commission is right to accept that advice.
Sucralose presents no problems: it is made from sugar, it is non-calorific, it does not lead to tooth decay or - and here let me declare an interest - to risks for those of us who live with diabetes.
Indeed, if it could do something for my brainpower as well, I would sit here munching it all night.
It has already been approved in some 45 countries.
In the past cyclamates have rightly been treated with caution.
However, now science shows that a reduction of the permitted level from 400 mg/l to 350 mg/l is all that is needed.
To go further has no basis in science, except for a tiny sample of 43 children in Denmark, which was itself rejected by the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration.
The acceptable daily intake - the ADI - is not only the favoured measurement of the FAO and WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, but it also sets an intake level - not a maximum for a single day, but an average over a lifetime.
The proposed ADI is 7 mg/kg of body weight.
Thus all seemed plain sailing, until we had the rapporteur's proposal to reduce the figure to 250 mg, whereupon we had the Commission's brainstorm.
A normally sensible, wise and objective official, widely respected and, indeed, loved by the world of food and food safety allowed herself to be bounced into a statement that the Commission could accept 250.
She then had to admit that this was not based on one iota of scientific evidence.
That is a very dangerous precedent.
If the Commission ignores the advice of its own scientists, who can we trust?
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I are both of the view that the requests for a new report on the re-evaluation of the approval of aspartame are also completely misplaced.
In December 2002, the Scientific Committee on Food, in cooperation with the French and British food authorities, concluded that there is no reason to adjust the approval of aspartame in any way.
In addition, the FDA and JEFCFA - the scientific advisory body of WHO - have approved the substance.
Therefore, it is absolutely unnecessary to question the validity of the conclusion of the European Union's independent scientific committee - the SCF - that aspartame is a substance safe for human consumption.
It has to be taken into consideration that in the approval of a substance like aspartame the SCF sets the allowed daily intake in which the vulnerable life phases are included at a level such that even the heaviest users of the substance will not exceed 30-40% of that maximum intake.
A new report on the evaluation of aspartame would lead simply to negative publicity.
It would bring about rumours and feelings of uncertainty among consumers, as a substance that has been approved safe by an independent scientific committee is being questioned again for absolutely no good reason.
I would just add that my good friend Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who, jointly with Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, tabled Amendment 12, to which Mrs Ferreira referred, asked me to point out that she thinks there is a translation problem - at least in the English version - and that the category 'fine bakery products, energy-reduced or with no added sugar' - is supposed to be an addition to the previous text and not a replacement for it.
I put that before you and leave it in your good hands, Mr President, and exhort the services, if possible, to look at this before we come to vote on the matter tomorrow.
Mr President, it is always daunting to follow the measured tread of Mr Bowis as he spreads reassurance through the Chamber.
I, however, tend to take the view of the rapporteur and of those of my political Group in the Committee of which we are all members.
I wake up every morning, like Mr Bowis, and say to myself 'I am not a scientist'.
I have no right to second-guess scientists.
However, I do have a right to the long view and to second opinions, and where there are concerns, even if these have been allayed to some degree in the period when a new product is coming into use, as is certainly the case with salt of aspartame, nevertheless it is right to think after these products have gone into use - and they are now being used in many hundreds of different confectionery and other products - that over time a periodic review of a new substance is necessary.
I do not think that any of us know, because we are part of this vast experiment, how far the human metabolism has been changed by this whole range of new artificial products many of which bring great benefits, as salt of aspartame obviously does to Mr Bowis, but which could also cause concern.
He has probably received, as I have, a number of letters from the Additives Survivors' Network, who relate pretty grim stories of the adverse consequences of salt of aspartame for some of them.
We are not advocating second-guessing the scientific committee and our own Foods Standards Agency in the United Kingdom.
We are simply saying, over time you need to have the right to review this, to take another view once it is general use and is part of that great experiment among the population.
My second and last point relates to the reduction of cyclamate levels.
Mr Bowis says this was all the result of some brainstorm in the Commission.
Some feckless person in the Commission foolishly said yes, a 250 mg limit would be acceptable.
It is also actually as Mr Bowis probably knows, the view of the UK Government - in the advice that it circulates to us and is more frequently sometimes copied on that side of the House than on this - that a reduction to 250 mg measurement may be necessary.
Why is that?
It is because lifetime use has to be considered in the light of the intensity of the intake.
We do have to take into account the extensive use, for very young children in particular, of products which have been flavoured and sweetened in this way.
I believe that we should reduce to 250 mg and I am glad to see that I am in good company, though not alas that of Mr Bowis.
Mr President, I hope that you will not be any more strict with me than with other Members.
Nevertheless, I shall try to keep within my allotted speaking time.
What are the main concerns highlighted by this report?
I think that Mrs Ferreira, who has done some very serious work on this subject, has stated them quite correctly.
I should therefore like to give you my opinion on what seem to me to be the main points, starting with the addition to the list of sweeteners of a new sweetener called sucralose, and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that sucralose is no ordinary substance.
It is an organochlorine substance obtained by the conversion of sugar with the addition of three atoms of chlorine.
I would point out to you that organochlorines are substances which generally give rise to problems regarding the environment and even health.
I am astonished, therefore, at a proposal which seems to treat as something quite commonplace the inclusion of this new sweetener in the list of approved sweeteners.
In addition to that remark, I would also point out that the ADI, or acceptable daily intake, which is being proposed for this sweetener, is three times higher than the one proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Consequently it seems to me that there are enough unknown factors regarding this new sweetener to justify our not agreeing to allow it to be added to the list of approved substances.
