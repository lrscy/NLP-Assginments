Turning to the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Council will be adopting, by way of following up the Tampere programmes, a multiannual programme that will determine what the Union does in this area over the coming years.
Since Tampere, we have laid the foundations for a common area of freedom, security and justice.
The new Hague Programme will continue these efforts with the same vision and with a renewed willingness to cooperate with an enlarged and enlarging Union founded on the basic values of justice, freedom and security for all its citizens.
Since Tampere, we have adapted our priorities to take account of the many tragic events and appalling atrocities that we have had to witness in recent years.
It is now largely accepted that the Member States cannot meet these challenges alone.
If we are to prevail, we must continue to work together within the structure of the EU.
Another important element was the progressive development of a new policy, which deals with fundamental rights.
The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty, the forthcoming accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, the development of mechanisms under Article 7, the adoption of the anti-discrimination directives â all these things have had an effect on the EU, and they are reflected in every area of its policies.
In the same way that we, in the field of economic policy, make the claim to be seeking, by our own efforts, to become the worldâs strongest economic area, we should also be ambitious enough to make every effort to become the area of the world with the strongest guarantees of human rights.
These aspects remind us that we have to find the right way between the need for, and right to, freedom on the one hand and security considerations on the other.
Where security is concerned, the events of recent years have compelled us to make the combating of terrorism a priority.
Although we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from this, we should not forget the need to press on with the effective prevention and combating of all serious forms of organised crime, and this features in the new programme.
In terms of practical implementation, the Commission welcomes the Councilâs decision to introduce the codecision procedure for the sectors covered by Title IV of the Treaty of Nice, and will be producing an annual progress report on the results and the way in which this works in practice.
Next weekâs European Council will also consider the question of how to communicate Europe to its citizens.
Here in the House, I do not need to enlarge on this task, for it is one with which every one of you has to do on a daily basis, and I am sure that we all agree that communication can be improved and needs to be one of our principal priorities.
There is a perceptible gulf between the European institutions and the public, and we must close it.
I believe that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in all the Member States will provide a great opportunity for discussing Europe with the public and for involving them in its political processes.
While the ratification process remains a matter for the national level, the Commission will, while it is going on, communicate more with people in order to be of assistance wherever they need to be informed about the Constitution or have its advantages for our Union explained to them.
It does of course go without saying that a communications offensive of this kind can be mounted only in close cooperation and partnership with the European Parliament.
Let me conclude by saying something further about enlargement.
The European Council will not, over the coming weeks, be taking any decisions about the most recent reports by the Commission, but they will be discussed and presented.
Your House has already received the proposals that the Commission adopted at the beginning of this month, and I think we have reached a very important point where enlargement is concerned.
Even today, we can predict, with a fair degree of certainty, that the fifth enlargement will be completed, as planned, by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.
We can fairly accurately predict that we will commence negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of next year, and we know that it will be at the end of this year that the great decision, with its far-reaching implications, must be taken as to whether or not to start negotiations with Turkey.
Let me just say at this point that the Commission has endeavoured to produce a consensus-based proposal, one that has paid very close attention to the discussions that have gone on in the Member States and to what was discussed in this House â in every one of its political groups, no less.
It was also intended that the proposal should take as much account as possible of peopleâs thoughts and ideas, not to mention their fears and concerns, which we do indeed share.
The Commission is, for that reason, convinced that the proposals it has made constitute a sound basis for the decisions that have to be taken.
The Commission believes that next weekâs European Council will provide an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate both the continuity of European policy and its new-found dynamism.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important items at next weekâs European Council is, of course, the report on the mid-term review of the Lisbon process.
Almost everyone is familiar with the key words of that programme: growth, competitiveness, knowledge, economy, employment and sustainable development.
Everyone talks about them, everyone supports them, but results are lacking or altogether far too insubstantial.
Of course, the world has changed a great deal since Lisbon.
Certain Asian countries are experiencing tremendous growth, and the EU itself has also become much larger.
We have been joined by ten more countries, and that does not make things any easier.
We have also learnt â indeed, it was spelt out to us in black and white in the spring â that, whereas the Member States are adopting Lisbon directives, they are showing far less enthusiasm for actually transposing them.
We also note that the structural measures necessary in the Member States have not been taken, or have not been taken in all cases, or have not been taken in all cases to a sufficient degree.
Should we dilute the Lisbon ambitions on grounds that they are not achievable?
No, we need to do the opposite; a better approach is to go up a gear.
I therefore wish the Dutch Presidency success in providing the initial impetus that steers the debate in the right direction.
The obvious question, however, is how to achieve what we need to do.
In our opinion, what we must not do on any account is to dilute the Stability and Growth Pact, nor must we on any account reduce our own room for manoeuvre to effectively do nothing in the debate on the financial perspective.
What Europe must do, however, is to facilitate the evolution of Lisbon, and many things are needed and indeed possible in order to do this.
I have always wondered whether the Member States can commit themselves to each other such that they are able to use that commitment as an external factor that can be called upon when they lack the courage at domestic level to do what they have to do, and when they are once again tempted to put off the necessary action for maybe just another year.
It helped when we created Economic and Monetary Union, and it can help now.
Should we not also all make an effort to speak about the Lisbon process in different terms; to convey it to people in a different way?
Even changing our vocabulary could help move the matter a great deal further forward.
We have always talked of growth and competitiveness; we could also talk about prosperity for more people and greater opportunities for good jobs.
We talk of the problem of population ageing; we could also talk about the prospect of a longer and better life.
We must refine the message, but we must also provide a good messenger, and indeed this is something we have been lacking in recent years.
I hope that we shall have a new Commission President who carries out that aspect of his duties, too, because we need him to. This could give processes such as Lisbon a boost.
That is our task, and we must all do our share.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you are planning to vote against the proposed Commission later on, bear in mind that this will be another factor causing considerable delay to the evolution of the Lisbon process, and people can really do without that.
President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you every success.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists has concerns about the Dutch Presidency.
We are afraid that you are pushing Europe further and further into the conservative corner, and thus actually exchanging the Lisbon agenda for a right-wing agenda.
This means harder work and longer hours for the same pay, instead of entering into global competition by maintaining protection, by means of more intelligent manufacturing, by investing more in people and in knowledge networks, and also creating scope for this in public funds; thus revealing social Europe.
It is no wonder that Queen Beatrix said yesterday in this House that Europe has a regrettable lack of enthusiasm.
We are also concerned that you are found wanting at critical junctures in the political drama set to reach its climax here this morning.
Whilst Heads of State or Government such as MrÂ Verhofstadt of Belgium and MrÂ Persson of Sweden are adamant that they would not want the likes of MrÂ Buttiglione either in their own or the European administration, you refuse to give the President of the Barroso Commission a signal to indicate that he must back down and meet the manifest wish of a majority in the European Parliament.
What is more, the Dutch minister MrÂ Bot even says that he is squarely behind MrÂ Buttiglione.
You are very free with your opinions on tax reductions and economising; yet lacking as a Presidency when it comes to the utterances of the Commissioner-Designate who constitutes a threat to European values: the values that you yourselves advocate so fervently.
At a time when citizens seem to be seized with political passion, the Dutch Presidency is found wanting; yesterday morning it was even physically missing.
However good the Dutch Presidencyâs technical ability, it is politically divided and is thus becoming a sickly figure.
Europe deserves something better, more socially focused, stronger and above all more democratic.
We challenge you, the Dutch Presidency, to develop your profile and political face.
European citizens are entitled to this, beginning with a clear statement from the Council asking that MrÂ Barroso meet the demands of the European Parliament; or is your talk of a strong European Parliament really just for show?
The choice is yours.
Â Â  . Mr President, in view of current events, Liberals and Democrats in this House will have enjoyed the PresidentâinâOffice's deadpan presentation of a Council agenda of almost baroque design.
The delivery of his speech at 33 r.p.m. was quite exquisite.
This Council will work through the findings of the Kok Report on reviving the Lisbon Agenda.
Advance sightings of that report suggest a surprisingly coherent piece of work.
My Group welcomes the prospect of a leaner, more focused redirection of the Lisbon Agenda.
I notice, incidentally, that the Kok Report tempers our rhetoric a little: instead of 'the most competitive knowledgeâbased economy in the world', it talks of 'among the best in the world'.
I do not take this as a lessening of ambition.
The focus for the Lisbon Agenda should not be international benchmarking.
The goal is delivering sustainable prosperity and a better quality of life for Europe's citizens in a way that reflects the innate potential and unique dynamic of European life, not crossing some notional finish line ahead of China or the United States.
The Kok Report rightly stresses the need for European Member States to coordinate better.
We cannot run a single market without a single mindset.
How many European states are setting their national economic agendas with Lisbon in mind?
Not many.
Not enough.
What matters this weekend is that the Kok Report does not become a substitute for concerted action by the Council.
Welcome it; approve it; restate your commitment to it, but for the good of the European Union, make it real.
The Council will also address the multiannual agenda for justice and home affairs, the 'Tampere-Plus', of which Mr Verheugen spoke.
The ambition is to restate the broad scope of justice and home affairs policy in the European Union.
Liberals and Democrats welcome that, but Europe has changed since Tampere and this new agenda must reflect that.
Europe has never had a greater need of a balanced, liberal approach to migration and asylum.
The evident desire in some national capitals to outsource our international legal duties to refugees and asylum seekers to clapboard states outside our borders must be resisted.
'Tampere-Plus' also means 'after-Madrid'.
The fight against terrorism and the urgent need for better judicial and police cooperation must be priorities.
Liberals and Democrats will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that measures to make us safer in Europe do not erode our fundamental freedoms.
The Union will soon have new legislation on procedural safeguards and the rights of defendants, and we remind the Council that those rights are non-negotiable.
We also want a commitment to a new third-pillar data protection instrument to guarantee Europe-wide data protection for Europe's citizens.
These rights must form the centrepiece of the new agenda.
Yesterday I referred to the Council as the invisible elephant.
Now the elephant is here, and I hope that it will listen to what this House says today, reflect on our rights and the way we choose to exercise them and respect the prerogatives of this Chamber, whatever happens during the vote today.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the President-in-Office two questions.
One is about yesterdayâs sitting: I should like to know what the President-in-Office had to do that was so urgent that he could not join us.
I think his presence would have been important and most welcome in the kind of debate we had yesterday.
My second question is about the Lisbon strategy: before I go into it in detail, I should like to know how the Presidency is thinking of organising the relationships between the three high-level reports that have recently been produced: the Strauss-Kahn report, the Sapir report and the latest Kok report.
Most of what is said in these three reports is rather similar, but then it is not clear what the relationship between them is or, above all, how they will be followed up.
I should be grateful if the President-in-Office could tell us something about these two points.
Regarding the content of the Kok report and how we might carry the Lisbon strategy forward, I should like to offer three considerations.
First, when the European social model is mentioned, at least in these reports within the context of the discussion on the Lisbon strategy, there is a tendency to focus exclusively on the living standards and income levels that have to be guaranteed.
We believe, however, that that is an extremely limited view of the European social model, which also involves the issue of how people live and hence the models of social cohesion that exist in Europe, how people consume and hence also the respect they have for our environment, and how people produce, thus trying to apply criteria of transparency and participation in a positive manner.
Secondly, we think it is a real mistake, especially for a group of top experts, to consider that just labour market reforms and the need to cut down rules and constraints are the only real ways for us to become truly competitive.
We believe that there has been a complete lack of any serious thought about the macroeconomic reforms that are needed and, for instance, about how to overcome the weaknesses on the demand side.
Thirdly, in this as in other reports, the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy really seems to be merely a kind of token gesture: no one believes in it very much but there is a feeling that it has at least to be mentioned for the sake of conformism and political correctness.
It is pushed into the background and left out of the real notion of growth.
I should like to know what the Presidency intends to do on this subject as well.
With regard to the sphere of justice and home affairs, we have two concerns on topics you will be discussing.
On the one hand, while it is true that the G5 substantially ruled out the idea of camps outside the European Union, it is also true that the report you are going to consider does mention dealing with asylum applications outside the European Union, in cooperation with third countries.
We do not, of course, oppose such cooperation â we just have to see how it works in practice.
The report also mentions increasing the asylum capacity of third countries, something that I find particularly heartless when talking about developing countries.
I should be grateful if you could tell us why this general opposition to the camps is then somehow picked up again in the report and how the Presidency intends to approach this issue.
The second difficulty is clearly that of codecision, the infamous âbridgeâ, to which there is considerable opposition.
What is the Dutch Presidencyâs strategy?
Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, a question about the issue of enlargement or, rather, about this period straddling enlargement and the accession of the new Member States.
I should like to know whether the Presidency intends to do anything about the Turkish Cypriot question.
As you know, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community has lost his majority.
I should be grateful to hear what you intend to do, because the European Union clearly cannot abandon the Turkish Cypriots as it is doing at the moment.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, after this debate, Parliament has the opportunity to demonstrate that it is not a puppet of the Council and the Commission.
If the new European Commission is voted down under the Dutch Presidency, that will go down in history as the moment when European democracy took a step forward.
The new composition of the Commission that is to be decided later on will not change politically, but it is in everyoneâs interests to remove the most controversial candidates.
This applies equally to candidates with a history of putting their own business interests first and to candidates wanting to maintain the second-class status of women and homosexuals.
Some important news is that the media have reported that MrÂ Prodi and Mr Kok are finally acknowledging that the most important objective of the Lisbon agenda of 2000 cannot be achieved.
The measures chosen, aimed at giving large multinational enterprises greater scope and freedom, will not produce the most competitive economy.
Establishing that Lisbon is failing presents Europe with new opportunities.
It is time for a new objective: Europe as the most socially focused economy in the world.
That was the original aim in 2000.
We then made the mistake of confusing the long-standing pursuit of a social Europe with the quest for as many jobs in the commercial sector as possible.
That mistake has now led to the proposal for a Services Directive that allows national legislation and collective labour agreements to compete with each other, to more extensive privatisation, leading to lower quality at higher costs, and again to a Ports Directive that would further destroy the work of the dockers.
We come from the richest part of the world.
Our problems are the disintegration of society and environmental pollution; problems that will not be solved by ever increasing economic growth at any price.
It is not growth but a better distribution of what we already have that must receive much more attention.
Instead of maintaining a constrictive Stability and Growth Pact that seriously undermines the role of the democratically elected government as a problem-solver, we can strive for better public services, social security for all and the fair distribution of the available work.
We have the means to actively combat poverty, indifference, crime, damage to nature and environmental degradation.
It is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Unionâs communications strategy has just been drawn up.
Everyone agrees that this strategy has been and remains unsatisfactory and even inappropriate.
MrÂ Verheugen was one of several speakers to say so today.
Both within EU Member States and beyond the EU, the only viewpoint put forward is that of a single centralist approach to the building of Europeâs common future.
Many of the Members of this House are actually sceptical about this model of integration, which after all is only one of many possible models.
For example, a significant number of Members are opposed to Turkey being accepted into the EU, and the arguments they put forward are rational ones.
As we search for a way in which the EU can communicate more effectively with its citizens, I would emphasise the importance of not disregarding attitudes and ideas which are as yet held by a minority, but which are becoming increasingly widespread and are equally valid.
This is the only way in which democracy and pluralism will gain respect in this House, in the EU Member States and in the candidate countries.
I thank you.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
This House has heard a great deal about the Lisbon strategy, and we would of course like it to succeed.
For this to happen, however, we cannot treat it like some kind of magic formula that will solve all our problems by itself.
MrÂ Verheugen has said Europe must be competitive, and we agree that it must be competitive in relation to other regions of the world.
At the same time, however, it has been said that we need to build a European social model, which I take to mean an over-supportive welfare state, or a state that robs citizens of initiative by providing them with everything the state believes they need.
Clearly, a choice has to be made.
Either we opt for a social model and an over-supportive welfare state, or for competitiveness in relation to America.
If no such choice is made, we will not be in a position to build Europeâs economic success.
By way of example, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯âs announcement that consultations will be held with employers, employees and trade unions are a step too far.
It is quite sufficient for employers and employees to take part.
If it turns out that trade unions need to take part as well as employees, I do not believe agreement will ever be reached.
As regards the common legal area, we need to be aware that this must not extend beyond the legal framework laid down in the European Treaties that have been signed to date.
If it were to do so, it would amount to a violation of the Treaties and thus to an attack on the EUâs cohesion.
It should also be emphasised that foreign policy needs to be based on aspects common to us all, or in other words on positive values.
Policy is extremely important in this field, for example in the case of Darfur.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, Commissioner, at the EU summit in November the German Chancellor will put forward proposals for the full liberalisation of the EU energy market by 2007, as well as for the creation of a European system for monitoring financial markets and for the harmonisation of the principles of financial transactions in the 25Â Member States.
Another of MrÂ SchrÃ¶derâs proposals is the consolidation of the European armaments market.
In this context, I should like to quote the French proverb âgrasp all, lose allâ.
It might be better to have fewer plans, but for those plans to be more realistic.
What is genuinely disturbing, however, is MrÂ SchrÃ¶derâs proposal to harmonise the corporate tax base in the EU.
This project, details of which were revealed in an article in yesterdayâs edition of the German business daily , is supposed to be completed in 2006, and will result in tax bands being implemented in the EU, following the example of the VAT system.
Does this really have anything to do with competitiveness, one of the European Unionâs watchwords?
It certainly does not.
Instead, it fits in with the latest proposals put forward by the French Finance Minister, MrÂ Sarkozy, the implementation of which would be a particular blow to the economies of the new Member States.
We will not agree to this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my thanks to MrÂ NicolaÃ¯ for his presentation.
In my opinion, he has identified three very important issues on behalf of the Council; the first being the Lisbon agenda.
I agree with all of those who say it is time that all the fine words are translated into real action.
It is time that our European economy really establishes a lead.
In my opinion, it is a good thing that there has actually been a certain change of model.
I am not referring to those grand plans some people have for a âSuper-Commissionerâ or something similar, and the change is not only from above, but more oriented towards the countries themselves: where can good examples be found; how can we support them?
I am talking about a bottom-up approach, in which I should like to call for special attention to the regional dimension, to improving compatibility between a European policy and an effective national policy, including by promoting the most technologically advanced regions.
We must lend support to these success factors, but one aspect of this is the need for better determination of whether national parliaments are really keeping their side of the bargain.
Perhaps His Excellency could elaborate on this.
The second issue is terrorism.
Many fine words have been said about this; but how is it possible, MrÂ President, that we were saying here so soon after the tragic attack in your native Spain that the security services really must now enhance their cooperation â indeed, that is what we had said on 11 September 2001 â that that energy now seems to be ebbing away again, and that it is again considered less important?
How can we really ensure cooperation on combating terrorism now, before any more harm is done?
The third issue is Tampere.
This issue is crucial if we hope to uphold the credibility of a social Union.
We will need to act boldly on this.
It is no longer acceptable to have divergent policies that give people traffickers the opportunity to smuggle hundreds of thousands of people per annum like cattle across the internal borders of our Union.
For this reason, I agree wholeheartedly with the Council about using qualified majority voting and codecision.
We must stay firmly on this path, because it is time that Europe really solves the problem of these people.
My message to those perhaps hoping to defeat the Commission this afternoon is therefore: bear in mind that there will be confusion amongst many people out there, because they cannot understand why the EU is shooting itself in the foot whilst there is so much to be done.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall concentrate on the problems of enlargement and on the important date for opening accession negotiations with Turkey.
I should like firstly to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for the extraordinary report on Turkey with which he has provided us.
I believe it alludes to everything: arguments in favour of this accession and factors that only reinforce the fears we might have.
The discussion we began to have in the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday evening has enabled us to distinguish two âclansâ.
The first is already beginning to draw up a formal list of everything Turkey should do before the accession negotiations are even entered into.
As we are very aware, it is human rights that are at issue, as well as Cyprus and the situation of the Kurds. These are all matters that must be dealt with but that can be so over a very long period in the course of the accession negotiations.
Others, like my own group, are, however, of the view that, at the geopolitical and geostrategic levels, Turkey constitutes an opportunity for Europe.
We must examine the conditions of this accession very seriously.
We must not already say âyesâ or ânoâ, but begin to work in an entirely even-handed way, that is to say in the same way that we have worked with the other countries.
I should like, however, to express surprise, MrÂ Verheugen, that the report does not contain more scenarios or perspectives regarding the repercussions that Turkeyâs accession might have for our social model.
Shall we be able, for example, to continue with the current policy of social cohesion and with the Structural Funds, both of which are indispensable to European cohesion?
Would not this social model be damaged by enlargements that did not take account of it?
The report contains only very vague ideas about the adjustments Europe would have to make following a future accession, and these seem to me to be quite inadequate.
The issue of Turkeyâs accession is, above all, the issue of Europe.
Shall we be able to enlarge while maintaining our model of solidarity?
We shall be particularly vigilant in this regard, no less than we shall be regarding the issue of human rights in Turkey.
Â Â  MrÂ President, public opinion and the people of Europe expect three things from the European Council.
The first is that the Council make clear progress in the fight against terrorism.
The Madrid attacks reminded us of how urgent it is to make significant progress, especially in the fields of cooperation between police forces, the organisation of Europol and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The second thing we expect is that you do not go back on the protection of fundamental rights, whether this be in connection with exchanges of data, which must be subject to strict legal controls, or whether, above all, it be in connection with asylum and immigration, which cannot be subject to solutions that ignore human rights.
Thirdly and finally â and while being very pleased that the Dutch Presidency is actually going down this road â we expect you to cross an important threshold by making the whole of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community subject to codecision, which is a guarantee of democracy, and to qualified majority voting, which is a guarantee of efficiency.
Â Â  â Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has talked a great deal today about the need to have a safer Europe.
We believe that before we have a safer Europe we ought to have a more democratic, freer and more welcoming Europe.
On the subject of guaranteeing the right to asylum, a number of abuses and illegal acts have in fact been committed recently: from the Cap Anamur affair to the Lampedusa deportations, to the latest song and dance about the 13 Kurds who landed at the port of Augusta.
All too often there are breaches of the Geneva Convention on non-, asylum seekers are hastily identified, and abuses are committed that even extend to the use of handcuffs, as we saw recently.
The Council that will be meeting next week on the subject of freedom, security and justice will clearly be constrained by the decisions already taken by the G5 in Florence last week.
In this context, I should like to ask what opinion the Presidency of the Council holds on the use of biometric data in passports and visas, and what the Councilâs position is on the establishment of reception camps outside EU territory.
Â Â  Mr President, five years into Lisbon, in Ireland â and, I wonder, where else? â poverty, discrimination and homelessness are alive and well.
A selective interpretation of Lisbon gave our countries' financial planners an excuse to push profit, even where it was at the expense of people.
In Ireland, social spending cuts provide money to fuel economic growth.
But, even when the profits flooded in, the Lisbon strategy, as our leaders chose to understand it, remained an excuse â a kind of mantra â to spend the new and plentiful money on anything but the people who needed it most.
For example, enormous amounts of money have been put into university-level students but no money into early intervention for children experiencing learning difficulties, to give them hope of reaching college or getting a job and not having a life of dependency.
In the Lisbon review, I urge you to correct any faulty â or indeed accurate âinterpretations of the strategy that have the unfortunate effect of increasing the gap between rich and poor, able and disabled, strong and weak.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that more initiatives will have to be implemented if the European Union is to become the most knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
The EU 2005 programme must be fully implemented so as to increase broadband access to schools and libraries and ensure that all our young people are guaranteed access to high-speed Internet services and development skills.
Full broadband facilities must be available to all rural, as well as urban, areas and especially to the most peripheral areas of the European Union.
The European Union must also implement the Financial Services Action Plan by the end of next year.
This will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an EU-wide basis.
A new framework directive on services â a key measure needed to complete the internal market â must also be implemented.
I also believe that the EU must implement the recommendations of the European Employment Task Force.
This Task Force seeks to promote greater flexibility in education, training and innovation, encourages greater flexibility on the part of workers and companies, and removes disincentives to employment.
We must also invest more in research and development policies.
We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives.
The European Council is going to ask the European Commission to develop a broader communications strategy.
This will be the job of Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, who will have a key role in explaining how Europe takes its decisions and why Europe makes these decisions.
Â Â  â Mr President, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, represented in this Chamber by myself and Mr De Michelis.
The mid-term review should be a time for clear, calm analysis and stocktaking.
While acknowledging the major results that have been achieved, it is also important to highlight those areas and fields of activity where Community action has fallen short and been too slow in comparison with the parameters set by the Lisbon strategy.
As reformists, we also want to re-emphasise the importance of the fact that growth and economic development cannot and must not occur to the detriment of the social model of European solidarity that has been put forward, which can be brought up to date but must not have its guidelines and principles eroded away.
In the end, we believe that the objective of creating a citizensâ Europe should be a fundamental target.
We have to identify those methods of communicating and interacting with the people that will bring Europe ever closer to the Europeans, because unfortunately the Community institutions have, in the past, been seen all too often as something abstract and distant â a trend that must be reversed.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verheugen, the Lisbon strategy is crucial, yet today it has been acknowledged that inadequate progress has been made with it.
It is important to remember that the provisions and goals of the Lisbon strategy disregarded the EUâs enlargement and did not take full advantage of it as a catalyst for development.
It is also likely that too many priorities were set.
At present, we note a lack of progress with the implementation of the strategy.
Key economic reforms have been neglected too, and this has resulted in a slow-down in growth.
At the same time, certain governments are attempting to share their problems with others, for example by proposing tax harmonisation or initiatives to support European giants instead of the small and medium-sized enterprises that are far more important.
The end result of all this can only be that we all lose this race.
How can the situation be rectified?
First and foremost, the priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be reduced to an absolute minimum, and priorities relating to economic growth should be placed at the top of the agenda.
Which priorities would this involve?
Firstly, completion of the single market. This encompasses aspects such as the market for services and the discrepancy between governmentsâ declarations and their actions, as in the case of the quota limitations imposed on Polish service providers on the German market, and the fact that the situation has in fact deteriorated since 1Â MayÂ 2004.
Secondly, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, above all by simplifying legislation.
Thirdly, modernisation of the labour market as employees must be mobile in order to win the fight to be competitive.
We should therefore work on the assumption that as of 1Â MayÂ 2006, two years after enlargement, there will be no restrictions on the movement of persons within the European Union.
Fourthly, the Seventh EU Framework Programme should abolish the existing preference given to research institutions from the old Member States over those from the new Member States.
Fifthly, one of the instruments used to increase the EUâs competitiveness should be an effectively implemented cohesion policy, which takes into account the additional catalyst for development provided by the new Member States.
In addition, the role of the European Commission should be stepped up to include the task of holding governments to account for the effectiveness of their actions.
And last but not least, the European Parliament should not only be kept informed of decisions relating to the Lisbon strategy, but should also have an influence on such decisions, as this would facilitate the building of consensus at national level.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have been forced to note with some amazement that in both introductory speeches â in their discussions of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy â the words âenvironmentâ and âsustainable developmentâ were never used.
I am not interested in formal acknowledgements or ritual tributes, but I do wonder, Mr Verheugen, if this is the type of continuity to which you alluded.
Apart from that, however, there are three good reasons to consider this third pillar of the Lisbon strategy to be still relevant.
The first is that a few days ago an international event of the greatest importance occurred, something highly positive for once: the ratification by the Duma of the Kyoto Protocol, a field in which the European Union has been a world leader.
The second is that, as chance would have it, the environment is precisely the field in which the Member States are furthest behind schedule in their implementation of Community policies.
There is yet another even more important reason, which has to do with the subject that government offices throughout Europe are quite rightly â and rather obsessively â concerned about at the moment: competitiveness.
How can the European Union regain its competitiveness in world markets if it does not commit itself to the new technologies, or if it does not take on leadership â including technological leadership â in the field of environmental technologies?
This is the issue that I am raising, and I hope it will be a key point in the strategy review process.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to express my thanks for the report.
I should like to speak on two matters: the first concerns Lisbon.
The European social model can certainly be combined with competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity, which are not mere buzzwords but need to be transformed into political actions.
To this end the results will have to be assessed in practical terms and our great ambitions must not be abandoned.
The main road, I must insist, is the one that leads on firmly towards training, schools and research, to give everyone the means to grow and to take part in active citizenship, so that social protection does not turn into a benefits culture.
The second matter concerns citizensâ Europe, which is having difficulty in taking off and certainly requires a great effort on our part in the area of communications.
If, however, we do not want it to remain a mere statement of intention, we must support it with adequate funding within our budget, and the Constitutional Treaty can certainly provide some valuable momentum.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are very concerned about the implementation and revision of the Lisbon Agenda, which was adopted in March 2000.
The concern is that today, instead of what was promised, we have 20Â million people unemployed and around 70Â million people at risk of poverty.
These figures are appalling.
If it is true that the Lisbon Agenda has been one big failure, as President Prodi recently stated at the end of his term in office, it has failed solely in terms of the expectations it aroused and the promises it made in social areas, namely full employment and social inclusion, and in terms of knowledge and research.
It has not failed in the areas that were of interest to the large economic and financial groups.
Liberalisation and privatisation in essential sectors such as energy, postal services, telecommunications, essential public services and financial sectors continues apace, to the extent that more and more legislative proposals have appeared in areas that jeopardise fundamental human rights and workersâ rights, such as the proposal for a directive aimed at creating an internal services market â in other words, more privatisations â and the retrograde and unacceptable proposal for a directive on working hours.
The Lisbon Agenda must, therefore, be reviewed, so that its content can be amended and so that jobs, and the social inclusion that is needed, can be given priority.
Â Â  â Mr President, to talk of security problems in Europe and to ignore the dangers of Islamic terrorism, as the reports at the beginning of this debate did to a great extent, is extremely serious.
It shows just how inured we have become, perhaps partly because of the propaganda about the fairy tale of moderate Islam and partly because of the influence that the extremely powerful Islamic lobby, rich in petrodollars, exerts over European politics, the individual Member States and the media.
With regard to the important and sensitive problem of asylum, however, I believe we should encourage the perhaps belated efforts to relocate the examination of asylum-seekersâ files and situations to the territories of third countries, where it should come within the political and social remit of those countries â and I am thinking of the African countries here.
Perhaps African leaders have clearer ideas on this subject, since they have told us of the trend to fraudulently use this technique â this trick â of falsely applying for asylum, and they have called on us to open our eyes.
In order to involve the African countries, however, we need to change our aid policy and make it more transparent and more worthwhile for the peoples of Africa.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Council should understand that the British people have never voted to be governed by former communists, especially those who helped to enforce the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe.
Neither do we want unelected commissioners who hide their murky involvement in the corrupt use of public money, tax evasion and bribery.
We demand a duty of care from our government, which is why, last week, I gave detailed information about institutionalised corruption in this place to the Serious Fraud Office in London and I called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union under the terms of the Vienna Convention.
No British Parliament has ever voted to pass British taxpayers' public money to third parties who cannot be trusted.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this debate, which takes place only two weeks before the European Council discusses Wim Kok's report on the Lisbon Agenda.
This is the European Union's most pressing issue.
The health of the European economy is a matter of deep concern to millions of our citizens who remain without a job.
It is of vital concern to future competitiveness that Europe will need to deal with the twin challenges of major demographic change and the competition that we are increasingly facing from China, India and other emerging economies.
In July when Prime Minister Balkenende addressed Parliament, he said that Europe's economy has 'stiff joints and makes little use of its head'.
This makes our competitors too quick and too smart for us.
Anyone who looks objectively at the developments sees that Europe is losing ground, even in periods of economic recovery.
These were wise words and I applaud the priority which the presidency is giving to the economic sclerosis that affects significant areas of this continent.
If we do not push radical economic reform, then Europe will fail.
This does not apply only to our current generation: it will also leave a legacy of failure for those who come after us.
Mr Prodi claimed earlier this week that the reason for the failure of the Lisbon process is the lack of majority voting in the European Union.
What nonsense!
The failure lies in the lack of political will to pursue the reforms that are plainly needed.
Some people are trying to recast Lisbon to place more emphasis on the social and environmental goals at the expense of the hard economic decisions that are required.
It is no surprise to me that the nations of Europe that are producing economic growth are those that have pushed the necessary reforms.
No-one denies that these reforms were painful, but they were necessary.
It seems to me that Parliament, the Commission and the Kok Working Group all agree that real progress needs to be made.
The question is whether Europe has the courage to move to action, rather than just continuing to express words.
Â Â  Having taken two minutes to consider the matter, I would like to state that what Mr Mote is asking for is of course contrary to the laws of the European Union.
I say this in order that the Minutes may record that Mr Mote made an illegal demand in this House.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that both the President-in-Office and Commissioner Verheugen stressed that the Kok report is not an end-point but a starting point for the mid-term review of Lisbon to be concluded at next year's spring summit.
I am glad about that because the early drafts I have seen of the Kok report would be an inappropriate conclusion for a mid-term review as the balance is wrong.
I disagree with Mr Evans on this point.
Quite correctly, the report makes much of the need for improved growth and competitiveness, but you have to read well into it before you come across the notion that social policy can be a productive factor.
It is a productive factor.
We need improved competitiveness to maintain our European social model, but that model is a productive factor in itself for achieving competitiveness.
Rather than talking in grand terms, let me give a specific example.
I read recently that in the new Member States, as many as 40% of workers are affected by ill-health or injury related to work.
The figure in the former 15 Member States is much lower, at 25%.
I think that is in large part due to the comprehensive framework of health and safety laws we have had in place in Europe for over a decade.
We need to bear that in mind.
That is social policy as a productive factor, contributing to competitiveness, contributing to quality at work, quality jobs, and maintaining people's active involvement in the labour market.
Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall.
Â Â  Mr President, nobody questions the importance of Tampere I: it set a direction, it opened up an internal space and, consequently, numerous actions were initiated in all areas.
Those of us who promoted and actively participated in Tampere I know that Tampere II has to be radically different.
It cannot simply be a multi-annual programme with the same characteristics as the previous one.
It must be able to choose, select, specify, emphasise and, above all, prioritise. These are not the only verbs one could use to describe what Tampere II must achieve.
We must move on from the general fight against terrorism to a European political project able to deal with the fight against Islamist terrorism; from general plans to combat terrorism, we must move on to explaining what concrete measures our fight against a specific organisation requires.
I would like to point out that our colleague Alain Lamassoure has just introduced a European pilot project for combating Islamist terrorism into this Parliamentâs budget: I believe that that is the path the European Council must take.
The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, replacing the European Unionâs President-in-Office, has stated that combating terrorism is our continentâs priority, since the attacks in Madrid, the Philippines and Asia show that this problem affects all of us.
But it is not just a question of foreign policy: it must have consequences for internal policy.
There can be no European foreign policy unless we first have a shared internal policy within the European Union; there can be no foreign policy in Europe unless we first create an area of freedom capable of dealing with the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the new priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice must, above all, be the promotion and protection of fundamental rights, and not only those of Europeans but also those of third country nationals.
This objective can, moreover, only be achieved if the efforts made to develop this area are not confined to creating a Fortress Europe. The debate on asylum must be refocused upon Europeâs humanitarian duty.
We must, indeed, preserve the right of asylum.
All those in danger must be able to find refuge in Europe.
Our objective is still to obtain an acceptable level of European harmonisation.
It turns out that the first phase has not led to the harmonisation we wanted.
Harmonisation has mainly been from the bottom up.
It is therefore vital that we as quickly as possible enable new legislative instruments to be adopted.
We must have an overall approach to the management of migration flows and of borders.
I welcome the Presidencyâs proposal to make the transition, on 1 April 2005, to qualified majority voting and to codecision for the whole of the chapter on asylum, immigration and borders, and I call for those Member States which are not convinced to allow, as quickly as possible, this transition to codecision in all areas in accordance with ArticleÂ 67 of the Treaty.
European cooperation against terrorism should also continue to be strengthened and, in particular, it should be made easier for the relevant national services and the services responsible for the fight against terrorism to exchange information.
This must go hand in hand with a strengthening of the roles of Europol and Eurojust.
We therefore call upon the Member States to remain faithful to the spirit of Tampere in order to respond to these challenges.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr NicolaÃ¯, Commissioner, in the 1980s, Jacques Delors gave the European project a new impetus and a new vision, when he proposed the internal market and the single currency.
In 2000, at the Lisbon Summit, the EU once again set itself a challenge for a decade: to become the most dynamic and most competitive economy in the world.
2005 is almost upon us, already the midway point in the decade, and the balance sheet does not make very cheerful reading.
Scant progress has been made and in a matter of days Mr Kok will present his interim evaluation report, which will be the main item on the agenda at the November European Summit.
We are not yet able to comment on the conclusions of the interim report in this House, but I do wish to raise two points that I feel are extremely relevant.
The first relates to the fact that when the intention of a strategy is to influence everything, it normally influences nothing.
We must therefore set clear priorities within a clear strategy.
There is no point in favouring the economic strand of the strategy to the detriment of the social or environmental strand, or vice-versa.
What we must do is set out political priorities for all of the strands.
These are difficult choices, but they cannot be put off any longer.
The second point is that I wish to emphasise that the Lisbon Strategy cannot only be seen as a responsibility of the EU.
Success will depend, to a large extent, on the Member Statesâ ability to put the structural reforms into practice, which means that they will have to play a leading role at world level.
I still believe that the aims of the Lisbon Strategy are neither utopian nor impossible to achieve.
Back in the 1980s, for example, who would have believed that more than 300Â million Europeans would be using the single currency today?
As Kohl once said, the visionaries end up being the realists.
One last word, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to welcome the position taken by the President â or so I hope â of the next European Commission, in making the Lisbon Strategy a priority for his term in office.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by emphasising strongly how pleased I am to be here in your midst, particularly against the background of questions asked in the course of the very important debate on the Commission that I attended yesterday.
One of these specifically related to the reason for my absence.
It is simple: it was my duty to escort the Queen of the Netherlands here and to be present for her speech.
The main thing, however, is that you can be assured that we are following everything that is said here about the extremely important issue of Parliamentâs decision on the new Commission particularly closely.
The Presidency is keeping in close contact with all the parties concerned and is not missing a word: you can be assured of that.
All the same, the Presidency is not involved in this important discussion between Parliament and the new Commission President.
However involved we feel in this, fully fledged democracy determines that Parliament enters into discussion with the new Commission President.
I should like to emphasise here that no one, including the Presidency, would deny you as a Parliament any right to take decisions at your own discretion.
That, too, is compatible with the fully fledged democracy that is Europe.
That right is yours and I take it for granted that you as a Parliament will presently take a prudent, considered decision.
I should then like to express my thanks for the words of encouragement that many of you have given to the Presidency and regarding the coming European Council, and for your endorsement in many cases of the issues and the way in which they are discussed.
Of course, your opinions may subsequently differ on the subject matter, and that is just the way it should be.
In fact, the only general criticism I have heard regarding the role of the Presidency has come from Dutch Member MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg from the Socialists Group in the European Parliament, but other than that I feel encouraged, on the whole, in the path we are taking as a Presidency.
As regards the coming European Council, many of you have called for attention to the Lisbon Strategy.
I should therefore like to formally draw attention to the fact that, as you know, the Spring European Council is the crucial European Council â the one at which decisions on the whole Lisbon Strategy are to be taken â and that the activities of this Novemberâs European Council should be seen as a preparation for this Spring European Council, to be led by the Luxemburg Presidency.
Nevertheless, a great deal is at stake, and I very much agree with everyone â MrÂ Verheugen was the first to emphasise this â that it is extremely important to give a renewed impetus to this Lisbon Strategy, and therefore to the development of the most competitive possible knowledge-based economy in the world.
I also very much agree with the many people, such as MrÂ Eurlings and Mr Jonathan Evans, who have called for action rather than words; for theory to be translated into tangible actions.
I also very much agree with the many people who advocated looking to national governments and trying not to pass the buck to Brussels.
Let us be aware, however, that the Lisbon agenda is primarily the responsibility of national governments and that they must put their money where their mouth is.
MrsÂ Thyssen was one of the first to underline this, but MrÂ Watson, Mr Eurlings and others also emphasised that it is important to have the courage to implement structural reforms at national level.
Indeed, this is the very topic for discussion at the informal dinner with the Heads of State or Government.
The implementation of such badly needed reforms will involve an exchange of national experiences.
Some have pointed out that the balance in the Lisbon Strategy, as presented here by the Presidency, and as planned for discussion in the European Council, is not correct, paying too little attention to the components other than economic growth itself, namely the social and environmental components.
I can assure those who drew attention to this, such as MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg and MrsÂ Frassoni, and others that we shall maintain that balance.
Of course, the Council will have its say and will have to draw its own conclusions but, in Council, the Presidency will explicitly hold on to the three pillars that the Lisbon Strategy had and must continue to have.
I do not at all agree, therefore â this was another of MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Bergâs more cutting remarks â that this is a conservative approach and scheme.
On the contrary, I think that we should actually be progressive in the way we promote economic growth in conjunction with the two other pillars.
Indeed, it is good that the former Labour Prime Minister of the Netherlands, MrÂ Kok, is chairing the task force for the mid-term review and is to present his report.
I really do hope that the Council can use that as a good starting point for further discussion.
A number of you rightly and understandably mentioned the other important item that is on the agenda more with a view to decision making, in a sense, at the coming European Council: justice and home affairs.
Many have rightly said in this regard that we must not lose energy following the horrific attack in Madrid.
We must use this energy to really take steps towards the interchange of data and towards greater police and judicial cooperation.
MrÂ Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and many others rightly made this remark.
That is exactly what we are doing.
This process is under way, as you know, and I am decidedly positive about the steps that are now being taken. We shall be discussing these.
We shall also be discussing them in December, because then we shall have the actual report by the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator at our disposal, and shall bring this up for discussion in the European Council.
It has also been rightly pointed out that, in the face of the great need to produce closer cooperation and come up with more extreme possibilities and measures in the fight against terrorism, we must not lose sight of the essential fundamental human rights and freedoms.
MrÂ Watson and others made this observation.
This important issue will certainly come up for discussion in this way at this and the December European Councils.
Some â MrsÂ Frassoni and MrÂ Catania â asked more specifically about the ideas on asylum and migration policy.
Camps have been mentioned, although we do not call them that, but rather speak of reception capacities in the region.
Cooperation is needed with the third countries from which the asylum seekers originate.
The Presidency proposes tackling the problems at source by means of enhanced cooperation with third countries, and hopes that this approach can be confirmed and decided at the European Council.
This means that we must show real commitment on our part, but can also expect something from these third countries as regards migration and asylum.
Many, including MrÂ Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and MrsÂ RÃŒhle, have rightly and very importantly referred to the question of principle that is the desired transition to qualified majority voting and codecision in this whole field of asylum and migration.
I perfectly understand the desire on the part of everyone that has talked about this to see the changeover in this field.
I cannot deny that it is a difficult discussion.
You know that the Presidency shares the views expressed by a number of you here, namely that we should indeed take that path as far as possible.
At all events, the Presidency is making a supreme effort towards this, and so I hope that we can achieve a sufficiently positive decision in this direction.
A number of you have drawn attention to a third item that also features on the agenda of the coming European Council, which concerns the problem of âcommunicating Europeâ: that is to say, promoting greater involvement of citizens in Europe, in what you do here, in what the Council does, in what the Commission does, in what we do in Brussels.
Various remarks have been made about this, but in all cases there was agreement that this subject requires a better, more vigorous approach, because we cannot carry on like this: distributing pamphlets and then keeping our fingers crossed that citizens finally understand the merit and importance of the work that we are all doing here.
In that sense, I also agree with MrÂ Piotrowski, for example, who says that we should not just give one side of the story, but also include the aspects of criticism and scepticism.
Indeed, let us not fear criticism, let us not fear debates in which negative judgments are expressed, nor let us fear clashes between various institutions such as Parliament and Commission as regards the maturity of the democracy and the encouragement of debate, because debate will ultimately be the most important means to enhance citizensâ involvement in Europe.
When they see that important things are decided here on which opinions can differ and on which citizens also have an opinion, they will become involved in Europe, and then â and I also address this to MrÂ Battilocchio â Europe will be less remote than many people currently find it.
In practical terms, MrsÂ Sbarbati, yes, it will cost money.
Commission, Council, national governments will need to have something set aside in order to attend to this.
If I may mention one thing: the Dutch Presidency has promoted the showing of a television broadcast on the eve of the December European Council that will confront people in a broadly accessible manner and hold them to account on subjects discussed there, and the Dutch Presidency is putting money into that, too.
Finally, I should like to mention other topics that have been raised, such as enlargement, to which MrÂ Verheugen has already referred.
No discussion of the substance of this is planned for this European Council, because this is scheduled for the December European Council.
There will of course be a presentation, and we are all familiar with the important and very valuable Commission report on this.
I wish to hereby add my voice to the compliments paid to the Commission, particularly MrÂ Verheugen, by MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser and others regarding the value of the report we now have before us.
I also concur with the remarks that she and others made about Turkey, namely that we must focus on the various aspects, on the opportunities and positive sides.
Nevertheless, I also think that it was a very wise observation of MrÂ Verheugenâs that even the concerns that exist are shared by us, and these are also being included, have been included, in the proposals the Commission has presented, which also mention the possible results.
By way of conclusion, MrsÂ Frassoni put a specific question regarding the Turkish part of Cyprus and what the Council intends to do about it.
This is not on the agenda of the European Council, but I can tell you, and tell her via you, that her remark that the European Union cannot leave the Turkish part of Cyprus out in the cold is the exact essence of the guiding principle the Presidency has been following since the negative outcome of the referendum.
This is also why, as you know, we are working hard with others to make as much progress as possible with direct aid and direct trade during our Presidency.
At all events, we aim to continue working in that direction.
I hope that I have covered the key issues and responded to the issues that Parliament has raised.
MrÂ President, I hope that I may be excused after this speech.
On this occasion, too, we shall keep track of every word the Commission says; I do not believe that this has to be in person.
If you will permit me to take my leave now, I shall gladly do so.
Otherwise, I shall of course remain here at your request.
Â Â  This is a free country, Mr NicolaÃ¯.
You cannot be compelled to remain here.
Although we are glad to see you here, you are of course also discharging your duties if you want to be informed of what is said here even though you cannot be present.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the simple fact about Lisbon is that, on the core points of productivity, growth and employment, we have failed to live up to our own expectations.
This has two causes, the first being factors over which we have little control, such as external indicators, global economic influences, oil prices, and so on, whilst the second, over which we do indeed have some control, has to do with the fact that only very rarely was the Lisbon project recast as a national project at Member State level.
As most of the Lisbon project is outside the Community framework and has to be implemented at national level, the Member States must now be induced to devise national plans for its implementation and make the Lisbon project a priority for their own national policies.
If they do not do that, it will not work, and I agree entirely with Mr Watson, that the question of whether or not we will be as good as the Americans in 2010 is an interesting issue, but probably not the decisive one.
What I do think of as realistically feasible by 2010 is reversing the trend, which means reducing the productivity, growth and employment gaps and creating in Europe the dynamism that will enable us to achieve our goal of being the economically strongest region of the world, but, as little more than a perceptible reversal of trends will be possible in time for 2010, we should take a more realistic view of things.
I would like to spell out some home truths about the relationship between the Lisbon strategy, the environment, and the social framework.
We do, of course, want environmental and social standards to be as high as possible; as a fundamental of European policy, this is beyond dispute.
If, though, we want to have the highest possible environmental and social standards, we need the economy to be as competitive as possible, with competitive industries and competitive businesses.
Competitiveness is not just about individuals being able to make the largest profits possible, but about making our national economies so strong that they can achieve the great social goals, such as high standards of environmental protection and social security.
The fact is, though, that the set phrases used in Europe conceal fundamental differences in thinking.
I noticed that in this debate, in which, for example, Members spoke about quite different concepts of the European social model, with one Member saying that workers in Europe were over-protected, and others saying that they enjoyed too few social rights.
One said that reform must mean the dismantling of social rights; another that it must involve more social rights.
Within Europe, there is absolutely no agreement as to what the term âsocial modelâ actually means.
If, over the coming years, I get the chance to do some work in this area of policy, I will not play along with this policy of suppression and concealment.
I will make it clear that there are conflicts here, conflicts that must be called by their names; I will make it clear that decisions have to be taken in full awareness of where the conflicts actually lie, and that these empty phrases and code words, concealing as they do what are actually utterly different outlooks, do not help to solve our problems.
Please excuse my vehemence, but there are times when, in order to achieve a policy objective, one has to become accustomed to the truth, which is that there is no agreement as to how to go about organising the relationship between maximum environmental and social standards on the one hand and competitiveness on the other â but we will work at it.
Let me just say something about two other issues that have been addressed.
I am grateful to Mrs Frassoni for again raising the subject of Cyprus, which gives me the chance to tell your House something more about it.
I do not wish to conceal from you how deeply disappointed I am that it proved impossible to keep the promise made to the Turkish Cypriots after the April referendum by this Parliament, this Council, this Commission and the international community as a whole.
They were promised that they would not suffer on account of the rejection of the referendum in the Greek part of Cyprus.
We promised them that we would lead them out of their economic isolation.
The Council has not yet been able to adopt the Commission proposal to this effect, and I appeal urgently, not only to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, but also to a number of other Member States, to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the policies of the international community and of the European Union in relation to Cyprus are implemented.
The adverse effects are already visible.
We worked for years to get a democratic, pro-European government in Turkish Cyprus; that government has now collapsed, as Denktash and his people were able to argue that the Europeans had, as usual, made empty promises that they could not keep.
The damage already done to the prospects for a resolution of the Cyprus issue is beyond calculation, and the Commission urges that its proposal be adopted before the end of this year and that the promise we all made to the Turkish Cypriots be actually kept.
Let me conclude, ladies and gentlemen, with an observation on the economic effects of the enlargement that has already taken place and of the plans we have for the future.
Mr Buzek said something very important, and the Commission endorses his view that the membership of the ten countries has brought with it a very beneficial economic surge.
Our analysis shows clearly that enlargement has brought favourable economic results, not only in the new Member States, but also in the old ones, that both sides are benefiting from our integration of what are growing regions.
We can expect the same thing of the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria, which are in the offing.
Speaking personally, for I can say this only for myself, I am firmly convinced that, if the process of political and economic reform continues in Turkey over the next ten years, the result will be an economic situation in that country which, were it to accede, would put us in the same win-win situation as we have already had with the enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
That answers the question as to whether such an accession would jeopardise our social model, and the answer to that question is an unequivocal ânoâ.
These countriesâ accessions will not imperil our social standards; quite the contrary, they will make Europe stronger, and they will help us to achieve our goals.
Â Â  I have been notified by the French authorities that, with effect from 22 October, MrsÂ Simonot has been replaced by Mr Le Rachinel.
I welcome our new Member and would point out that Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Procedure states that a Member shall take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto until such time as his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute.
Â Â  â The workers should not expect any good to come out of the forthcoming summit on 4-5 November; on the contrary.
After the first five years of implementation of the Tampere decisions restricting democratic rights and freedoms and the anti-labour Lisbon strategy, they are planning a second five-year attack with new, more repressive, anti-grass roots measures.
Tampere II speeds up procedures for restricting the granting of asylum, promotes camps for rounding up immigrants outside Europe, introduces biometric data and strengthens obscure, centralised services, EU information systems and mechanisms for legalising repression on the pretext of organised crime and terrorism, thereby shielding the dictatorship of European capital.
The new anti-grass roots measures contained in MrÂ Îok's report will also make their appearance at the summit; they will form the basis for promoting the anti-labour Lisbon strategy at a faster pace and decisions will be taken about the militarisation of the ÎU and its enhanced participation in the Iraq war alongside the USA.
The repressive measures, however, will not be able to stop the fight by the workers against this warmongering, anti-labour, autocratic policy and the promising march to claim satisfaction of their contemporary needs.
Â Â  The next item is the speech by Mr Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I have asked for the floor at this point because I believe it is important that I share with you my analysis of the current situation and that I convey to you my position at this stage of our debate.
I listened very attentively to yesterday's debate.
I have had extensive contacts with the Group leaders, and I have also spoken with the PresidentâinâOffice of the Council.
I have come to the conclusion that if a vote were to take place today, the outcome would not be positive for the European institutions or for the European project.
In these circumstances I have decided not to submit a new Commission for your approval today.
I need more time to look at this issue, to consult with the Council and to consult further with you, so that we can have strong support for the new Commission.
It is better to have more time to get it right.
These last few days have demonstrated that the European Union is a strong political construction and that this Parliament, elected by popular vote across all our Member States, has a vital role to play in the governance of Europe.
I was honoured to receive your support as President-designate of the Commission in July.
At that time I committed myself to working actively with you in the European interest.
I renew that commitment today.
I believe that we can agree on our common commitment to reinforcing the democratic nature of European integration.
In that spirit, I hope we can arrive at an outcome in the next few weeks that will permit us to take forward our work in the European Union.
You can count on me.
I can always offer you loyal, constructive cooperation for the good of Europe and the European Union project.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Barroso.
We remain in politically uncharted territory, since this is a situation we could never have foreseen.
The Treaties clearly lay down that the new Commission must commence its duties on 1 November and that beforehand the European Parliament must give its opinion on a proposal.
But Parliament clearly cannot give its opinion if there is no proposal.
Mr Barroso tells us that there is no proposal.
I believe it would be good to know the Councilâs position, since, if there is no proposal, the Council must also give its opinion.
Â Â  . Mr President, Members of Parliament, we understand the situation.
The consequence of this situation is that the current Prodi Commission will stay in office for as long as is necessary.
Â Â  Before the President continues his considerations, perhaps we should hear the Presidents of the political groups.
I believe there is a point of order.
Mr Pannella has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my point of order is based on the combined provisions of Article 214 of the Treaty and Rule 99(2) and Rule 132 of the parliamentary Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, the point of order that I want to raise, as you have already correctly pointed out, concerns the deadline set by the Treaty for November, in a few daysâ time.
Secondly, the President-designate, as the Rules also state, is obliged to present the Commission to Parliament, and the Council will then be notified if it is approved.
Â Â  That is not a point of order.
Mr Pannella, you do not have the floor.
Mr Schulz has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the statements by the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you, on behalf of my group and, I believe, on behalf of others, for the sitting to be suspended, as originally planned, as our group wants to discuss how to proceed further.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a decisive moment for the European Union, for Parliament, and for its relations with the Commission.
Our group has had a consultation, but in order that all those who wish to speak may do so â not everyone has been invited to â we should meet this concern, as we want the decision we take when we reassemble to be taken on as broad a basis as possible.
I therefore support the request for the sitting to be suspended now.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency considers it essential to suspend the sitting and ask the political groups to meet, but before resuming the plenary sitting and following the meetings of the political groups, I shall call the Conference of Presidents.
Groups, Conference of Presidents and then plenary.
We shall meet again in plenary at noon.
Â Â  Mr Rogalski has the floor on a point of order.
Â Â  Â Â Â This is a point of order, MrÂ President.
On behalf of the League of Polish Families I should like to propose that this House dissolve itself, as it has become hostage to the European homosexual lobby.
It is an inefficient, expensive and unproductive institution.
Â Â  That is clearly not a point of order.
The Chairmen of the political groups shall speak.
Mr Poettering has the floor first.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso was elected on 22 July, by a large majority, as the next President of the European Commission, and today he has taken the initiative.
In doing so, he has shown that he possesses the strength to be a leader.
And what we expect of the Presidency of JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso
is a strong European Commission.
The President of the Commission has said that he has no proposal to make today, and that he needs more time.
Mr President of the Commission, let me tell you, on behalf of our Group, that of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that our support for you has never wavered over the past few weeks, and you can be sure that we will continue to support you in the difficult days and weeks now, so that there will eventually be a strong Commission under your decisive leadership.
Todayâs applause showed that your proposal enjoys wide support.
We would have preferred to see a vote in favour of your team today â that I will not deny â but politics is a process.
I hope that it is apparent to all in the European Union that this House possesses influence and power, and the European Union is undergoing a process of parliamentarisation. Today is for that reason a significant day in the history of the European Parliament.
Our group has always had the strategic objective of having a strong Commission presided over by you, and of not isolating one single member of your team.
Instead, we must take note of the overall results of the hearings and draw conclusions from them.
It will be your task to join, on this basis, with all interested parties and with the Council in coming to the right decisions.
We also, in order that you may not be the tool of governments, must see to it that the future President of the Commission can have the last word and reject candidates put forward to him.
This leads our group to believe that we do not need a decision today.
It is now for us in this House to discharge our responsibilities.
In difficult times, when, on Friday, the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, with us affirming our belief in our continentâs future, we want a strong European Parliament, a strong Commission and a Council of Ministers that works well with both institutions.
Believing as we do that Europe has a future, we now wish you, Mr President-designate of the European Commission, much success in presenting your team, to which we hope we will be able to give a great deal of support and a vote of approval.
You have our support as we go this way together.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission ...
Mr President, perhaps the medical service could give the honourable gentleman a tranquilliser.
Mr President, I am quite happy to sacrifice two minutes of my time to hooliganism in the European Union.
This is intolerable.
These people claim to speak on behalf of the European people!
You should be ashamed of yourself, you louts!
Mr Kilroy-Silk, please be quiet and sit down.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision we have to take today is one of great importance for the European Union and for its future.
We have had lively discussions and vigorous disagreements over the last few weeks.
My groupâs resolution, taken unanimously yesterday evening, was preceded by hard, tough debates and serious disagreements, even in our own ranks.
We had disagreements because our decision would involve passing judgment on our Social Democrat friends in the Commission.
After lengthy discussions yesterday evening, which involved them â and let me tell them that they were the outstanding members of the proposed Commission â our solidarity with these friends from our group meant that the decision was not, for us, an easy one.
The decision we took yesterday evening is that we, despite everything, cannot have confidence in the Commission that you, Mr Barroso, would have proposed, or intended to propose, this morning.
Rather than revisit the debate, which was a lively one, I want to tell you that, having recognised â this morning, yesterday evening and during the course of yesterday â that this proposal would not gain a majority, you came to the right conclusion by acceding to Parliamentâs wishes.
On behalf of my group, let me say that this was the right course of action.
What you are doing this morning opens up the way to a shared future for all of us, both the Commission and the broad majority in the European Parliament.
I was pleased to hear Mr Poettering say that he supported this development, and I can tell him that it is never too late to join those who said that the European Parliament also needs to be strengthened when debates are cut short, when they are reduced to a presentation, on the basis that the European Parliament talks sense only when it agrees with the Commission.
So, welcome to the club, Mr Poettering.
Those who want a strong Commission, enabled to work by the broad support for it in the European Parliament, are those who want one strong institution â the Commission â supported by another strong institution â Parliament â to be capable of dealing with the real challenges of the years to come.
If you strengthen such a Commission, then you are for Europe.
If you seek to make it dependent on the votes of that gentleman, whose three or four votes just might help the Commission get a majority, then you are weakening Europe.
That is why a broad majority is necessary.
In the last few weeks, Mr Barroso, we have had various proposals to put to you.
My group expects you, in your future considerations, to bear in mind the proposals that this House put to you at the end of the hearings.
Speaking on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we also expect your considerations to be influenced by what the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has told you, for one thing is clear, and that is that you will need my groupâs support for your future Commission too.
While offering you cooperation, we also urge you to take seriously the advice that the Socialist Group in this House has given you.
On 22 July, you had 413 votes, some of them from members of my group.
Many in my group did not vote for you on that occasion, but what you got then was a great vote of confidence.
Over the last three months, you have been gambling with some of your credit, but, with your decision today, you have won some of it back.
We in the European Parliamentâs Socialist Group are ready for constructive collaboration, and that is the road you have chosen today â something we have sometimes missed over the last few weeks.
If we are to achieve something in the next few weeks, I ask you not to bring back the same Commission that you would have presented to us today, as otherwise we could have voted on it today.
I ask you to bring us a new proposal, one offering the possibility of broader support for the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, today this House on the river Rhine has grown in stature.
Its will was tested, its will has prevailed.
At no time did we ask for anything more than is our right.
We asked for no prerogative that is not laid down in the law of Europe.
We asked for our considered judgment to be treated with respect.
At every stage, our willingness to stand by that judgment was doubted, mistrusted and tested.
It was tested to the edge of political crisis until the price of exerting our will became so high that only the unwalked ground of political crisis stretched ahead of us, and none of us wanted to venture onto it.
However, our will and our willingness to stand by our judgment prevailed.
Nobody in this Chamber seeks confrontation for its own sake.
We value the tension that exists between our institutions, because the ability to turn that tension to mutual benefit is the sign of our institutions' maturity.
Mr Barroso, you suggested yesterday that it was antiâEuropean to vote against your Commission.
I do not honestly think you believe that.
You know that when proâEuropeans criticise your Commission, they are not doing the work of Euroscepticism, but the very opposite: today, Euroscepticism loses because the voice of democracy in Europe has risen by an octave and has made itself heard in every national capital and beyond.
You know that Liberals and Democrats in this House challenged you and your Commission, because we want it to be stronger than you were given the chance to build it â stronger so that the European Union is stronger.
Mr Barroso, I restate now that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports you.
We voted for you in the knowledge that your commitment to the European Union matches our own.
I say again today what I said yesterday: if our House is weak, then so is yours, because if the governments of Europe do not respect us, they will not respect you or the independence of your College.
Our strength is your strength.
You have a chance to rebuild a Commission that can win the support of this House.
Work fast!
You know the will of this Chamber.
Through resignation, reshuffle or withdrawal, you can come back to us with a new Commission, confident that we hold you in high regard as a committed European and a President of the European Commission with a capacity for great work.
Yesterday I spoke of an elephant in this Chamber, and it is here again.
Once again I call on the Council to reflect on the rights of this House and on the way in which it chooses to exercise them.
Liberals and Democrats call on the Council to respect the prerogatives of this House and the independence of the Commission, which it is charged with approving.
We call on you to reflect on your own responsibility for the impasse at which we found ourselves.
We will work with you to surmount that impasse. Over the rich summit dinner on Friday, let there be food for thought.
Mr Barroso, on behalf of my Group, I commit the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to working with you to see a Commission approved in November.
I thank you for your candour and commitment.
I repeat that this House has today grown in stature: our will was tested and our will has prevailed.
Mr Kilroy-Silk, if you continue to disrupt the sitting, I shall expel you from the Chamber.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-designate, MrÂ Barroso, I should like to begin in a language that is our language of the past by quoting Mao Zedong to you.
Mao Zedong said that to understand defeat is to prepare for victory.
MrÂ Poettering, you and MrÂ Barroso should read some Mao Zedong together.
Secondly, winning Parliamentâs confidence is a long march.
We shall help you on that long march ...
Mr President, over the last few days we in this House have seen exciting things happening.
I think that all of us have learned things.
We have learned that getting to grips with the political substance of a Commission is quite a business.
We learned that from your election, Mr Barroso, when you gained a majority, so that you are the intended future President of the Commission.
We then had to discuss the competence of the proposed Commissioners.
When you introduced yourself to us, you told us that you were independent, that you wanted to be independent, no matter what was said by Mr Schroeder, Mr Blair or anyone else, that the Commission would be your work rather than the Councilâs.
Wonderful, do it, do it!
What that means is that you, if someone proposed by a Member State is not competent, will, with our support, reject the proposal rather than simply accept it.
With us, you will be strong enough to do that; we will be right behind you.
And that has nothing to do with ideology.
As I see it, my friends, competent people have been proposed for the Commission, who do not share my political outlook.
We want strong and competent Commissioners who will be more than the mere lapdogs of this or that European government.
We say that loud and clear.
That, Mr President, is why we are telling you, in plain language, to read very carefully the resolution that this House proposed, the one that effectively led to your withdrawal.
That resolution contains the arguments on the basis of which we will judge the next proposals.
It is competence and conflicts of interest that are at issue.
Do not come back here proposing tainted people as Commissioners, or you will end up with your back to the wall again.
Do not propose people who go against what your Commission has it in mind to do.
We will therefore be quite frank in saying that we regard your withdrawal as a brave step, as a sign that you have seen sense.
You have realised that there is no possibility of winning a majority with only one part of this House behind you.
Mr Watson, I am very happy that you did not have to vote contrary to the way you spoke.
That would not have been good.
We know from the feminists that when a woman says 'No', it means no.
From you, we have learned that when the Liberals say 'No', it can mean yes, and this is wrong.
And so, Mr President, I ask you to listen to this House in future.
If you listen carefully, you will get a large majority for a Commission.
That is something you need to know.
As Mr Poettering discovered today, the strongest group does not always add up to a majority in this House.
This is a democratic learning process, one that we have all been fortunate to be able to undergo in these days.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it turns out that MrÂ Barroso needed to be given a fright in order to resign himself to withdrawing his Commission.
It is a victory for European democracy and a great encouragement to all those who helped create the conditions for this decision.
I would point out that when, under the pretext that it was criticising his team, the President-designate accused half of this House of siding with, and I quote, âthe anti-European extremistsâ, he yesterday revealed himself once more to be precisely the person he not long ago maintained he did not want to be: a President of the Right in conflict with the Left and, indeed, the liberals.
The Commission did not believe that we could agree upon a common position, but we succeeded and we won.
Now, the next stage has to be prepared and, with that in view, lessons learned from what has just happened.
How did such an unprecedented situation arise?
Yesterday, I drew attention to the disaffection felt by the majority of people and to some of the symptoms of the evil that is eating away at our institutions.
In this context, the challenge to be taken up by European leaders at all levels was, and remains, that of daring to carry out a critical evaluation of what is now lacking and of showing that they are determined to invest the European adventure with meaning again, for, contrary to what you said, MrÂ Barroso, I, for my part, believe in Europe.
I am convinced of the need for Europe, so do not go on classifying me among the anti-Europeans.
MrÂ Barroso did the opposite of taking up this challenge.
Not only did he accentuate the most controversial features of European economic and social policy by placing champions of liberalism in strategic posts, but he also fuelled fears of a return to the moral and patriarchal order of times gone by and of people uniting behind a vision of the world closer to that of American neo-conservatives than to the expectations of Europeans.
That is what, in our view, must change in the future Commission, not just the identity of the person responsible for a particular portfolio.
In this troubled context, I shall single out one very good piece of news.
Others have said it before me: what we have here are fresh stirrings of political confrontation in the European Parliament, finally replacing half-heartedness and feeble consensus.
A real debate about the civilised order has begun that may have far-reaching consequences for the greater good of Europe.
In this sense, these historic moments constitute a genuine milestone.
May their promise be fulfilled!
Â Â  MrÂ President, todayâs crisis shows that the rules for appointing the Commission do not work.
Nor will they work where the Constitution is concerned.
The prime ministers appoint people they want or, often, people they want to get rid of, and expect us to rubber-stamp their choice.
We propose instead that each individual national parliament choose its own Commissioner and hold him or her responsible.
In that way, we should have a democratically appointed Commission.
What is the body we now call the Commission?
It is the engine of integration.
It is not subject to control by elected representatives, be they national representatives from the parliaments or supranational representatives from this House.
It operates through 30Â 000 officials and more than 3Â 000 working groups, through which the Commission secures influence for itself, and through a network in the Member States that also bypasses the national authorities.
The working groups are secret and cannot be controlled by the national parliamentsâ Europe committees.
The thousands of decisions and laws adopted by the Commission are rarely made in the Commission itself but, more often than not, in working groups involving participants of whom we have no knowledge.
Only relatively few votes are taken in the Commission, and the general public is unaware of the results.
The Commission administers a budget of EURÂ 100 billion, but this is not controlled by the Commissionâs own accounts department, by the Court of Auditors or by the Committee on Budgetary Control set up for the purpose by the European Parliament.
Nor, for safetyâs sake, can the Ombudsman obtain any documents he might request.
In the Commission itself, the presidents cannot control the various Directors General, even though it is formally the president who is responsible for doing so.
The whole lot of them are, however, in agreement as to the direction to be taken, namely ever more power to Brussels.
Every opportunity must be taken to obtain more power, and concessions to transparency are made only rarely.
It took MrÂ Santer four years to have the Commissionâs telephone directory made publicly available.
It is now on the Net as an experiment.
It has taken MrÂ Prodi four years to have the Commissionâs agendas and minutes put on the Net.
It took MrÂ Barroso a day to make the list of Commission working groups available.
That was the day before he was to be elected here in this House.
He wanted in that way to show that it was he who made the decisions, but then transparency came to an end.
We have not been given a promise that we shall be told who participates in the working groups and what they do.
My group is not taking part in the onslaught on an individual Commissionerâs personal beliefs.
Nor, however, will we deliver votes to a supranational, anti-democratic organisation which one departing Commissioner described very precisely as a âmonsterâ.
This âmonsterâ has a monopoly on tabling bills.
No one can blame the European Parliament for using its limited powers to reject the Commission, but the undignified hounding of an individual Commissioner shows that the best form of control is obtained if each countryâs electorate and own national parliament chooses its own Commissioner and holds him or her responsible.
In that way, the Commission would be elected from the bottom up and not from the top down by a qualified majority of prime ministers.
The individual Commissioners could attend their national parliaments each week and listen to, and talk with, the representatives of the electorate, and the Commission would then constitute our representatives in Brussels, and the officials its servants.
The Commission would no longer be an unruly âmonsterâ, and people would stand up and applaud spontaneously if the Commission President were to pass by.
There is a long way still to go, and MrÂ Barroso has not shown that he dares take the leap of becoming the votersâ servant.
Today, he has talked with the representatives of the three largest groups.
The four smallest groups have not been consulted.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have suffered from injustice during our lives, and for people of good faith that is a reason to make every effort so that others should not suffer discrimination and abuse.
Before making any decision, Martin Luther King used to ask himself: âIs it right?â
I believe it is right that every political person should stand up for his or her own convictions and fight to defend the ideas of others for the sake of the common good.
Politics, in fact, is about making laws in the overall interests of todayâs and tomorrowâs citizens.
Those who do not express their reasoned opinions are acting in the interests of their parties but not in the interests of Parliament, which represents all voters and not just those who voted for us personally.
We should therefore have preferred to vote today so as to carry out our mutual responsibilities.
Nevertheless, we accept MrÂ Barrosoâs decision in the hope that further time for calm reflection will provide an opportunity for the Council, which is due to meet in Rome shortly for the signing of the Constitutional Treaty, to reach a considered understanding with Parliament and the Commission.
We renew our trust in Mr Barroso in the certainty that his choices and the appointments made by the governments will comply with the peopleâs call for a transparent Commission that respects the principle of subsidiarity and is able to uphold everyoneâs rights, within the context of the overall interests of society from a European viewpoint, but also in the interests of the rest of the world.
We call on Parliament, in any case, to provide all the committees with specific rules in common, so that future hearings will all follow the same procedures.
The different procedures used to date have not, in fact, guaranteed either impartial methods or respect for true democracy.
In response to the statement by the Council representative, we do not consider that the Prodi Commission can remain in office for as long as necessary.
The Prodi Commission must remain in office for ordinary administration until the next plenary part-session of Parliament in Strasbourg.
On that date, Mr Barroso must come before this House again with the complete list of Commissioners.
Otherwise we would have a poor image of this Europe, which I do not think anybody wants.
Over the past fifteen years in this House, I have always remembered that the secular spirit of Parliament can only be preserved so long as this secularity is not transformed into a new kind of fundamentalism, which, while supporting the protection of some groups, breaches the rights of others.
Two wrongs never make a right but create new oppressions and divisions in society.
Anyone who tries to protect differences in culture or sexual orientation by discriminating against the culture or religious beliefs of others is not acting for the common good but perpetrating new discrimination.
Intellectual narrow-mindedness makes human beings petty and arrogant.
Respect for others, on the other hand, enables them to formulate rules that ensure peaceful coexistence for all.
Mr Barroso, the Commission must listen to Parliament but reject the attempts by some to blackmail you.
The Commission does not need guardians along its way, but loyal and intellectually honest partners in dialogue.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is an anecdote told in my country according to which an outstanding Polish politician is one who never agrees to a compromise, whereas a good American statesman is one who can always find a compromise.
If this anecdote were to be translated, taken seriously, and adapted for the European Parliament, MrÂ Barroso would have a successful career ahead of him in America, and many outstanding politicians and speakers in this House would triumph over the political scene in my country.
In response to MrÂ Barrosoâs critics, I should like to remind them that it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the appointment of Commissioners.
MrÂ Barrosoâs room for manoeuvre is limited, and we should be clear about the fact that it will remain limited until there is a change in the way the Commission is appointed.
If this House wishes to say that the governments of the Member States play too large a role in this process, it should say so clearly.
I do not share this opinion, however, as I do not believe the role governments play is too large.
If the Commission is to have the support of the Member States, the Member Statesâ governments must have a major part to play in its appointment, even if this sometimes prolongs the decision-making process.
We have great respect for all those speakers who have expressed their reservations concerning individual Commissioners-designate, as many of us also had doubts about a number of them.
The voting procedure is what it is, however, and we vote on the Commission as a whole, without being able to vote on individual Commissioners, something that has both positive and negative sides.
The ball is now back in the court of the President of the Commission and the EU Member States, but this decision-making process should not be allowed to drag on, as Europe needs a new Commission, just as Europe needs a strong European Parliament.
Indeed this House is now proving its strength, and I am sure we are all aware of this, both those who would vote in favour of MrÂ Barroso and his Commission and those who would vote against.
It is to be hoped that the heated dispute we are witnessing and involved in will not cause a permanent rift in this House.
Even when we have fundamental differences of opinion, we should remember the aspects that unite us and not only those that may divide us.
Finally, I should like to express my respect for MrÂ Barroso.
You do not have an easy life, and you have embarked upon a difficult mission.
This makes it even more important for me to tell you, at this difficult time, that I value your efforts and the strength of character you have demonstrated.
I believe that before long we will be able to congratulate you on your political success.
Many thanks.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the scheduled speeches of the Chairmen of the political groups.
Mr Kilroy-Silk has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order; Mr Barroso showed his disdain for Parliament yesterday by turning up late and not apologising.
He has now demonstrated his incompetence by having no proposals to put before Parliament today.
Any self-respecting Parliament would now vote no confidence in the ...
That is not a point of order.
Mrs Mussolini has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to raise a point of order.
I refer to Article 99(2) â just as the Member whose name I do not know wished to.
I find it absurd that Parliament should be deprived of its right to speak when faced with such an important political change as this, and I consider it essential to open a debate.
It should not only be the group leaders who can speak.
By withdrawing his proposal, Mr Barroso has deprived Parliament of its right.
The President-designate has, in fact, taken a political line in structuring his Commission and, seeing that each Commissioner has already appeared before the appropriate parliamentary committee, the vote should have taken place.
It is not an option now to put everything off for a month and to go looking for a majority, because Parliament is sovereign; otherwise we would not count for anything.
It should not only be the group leaders who can speak: it should be everyoneâŠ
Â Â  Mrs Mussolini, that is not a point of order.
Mr NicolaÃ¯, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor.
Strictly speaking, the presidency and the Council are not official parties to the discussion that is taking place between Parliament and the new President of the Commission.
We are naturally very closely involved in this debate and this situation.
I can also respond to Mr Watsonâs remark by assuring you that we have, literally, missed not one word of anything that the Members of this House have had to say about this important issue, as I already explained this morning.
Needless to say, the Council bears a share of responsibility in this situation.
As Mr Barroso has already indicated, we will take that responsibility by consulting the new President of the Commission and the other Members of the European Council at the earliest opportunity, in a bid to bring about a speedy solution to this situation.
I should like to repeat what I stated this morning, namely that the European Parliament has, of course, got every right to take its responsibility, determine its position and make its choice.
I also said that the present confrontation between Parliament and the incoming Commission can also be seen as evidence of a European democracy that is reaching maturity, and that I naturally have every confidence that the position that your House will adopt will be well thought-out.
I expressly repeated this morning that the presidency and the Council had every confidence in Mr Barroso as the incoming President of the Commission, and that is still the case.
I also expressed my sympathy and understanding for the step that he has just taken.
So, finally, I trust that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible.
To that I would add that your work, the work of the Council and the presidency, as well as the work of the Commission, carries on as before.
It is thus important to know that the present Prodi Commission will be carrying on its duties, so that the European citizen does not lose out as a result of this situation.
The work will be continued at all levels and in all institutions, and the Prodi Commission will for that reason continue to carry out its tasks as long as this proves to be necessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you very much for giving me the floor.
I believe that everything has already been said.
I want first of all to thank all those who supported me and understood my approach.
I hope to be able to work with you over the next five years.
I think it may be said that we shall get to know each other.
I am keen for you to know that I am a man of compromise.
Compromise is something in which I profoundly believe.
You should know that I am in favour of a âcoalitionâ, if I can put it like that, between all those who are in favour of the European project.
This point is important.
I already mentioned it at the meeting of the chairmen of political groups when the issue of politicisation came up. Admittedly, I belong to a political family.
I have the great honour of belonging to the political family of Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Alcide De Gasperi. I also believe, however, that we must unite all those who wish to work together, be they from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or other groups who are in favour of Europe.
I want you to know that my Commission is not partisan.
It is a Commission in which there are Christian Democrats and members of the European Peopleâs Party and in which there are socialists and liberals and, too, a member of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
It is a pluralist Commission.
The real Europe is characterised by pluralism, tolerance and balance and by a consensus designed to benefit our people.
I therefore did what I had to do.
I came here with my team and made a rational assessment of what was best, not only for the Commission but for all the European institutions.
That, moreover, is an aspect I am keen to emphasise.
As is natural in political debate â and I too am a politician â people do indeed sometimes say: it is we who have won, and the others have lost.
I do not think of institutional relations within the European Union in terms of a victory by Parliament over the Council or of a victory of the Commission over Parliament.
I do not think of our relations in those terms.
It is not a football match.
I believe that, on the contrary, we are sources of mutual strength.
As has been said, and very commendably, we need a strong Parliament and a strong Commission too.
That much is obvious.
Our authority cannot be established at the expense of the other institutions.
In this connection, I also want to give prominence to the Council, because the Council is the representative of the Member States, and I believe that all those who have been elected by the citizens of the Member States are democrats.
To summarise, we must respect all our institutions, and that is indeed the way I intend to continue if, of course, I have your backing and support.
We need this culture of respect between the various institutions in order to strengthen all those in Europe who are in favour of the idea of compromise.
I do not believe there is any mileage in imagining that what the one institution gains, the other loses.
Today, I believe that we have made broader and more fruitful cooperation possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have not talked very much about Europeâs basic problems, but we need broader support in order to make progress towards achieving our priorities in Europe.
For my part, I am, of course, prepared to work with you in a spirit of mutual respect and loyalty, with the European project â that of our citizens â always our main priority.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Having listened to you, the Council and the Chairmen of the political groups, the Presidency would draw the following conclusions from what has been said.
This is not a request to delay the vote.
If that were the case, Parliament would give its opinion on whether or not to accept this request.
But that is not the case.
We are not being asked to delay the vote.
We are being told that there is not yet any proposal on which to vote.
Mr Barroso needs more time to draw it up and the Council understands this and accepts it, and the Prodi Commission will therefore remain in office until we can debate and vote on a proposal.
There is, therefore, nothing to vote on at the moment.
Neither does it make much sense to vote on motions for resolutions related to the debate on the Commission.
Although we are not going to vote on the motions for resolutions, I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to read them carefully.
I believe you will find elements in them which may help you in the work you have yet to do.
There will not, therefore, be a vote on any issue.
When I say that I invite Mr Barroso to read them, I also invite him to read all of the proposals presented by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
It only remains for me to invite Mr Barroso and the Council to present us with a proposal as soon as possible, without setting any strict time limit, which Parliament can decide upon, and to keep us informed of how their work is progressing in this regard.
If there are no comments, the sitting is suspended.
Â Â  The Minutesof yesterdayâs sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 172 I have a correction to make to yesterday's Minutes.
In Item 3 there is some confusion over a name.
The second name in section 2 â 'From Members' â should be Wojciech Wierzejski, not 'Wojciechowski Janusz CzesÅaw'.
The first name was confused with the surname.
I ask that the Minutes be corrected in this regard.
Â Â  Of course, MrÂ Giertych, I duly note your comment, and we shall naturally make the required changes.
Â Â  Mr President, this morning Parliament's agenda was changed.
Does this change affect the whole of the day's agenda, or just part of it, and who decided on the change?
Â Â  As everyone will have noticed, a number of events have taken place this morning, but the agenda, as planned, remains unchanged.
We shall therefore resume the debates at 3Â p.m. today, as provided for in the agenda.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I was about to say Minister, as I remember you from your days as French Minister for European Integration.
I have an objection and an important observation to make relating to yesterdayâs Minutes, and in particular to the one-minute speeches.
My speech on the âgolden shareâ and the dispute between the European Commission and the German and Polish Governments has been attributed to an entirely different Member, namely to MrÂ JaÅowiecki from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I would therefore ask for this to be corrected, as it was definitely not MrÂ JaÅowiecki who spoke, but me.
I also have an objection regarding the list of speakers who gave one-minute speeches, as my name does not appear in it at all.
I am a modest person and do not believe such an omission would be detrimental to me in any way.
Nevertheless, I would like the relevant corrections to be made for the sake of accuracy.
Â Â  Thank you for those comments. As the saying goes, one must âgive to Caesar what is Caesarâsâ.
Here too, the necessary changes will therefore be made.
Are there no more comments?
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the EU-India Summit, with the Council and Commission statements on EU-India relations, then MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valleâs report on the same subject.
Â Â  . Mr President, the first summit between the EU and India took place in Lisbon in 2000.
Since then, our relationship has undergone a fast and dynamic development.
Our cooperation covers a wide range of subjects, from economic to cultural, and we address local, regional and global issues.
The framework of our strategic partnership, set up in 2000, now really has flesh on the bones.
The Netherlands presidency is very much looking forward to hosting the forthcoming summit in The Hague on 8 November.
This will give a further boost to our relations.
What do we want to get out of this summit?
The first thing we should do is to set a deadline for the completion of a comprehensive EU-India Action Plan for a Strategic Partnership.
This action plan should be approved at the next Summit in 2005.
This will reflect the ambition to further develop EU-India relations in several key areas, such as cooperation in the UN and other multilateral fora; conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction; cooperation on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; the fight against terrorism and organised crime; dialogue on democracy and human rights and EU support for Indiaâs achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
The Commissionâs communication, which was published last June, and the Indian reaction to it form the basis for this Action Plan.
There are a number of global challenges that we should address at the summit.
Both the EU and India are committed to strengthening the role of the UN.
We should therefore emphasise that an effective multilateral system based on the principles of international law, with a strong United Nations at its centre, is essential for achieving peace and international stability.
In addition to 'old' challenges, we also have to address new ones, such as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and the fight against terrorism.
On the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we should increase our cooperation, particularly with a view to reinforcing the consistency and effectiveness of export control measures for dual-use goods.
The EU wants to strengthen the political dialogue with India in this field and on issues relating to weapons of mass destruction.
We hope India will react positively.
The European Union is very concerned about the threat posed by the spread of HIV/AIDS in India.
The International Conference on Population and Development formulated a clear agenda on the fight against AIDS, and in 2001 the UN General Assembly adopted a Declaration of Commitment on AIDS.
We want to reiterate the importance of implementing the agenda and declaration.
On terrorism, we now have a clear resolution from the UN Security Council.
The EU will confirm to the Indians our commitment to the fight against terrorism.
We will also inform them of the concrete EU action to combat terrorism.
At the summit, we will also be discussing international and regional developments.
I will focus on the latter.
The EU has an interest in a stable, peaceful and prosperous South Asia.
Looking to this region, we are encouraged by the developments in SAARC and the ongoing and genuine efforts to take forward the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan.
At various meetings at both political and official level the EU has expressed its full support and its satisfaction with the steps taken by both countries.
At the summit, the EU will encourage India to continue to make progress in agreeing on substantive confidence-building measures, through improvements in transport, trade and economic links and more personal contact across the Line of Control.
But we cannot expect rapid progress: a cautious, gradual approach is needed.
We are encouraged by what we see as shifting parameters in India-Pakistan relations during the last months.
The EU hopes that both sides will continue to engage fully in this process, for instance through consolidation of the Line of Control ceasefire.
We also welcome the agreement of both sides to explore possible options for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue as part of the wider process of the composite dialogue between both countries.
This is critical to the future of the process.
Of course, Pakistan must continue to make every effort to curb terrorist infiltration across the Line of Control and cross-border terrorism.
But at the same time India needs to take further action to reduce human rights violations.
Improved social and economic quality of life in Jammu and Kashmir is important in sustaining peace.
India should continue to take into account the views of local leaders, representing a broad spectrum of Kashmiri stakeholders.
Indian involvement is also needed when it comes to the situation in Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Burma, issues that we will also discuss at the summit.
The EU is ready to express its commitment to the reconstruction and stabilisation of Afghanistan in partnership with the Afghan Government and is counting on India to do the same.
Peace and stability is also needed in Nepal and Sri Lanka.
We will encourage the Indians to use their influence to contribute to this goal.
Economics form an important part of EU-India relations.
Therefore, we also want to give some signals in this field.
We want to intensify bilateral cooperation in order to facilitate and expand trade and investment flows.
The European Union is Indiaâs first partner in terms of trade and actual investment inflows and is in the front rank of its partners in the field of economic cooperation.
We want to maintain that.
The summit will also provide an opportunity to express our commitment to the multilateral trading system and the desire to make progress in the Doha Development Round.
We also want India to participate in Galileo, our global satellite navigation system, and we want to discuss the negotiations on a maritime agreement.
Although the first summit took place only four years ago, the European and Indian cultures go back thousands of years.
They first came into contact at the time of Alexander the Great.
It is therefore only natural to stress the cultural dimension of our relationship by the signing of a common declaration on cultural relations.
I would like to conclude by saying that EU-India relations are improving all the time.
The relationship covers many areas and it is bound to succeed.
The Summit on 8 November will prove this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you about EU-India relations.
India is a partner that deserves special attention, and this Commission has made a point of bringing the relationship with India to new heights during its mandate.
Our objective has been a more comprehensive and forward-looking European policy towards India, and this is taking shape.
Looking at the state of our relations today, it is clear that they have come a long way since our first summit in Lisbon in June 2000.
In particular, we have deepened and strengthened our dialogue in all areas.
At last year's EU-India summit it was agreed that we should seize the opportunity to develop our friendship into a strategic partnership.
As global actors with strong democracies and common values and with many years of growing trade and political links, there is much to build on.
India has a formidable economic potential, as it looks set to emulate Chinaâs economic growth.
It plays an increasingly assertive role on the international stage.
It is engaged in a process of conciliation with Pakistan.
For these and many more reasons, the European Union simply cannot afford to miss out on opportunities for cooperation.
The Commission has set out proposals for doing just that.
The Communication on an EU-India Strategic Partnership identifies the challenges, opportunities and expectations for strengthening our international, economic and development cooperation with India.
Firstly, it is important to recognise that our relationship is no longer just about trade.
We are both more active on issues such as promoting peace, security and democracy in the world, where we hold common views.
The European Union and India could work more effectively together to support multilateralism and the role of the United Nations.
We could strengthen our cooperation in conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction, and in addressing global concerns such as non-proliferation and terrorism.
Certainly, the European Union and India should enhance their dialogue on human rights and democracy, bilaterally and internationally.
The European Union and India could also work more closely on promoting regional peace, prosperity and stability.
In areas where the European Union is involved in the peace process and reconstruction, such as Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, dialogue and cooperation with India could be stepped up.
The role of the European Parliament is crucial.
We encourage contacts with the Indian Lower House and suggest, in particular, regular meetings between delegations from both sides.
The planned visit of Members of the European Parliament to India early next month is excellent news.
India could become a major economic partner, and much remains to be done to tap the full potential of the European Union and Indiaâs trade and investment relationship.
India has been one of the worldâs fastest growing economies for over a decade.
Its growing prosperity is attracting increased attention from European business.
India should assure its climb to economic prosperity by continued economic reforms, including greater market access and better regulation.
We should therefore initiate a policy dialogue in important areas of economic management, such as industrial policy, the environment or competition.
We intend to promote strategic dialogues â ranging from regulatory dialogue to cooperation in research â in sectors such as information technology, transport, energy, biotechnology or space science.
We want to foster progress on trade and investment.
This includes strengthening the multilateral trading system from which we have both benefited.
The recent agreement on a South Asia Free Trade Agreement takes explicit inspiration from the EU process.
We stand ready to offer assistance based on our experience.
Mutual understanding is an area that has been neglected for too long.
Educational exchanges will receive a boost through a scholarship programme in the framework of Erasmus Mundus.
When we hold the next summit in The Hague in early November, we will adopt a declaration on cultural cooperation, hoping to make this area a priority for our future cooperation.
The Council has produced conclusions endorsing the main thrust of the communication, and India has responded with a very positive strategy paper.
Together with the excellent recommendations of Parliament, all elements are in place for the fifth summit to take the necessary decision to open a new era in our relations and to upgrade the relationship with India to a strategic partnership.
Political leaders are expected to task officials to prepare a detailed action plan and a new political statement for the sixth summit in 2005.
Implementation can only work with sustained and committed support from all actors, including the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe it is sad that we had to experience the attacks of 11 September for certain analyses and actions to be carried out and for certain objectives to be taken seriously.
If we want terrorism to be eradicated one day, we must not just use force, but also intelligence, and if we use our intelligence we will realise that very often the scourge we are facing is led by educated people who find a perfect breeding ground amongst the wretched of the Earth.
The combination of extreme ideology and hunger is undoubtedly explosive.
So I believe it is essential for us, while not dropping our guard, to deal with the different causes of terrorism simultaneously.
International relations are in turmoil and the Union, which is seeking to consolidate itself institutionally through the approval of the European Constitution, can play a significant and beneficial role in the quest for peace, stability and justice, including ecological justice, on our tormented planet, if we acquire the political will to do so.
I say this at a time when we are about to find out whether, on 2 November, the American superpower will opt for the path of constructive cooperation and respect for the opinions of others, including the international institutions, or whether it will choose the opposite direction.
In any event, we should bear in mind that, despite the enormous hegemony of the great American power, which can be either benevolent or hostile, as well as the European Union, other States are increasing in importance in terms of international relations, such as, to differing degrees and by way of example, China, India, Japan, Brazil and South Africa, to name but a few.
Close, respectful and mutually beneficial cooperation between the Union and some of these countries may contribute to stabilising a prosperous, just and peaceful southern Asia.
I do not believe there is any need to extol the virtues of India taking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, something it aspires to, as we all know.
Nevertheless, the very fact that that possibility is on the table clearly demonstrates not just the need to carry out a reform of the United Nations, but also the essential need to consider the structural injustice that distorts relations between the human beings and peoples of the planet.
The fact that in the twenty-first century it is still necessary to create an alliance against hunger, as several countries have done recently in the headquarters of the United Nations, demonstrates what a disaster the international social organisation we are immersed in is.
Our relations with India go back to the sixties.
In fact, India was one of the first States to establish diplomatic relations with what was then the European Economic Community.
It is no to say that that great country is the largest democracy in the world â although it may have shortcomings and defects, it is nevertheless the case.
The Union is Indiaâs most important trade partner and investor, but India is fourteenth on the list of the European Unionâs trade partners â just behind China, Brazil and South Africa in fact.
For all these reasons, we must take a positive view of the Commissionâs communication, proposing the establishment of strategic cooperation as well as positive conclusions from the Council of 11 October.
I believe we can all take heart from the fact that this is an issue the three Institutions agree on, which will provide us with suggestions and details to make the journey towards this strategic cooperation easier and richer.
I believe, therefore, that, in accordance with our respective competences, but always in a coordinated fashion, we three Institutions can and must promote sustainable development and appropriate management of globalisation, encouraging New Delhi to wage a decisive war against poverty, in which I am sure it can count on the cooperation of the Union.
The fact that India is a significant country in terms of certain important technologies, while at the same time 300 million of its inhabitants are living in poverty, is something that is quite frankly difficult to stomach.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that the strategic cooperation proposed, and which will be properly laid out at the bilateral Summit of 8 November, will contribute to finding solutions and to sharing effective multilateralism in international relations.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we fully agree with the statements made by the Commission and the Council, as well as the rapporteurâs report.
We believe that India, which is today the largest multicultural democracy in the world, should be a strategic partner for the European Union in defining new international political alignments to ensure peace and security.
We therefore fully agree with the recommendation that the Council should, at the fifth EU-India Summit on 8 November, identify India as a strategic partner for the Union.
A multilateral approach that also focuses on closer collaboration within the United Nations should be a central objective of the European Unionâs foreign policy, with which we are today coming face to face with the approval of the new Constitution.
That is why, if India is a strategic partner, we must ensure that the conditions are right for India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute in a peaceful and civilised manner.
I am not suggesting any useless external interference but something much simpler, giving as much helpful and welcome support as the European Union can provide based on its own experience in matters of foreign policy.
We hope, therefore, that cooperation can go much further.
The European Union is in fact Indiaâs largest trading partner, but India only ranks fourteenth for the countries of Europe.
There is thus a need for greater investment in economic cooperation among our enterprises, in research and in sustainable development.
We think that the proposals put forward for the establishment of a Centre for Indian Studies through collaboration between the European Union and India, the possibility of holding cultural weeks to coincide with India-EU summits and designing a strategy to make the European Union better known to the Indian people should be fundamental.
That is why we hope that the Indian Parliament will come and visit the European Parliament as soon as possible.
It has been too many years since that happened, and we should instead develop much closer interparliamentary cooperation between our countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent report and his insightful work into EU-India relations; I endorse the report as it currently stands.
However, speaking as Chair of the Parliament's South Asia delegation, I would like to go further.
I am extremely keen that we develop a meaningful, strategic partnership.
My hope for the fifth EU-India Summit on 8Â November is that it is a landmark one; one that propels the relationship between the world's largest democracy and ourselves â the second-largest â into the twenty-first century.
This can only happen if both sides have a strong will to turn dialogue and statements into a tangible reality.
Therefore, I ask the Council to reflect on why, despite many proposals and summits in the past, very little progress has been made on this issue.
Could it be that we have not had a clear vision of where we want our relations to be in five or ten years' time?
Mr NicolaÃ¯ and Commissioner Verheugen outlined a long list of areas where we need cooperation. But I believe we need to prioritise, because having this vast range of areas means we cannot focus on what we want to achieve.
The list is also missing some crucial priorities: one of our main priorities, for example, is realising the Lisbon goals, which also happens to be one of India's top priorities.
Their objective, like ours, is to create a knowledge-based society.
We have the same goals and we can learn from each other, but we need to have the means to translate the wish-list into actual achievements if we are to ensure that happens.
We also need to ensure that there are adequate resources in place.
I am keen to see the Commission communication creating a tangible difference on the ground and a partnership that allows the benefits of the enlarged Union to be reflected in the new neighbourhood policy.
I am leading a Parliamentary delegation to New Delhi next week and I will be urging our Indian counterparts to take action in the same areas â to prioritise, to produce a document â with a view to improving EU-India relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and emphasise how important it is that relations between the European Union and India be strengthened and cooperation stepped up.
It has taken us too long to comprehend Indiaâs significance.
For a long time, we have treated India differently from other countries in the region, China for example, and so we are glad that, to judge by the journeys undertaken recently, both the European Union and many national governments are giving greater attention to relations with it.
As many previous speakers have pointed out, India is the worldâs largest democracy, with a diversity of religions, cultures and ethnicities, whilst being at the same time a rising economic power.
We would therefore be well advised, to our mutual benefit, to attach the necessary importance to that country.
I do believe, though, that honesty, honest friendship and honest relationships involve neither party sweeping problems under the carpet, but rather addressing them frankly.
Indians see one of these problems as being the issue of the import restrictions that we in the European Union still impose on India, some of which are rigid.
India is right to address this issue, and we should consider whether fair trade might not be of more help to India than development aid has been to date.
I believe that critical scrutiny is needed here.
I would, however, like to add that we very definitely see human rights as being another of these issues.
While we welcome the indications that relations between India and Pakistan are bearing fruit in the shape of a potential resolution of the conflict in Kashmir, which gives cause for rejoicing, we also demand and expressly seek the acceleration, as a matter of urgency, of nuclear disarmament across the region, for the sake of the safety of the people who live there.
As I have already indicated, one issue that must not be allowed to drop off the agenda in discussions with India is that of human rights; from the role of women to the caste system, these issues have a place in this context.
Â Â  . Mr President, in his first statement in July, Mr Barroso said that we have to choose one priority, and that priority must be employment.
This does not seem to have transmitted itself to this particular committee, which recommends upgrading EU-India relations by outsourcing and insourcing.
I am sorry the rapporteur did not have the time to tell us how much insourcing there has been, but there has been a great deal of outsourcing.
In Britain alone, most of the banks, the insurance companies and even the National Health Service have outsourced.
My point concerns 3SE, which was set up by the EU and the Indian Government.
On its website it goes a little further.
According to the website, the value of outsourcing is in increased working days.
It invites employers to harness the time difference of three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours to pack in hours.
So there are no Commission hang-ups then about the working-time directive, as long it is the poor exploited workers of India who are involved!
The rapporteur tells us that we must help Delhi fight against poverty, but would he just tell his own organisation what it is doing to help?
