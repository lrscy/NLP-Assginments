However, on a practical level, I believe it is essential for MPs and MEPs to work more closely together to ensure the correct transposition of legislation.
Gold plating is a phenomenon which affects every Member State to a greater or lesser extent.
In the UK it is particularly harmful, harmful to our agriculture for instance.
The Abattoirs Directive left the Commission as a twelve-page document, was reduced by the French to a manageable seven pages and expanded by the British to an unreadable ninety-five pages.
Sadly, there are many other examples of gold plating in the fields of business and industry.
So why does gold plating affect the UK more than any other Member State?
One important reason is because the UK, unlike other states, does not involve MPs in the transposition process.
Belgium has a Federal Advisory Committee on European Affairs, made up jointly of MPs and MEPs.
The German and Greek legislatures have similar arrangements.
As an MEP who has been an MP in the UK, I now realise how little my colleagues and I knew about the regulations coming from Europe.
The problems have deteriorated under the present British Government as it reduced the powers of our House of Commons.
The way forward is for joint committees of members of national parliaments and MEPs to oversee the transposition of legislation into national law in every Member State.
This would be a small but significant step in the right direction and, by increasing cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament, it would allow national MPs a real say in the workings of our Union.
Mr President, it stands to reason that a European constitution makes sense if it is actually worthy of the name; so, quite certainly, do the plebiscites or referendums that even the treasurer and election campaign manager of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has called for.
Which draft, though, do we see before us?
Will this draft by the Convention give us fair and, above all, truly transparent decision-making structures?
Will it bring about the unmistakeably clear separation of powers?
Will enough decisions be taken by majority vote?
Did not the governments brutally force through their positions, as one of the previous speakers, Mr Voggenhuber, put it?
Will the small Member States lose out?
Will only a few of the large ones gain anything, Mr Rack?
Will the European Parliament become fully representative of the people?
Can it now call individual Commissioners to account in any real sense?
If we cannot, then can, at least, the voters?
Are they able to directly elect the Commissioners?
Will voters have direct influence on the decisions of the Council?
In essence, will there be more direct democracy?
John Palmer, of the respected European Policy Centre, and numerous German provincial prime ministers of varying political colours, have for years been saying over and over again, that if a country were constituted in the same way as the European Union, it would not be able, by reason of its lack of democratic legitimacy, to qualify as a Member State of the EU.
Will this new draft now do away with this fundamental deficit?
Are our much-valued European regions not left out?
What about the right of appeal?
Will we now at last have the proximity to the citizens that we have so often invoked?
Is the draft so clear and comprehensible that young people will be able to get to grips with it and get some idea of what Europe is?
Will it not result in incessant wrangling and party-political horse-trading?
A strong social market economy is the key to social peace in Europe - does the constitution contain any of the framework conditions on which that is dependent?
The answer to too many of these questions has to be 'no'.
That is why it now makes sense to convinced Europeans, among whom I number myself, to say 'no' to the text that is before us.
In any case, there can be no democracy without transparency, and, to this deception, we have to say, 'no, thank you'.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after congratulating the rapporteurs on their work, I believe that it is necessary to make some preliminary remarks.
There was a lengthy debate on whether it was necessary, appropriate and right to introduce a reference to Christian values - or even to God - in the text in question and in the text that will be adopted.
I believe that, over and above the formal aspects - and I would not be sorry if a reference to Christian values could be included - and over and above the terms used, it is important to note that the text that has emerged, and is emerging as it develops, respects these values.
I believe that the text shows considerable respect for Christian values: respect for human life and respect for the dignity of human life are, indeed, points of reference on which there has been much work in the Convention.
I feel it is important to emphasise that, over and above the actual words contained in the text, there is a reference to our history, to European life, that has, of course, been influenced by and associated with Christian values.
The different stages in achieving a Convention, a Constitution, new Treaties, have, I believe, been useful.
I am not a pessimist: on the contrary, I believe that the work that has been carried out, although slow, has, overall, been fruitful, even if there is still room for some more development.
I often think of what Europe could have been like without the Institutions that there are today, and I remember what our continent was in essence 60 years ago.
I must say, therefore, that what has been done - in terms of the direct legitimacy of the public, the quest for ways of achieving consensus and the management of the institutions and consensus - can be considered to be positive overall.
Many people maintain that there is still a great divide between the institutions and the citizens.
Perhaps these very citizens should be involved in the evolution of Europe to a greater extent; perhaps it falls to us to recognise rights and to ensure that, through an important principle - justified expenditure, effective and appropriate bureaucracy - the divide between the institutions and civil society can be bridged.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Europe is becoming more democratic, more transparent, and closer to its people, it has certainly not finished with this Constitutional Treaty.
We are a project, on which work must be in continual progress.
The codecision procedure is becoming the rule and unanimity the valid exception.
The citizens' parliament's legislative competence is being extended more than twice over.
The way in which the national governments share responsibility for European decisions is being made more transparent, so it will be harder to make accusations, and the information given to the public will need to be more honest.
Two of the constitution's fundamental pillars of governance are the subsidiarity principle and the environmentally responsible market economy.
There is, of course, criticism.
Aspects that have been criticised and cry out for amendment include the current proposal on the composition of the Commission, unanimous voting on taxes relevant to the internal market and on the Common Foreign Policy, as well as the absence of a common information campaign and of any requirement that the public be involved in the process of ratification.
It is because Europe needs European awareness, an awareness that only information can create, and because we need our citizens to be informed and involved, that I advocate - even though the legal basis for it is not yet in place - a Europe-wide referendum, to take place at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament.
It is because we have to inform, because we have to make citizens participants - and what could be more vital than to pro-actively tell the public about the European constitution, with its fundamental rights and civil liberties for citizens and to enable citizens to participate?
I call on the members of the Intergovernmental Conference to hold a Europe-wide referendum to introduce the process of ratification, and I call upon my fellow Members of this House to endorse my statement to this effect.
Mr President, I would like to focus on three points: the question of unanimity, the reference to God and Christianity and traditionally resident minorities.
The work of both the Convention and the rapporteurs is certainly positive; therefore - in answer to the pessimists and to those who always say no - I would say that, in terms of a complete Constitution, we are obviously only half way along the road but, compared to Nice, we have made steps forward that were and are giant steps.
It is, however, necessary to make some changes to this report, as President Prodi, whose opinion I share, stated before this House.
The first point that I would like to mention is unanimity.
I believe that, in requiring unanimity for constitutional amendments of minor importance too we would certainly be closing the door to future developments.
We must endeavour to be more farsighted and more open, and, to this end, I, too, endorse the spirit of Amendment No 20, for which I will vote.
Regarding my second point, the reference to God and Christianity, I find the uncompromising position of certain sections of this House incomprehensible; indeed, it is in conflict with the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the population. As regards Christianity, above all, if we do not include a clear, firm reference to it in the Constitution it will be tantamount to disowning our age-old history.
The third point concerns linguistic and cultural diversity and the rights of minorities, referred to in Amendment No 22, recital H. I believe that the minorities that were referred to in the Copenhagen criteria should have a place in this report as well.
I urge the Italian Presidency to make every endeavour to this end, both before and during the IGC, and to ensure that these minorities are mentioned in the Constitution too.
Mr President, I will be very brief. I just want to thank all the Members who spoke and made a valuable contribution to the debate which sees us all committed to creating a new, effective European Constitution: I would therefore like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what will be a precious contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I think that the Presidency is right not to discuss the merits of each individual issue, for the issues will, of course, be reflected upon and discussed during the Conference itself.
I believe, on the other hand, that it is right to take on board the general sense of direction and the suggestions relating to transparency, first and foremost, and, from this point of view, I can assure you that the Presidency will make every endeavour to ensure the participation of the entire European public, not least by setting up a special web site.
As regards the fundamental issue, which concerns the European Parliament and on which there was also an oral amendment from the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, namely the direct participation of Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I can only confirm what I said in the initial report, to the effect that the Presidency is in favour of making this possible.
This does not, of course, depend on our own will; we could propose it again and try to support it with conviction because we are certain that the European Parliament can make a decisive contribution to achieving a positive result when the new European Constitution is drawn up.
Since we, ourselves, are not, however, able to impose it, we can only take the message on board, make it our own and genuinely try to achieve a good result, in the hope that we will all be able to be present and to contribute to the achievement of this major, important objective that is the European Constitution.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)

The European Parliament joins with Mr ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing in hoping that the forthcoming IGC accepts the Convention's draft more or less in its present form. Parliament would hope that all the possible proposals would have been debated openly and that its conclusions would reflect the political will of the citizens.
There is considerable doubt surrounding all this, however.
As I stated in the minority opinion attached to the Gil-Robles-Tsatsos report, the Convention was in fact nothing more than a think-tank set up by the Council. It was not representative and it did not have a democratic decision-making mandate.
In addition, it exceeded its terms of reference, insofar as it was never asked to draw up a draft Constitution.
This has now been universally recognised.
Accordingly, the wish expressed by most governments to have what they describe as a genuine IGC, is therefore fully justified. They are calling for an IGC where meaningful discussion takes place, and where the original mandate is addressed.
This concerned how to overcome the democratic deficit. The supranational proposals of the Convention would simply increase it still further.
The way to overcome this deficit is rather to ensure European integration is better anchored on national democracies.
National governments are the genuine representatives of their people. This therefore is the task they should set themselves at the IGC.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge you most earnestly to adopt the recommendations drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
They represent an attempt at making a new start and desisting from the disputes of the past.
They are about finding a solution to the problem of how we help the people of Iraq in the aftermath of war, and that of the competences of the United Nations, which must progressively take over the leadership in this area in order to be able to permanently stabilise the region.
It is for this reason that I am pushing for the rejection of those amendments that seek to re-ignite the disputes between us from the time before the war in Iraq.
We owe it to the people there to look to the future rather than perpetuating old disputes, and so I would recommend that you reject all the amendments, with the exception of Mr Sakellariou's on the International Court of Justice, which I recommend that we adopt.
If you do, you will achieve a great majority in this House, enabling the European Union to be in a stronger position when it goes to the donors' conference and us to take on a great deal of responsibility in a constructive way.
Mr Korakas has asked to speak on a point of order.
Mr President, I wish to protest about Mr Brok's intervention.
He referred to the substance.
There is no further debate today.
What he said confirms precisely our position: that an attempt is being made to legalise the intervention in Iraq and the occupation and we are radically against any such development ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Korakas, I do not intend to reopen a debate.
Mr President, the oral amendment to Article 4(3) is as follows: 'The technical contribution shall be assessed by consideration of the difference between all of the technical features of the patent claim and the state of the art, irrespective of whether or not such features are accompanied by non-technical features.'
This amendment merges my original Amendments 110 and 16.
Mr President, the time has come for us to vote on the report by our fellow Members Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos.
I think it is important that we are able to do so.
I would just like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Villiers. She is to be commended not simply for her report on the directive on investment services but in particular for her work as a Member working behind the scenes, as it were.
The debate on her report closed yesterday evening.
My group attaches great importance to the coherence of our work. In the interests of coherence we should have voted on that report now.
As things stand, Parliament will not vote on the report until tomorrow, because the British Liberal Democrats are meeting in Brighton today. It so happens that the French Socialists will be in Limoges tomorrow.
Mrs BerÃšs, as you know, the decision is taken by the Conference of Presidents.
Report (A5-0299/2003) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the European Parliament's opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) [11047/2003 - C5-0340/2003 - 2003/0902(CNS)]
Mr President, I have presented this amendment having heard the Italian Presidency of the Council and the report it has produced on the situation relating to Parliament's representation in the Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe that we cannot strongly welcome something we have not been offered, and therefore my proposal is that the following should be included: 'Expresses its concern and discontent with the lack of compliance by the Council with the assurances expressed by the Italian Presidency to Parliament'.
The rest would stay the same.
I would point out that the President-in-Office of the Council has indicated his agreement with this amendment, because it may help him at the Council.
Mr President, the Council has not made any agreement and, since it has not made any agreement, it is not possible to express concern over a non-existent agreement.
What happened in the meeting was that the decision was left to the Heads of State or Government.
My group is therefore opposed to this oral amendment and to a vote on it, because we believe that it responds to a political aim which we do not share.
If it is necessary for twelve of us to rise, moreover, twelve of us will rise.
I would ask twelve Members to rise.
- (FR) This text resorts to a jumble of meaningless phrases in an attempt to paper over the differences between the medium-sized powers in the European Union. One of these powers backed the United States to the hilt by taking part in the invasion of Iraq, whilst the others adopted a more prudent approach.
It is true that the discrepancies between the policies of both sides are now diminishing.
Given the present difficulties of the occupation, the United States needs more forces on the ground. Member States are becoming more favourably disposed to supplying such forces on condition that this is done under the aegis of the United Nations.
For our part, we are opposed to supporting an aggressive, imperialist war, even after the event. Likewise, we refuse to support the occupation even if it were under the auspices of the United Nations.
Not a single person from the European Union should leave their homeland to promote the interests of the great imperialist powers in Iraq!
Down with the imperialist war and occupation!
I count myself amongst those who regret that the resolution does not refer to the causes and reasons of the present crisis in Iraq for so-called politicking reasons. Nevertheless, I cannot withhold my broad support for the proposals contained in the resolution tabled with a view to resolving this crisis.
While I support the proposals, this does not mean that I support the Anglo-American war. Quite the opposite is the case!
The proposals advocate giving the United Nations a significant and central role in ensuring that a democratic Iraq regains its independence at the earliest opportunity.
This is why I support the majority of these proposals!
. (PT) It beggars belief that the European Parliament should, in its first statement following the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies, adopt a recommendation which, due to the rejection of an amendment tabled by my group, fails to recall - to paraphrase our amendment - that the present unstable situation, which represents a threat to the Iraqi people and the international community, is a consequence of the unjust, illegitimate and illegal attack launched by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries on 20 March 2003.
It is unacceptable for the European Parliament to refuse, as a result of the rejection of one of our amendments, to call - and I paraphrase again - for the restitution of international law, with the immediate withdrawal of occupying foreign troops and the assumption by the United Nations of its responsibilities under the UN Charter, with a view to putting power in the hands of truly representative, legitimate and democratic institutions without delay, by holding elections to ensure that the Iraqi people regains its sovereignty.
It is worth mentioning, by way of criticism, that the recommendation welcomes what it perceives as 'the change of attitude of the Bush administration towards the more active role of the International Community', when the real issue is, above all, dividing the costs of the occupation and the Iraqi people's resistance to that occupation.
That is why we voted against the recommendation.
. British Labour MEPs are pleased to have voted in favour of this resolution, which marks a genuine effort on all sides to build consensus within this European Parliament around the very difficult issue of Iraq.
In the spirit of seeking maximum support for European and international cooperation for the reconstruction of Iraq, its return to peace and stability and for the full observance of human rights and democracy for its people, we have not sought to amend the wording which commanded all-party support in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Nevertheless, vital as the role of the United Nations is and must remain, it is impossible at this stage to lay out a precise timetable for a transfer of sovereignty, or indeed to identify the precise nature of a Trust Fund in advance of the forthcoming donors' conference.
The principles, however, are ones on which we are all agreed.
In terms of the resolution's reference to an ad hoc international tribunal, we should also recognise the need for Iraq to develop its own reformed judicial system within which perpetrators of crimes could be tried, and which could itself refer cases to the International Criminal Court.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the recommendation to the Council on Iraq because, while it does not say a word about the invasion and occupation, it welcomes the efforts by the Bush administration to get out of the impasse and condemns the resistance of the Iraqi people, which it qualifies as terrorism.
It proposes making the Iraqi people a ward of the international community until it is old enough for democracy.
Two elements in particular are typical of this opinion:
paragraph 1.8 talks of the need to set up a multinational military force and a police force mandated by the United Nations, in cooperation with ????, on the basis of a 'political timetable', thereby repeating the 'Bosnia-Herzegovina' argument (six-month timetable, now ten years old);
Mr Brok called for and succeeded in securing a vote against all amendments calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces, the assumption by the UN of its responsibilities, the restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and the amendments which referred to the illegality of the invasion of Iraq and the lack of proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction.
The fact that only the members of the European United Left (45) voted in favour of these amendments, while 420 voted against and 68 abstained, demonstrates just how hypocritical they all are; while they are making a great show of fighting for the rights of the Iraqi people, they bless its occupation, oppression and plundering in practice.
We leave them to the judgment of our peoples.
Mr President, the European Parliament today has voted on legislation that will slow down the rate of technological advance, narrow consumer choice, increase the price of software and destroy the free and open-source software industry in Europe.
Of course I have voted against it.
We do not want to see a situation where a limitless patent system can be abused by large operatives to stifle technical competition or, even worse, prevent the publication of information.
US experience tells us that software patents do not encourage innovation and R&D but, in fact, weaken the market and suffocate small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as those starting out in the market.
Software is not an invention and is already protected under copyright law, just like books, films and music.
Changing this to patenting is a recipe for handing the software industry over to lawyers instead of the creative people who have led the boom in technology.
I welcome the fact that the directive as proposed was improved, but it is still not good enough and I hope that it will not destroy the software industry in Europe as we know it.
Mr President, I particularly want to thank Mrs McCarthy for her work on this difficult report.
I was shocked to hear some of the comments that were made about her personally and I in no way subscribe to them.
However, in the end I voted against the report.
My main reason for doing so was because of the legal uncertainty which is created by the imposition of a patent on software development, particularly when we can see the rapid advance of technology and the new small and medium sized enterprises that are starting up to create software packages specific to certain sectors of industry or business, or merely to create a new game for them to play themselves.
All of this could now be prevented because a patent could be placed on the menu option, on the one-click option or in numerous other areas of operation.
As Mrs Ahern said, some improvements have been made, but the reality is that we have to take into account the experience in the United States which has created multi-million and multi-billion dollar legal suits by large companies against small companies, which have stifled innovation, prevented new invention and prevented job creation.
Mr President, I, too, voted against this draft directive, which I find bitterly disappointing.
It is lamentable that Parliament has bowed to pressure from the USA and, above all, pressure exerted by the major software companies.
This is a great disappointment, especially for consumers.
It is they who will have to pick up the tab for this decision; for them, it will mean higher prices and less diversity in products, reducing their freedom of choice.
Software patents stand in the way of a growing, dynamic and diverse European software industry.
It is primarily consumers and software users who feel their effects.
They increase dependence on software giants, such as Microsoft, which have secured many trivial patents, and quite manifestly curtail freedom of choice, but this is also a grave blow for the development of software in Europe, which is being hampered by the monopolies that are establishing themselves.
Not only does this go counter to the interests of consumers, but it also hampers innovation, instead of encouraging competition and diversity in the software market.
It is also a real defeat for Europe as a location for business, even though its advocates see it as the very opposite.
That will become apparent in the future, and this decision does the utmost damage to the prospect of an open, free and sustainable knowledge-based society.
Mr President, my colleagues and I expressed our views on all the amendments seeking to improve the text. We were pleased to note a number of improvements but deeply regretted that a number of the proposed amendments did not succeed.
This has strengthened our belief that the directive, far from encouraging dynamism and creativity, is giving in to the desire for bureaucracy to regulate inventiveness itself.
It has not escaped our attention that this departure favours big financial and industrial groups.
This is why we eventually voted against the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the EU had to respond to the enormous increase in the number of patent applications in this area is not a matter of doubt, nor is there any doubt about the fact that these must not be allowed to be detrimental to the interests of small software companies.
What the Commission is proposing, however, encourages the domination of the software market by monopolies, as small software companies cannot afford disputes about patent rights.
Greater protection for patents would enhance the large service providers' position of strength in the market and would consequently mean that software developers would have to pay fees, in other words, royalties, for a wide variety of standard functions.
It is the consumer who will end up paying the bill.
The attempt to create greater legal certainty by means of this directive is to be welcomed, but, in this instance, it misses the mark.
On the one hand, there is no single definition of the 'technical contribution' required for a patent to be granted, and, on the other, it blurs the boundaries between the end product - which can be patented - and the software itself, which cannot.
The EU needs patent law that not only encourages innovation, but also gives better protection to inventors who lack financial clout.
This proposal from the Commission guarantees neither of these things, and that is why we have voted against it.
The report and the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions creates an asphyxiating environment for the creative skills of scientists and small software firms and will ultimately only work in favour of the giant enterprises which have thousands of patents and huge legal departments to throttle small companies and, more importantly, the free innovative environment.
The European Union will thus follow the path of support for the behemoths taken by the USA.
Patents should have nothing to do with algorithms or business methods.
This should have been made clear and the only restriction should be on technical/material structures.
Despite the improvements made by plenary, the lack of transparency remains, which is why I voted against.
The directive we are examining today allows every type of software to be patented.
The aim is obvious: to strengthen and consolidate the economic/political centres of control and the monopoly of information and information processing by the multinational companies active in the software centre.
The result is easy to foresee: small and medium-sized enterprises and independent programmers will be throttled.
Adopting it signals the de jure acceptance of the demands of the widespread 'patent industry' in the USA, will discourage research and development and will result in a huge waste of resources on legal protection proceedings which could have been invested in technological innovation.
The procedure for safeguarding software patents will have painful consequences for consumers/end users, who will be called on to pay the increased profits of the monopolies while, at the same time, their options will be limited, as will the facility to use improved software.
It is for these reasons that we members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the directive and the corresponding report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and we stand by those demanding free and open software.
In its short justification, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport notes that a 'patent gives its owner the right to prevent others from commercially using his invention'. Everyone knows, however, that this right is rarely used by the inventor his or herself.
Rather, it is often used by big companies.
Such companies have the financial means to buy patents and build up vast portfolios. This allows them to market some of their inventions whilst blocking the development of others.
Patents are of very little or no use to inventors.
On the other hand, they provide extra means for big industrial and commercial groups.
They protect commercial monopoly instead of intellectual property.
As we do not support patents in general, not just those on information technology, we voted against the proposal contained in the McCarthy report.
- (FR) The gravity of the European Commission's plans in this field have been made all too clear by the large mobilisation of information technology users, inventors and innovators.
Some progress has certainly been made and this has been turned into amendments but Mr Bolkestein's stubbornness and the weight of the lobbies promoting the interests of huge economic empires make the final result too uncertain and potentially dangerous.
This is why I voted against the directive.
. (NL) The Vlaams Blok ('Flemish Block') opposes the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, it having been found in practice that software patents stifle the innovation capacity of small and medium-size enterprises in the IT industry.
All too frequently, these patents are used improperly by (invariably American) computer giants with large in-house legal departments to take 'offenders' to court.
These practices are crippling to free competition, since many patents relate to software which de facto belongs to the public domain.
Applying for, and obtaining, patents is an expensive business.
New and creative IT businesses in Europe are right not to see the legal aspects that are involved as part of their core business.
Europe is queering its own pitch by adopting this report.
- (PT) It is regrettable that the European Parliament did not approve our proposal to reject this proposal for a directive, which prepares the ground for the patentability of computer programs, despite the fact that very many of the proposals for amendments to this directive were adopted.
The European Parliament has thus done innovation and technological development a disservice.
In today's world, it seems that anything can be marketed. Anything can become private property and be used for somebody's personal gain.
There are those who would like marketing to embrace not only production but also knowledge and life itself.
We live in a time when discoveries - a common heritage for all of us - are being confused with inventions.
This directive prepares the ground for the patentability of human knowledge, which we oppose.
Although a few positive proposals were also approved at the final vote, most of our own proposals were rejected, which gives us cause for regret.
We will continue to fight this proposal for a directive and the large multinational interests it aims to please.
- (FR) After a deadlock sustained by the mobilisation of the public against software patenting, Parliament declared itself in favour of the report.
I voted against the directive.
This project is useless; there is no justification for it because no one asked for it, apart from the multinationals, who want to hold on to their monopoly!
Under the pretext of protecting 'invention', patents will eradicate innovation.
By voting against this project we are refusing to support such manipulative behaviour.
This is because this plan, even if amended significantly by Parliament, is still dangerous.
Its very name: patentability of computer-implemented inventions, allows software to be patented.
If such legislation had existed at the time of Mozart or Beethoven, authorising the patenting of musical works, then the whole of our world heritage would have been undermined at its very roots.
The system of copyright currently covering software should continue to be enforced because this alone guarantees that authors remain justly and permanently rewarded.
Once again the European Parliament has failed to listen to the voice of reason and has accepted the principle of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.
The majority bloc of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, although weakened by the pertinence of the arguments put forward by those who oppose this measure, once again yielded to the demands of major corporations to take the commercialisation of human activity ever further.
Indeed, by accepting the principle of patents in this field, when computer-implemented inventions are already protected by copyright, multinationals are in effect given the power to seal off this sector.
They alone would have the financial power to lead a type of continuous legal guerrilla war, with a view to monopolising these inventions to make them pay a high price or to block them, depending on what is in their interests.
Several amendments to the Mc Carthy report limiting the extent of this attack have, I am pleased to say, been adopted.
The fact remains that the final wording of the resolution remained profoundly dangerous and we voted against it.
After much consideration and reflection on the arguments put forward by the various businesses, software producers etc., on the issue of this directive, the aim of which is to allow computer-implemented inventions to be patented, I have come to the conclusion that, if clear definitions and precise explanations were introduced into the directive with regard to some questionable and ambiguous terms to avoid erroneous interpretations, then I could subscribe to it.
Indeed, I believe that it is essential that we set about clearly determining the scope of the directive by precisely defining pure software and inventions which, to be executable, must be computer-implemented.
The patentability of software is absurd in so far as it would lead to the formation of a monopoly of large software companies detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in this field, which, more often that not, play a key role in developing new technologies.
Software is a precious tool that must continue to be accessible to all so that we have every chance of achieving the Lisbon objective by 2010, that is, for the European Union to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
- (ES) Although the amendments approved have improved the content of the McCarthy report, the legislation represents a step backwards for the development of innovation, the spread of knowledge and free competition, all of which are essential to the good functioning and stimulation of the European software industry.
Furthermore, we believe that the legislative proposal benefits the large multinational corporations (in particular the United States ones, which have continued to apply pressure in order to introduce their abusive system of patents into Europe) and represents a retrograde step for independent workers and small companies, as well as an obstacle for free software.
Once again, the will of more than 200 000 people (including the majority of experts in the field and consumers) is being ignored, and we can see that economic interest is taking precedence over support for the free use of knowledge and information.
Since I am from a country, Catalonia, whose productive fabric depends on independent workers and small- and medium-sized businesses, I can only express my regret at the final result of the vote.
. As rapporteur, I supported the thrust of amendments tabled with a view to getting a clearer definition of what is patentable and limits to ensure that pure software is not patentable.
It remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved.
We await a common position from Council and Commission.
This will be difficult to achieve as Parliament's amendments will inevitably be seen to go well beyond the legal situation as regards the patenting of computer-implemented inventions and may indeed put us at odds with our obligations under TRIPs.
I continue to express my concerns that this EU directive should not undermine the competitiveness and innovation of our brightest and best companies in Europe, in particular by putting EU business and industry at a disadvantage in the global marketplace.
It would be folly if our companies as a result of Parliament's amendments could not protect their innovation, enforce patents or gain a return on their R&D investment.
It would be contrary to our economic interests if we allowed the US and Japan to dominate markets as a result of their patent protection, while Europe's companies are squeezed out.
.
(NL) In America, large computer companies have been trying for years to protect their software inventions against free use by individual users and small companies.
They build in technical restrictions, tie buyers to restricting contracts, try to collect enormous damages and demand legal protection by the authorities.
It is young, resourceful users in particular who are faced with ever more restrictions and run the risk of ending up in prison.
In Europe too, such companies are trying more effective ways of protecting their monopoly against the public.
In departing from Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, according to which software is subject to copyright rather than to patenting, the European Patent Bureau in Munich is trying to extend its remit along the lines of the American system.
It has managed to do this by granting 30 000 patents to date.
The European Commission and part of this Parliament want to justify this extended remit with the argument that nothing actually changes in comparison to the present situation.
This course of action is meeting with much opposition, and with good reason, from those who are hindered in their inventions, their education, their work or their leisure activities.
I support this opposition to the commercial interests of large monopolies and have enjoyed working on counter arguments prior to this vote.
- (FR) Mr Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I voted against the directive on computer-implemented inventions, which remains a confused text, opening the door to the patentability of software.
I am disappointed that the amendment to reject the directive tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was not adopted: when a directive is badly drafted, I think that the Commission has a duty to redraft it.
Nevertheless, I am delighted that there was excellent cooperation with other political groups, allowing us to improve the text, in particular in Article 2.
In recent months, I have been approached by several researchers who are afraid that the software patent is putting the brakes on innovation in the European Union.
At a time when we are doing everything we can to create a European area of research, it is absurd to adopt legislation that is condemned by the most eminent members of the EU's scientific community, who sent a petition to me.
Furthermore, software patents endanger free software, which is used in a number of scientific and industrial applications such as the European satellites in the Galileo system.
Only a clear text guaranteeing the protection of computer programs by copyright could re-establish legal clarity in this field.
- (PT) During the debate in plenary, my colleague Mr Mussa said words to the effect that intelligence cannot be patented.
I entirely agree with this principle, since we cannot ignore the fact that any piece of software is the product of a mental process enabling a human being to command an unintelligent machine to perform a series of instructions.
What is at issue, therefore, is a product of the human mind. To patent it would be to risk diminishing our capacity for research and innovation, in view of the number of patents already filed, particularly by large United States corporations.
These corporations would thus come to enjoy a sort of 'monopoly on intelligence'.
Although this is a highly complex area in technical terms, we are sensitive to the economic and political consequences of the proposal, which will hit small- and medium-sized software companies hardest.
We voted against it, therefore, even though some amendments pointing in the right direction were adopted.
. (PT) A patent is a tool designed to protect intelligence and encourage creativity by legally protecting a creation, in the strict sense of the word.
Those who legislate in this area should do so with that principle in mind.
In other words, patents should not be used to do exactly the opposite.
Intelligence itself cannot be patented, nor can patents be used to stifle creativity, giving rise, in extreme cases, to 'crimes of intelligence' or 'crimes of free creation'.
A patent must not be reduced to the status of a trophy for whoever gets to the competent authority first with an application for a particular patent. Rather, it should be a reward reserved for those who really have created something new, and an incentive to create more.
In contravention of the provisions of the European Patent Convention, this proposal for a directive allows for the patentability of ideas implemented by software programs to be authorised.
That goes much further than the safeguards already provided by copyright, and would lead to the stagnation of 'intelligences' and the disastrous establishment of an obstacle to technological development per se, as well as to economic and social development.
The approval in plenary of a few amendments, some of which were proposed by me, enhanced the text a little, but not enough to gain my support.
That is why I voted against it.
Furthermore, I would rather the proposal had been rejected and the process started all over again on the basis of a fresh report, as I also proposed.
- (FR) I abstained in the vote on the McCarthy report because the arguments of the rapporteur and the European Commission in favour of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions are not compelling.
I personally am convinced that patents in the software sector are the weapons that companies have long dreamt of for their army of lawyers to make them capable of legal blackmail.
The sole aim of this all-out investment in patents is to weaken and even to eradicate all competition.
As a Liberal, I cannot accept this commercial approach based on monopolies, which aims in time, to kill off the creative spirit of young computer scientists and the innovation brought to the sector by producers and users of free software.
This is why I voted in favour of all the amendments making it possible to give this report a human face; those that, for example, seek to limit the scope of patentable software.
Finally, I am glad that a clear signal has been given to the European Patent Office in Munich.
The European Parliament calls on this body to act transparently and responsibly and sending this signal is the least we can do for this organisation which, in violating the European Patents Convention of 1973, authorised more than 30 000 patents to be granted for computer programs.
- (SV) The currently applicable European Patent Convention is interpreted differently from one Member State to another.
What is clear is that it is seen as legally insecure and as producing negative effects on the internal market.
That is why we believe there is a need for an EU directive.
The proposal for a new directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions has given rise to a lot of debate.
We concur with the huge criticism that has been directed against making the concept of the patent too wide, something that would be downright damaging and mean that the wealth of invention would be reduced.
Consequently, we have voted in favour of amendments aimed at narrowing down the concept of the patent.
In the final vote, we voted in favour.
- (FR) Our sub-group sets great store by consumer protection and we will support the rapporteur's compromise, but we will abstain on the final resolution because of budgetary considerations.
Programming has indeed been planned until 2007 but we all know that the financial perspectives will be revised in 2006.
There is, therefore, no guarantee of continuity.
I return to the wisdom of the Committee on Budgets (COBU), which states that 'the amount scheduled for the year 2007 is subject to approval by the Budgetary Authority for the Financial Perspective beyond 2006.'
I am equally concerned about the operational costs.
EUR 32 million are earmarked for human resources, whilst the operational envelope amounts to EUR 72 million.
That is a terrible cost-benefit ratio.
Let us not forget that consumer organisations, which exist in all Member States, are an effective opposition force.
What is the use of implementing European financing at such a high cost price?
As regards the cofinancing of projects, I am in favour of keeping a maximum ceiling of 70% and I am against 75%.
As regards financial support for European consumer organisations, a 50% threshold is much too high.
We need to avoid these organisations and the Commission becoming dependent on one another, thereby preventing these organisations from operating independently and from acting without constraint.
I abstained on the final resolution for all of these reasons.
. (PT) This proposal for a decision aims to safeguard the financing of Community actions in support of consumer policy for the years 2004-2007, in line with the objectives and actions laid down in the European Consumer Policy Strategy, adopted in 2003.
It aims, therefore, to support organisations and bodies working to promote consumer interests at Community or national level. EUR 72 million have been allocated to this end.
While I feel that the financial package should be more generous, I support this initiative, which was unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
It endorses the following objectives: a high level of consumer protection; effective enforcement of consumer protection rules; greater involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies; and integration of consumer protection objectives into all other Community policy areas.
I believe, nevertheless, that the delivery of this support should be expeditious, not encumbered by bureaucracy, and that direct assistance to national consumer organisations, including cooperatives, should not be excluded.
A clearer distinction should also be drawn between organisations genuinely working to promote consumer interests and those which are merely the mouthpieces of industrial lobbies.
. (PT) We could only vote in favour of this report, given that what is at stake is financing a high common level of consumer protection, effective enforcement of consumer protection rules, and the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies, even though this report looks no further than questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products, protecting the economic interests of consumers, and promoting consumer organisations at European level, as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies relevant to their interests.
It is pleasing to note that the total budget proposed for this period has risen to EUR 72 million in operational credits, or EUR 18 million per year, while the total for human resources and other administrative costs has risen to EUR 32 million, or EUR 8 million per year.
. (PT) I voted in favour of this report, because the aim of the financial framework on the table (for 2002-2007) is to pursue a consumer protection policy, particularly by financing consumer information projects.
This tool will be important for achieving the EU's three political objectives, set by the European Commission's 2002 communication (the Consumer Policy Strategy for 2002-2006). These objectives are to strive for a high common level of consumer protection and effective enforcement of consumer protection rules, and to ensure that consumer organisations are involved in EU policies.
Although the sums that have been announced do not encourage major fundamental changes - especially in terms of major projects - I felt that things were moving in the right direction, especially as regards questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products, protecting the economic interests of consumers, and promoting consumer organisations at European level, as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies which are relevant to their interests.
We will nurture the active and inclusive citizenship we desire only if citizens have at their disposal the means of promoting their interests, common or individual, and enhancing the protection of those interests effectively through concerted efforts at European, national and regional levels.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Jonckheer report, as we now need to make it possible to at last give favourable tax treatment to non-food crops.
We should welcome the European Union's declaration that the increased use of renewable sources of energy is one of its objectives and the Commission's definition of binding objectives and timetables in its 'Renewable Energies' White Paper.
The right conditions and instruments are needed, though, if these objectives are to be achieved.
If the European Union wants to discharge its obligations under international law to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the Kyoto commitments, this directive on the taxation of energy can be only one of many steps that will end up taking us in the right direction.
Not only is the use of renewable energy sources CO2-neutral, but it also makes for added value in the regions and creates new and modern jobs in rural areas.
- (FR) In the name of so-called environmental principles set up as dogmas which are given priority over the real situation in society, when talking about taxing energy products and electricity, this report does not specify which social category is affected by this taxation.
We do not see any disadvantages to increasing taxes for large industrial groups, who are the main polluters.
We are, however, opposed to the idea of increasing taxation on diesel consumption for individuals.
This indirect tax essentially affects the working classes, who are forced to use private, due to a lack of suitable public transport.
Even more so, it is unacceptable to tax fuel on electricity for domestic use.
This is the sense that we want to convey in voting against the entire report.
. (PT) The Commission has wanted to create a Community framework for the taxation of energy products for some time.
This Council compromise, therefore, constitutes a significant step in that direction, since it has brought agreement on a comprehensive energy tax directive, encompassing all forms of energy.
The rapporteur, however, has some piercing criticisms of the minimum tax rates agreed, the exemptions and the tax reductions provided for.
We have grave reservations about this directive.
We favour lightening the tax burden on workers, but the solution does not involve so-called 'environmental taxation' of energy or pollution.
The solution involves finding a new balance of taxation between workers and capital.
What is more, this type of indirect taxation is levied, when all is said and done, on the final consumers (users).
It is not sensitive to levels of income and penalises lower-income households.
The effects of steep tax increases on the productive fabric, especially in the least-favoured regions, should also be assessed.
The underlying 'polluter pays' principle, furthermore, engenders serious reservations, as it permits those with economic clout to generate pollution. That is clear in the liberal philosophy behind emissions trading.
The bottom line is that we should not pollute at all.
The battle to protect the environment and stop environmental dumping must be fought with appropriate legislation and effective enforcement. This requires a high degree of state intervention and investment.
.
(DE) Tax issues are by their nature very thorny, something attributable, as much as to anything else, to the great differences between one country's system and another's; for example, the Scandinavian states, in particular, use high levels of excise duty to fund their extremely generous social security systems.
Our practice is to fund pensions - to take one example - using employers' and employees' contributions, albeit on a participatory basis.
In the EU, we agreed, at the beginning of the 1990s, to lay down only minimum rates and to retain unanimity in the Council on matters relating to this.
Despite the issue's sensitivity, efforts were made, when this proposal was discussed, to abolish the unanimity principle with effect from 2010.
Decisions as important as that are taken while revising the Treaties or the Constitutional Treaty and not when consulting Parliament on a draft directive.
Turning to the taxation of fuel, harmonised minimum rates for Luxembourg (and other Member States) always go hand in hand with an increase in tax, and thus, in fact, with an increase in prices.
Although Luxembourg's specific situation meant that it was allowed a temporary derogation, this is no reason to bring forward from 2010 to 2008 the second phase for the application of the minimum rates.
I am sure that the thinking behind the rapporteur's amendment was that it would benefit the environment if higher fuel prices were to deter consumers from using their own cars.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure.)
. (PT) The European Parliament took an important step towards greening European Union energy taxation today, by giving the green light to the directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity.
I hope the Council's reaction will now be equally constructive, and that there will not be a repeat of the veto which precluded any revision of this very same piece of legislation in 1997.
One of the most important objectives of any sustainable development policy is to internalise environmental externalities into the economy.
In other words, the price of goods must reflect their real environmental cost.
The message sent by the price is essential in order to induce both producers and consumers to realign their choices towards sustainability.
That situation is, unfortunately, still a long way off, which is why buying green is still a luxury and selling green is not yet sufficiently profitable.
I welcome the rapporteur's advocacy of more ambitious and binding rules, and in particular of lowering taxes on goods produced using renewable energy sources while raising taxes on fossil fuels for use in transport.
. (PT) I voted in favour of this report, since I feel it is necessary to face up to climate change and the growing threats to the environment, using taxation as an additional tool to that end.
Despite the rapporteur's reservations about the Council's draft, which, in his view, fell short of expectations, I believe that this draft represents the broadest possible consensus within the Council, bearing in mind that caution and the ability to compromise are advisable when approaching this issue.
My vote, then, is a response to the legislative body of the report, for I do not entirely share the rapporteur's concerns, which are detailed in the explanatory statement.
We differ in particular on doing away with the unanimity requirement in these matters and on tightening Community requirements relating to the taxation of products.
Indeed, although there must obviously be greater coordination between Member States in order to meet the growing environmental challenges, the keynote should be the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and not the imposition of any artificial consensus.
. The EPLP voted against amendments concerning taxation changes and abstained on the final vote, consistent with its attitude on taxation.
. (PT) The fishing agreement with the Government of Mauritius expired on 2 December 2002.
The parties had agreed to begin renegotiating the protocol annexed to the agreement.
These negotiations, however, were postponed in view of the fact that the Government of Mauritius is currently reviewing the state of its salt-water fish stocks.
The parties, therefore, proposed that the current protocol be extended for one year, retaining the fishing opportunities and distribution between the Member States.
This means that Portugal's eight longliners will continue to enjoy fishing opportunities.
The extension is thus essential and for that reason I support it, although I regret the delay in referring this protocol to Parliament for consideration.
The crux of the matter, however, is creating, as quickly as possible, the right conditions for concluding a new multiannual agreement.
My vote in favour does not, however, mean that I agree with all the rapporteur's views.
Mr President, the European Parliament has just adopted the Andersson report on adequate and sustainable pensions.
One of the paragraphs it adopted was paragraph 16, in which the European Parliament calls for the increase in the effective retirement age to be implemented together with incentives - and not, I repeat, not - with disincentives such as drastic reductions in pension values
The European Parliament is thus going in the opposite direction from the Italian Government, which presented a proposal which means that, from 2008, retirement pensions will be put back five years with disincentives - and what disincentives: pensions will be completely cancelled for five years.
This will bring EUR 25 billion to the state coffers in 2013, whilst there will be 2 million fewer jobs for young people and the unemployed.
Mr President, I did not vote for this report because I believe that this issue should be the competence of national states and legislation without interference from Brussels.
. (PT) Ageing populations and ever-lower levels of employment among older people are threatening the sustainability of pension schemes.
We are faced with an urgent need to reform social protection systems.
The Member States must cooperate on pensions by applying the open method of coordination, so that differences of interpretation arising from bilateral agreements can be reduced.
Studies carried out on developments in pension schemes show that the balance between economic and social concerns is the key to success, since macroeconomic, social and employment policies are connected.
The European Employment Strategy and the European Social Fund have important contributions to make in promoting the continued employment and hiring of older workers.
The Member States should adopt measures to discourage early retirement and - together with companies, workers and social partners - encourage active ageing.
Lastly, the Member States must eliminate from their pension systems any forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender and any shortfalls in women's pensions, which are still lower then men's.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report.
- (FR) The Andersson report takes the form of a resolution commenting on the Joint Report by the Commission and the Council on 'adequate and sustainable' pensions.
It tries to reconcile two disparate elements, insisting on the compatibility of the 'financial dimension' and 'social and welfare aspects'.
The report contains a number of apt remarks, in particular, on the situation of women.
These good intentions soon, however, become meaningless.
The rapporteur seems, in fact, to feel obliged to make emphatic references to the European employment strategy, which is a very bad framework to use in devising the changes to revenue distribution that must accompany demographic change.
The text sees the reforms under way in many Member States as positive without mentioning that they have inspired massive public opposition amongst the communities affected.
Let us concede that with some trepidation the report 'supports the aim?of increasing the effective retirement age'.
We reject this objective, all the more so because it is the only one which is specifically advanced, on the basis of which all future 'reforms' should be organised.
We will challenge these reforms for millions of employees and we will oppose a simple measure, an increase in employer contributions.
This is why we voted against this report.
.
(DE) I am especially glad that this report, which, for the first time, subjects the EU Member States' commitment to the adoption of a common approach to the future of pensions policy to detailed and systematic scrutiny, addresses the problems of women in the way that I successfully insisted on in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
We clearly have to ensure that all the Member States banish from their pensions systems discrimination on the grounds of gender.
They ought to have done so ever since the directives in the 1970s on equal treatment for women and men in social security matters.
With variations from one country to another, women receive between 16% and 45% less in their pensions than do men.
In the case of those women retiring now, that results from, among other things, the fact that they, in their younger days, were, quite legally, entitled only to between 80% and 90% of the wages paid to men with the same qualifications.
This discrimination lives on, in that women suffer from it to the end of their lives.
Just as I had suggested, the report also makes reference to the problem of social protection for divorced women.
As long ago as 1993, Parliament had adopted, on my initiative, a report on the pension entitlements of women who were divorced or living separately from their partners.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure.)
. (NL) The establishment of pension systems used to be considered as a step towards a civilised society.
Together, we provided for our future, for security at a stage in life when people are no longer productive.
These days, the opinion is peddled that pension commitments are a burden on society whereby the elderly exploit the younger generations.
This is not only a result of the changing population pyramid which is becoming much narrower than before, because there are fewer younger people at the bottom and more elderly at the top.
It also has to do with short-term thinking, with the encouragement of individual egocentricity and with the advent of individual pension schemes.
Often, young people do not realise that they will live much beyond their productivity peak.
Also, they often do not realise that people suffer exhaustion faster because work has increasingly become a form of top-class sport.
So much productivity is being required from people that many are physically or mentally burnt out long before they reach the pensionable age.
In many cases, employers do not want to employ people over the age of 55.
However, people who are older than 55 are often very useful in voluntary work, in an advisory role or as childminders.
Given these circumstances, it is more obvious to lower, rather than increase, the pensionable age.
To refuse a pension to people who can no longer cope with the pressure at work creates problems that cannot be solved.
. (PT) The Commission communication on adequate and sustainable pensions analysed the first National Strategy Reports presented by the Member States in the field of pensions.
The Commission's analysis covers the adequacy of pension systems, their financial sustainability and the need for modernisation.
It goes without saying that I welcome the rapporteur's conclusion that the Member States have already started their reform processes, and that a number of them have put major reforms into practice.
This, I am happy to say, is the case in Portugal.
There is also a clear awareness of the need for further reforms in order to safeguard the long-term sustainability of pension systems, which is linked to sound public finances.
I feel that it is of the essence to eliminate from this debate any demagogic and stormy rhetoric styling itself as the 'champion of workers' rights'.
The unsustainability of many national pension systems is due to demographic change, and we may be sure that it will indubitably do serious and - unless something is done to stop it - irreparable harm to all retired workers, both now and in future.
Like the rapporteur, I welcome the close cooperation between Member States in this area.
Moreover, because I agree with most of his conclusions relating to three fundamental objectives - adequacy, financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems - I voted in favour of the report.
Mr President, as you know, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has voted basically in favour of the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report and the proposed European Constitution offered by the European Convention.
As I stated in the debate, however, the Catalan Members of Convergencia i UniÃ³ cannot accept this position and we have stated that we will abstain.
Having seen how the votes have unfolded, furthermore, we confirm with even more conviction our decision to abstain and to wait to establish our final position until the result of the draft European Constitution, which may be presented by the Intergovernmental Conference.
We regret in particular that the Group of the European Peoples' Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against our proposals to recognise and associate the regions with full legislative powers with the institutions of the Union, and also that the idea that the Ombudsmen of the parliaments of these regions with full legislative powers should be associated with the work of the European Ombudsman has been rejected.
I believe this is a mistake, since it leaves millions of citizens far from the reality which is closest to them.
This is the case for, amongst others, the stateless nations and the regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, and I believe it goes entirely against our stated aim of being closer to the citizens and building a Europe of the peoples.
Mr President, the way the voting went this morning reinforced our bitter feeling that the draft European Constitution flouts fundamental social desires and mounts a serious challenge to the European social model.
In particular, the precise, profound and dangerous threat hanging over public services was, I am sorry to say, confirmed by this House.
It was from then on impossible - not to mention other reasons such as the stubborn refusal to consider constitutional or legislative regions - to want, as the majority do, the Intergovernmental Conference not to modify the grave imbalance created in this way between the powerful and the weak.
This is why we voted against this report.
Mr President, the reason why I abstained is that I regret that our amendment relating to our Judaeo-Christian heritage was not adopted.
Not even a Marxist history teacher can deny that Europe's roots are both Christian and Jewish; without them Marx and Marxism would not have existed, and if Europe turns away from God, Christianity and Judaism, it is cutting itself off from its roots, only to be swamped by materialism and to collapse.
The second point I want to make in this connection is that it is an illusion to believe that this Treaty can be put under glass and can never again be amended.
Twenty-five governments are not going to meet together just to do nothing; they will work on the Treaty, and we hope that they will improve it.
It is to be hoped that they will include in the preamble reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots and also make a number of improvements in the institutional sphere, such as having one Commissioner per Member State, which I too regard as essential.
While we do not want the package to be completely unwrapped, there are some definite improvements that the governments should carry out in October.
Mr President, I did not vote for this report, despite being in favour of the text adopted by the Convention - which I took part in as an alternate - because the report has left out the reference to Europe's Christian roots.
Furthermore, there is an excessive tendency to restrict unanimity voting, which is one of the principles on which the European Union was first founded, even when it went under a different name.
I believe that unanimity voting is a bastion of the sovereignty of the States and protects the national interests that are so dear to the majority of Italian political groupings.
I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will confirm the substance of the Convention's work, despite the enraged attacks by President Prodi, who is doing everything he can to thwart it.
Mr President, the draft Constitution for Europe reminds me of a cappuccino: lots of good coffee, a political froth which is a little too thin and very bitter institutional chocolate.
As regards the coordination of economic and social policies, as regards foreign and defence policy, the political basis proposed is still flimsy.
The permanent president of the European Council will certainly be competing with and clash with the President of the Commission.
The division of the Commission into Commissioners that are accountable and non-voting and, therefore, unaccountable will weaken the Community dynamic and shatter the image of the Commission as a College with drive.
I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will draw its inspiration from the Commission recommendations and will improve on the Convention proposals.
This would mean that I could fully support a genuine European Constitution.
Awaiting something better, I abstained.
I would like to say once again to Mr Posselt that Europe not only has Judaeo-Christian roots but also Muslim and secular roots.
Thank you, Mr President; although I cannot spare you the inconvenience of my rising on a point of order, I intend to be brief.
I had no prior intention of holding my fellow Members up, and technology is normally very friendly to me.
Perhaps my slowness has fallen victim to its delightful speed.
In any case, my vote on Amendment No 21 to item 21a in the Gil-Robles report has not been recorded; I wanted to vote against it.
In asking for the floor, I actually want to refer back to yesterday.
I am delighted by the large number of roll-call votes today, which means that I am not going to be suspected of speaking in the interests of my own wallet.
That was not the case yesterday.
Today, though, it so happened that the exits from the Parliament building were once again blocked by demonstrators, so that vehicles on their way out had to use the way in, and those of us who wanted to get in - I managed it at twelve minutes to nine, having had to return briefly to my hotel - formed an enormous queue.
Following on from what was said yesterday, I would like again to urge the bureau to give some attention to the question of how MEPs are to be guaranteed adequate access when exercising their right to vote.
If the bureau is not willing to concern itself with this and inform MEPs as soon as possible, you will have to reckon with me constantly raising this issue in the plenary.
Professor Tsatsos has interesting, valuable, progressive views on the constitutional venture of the European Union.
If these views had passed into the report and the motion which he drafted together with his colleague Mr Gil-Robles, I believe I would have voted for it.
However, there prevails in the motion a concept of rounded corners, of compromise at any cost and of a 'realism' which is completely devoid of the democratic spirit of the articles written by the Greek rapporteur.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament is thus behind even the European Commission on top institutional issues, such as, for example, the number or the role of the commissioners or the presidency of the Council.
Thus, despite the useful ideas in the motion on issues such as the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, the development of social policy or referenda, I abstained from the final vote.
The European Parliament motion on the introduction of a 'Constitution for Europe' aims to give parliamentary cover to a large-scale operation to deceive the peoples.
It presents as a 'constitution' a text which not only fails to safeguard democratic achievements, but also, as we have repeatedly denounced, adds new links to the chains of the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice which big business has used to bind the workers in the Member States of the European Union.
The institutionalisation of the market economy, the further militarisation of the ?U, in cooperation with ????, which goes as far as preventive intervention on the pretext of terrorist threat, the redistribution of power for the benefit of the powerful and the even greater transfer of national sovereignty to the international centre are just some of the 'gifts' which the Intergovernmental Conference is to offer the monopolies.
The new venture is in total keeping with current policies, the undermining of workers' achievements, the successive terrorist laws and the interventions against peoples the world over.
Nor can we fail to note that the anti-democratic procedure followed when drafting the text is being promoted as a standard of democracy and transparency.
The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the introduction of a European constitution which strengthens the imperialist ?U. It trusts in the fight of the peoples, which will demolish the construction of the exploiters and radically change society.
- (SV) The draft European Convention and Parliament's opinion are generally sound.
We are especially satisfied with the fact that full employment, transparency, equality and sustainable development are now included as essential parts of the Convention's draft Constitution, something that is also welcomed in Parliament's opinion.
On a number of points, our view differs from that of the opinion.
It should be stated that EU law takes precedence over national law only in cases where the EU has legislative competence.
The European Parliament cannot be the only parliamentary body for the common foreign and security policy.
It must be possible for national parliaments too to be consulted.
We support the solidarity clause in the draft Constitution and are, in general, well disposed towards the draft Constitution's wordings on the foreign, security and defence policy.
We are, however, very doubtful about what the draft Constitution calls 'structured' and 'closer' cooperation, and we interpret the opinion's affirmation of 'structural cooperation' as referring to precisely that type of cooperation.
The draft Constitution's arrangements for the Commission are unsound.
Each Member State should have its own full Commissioner with voting rights.
We do not accept what the draft Constitution refers to as the passerelle clause. Nor do we accept treaty changes without unanimity and ratification.
The requirement of unanimity should not, as proposed in the opinion, be generally abolished in the cases of foreign and security policy and tax policy.
No exact time should be given for the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.
The IGC must be able to take the time required, irrespective of the Presidency.
- (SV) We have chosen to abstain from voting in the final vote on the aforementioned report.
Our position relates to the report and not to the outcome of the Convention in its entirety.
Certain parts of the report depart from the outcome of the Convention.
We support the work on designing a Constitution for Europe.
We have supported the Convention method which, in a unique way, has changed the method of drafting the EU's treaties.
We are in favour of a consolidated Treaty with a clearer distribution of competences.
It is good that decision-making is being improved and simplified and that people are being given greater opportunities to demand accountability.
We support the Convention's compromise despite the fact that, on a number of points, it departs from our own positions.
The EU must be limited and effective.
A Constitution should clearly mark the boundary between the public and the private, as well as the EU's decision-making competence in relation to the Member States.
It is the Member States that own the Treaty.
It is therefore obvious that Treaty changes must be approved unanimously and ratified by national parliaments.
That also means that we are doubtful about Article I-24.4 of the draft Constitution.
Like the Swedish Parliament, the Moderate Party opposes a permanent Presidency of the Council.
Nor can we support a development towards parliamentarianism at EU level.
We maintain that the EU should not be given any decision-making competence for social policy and taxes.
We are seeking a lively dialogue and see no intrinsic value in the Intergovernmental Conference's being concluded during the autumn.
- (FR) We voted against the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, which develops a strategy of 'encircling' the Intergovernmental Conference seeking to oblige national government representatives to more or less ratify the conclusions of the Convention.
Thus Parliament is showing that it is aware of the importance of the federalist breakthroughs achieved by the Convention, in particular, with the proposal for a European Constitution, which was not part of the initial mandate given by the Council, for whom it is an unexpected result that it does not want to compromise.
The Commission is not following the same strategy and is clearly trying to benefit from the IGC in order to make greater progress in terms of supranationality, for example, almost completely abolishing unanimity voting, methods of revision that make it possible to get around the opposition of some nations or stronger economic governance.
In any case, this is about moving towards a European super state, which the citizens do not want.
We hope that at the IGC the national governments will remember this and will not let their hands be tied by the European Institutions.
. On behalf of Mr Antoni Macierewicz:
It is necessary to underline the undemocratic procedure that led to adoption by the Convention of the draft Constitution.
Consensus means a universal agreement, but the text adopted did not enjoy such approval.
It is obvious that a document drawn up in violation of democratic principles can benefit neither the citizens, the nations, nor Europe itself.
The draft Constitution changes the fundamental principles through which the EU functions (right of veto, states' voting rights, equal representation in the European Commission etc.).
These principles played a significant role in the accession of new states to the Union.
Changing those principles is to present them with a fait accompli.
The draft Constitution aims at establishing a single European state, in which decisions would be taken over the heads of citizens and governments without reference to the referendum as a necessary method of expressing the will of citizens on such a fundamental issue.
Instead of imposing this anti-democratic Constitution on the peoples of Europe, we should work together so that in accordance with democratic principles we can build a true agreement between the nations and citizens of Europe.
- (FR) We voted against the draft European Constitution because, over and above the details of the wording, this Constitution is destined to become one of the legal foundations of laws designed to preserve the prevailing social order and to ensure the privileges of the wealthy.
Our rejection of the European Constitution in no way means that we are falling back on the French Constitution, which was also devised to protect the middle-classes and to sustain exploitation.
We advocate a completely unified Europe, from one end of the continent to the other, but one which is free from domination by the upper middle class and by the dictatorship of financial groups on the economy; we have no sympathy for anachronistic forms of sovereignty.
We abstained on the majority of the amendments because even the best intentioned ones still propose improving a Constitution that we reject.
We abstained on the amendments proposing to organise referenda on the draft Constitution.
Besides the fact that the questions are always skewed by the authorities asking them, we do not consider referenda to be a way for the citizens to express their will in a social structure in which the wealthy hold a monopoly over information tools and the media.
- (FR) My position today in no way prejudges my position on the future European Constitution.
In principle, I am in favour of a Constitution but I cannot, at this stage, join with those who state that the Intergovernmental Conference must not significantly change the draft prepared by the Convention.
Socially speaking and in terms of the citizens Mr Giscard d'Estaing's draft is manifestly insufficient.
Moreover, a Constitution should not set the economic and political structure of the EU in stone and thus deny the public any real opportunity to change society using its democratic vote.
I hope, therefore, that the IGC will make profound changes that will allow me to vote, when the time comes, in favour of the Constitution.
. (PT) I can only welcome the drafting of the Convention on the Future of Europe and its work, which represents an historic milestone in the process of European integration.
I welcome the concern to bring the Union closer to the citizens, enhance its democratic character and improve its decision-making capacity, in the context of enlargement.
I welcome the (admittedly rather unambitious) enhancement of the Union's role and its capacity for action on the world stage, bearing in mind the challenges of globalisation and growing interdependence.
I welcome the fact that, for the first time in the history of European integration, national parliaments will have an active role in drawing up European legislation.
The Union has acquired legal personality, and the longed-for disappearance of the pillar structure has become a reality.
I welcome the appeal contained in Mr Gil-Robles's excellent report that the citizens of Europe be called upon to give their opinion in a referendum, preferably on the same day as the European Parliament elections.
I regret the disappearance of the rotating Presidency of the Council and the omission of any reference to our common cultural and historical roots.
. (PT) In accordance with the indication of vote of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I voted against Amendment No 78, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
I feel, however, that the aforesaid amendment is essentially correct in pointing out one of the weaknesses of the draft Constitution presented to the Intergovernmental Conference by the Convention.
The fact is that this draft contributes little that is new to the economic governance of Europe.
Specifically, and crucially, it does not define how national economic policies should be coordinated, or review the objectives of the European Central Bank so as to link them more actively to growth and employment policies.
.
(DE) The Members of this House belonging to the CSU have voted in favour of the report by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos recommending the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference on the EU Convention's draft of a European constitution.
We do, however, believe that a number of amendments to the draft are necessary.
As a matter of urgency, we call for the incorporation, in the Constitution's preamble, of a reference to God and to Christianity.
As Europe has been shaped by the Christian West, its policies should also aspire to put Christian values into practice.
In order to make it possible for the EU to slim down and concentrate on its core tasks, we call in particular for there to be no extension of competences for the coordination of economic and employment policy, in order not to compromise freedom, competitiveness and the ownership of policies at national level; for no legal basis to be created for harmonising services of general interest, especially in water supply and sewerage; for competence in asylum and immigration policy to be limited to minimum standards, with the exception of rules on third-country nationals' access to the labour market; for there to be no extension of authority to promote and coordinate in the areas of sport, energy and civil protection; and for internal market competence to be restricted to measures primarily and directly intended to remove tangible obstacles.
. (PT) This report contains renewed endorsements of the work and results of the Convention we have rejected.
As we have complained in the past, the undemocratic methods and processes by which the Convention was constituted helped produce a text to which we are flatly opposed, since we disagree with the social project it advocates.
Under the terms of this text, an increasingly aggressive form of capitalism will become entrenched, society will be structured along neoliberal lines, everything will be commercialised and people will become increasingly devalued.
The social aspects which the text promised to defend will become secondary, and we will slide further down the road mapped out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice.
This is a real attack on the principles of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic.
It is a threat to sovereignty, not only in legal and institutional terms, but also in concrete areas of citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms.
It is an attempt to consign any chance of alternative routes to European integration to the dustbin of history.
Instead of selecting as absolute priorities the quest for peace, development, and economic and social cohesion, based on high levels of social welfare for all, this text defines peace as a mere possibility and not as a fundamental objective.
It embraces the profoundly militaristic NATO route, tied to United States imperialism.
We believe that the next Intergovernmental Conferences should reject the Convention's proposal and find alternative ways of giving a positive response to today's problems.
- (FR) In general, I approve of the proposals of the Convention, the draft Constitution and the proposal for a resolution that have been presented to us.
The Member States should not put all the work on the table again at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe, however, that a few changes are necessary, in particular at institutional level.
Whilst I accept the doubts and recommendations of our rapporteurs regarding the presidency of the European Council, I still have concerns about the solution proposed regarding the Commission and above all on distributing the seats in the European Parliament, for which neither the resolution nor the draft Constitution offer a satisfactory response.
Not wanting to swell the ranks of the eurosceptics, I voted in favour of the resolutions, although my concerns remain.
I hope that the IGC will be able to find appropriate solutions.
. (IT) I am not satisfied with this resolution: it is too long and difficult to understand for the uninitiated, and it is ambiguous on a fundamental issue, the revision procedure.
It is not enough to lament the fact that unanimity voting is being preserved and that the European Parliament is not being given power of ratification.
Parliament's demands had to be made a central issue, for the only way of overcoming the unsatisfactory elements in the Convention's text is precisely to ensure that there is a democratic method of ratification which will allow us to move forward.
The rapporteurs and the majority of Parliament have preferred to maintain a rigid and mistaken position on this issue: it is not true that the revision procedure forms a part of the agreement reached by the Convention.
This is practically the only issue on which we are asking the Intergovernmental Conference to decide!
Why, then, did I decide to vote for this resolution that I do not like?
Because a clear message needs to be given at this time: the IGC should not unilaterally reopen the fundamental issues of the text adopted by the Convention and this is what the resolution says.
From 4 October onwards, if the IGC decides to reopen the agreements then we will resume the battle over its content.
. (FR) The Convention, which was instructed to draw up the draft Constitution for a Europe of 25, published its report at the beginning of the summer.
Although the lack of change on some issues is to be regretted - and is this not inevitable - on others, we can only welcome the progress made by the Convention.
Promoting territorial cohesion is now one of the European Union's main objectives and, as a Member of the European Parliament representing an overseas territory, I am bound to welcome this fact.
Those who saw the work of the Convention as an opportunity to consign Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, concerning the outermost regions to the dustbin were seriously misguided.
The desire to see the content of this article feature in the future Constitution, is indeed legitimate but there was no guarantee that it would happen.
I believe that this new development demonstrates the desire to build a Europe that is united in its diversity, a Europe that is willing to provide assistance, a Europe that cares about the development of all citizens and a Europe that provides itself with the legal means to achieve all this!
This is what I have been fighting for, together with others and I am thinking in particular of Mrs Pervenche BerÃšs and Mr Olivier Duhamel, who are both representatives of the French Socialist delegation to the Convention and I should like publicly to offer them my thanks.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. I have voted against this report, although some amendments have taken on board a few numbers of our concerns about the future of our continent.
We must recall that this report was adopted in the Committee by 18th votes to 6, with 4 abstentions, which clearly indicates that the draft constitution lacks of credibility, being this report its formal evaluation by this Parliament.
The draft Constitution indeed does not incorporate into the Union the basic criteria that could build a desirable home for everybody.
As the report confirms, the unique nature of the Union is drawn from its member states and citizens.
The report, following the Constitutional draft, do not give any room to the peoples of Europe to exist as such, what in practical terms, excludes the recognition of the actual Stateless Nations of Europe, as has been clearly enlightened by the words of our catalans colleagues, Mr GasÃ²liba and Mr Mayol.
Certainly, this exclusion gratifies the Spanish nationalism of Mr Gil-Robles, but does not match in any way with what Mr Tsatsos wrote after the Treaty of Nice: 'The EU must steer a cause between the opposite poles of effectiveness and legitimacy, a balance which takes account of its raison d'Ãªtre as Union of peoples and states'.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) We have rejected this report as we rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention and presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing.
This draft has no legitimacy because it is not the outcome of the will of Europe's citizens and the Convention was nothing but a mockery of democratic debate.
Neither those who drafted it nor the decision-makers were mandated by the people or by universal suffrage.
The views of 'civil society' were certainly given a hearing but there was never any question of involving the citizens in the drafting process.
The most important aspect, however, is that this Treaty represents the constitutionalisation of a liberal, pro-Nato, militarist and antisocial Europe, which is opposed to secularism, social rights, public services and the interests of the workers.
We now refuse to give an Intergovernmental Conference the right to decide for us all.
The stakes, however, are high.
This European constitution for 450 million citizens will take precedence over national constitutions.
The container and the contents concern us all.
What is really needed is a different type of process, in other words, holding binding referendums on the same day throughout the Union in order to ensure that Europe has a different, more progressive draft Constitution.
The best way of opposing this free-market Europe is by mobilising the citizens, and this will happen in particular at the European Social Forum, which will take place at Saint-Denis in November of this year.
.
(DE) I voted for the report on the Constitutional Treaty despite a number of gripes about it, and so I am keen to clarify a number of points.
The extension of majority voting to a range of areas is, in an ever-expanding EU, something to be welcomed.
I regard the automatic abolition of unanimity - something provided for only in exceptional cases anyway - in order to transform it into a super qualified majority after 2009, as being premature at the present time.
Why announce now something that is due to happen in 2009?
I am glad that this passage, which was present in the first draft, has now disappeared.
I voted against paragraph 22 of the resolution, as I regard the allocation of Members in the European Parliament, as laid down in the protocol on enlargement appended to the Treaty of Nice, as balanced.
It is, however, not acceptable for the number of MEPs from Luxembourg to be cut by one-third.
I agree with Mr Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, that the proposals relating to the presidency of the specialised Councils of Ministers are unclear, in other words, that they still need some clarificatory amendments.
Nor is the creation of two classes of Commissioner - with and without voting rights - ideal.
Which country is getting a junior Commissioner, and when?
These are all questions that remain to be resolved.
.
(NL) The draft constitution, like many national constitutions, is full of fine rhetoric on such things as a high level of environmental protection, with a few points that sound social, and the rejection of capital punishment or discrimination, but this is not why this text was initially conceived.
The really tough points are the confirmation of the Council's power, which hinders parliamentary democracy, the integration of the whole of the EU into NATO and the establishment of the capitalist character of the EU economy.
Soon, there will be no more room for a militarily neutral position outside of NATO, as has so far been adopted by Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Austria, Cyprus and Malta.
It is not only about defending each other's territory against outside attackers together, but also about being able to intervene in defence of our own interests outside of NATO's and the EU's territories.
The constitution also protects freedom of enterprise and 'free and pure competition'.
In neo-liberal Europe, public utility companies in the areas of public transport, postal services, energy and telecommunications are no longer considered to be vital community tasks but are contracted out to profit-seekers.
In this way, this constitution will resemble that of Cuba or the former Soviet Union, which also wanted to lay down the form of their economy and protect it from democratic decisions about change.
If Europe is to have a constitution, then this is the wrong text.
There needs to be a referendum on this subject in every Member State.
- (IT) No one can deny the need for a European Union which has more transparent institutions whose respective roles and competences are better defined, and, as a result, less bureaucratic and more capable of acting quickly, where needed, in a Europe that leaves questions of an exclusively internal nature to the Member States so that it can, instead, deal with the major issues affecting society as a whole and our continent in particular; these objectives are at the heart of the text drawn up in the European Convention's eighteen months of work.
We are satisfied that the Convention established that Europe should be a union of nation states, respectful of the languages, cultures and traditions of every one of its components, and that this union, strengthened by a Constitutional Treaty, should produce a political, economic and social project capable of protecting our children, but also the rights of others' children: a Europe that, in safeguarding democracy, freedom and peace for its own peoples, is also able to promote freedom, peace and justice in other parts of the world too.
Precisely in order to ensure that democracy is respected, we urge the Intergovernmental Conference to accept the proposal for a Commissioner and the right to vote for every Member State, remembering that the concept of equal dignity of States, irrespective of the number of inhabitants, took shape as early as the peace of Westphalia.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) We thought that with the draft European Constitution we had seen everything, but obviously we did not count on this new report, which is supposed to express Parliament's position on the forthcoming IGC.
As regards the form, I wish to repeat that I am completely unable to sanction the work of the Convention which, as if this needed to be said again, had no democratic mandate to draw up a draft European Constitution.
Although some people might not like it, the election by direct universal suffrage of a constituent assembly is, in any democracy worthy of the name, a sacred rule.
In the present case, however, this principle has been breached, pure and simple.
As regards the content, I cannot accept this course of action by the European Parliament which, having made a catalogue of claims, each one more extravagant than the last (Parliament's electing the President of the Commission, extending codecision, greater involvement of Parliament in revising the Treaties, etc.) exerts enormous pressure on the representatives of the Member States who will take part in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) which 'is' and 'must' be the sole body competent to open the process of revising the Treaties.
No one should be surprised that my vote will go firmly against this report.
. (FR) I abstained from voting on compromise Amendment No 7 and I disagree with paragraph 30 of the motion for a resolution.
I believe that it is a mistake to say that 'draft Constitution prepared by the Convention (...) expresses the will of the citizens'.
The will of the citizens will only be effective once the Constitution has been ratified by a referendum of the people at European level.
Furthermore, I supported Amendment No 78, which expresses unhappiness at the draft Constitution's inclusion in part III, unamended, of all the articles of the Maastricht Treaty dealing with the Union's economic and monetary policy, which are founded on the principle of 'an open market economy with free competition' (Article III-70 of the draft Constitution).
I believe that this amendment is crucial to fully guarantee the content of Article 3 of the draft Constitution, which suggests that the Union is founded on a 'social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress'.
On the issue of public services I supported Amendment No 82, which calls for public services to be exempted from the rules of Community competition law.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(DE) I find it regrettable that the majority in the European Parliament has not supported the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats aimed at incorporating especial reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the draft Constitution.
Even in its present form, however, the Constitution contains elements that are important in terms of Europe's Christian heritage, in that the preamble refers to Europe's religious inheritance, and the Christian conception of mankind becomes one of the Constitution's important foundations through the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Article 51 of the draft Treaty, moreover, gives explicit recognition to the status of the churches and non-confessional organisations.
So the Constitution includes important features relating to Europe's religious heritage.
By means of its amendment, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to add another important dimension to these elements.
It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference, and hence for the Member States, to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft Constitution.
- (SV) I deeply regret the fact that a majority of the European Parliament (283 votes against, 211 votes in favour and 15 abstentions) rejected Amendment No 23, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, about expressly referring to the Judaeo-Christian religious heritage in the preamble to the intended Constitution.
The proposal should not be controversial, since it describes an historical fact.
We want every country, in the future too, each to have its own Commissioner, of equal standing and with voting rights.
Parliament rejects this.
We also regret Parliament's support for the creation of an EU President, which would mean abolishing the rotating Presidency of the Council and, thus, small countries' right to lead the EU.
I am very critical of what is termed the passerelle clause in Article I-24 concerning the ability to change the decision-making rules in the Council by means of a unanimous decision, and this without the approval of the national parliaments and without the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference within the EU.
. (FR) This report embodies a number of contradictions.
The most obvious of these is that Parliament is in favour of opening up the IGC but only in order to ensure that it achieves nothing.
Overall, the majority does appear to be highly satisfied with the results achieved by the Convention, but cannot deny that the major and recurring problems, such as a lack of democracy, transparency and effectiveness have still not been resolved.
As regards the detail, every proposal contradicts the commitment to diversity and to respect for democracy, because attempts are still being made to impose a uniform and binding supranational law.
The Chasse PÃªche Nature Traditions (CPNT) Members of the European Parliament's Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) feel that the Convention's method makes the same mistake that besets all diplomatic negotiations.
The decision was taken within a circle consisting of a chosen few, which seeks to impose its point of view, as has been the case since the beginnings of Community integration.
The only aspect of the draft drawn up by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was the last paragraph, which consented to seek the citizens' by referendum in the States whose constitution allows this.
It is to this test of truth that the proposals on the future of Europe must really be subject, by allowing a genuinely open debate on which everyone can take a stance.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (SV) I cannot support the European draft Constitution for several reasons.
I object to the trend towards a European state and recommend continued intergovernmental cooperation.
I cannot support proposals for increased military cooperation, which I consider to be a national issue.
A new state requires a constitution, a common currency, a common court of justice and a common defence.
To recommend, in addition, a common President, foreign minister and finance minister and remove the right of veto on important issues is to move further down the road towards creating a state.
Such a fundamental change to the direction taken by the EU should be placed before the people of Europe in referendums.
The members of the Convention, who have certainly done a sterling job, have not been elected democratically either, and the forms of decision-making within the Convention, in which no votes were taken, in themselves give rise to strong objections.
We voted against a proposal for a Constitution that is very complex and difficult to explain and understand; it is difficult to imagine how its mechanisms, dialectics and balance of powers will work in reality.
A very complex institutional structure is, by definition, not secular but conceived for the priests of bureaucracy that control everyday life: life that cannot be controlled and cannot function.
Whilst not denying that there has been progress in the current situation, it is in internal and related affairs.
There have, however, also been steps backwards such as the inclusion of Article 51(I), the declaration annexed to the Treaty, which confirms the status of religious bureaucracies too.
In fact, it obliges the EU to maintain regular dialogue with churches, thus violating the principle of secularism, the principle of separation between public institutions and religious organisations.
In this way the power of churches to interfere is sanctioned, and this is likely to constitute an obscurantist obstacle to the European citizens' right to decide freely on questions of ethics and science.
Furthermore, the EU is prevented from examining or reconsidering the situation of churches in the Member States, and so the preservation of privileges that are enjoyed by churches thanks to the agreements signed with Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, Salazar in Portugal and Hitler in Germany is guaranteed.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (ES) I take a positive view of the text of the report, in that it responds to many of the expectations of the political groups in this Parliament in relation to the future European Constitution.
Nevertheless, as a Member from Catalonia, a stateless nation which currently has a limited Statute of Autonomy within the framework of the Spanish state, I cannot accept the deficiencies in the future Constitutional text, particularly in relation to two specific aspects.
On the one hand, the territories with legislative powers have no clear, recognised system for participating in the EU's policy-making.
Neither is it established that those regions have the possibility of bringing cases before the Court of Justice when its competences may be affected.
Furthermore, neither does the future European Constitution provide for the incorporation into the Union's linguistic system of those languages which have official status in part of the territory of a Member State, as in the case of Catalan.
I hope that in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) the governments of the Member States will modify the text so that it is brought closer to the reality of today's Europe in relation to the aspects I have mentioned.
I therefore abstained from the final vote on the report.
That concludes the vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Middle East.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East and about the most recent events that have shaken the region.
The campaign of targeted killings which Israel has decided upon to eliminate the leaders of Hamas, the repeated appalling and bloody terrorist attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the resignation of the Palestinian Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, and the obstacles put in the way of his government by the President of the Palestinian National Authority, the decision in principle taken by Israel's Security Cabinet - the 'kitchen cabinet' - to expel President Arafat from the Palestinian Territories, and even the idea mooted that he should be killed, are all elements in a circle of violence which is in danger of spiralling completely out of control, putting an end to any hope of restoring peace to the Holy Land.
The escalation of violence therefore needs to be halted as soon as possible.
A ceasefire needs to be called without delay so that the negotiating process can be re-relaunched. We are committed to achieving this as a priority.
Indeed, we remain convinced that the only means of achieving a fair and lasting peace based on the United Nations' resolutions and principles is a process based on negotiation and on implementing the process laid out in the road map in good faith.
Only in this way will it be possible to realise the vision shared by the international community of two states peacefully coexisting and respecting both the Palestinians' right to self-determination and the Israelis' right to live in peace and security.
In addition to the day-to-day measures needed to respond to short-term imperatives, we also need other, more extensive measures based on a long-term vision of an area of peace, understanding, dialogue, prosperity and security, uniting the two shores of the Mediterranean.
This will be the vision before us at the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Naples, which we hope will give the Barcelona process fresh impetus and enable it to play its part in stabilising and bringing peace to the Middle East and to a wider Middle East.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should maintain a coherent approach on this issue, an approach fully supported by the Member States, the product of ongoing, thorough dialogue between the different viewpoints and perspectives.
Only by demonstrating cohesion and unity will the Union actually be able to strengthen its role and its influence in the Quartet and within the region, something we very much hope for.
In this connection, the unanimous, united vote by the 25 nations in the UN General Assembly in New York on the resolution exhorting the Israeli Government not to implement its decision to expel Yasser Arafat must be stressed.
What should our strategy be?
In the first place, as I have already said, we believe that the only way to achieve a peaceful solution of the conflict is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to implement the road map promptly in good faith.
We are therefore, once again, taking a firm line, calling for the terrorist structures to be dismantled and for both parties to refrain from acts likely to feed the spiral of violence.
Secondly, we believe that only broad-based international action can create the conditions necessary for the road map to succeed.
This is why we have been consistently committed, from the very beginning of our Presidency, to making the role played by the Quartet (including its role on the ground) more effective as the driving force behind negotiations between the two parties and, at the same time, to reinforcing the credibility and authority of the European Union's action within the Quartet.
Although the United States is the undoubted leader of the whole process, we must, to my mind, avoid a situation where it is left to act alone, unilaterally, on the ground: the European Union's role must be recognised.
Indeed, let us not forget that the European Union's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict are one of its international priorities.
Not only is this crisis taking place at the Union's southern borders and destabilising the whole of the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, but it also has wider adverse repercussions affecting the dialogue between civilisations and religions and the fight against international terrorism.
In the course of the practical implementation of the clear strategy I have just outlined, in line with our longstanding strong European commitment, we have consistently devoted special attention to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, to return now to the present, I would like to report on the initiatives that the Italian Presidency has taken in response to the latest tragic events which led to the breakdown of the truce and a return to the appalling spiral of violence.
As well as supporting the action taken by Mr Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who has made several visits to the region, we have stayed closely in touch with our fellow Quartet members - the United States, Russia and the United Nations - monitoring and assessing all the implications of the situation on the ground, in order to be able to take the most timely and appropriate steps to relaunch the negotiating process.
We have also acted to ensure that the Quartet will resume meeting at regular intervals at Special Envoy level without delay and that its ministers will meet on the occasion of the ministerial week at the United Nations General Assembly.
The members of the Quartet are unanimous in thinking that its role should be further reinforced.
We have told the two sides via various channels that they must, without fail, take concrete measures straight away to halt the violence and to avoid any action which could prevent a return to the negotiating table.
The progress made in the weeks following acceptance of the road map demonstrated that this is the path to take.
Despite everything that has happened, we have a duty not to lose heart.
There is still an opening, an opportunity to achieve the goals we have set, and violence must not prevent us from seizing it.
This was also the thrust of the public declaration issued by the Italian Presidency on behalf of its partners and with their approval on 11 September 2003.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have enormous responsibilities towards their citizens and towards the international community.
We accordingly expect them to show firm commitment, greater determination and, above all, great courage, sparing no effort in their pursuit of peace.
It is important that the power vacuum created by the resignation of Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas should be filled without delay.
Abu Ala, the Prime Minister designate, should quickly form a new Government of respected Palestinian politicians enjoying both his and his people's trust.
The new government should continue along the path laid out for it by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, putting an end to violence and opting resolutely for negotiation.
Abu Ala should also, as soon as possible and without further ado, deliver clear, tangible results on the security front by taking resolute action against terrorist violence.
To that end, it should be the new government - regardless of the membership of the national security council that President Arafat is preparing to appoint - which should have full control over the security forces.
If they take this path, Abu Ala and his government can count on the European Union's wholehearted support.
I wish here to reiterate our conviction that there can and must be no tolerance for terrorism.
As the holders of the European Union Presidency, reflecting very widespread public opinion in the Union, we firmly condemned the terrorist attacks for which Palestinian extremist organisations claimed responsibility.
At their informal meeting in Riva del Garda at the beginning of September, the EU Foreign Ministers decided to add the political wing of Hamas to Europe's list of terrorist organisations.
This had to be done: the EU had issued clear warnings to Hamas at the Thessaloniki European Council; not to have followed them up would have undermined the Union's credibility as a force to be reckoned with in the region.
I am very happy that the Council was able to reach a consensus that overcame the doubts harboured by some partners and enabled us to agree convincingly on a common position.
We also consider that the reforms being introduced by the Palestinian National Authority, to make it more democratic, transparent and efficient, are another necessary condition for a peaceful, stable and democratic Palestinian state.
Those reforms must continue and be nurtured by support from the European Union and the international community.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to set out clearly the Presidency's position with regard to President Arafat.
We cannot deny the essentially negative role that he has played in recent months, contributing to the splits in the PNA's leadership, undermining the efforts of Prime Minister Abu Mazen and causing his resignation.
His historical role and his responsibilities towards the Palestinian people should entitle us to expect from President Arafat a change of heart, full backing for the Prime Minister designate, Abu Ala, and a clear condemnation of terrorist violence.
Nonetheless, as the Presidency has publicly made clear to the Israeli Government, Yasser Arafat is the Palestinians' legitimately elected President; to send him into exile would be unacceptable and a very serious mistake.
The European Union - confirmed in this stance by the similar positions of the United States, Russia and many other members of the international community - has, accordingly, asked Israel to rescind its decision and to guarantee the physical safety of the President of the Palestinian National Authority: death threats are unacceptable.
We also reminded the Israeli Government of the need to show moderation and put an end, once and for all, to the targeted killings, which, apart from any considerations of international law, all too frequently also strike the innocent, thereby doing much to stoke the fires of rage, frustration and violence.
We also urged Israel to work harder to ease the conditions of the Palestinian people in the territories.
Lastly, we reminded Israel - whose need for security we do not underestimate - that the European Union expects it to proceed with other specific steps identified by the road map without delay, in particular to suspend all settlement activity in the Palestinian territories, to dismantle the settlements built since March 2001 and to stop erecting the 'security wall' along its current route, which is sited beyond the 'green line' and therefore jeopardises any prospect of a negotiated solution to the conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has an important part to play in the Quartet to reinvigorate the negotiating process in the direction I have described.
However, those diplomatic efforts must go hand in hand with action on the ground.
We are convinced that the European Union can, alongside the United States, take on a larger role in the international monitoring arrangements provided for in the road map right from phase 1.
The possibility of greater European involvement will also be discussed at the Quartet's forthcoming ministerial meeting in New York.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that, yet again, we have reached a critical point in the Middle East crisis; it is all the more painful because hopes were objectively raised by what seemed to be shared determination to forge ahead regardless of difficulties, with no effort spared.
History, especially the history of the Middle East crisis, teaches us that it is precisely when the negotiating process is yielding its first fruits that the forces of radical extremism, which are opposed to any form of peace, unleash greater violence.
At precisely these times, however, the onus is on the international community to press the parties involved to opt clearly for the negotiating table and to reject the use of violence.
The European Union will ensure that the region and the parties involved feel the weight of its efforts to bring about a negotiated peace.
In taking this road, we very much hope that we can rely on the support of Parliament, with its long tradition of closely following the Middle East crisis and responding to it.
Mr President, the Commission shares the assessment made by the Council Presidency, which can be summarised in a few words: the Middle East peace process has gone off the rails.
We believe that the future of the road map depends on a solid and unambiguous commitment by both sides and by the international community.
What is lacking is the political will, which is a crucial factor for peace and completely non-existent today.
We had hoped that the road map would create the political will to implement the vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace.
Is this still possible?
It is, but only if Israel regains a certain feeling of security, is once again accepted in the region and can have confidence in the Palestinian structures and if at the same time the Palestinians see that Israel accepts their aspiration to build a nation on the territory seized by Israel in 1967, as well as their desire to improve their economic and humanitarian situation.
What needs to be done today to give new impetus to this road map, which is coming apart at the seams?
Israel would have to adopt a sufficient number of measures designed to establish a climate of trust, in particular by stopping the extrajudicial executions and the punitive house demolitions, it would have to prove that all illegal settlements built since September 2000 will be dismantled and impose a freeze on new settlements and resolve the problems caused by the building of the 'security wall'.
The Palestinians for their part must adopt visible and effective measures to combat the planning or perpetration of terrorist attacks against Israelis by individuals or groups, rein in seditious acts, publicly declaim Israel's right to exist and speed up preparations for elections, for drafting a constitution and for the participation of civil society in reform.
We believe that the international community must exert its influence in order to resolve the security problem and offer rapid and effective support as sponsors.
Tomorrow, in New York, the quartet will meet and the European Union will take the opportunity to attempt to persuade all parties to accept genuine coordination of the quartet as regards the support and follow-up that should be given to this road map.
As the Council Presidency stated, Hamas still appears on the list of terrorist organisations, but banning this movement in the United States and in Europe is not enough.
We must go further.
Radical forces exert their influence through the social and educational services and we must not content ourselves with helping to cut off their sources of funding.
We must also increase the Palestinian authority's power to provide local services.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) can also provide support in this area.
We believe that what improving security and the fight against extremism requires is above all Community-level action.
The Commission has announced a programme of support for the reforms to be undertaken by the Palestinian Authority and also various measures aimed at alleviating the economic and humanitarian problems.
We estimate that our commitment this year will total around EUR 245 million.
We feel encouraged in this course of action by the aid recently donated to the Palestinian Authority by the United States and by the restoration of Israeli tax receipts to the Palestinian Authority.
This will not by any means suffice, however, to get the Palestinian Authority up and running again.
The economic situation will not improve if the border closures remain in place and Israel, for its part, must help to kick-start the Palestinian Authority.
We must also continue to reiterate to all Arab States to put an end to all public and private funding of groups bent on violence and terrorism and to close down the offices of their representations.
We in Europe have much more to offer the people of the Middle East: ever-closer relations thanks to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the network of association agreements that is currently being set up.
I want you all to know that we are making progress on this matter with Syria, the last country with which negotiations have not been concluded.
We have presented the new initiative on the policy of neighbourhood relations in an enlarged Europe, which sets out all the opportunities for closer cooperation to achieve the economic and social integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region. Only progress in the context of the peace process, however, can help our partners in the region to take full advantage of the opportunities with which the European Union will continue to provide them in this field.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East appears to be hopeless.
After the removal of the Iraqi dictator, we had all hoped for a new and peaceful order in the Middle East.
This hope proved to be false, and it appears as if all efforts for peace, and the roadmap, have come to nothing.
Mahmud Abbas has been replaced by Ahmed Kurei after only four months in power.
Personalities are of course important, and we also know that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are the decision-makers, but, in essence, this is about the people of these countries.
Prime Minister Sharon is democratically elected; so is President Arafat.
I do not know whether his election meets all the democratic criteria, but he is elected.
He is also a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, something that should perhaps spur the Israeli Government and the Palestinians to get back to the common ground that President Arafat once shared with the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin.
We are all familiar with the enormous problems that we face.
In our group, we are perfectly clear in our own minds that we can in no way justify the suicide attacks, which hold human life in contempt.
They constitute an abuse of the young people to whom promises of paradise are made, and they involve the murder of other innocent people.
They bring about a vicious circle of violence; another result of them is Israel's death lists, which we can in no way approve of, since - as Commissioner Lamy and Mr Antonione have said - it is not only the hunted criminals, or those assumed to be such, but also a very large number of innocent people who end up being killed.
A policy of 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' will bring no resolution.
Just as we hear Hamas and Islamic Jihad speaking the language of hatred, we also see the deeds of hatred, and all this leads to further escalations.
There are also Israel's illegal settlements in Western Jordan, which are a constant provocation for the people in Palestine.
Let me quote this from the 8 September issue of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: 'The symbolic removal of a few containers in illegal settlements west of the Jordan was too little for it to have been capable of becoming an encouraging experience of success for the Palestinians.'
The building of a wall rams home the deep sense of constant humiliation felt in Palestine.
We must seek to enable both Israel and Palestine to live within secure borders, and we declare that all the people of that region - Israelis and Palestinians alike - are endowed with the same dignity.
That is why, despite the apparent hopelessness, there is no alternative to pressing on with the efforts towards peace.
I am speaking personally rather than on behalf of my group when I say that I do not believe that a peaceful solution will be possible without an international military peacekeeping force.
Unless an international military peacekeeping force is used to keep the two sides off each other, I do not believe that a solution will be possible.
Nor can we expect the Americans to do everything - their elections mean, in any case, that they are less capable of acting in this area.
I rejoice at the common purpose that is apparent here, and it is as the European Union that we should persist in our efforts together with the USA, with the UN, and with Russia.
We must persist in our efforts, for it is the people of the Middle East who are at stake.
Mr President, the Israeli threats to assassinate Yasser Arafat are not just morally reprehensible, but also politically unacceptable and absurd, unless, of course, the intention is to cause chaos in the region.
It is as if we were not all aware that Hamas and Islamic Jihad consider Arafat to be the barrier preventing them from attempting an assault on Israel.
How are the Palestinians going to negotiate with people who intend, in this way, to assassinate their President, democratically elected in 1996 in fair and democratic elections, in the presence of observers, including ours?
Frankly, the only legitimate and morally acceptable way to get rid of Arafat is by means of the elections laid down in the roadmap.
George Bush has just said, although it sounds like sarcasm, that 'in the United States we free people by means of a peaceful and ordered process' but, nevertheless, has vetoed a resolution in the Security Council which advocated just that and expressed opposition to political assassination.
I would like to highlight here and now the political realism of President Chirac, who said in New York, and I quote verbatim, Mr President: 'you may think what you like about Arafat, but the truth is that he is the authority, the elected and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
I do not believe that anyone else can impose an agreement on the Palestinians'. End of quote.
Within this context, and in relation to the settlements, it offers little hope that Colin Powell should have said on Monday, and I quote, that: 'it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the Israeli Prime Minister to say to his people that he is giving in to American pressure'.
End of quote. I would ask myself: have the Palestinians not given in, by reforming the Ministry of Finance and creating the post of Prime Minister against the initial will of Arafat although, at the end of the day, with his assent?
Incidentally, however, if you wish to listen to an Israeli voice on the subject of Yasser Arafat, then please listen to Simon Peres, who - on reaching 80 years old - has said: firstly, that Arafat has accepted the theory of two states, abandoning that of the destruction of the state of Israel; secondly, that he has accepted the 1967 borders, abandoning those of 1948, and, thirdly, that he has agreed to negotiate.
Simon Peres says - and it is true - that Yasser Arafat only has one significant fault, which is that he is not combating the fundamentalist militias of Hamas and Jihad.
I, however, would say that until the Israeli Government adopts specific measures, which are credible to the Palestinian population, on selective assassinations, the settlements or the wall of shame, for example, no Palestinian will enjoy the popularity and political support necessary to combat the Islamic extremists.
Mr President, not until the non-terrorists have a consolidated political space, which so far Israel has not provided, will the terrorists have lost the war.
Mr President, two weeks ago a London newspaper convened a meeting between senior journalists from Israel and Palestine, the first of its kind since before the current intifada.
A number of participants, from both sides, expressed the belief that theirs was, in effect, a 'twenty-second century conflict': a war that would last a hundred years, blighting the lives of their grandchildren's children.
A conflict that has the capacity to exhaust the optimism of the best of us once again demands deeper reserves of patience and commitment.
But grim as the situation is, we cannot afford to despair.
If the two sides have strayed from the roadmap's path of peace and reconciliation, we must coax them back.
The European Union must continue to play a crucial role in the search for peace in the Middle East.
Greater engagement with Israel might help in this.
Making peace also requires a strong, functioning and accountable Palestinian Authority.
That is why the Union has spent more than EUR 300 million since 2000 to keep the Palestinian Authority in business.
An effective and legitimate Palestinian Authority is essential to dismantle the terrorist organisations.
The Palestinians also need a strong voice to negotiate with Israel.
The European Union must step up its support for financial reform of the Authority to help it distance itself from terrorism.
We have also provided more than EUR 30 million for the vital work of Palestinian municipalities in providing basic public services, because that is how you fight despair - with clean water and classrooms; with the promise of normality and peace.
We may regret Yasser Arafat's intransigence, but we should remember that if the Palestinians voted tomorrow in the fair and transparent elections we would like to see, they would probably choose him again as their leader.
The surest way to ensure that outcome would be for Israel to make a martyr out of him.
Arafat's place in the peace process is not for us to determine, any more than it is for Israel or for the United States.
However, we can have no truck with terrorism.
That is why my Group welcomes the inclusion of Hamas in the European list of terrorist organisations.
Suicide bombings have taken an unbearable toll in Israeli lives, and the political apologists for terror cannot receive support while the killing continues.
Both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict.
Israel's extra-judicial killings must end, as they will only breed more terrorists, not force the Palestinians to negotiate.
Israel must withdraw its forces from the Occupied Territories, and the settlement building must stop.
Two states, living side by side in peace - that is the only viable solution.
Israel's existence as a Jewish state and as a democracy demands a Palestinian state.
The alternatives are Palestinian apartheid or the inexorable demographic eclipse of Israel's character as a Jewish homeland.
The roadmap, of which the European Union was the chief cartographer, recognises this, and my Group remains firmly committed to its implementation.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, thank you, Europe, for the unanimous stance it adopted at the UN General Assembly.
Europe's assistance will be more important than ever in salvaging the situation.
This is the message given to us on Saturday, in Ramallah, by President Arafat, who was visibly relieved to have the impassioned support of his people in the face of Ariel Sharon's relentless hounding of him. At the same time, however, he was extremely concerned at the increasingly intolerable situation facing his fellow countrymen.
After the staggering decision of principle taken by the Israeli cabinet to expel an elected president from his country, and even, if comments made by the number 2 in the Sharon government are to be believed, to physically eliminate him, my group wished, through the intermediary of its chairman and of our colleague Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Parliamentary delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, to express on the spot what the vast majority of European citizens, including many who are actually critical of the Palestinian Authority, think about this extremely serious precedent.
This decision is completely unacceptable and I think that it must give food for thought to anyone who thinks that accommodating Ariel Sharon will encourage him to relax his approach.
The main lesson that we can learn from our meetings in Ramallah, and also in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is that there has never been a greater need for external political intervention in order to create a momentum for negotiations that offers a population on its knees some hope of a worthy and equitable peace.
I still remember the ominous words of Commissioner Patten on the eve of the war with Iraq: he basically said, to a barrage of applause from our House, that the one thing he was sure about, was that if this war takes place without a political solution being found for the conflict in the Middle East, we will see an upsurge in terrorism.
This is, unfortunately, the situation now facing us.
The 'road map' was supposed to take up this challenge and is in a doubly strong position to do so.
Firstly, this is a general political plan, not one concerned solely with security.
Because it makes sense, the Palestinian people will be all the more willing to rally forces to prevent terrorist acts as their daily lives become liveable once again and as their fundamental rights are recognised.
Furthermore, the route map has four official godparents, not just one, whose credibility as peacemaker is at its lowest ebb.
And yet, four months after launching this initiative, what remains of it?
What has become of the 'road map', what has happened to the 'quartet' and, for that matter, what is Europe doing?
At this crucial time, the European Union is unavailable to its subscribers.
I would like to believe that the unanimous vote given by the 25 in New York last week is a sign of a new awareness as regards the collective responsibility that must be shouldered in the region, and Mr Solana, due to speak to Parliament on 9 October, will then explain the political strategy, the practical goals to attain and the timetable of the initiatives decided on in Council to prevent the worst case scenario from arising and to give fresh hope to the Middle East.
My own conviction is that, of the priorities for launching such an initiative, three warrant particular attention.
First of all, we must refuse to give in to Ariel Sharon's blackmail where President Arafat is concerned.
It is one thing to support the idea that reforms are needed in the Palestinian Authority.
This debate is already taking place in Palestinian society, and is legitimate and healthy.
It is another matter altogether unquestioningly to accept the de facto imprisonment of an elected president in the ruins of his headquarters. What is even worse is the fact that we are bowing down to the veto imposed by the occupying force whilst failing to meet the man seen by his entire people as the living embodiment of Palestine.
Significant action is required, in my opinion, to put an end to this terrible ambiguity.
Next, we must strongly oppose the wall that is being built.
This is not simply a border that is questionable only in its appropriateness.
This constitutes a blatant incursion into internationally recognised Palestinian territory.
The wall cuts through the University of Aboudis, near Jerusalem.
It cuts through the very heart of Bethlehem.
It is depriving Palestinian farmers of crucial irrigated land to the north of the West Bank.
The wall's construction has entailed further land confiscations, further expulsions, and to further check points and foreshadows a Palestine in pieces.
This is a scandal of such proportions that even President Bush has taken umbrage at the action of his protÃ©gÃ©.
If the White House itself is threatening to remove US credit guarantees for Israel if Israel continues to forge ahead in this opportunistic way, the European Union must finally be bold enough to state clearly that the association agreements with Israel will only remain in place if there is a change of direction in Ariel Sharon's policy.
Lastly, we must attach priority to all Israeli and Palestinian initiatives to halt the violence and to reopen political dialogue.
I am thinking in particular of the coalition for peace, whose prime movers are Yossi Beilin, former Israeli Minister and negotiator of the Oslo agreements and Yasser Abed Rabbo, outgoing Palestinian government Minister, also a steadfast proponent of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
These two remarkable personalities have furthermore just accepted the invitation I sent them, on behalf of my group, jointly to visit the European Parliament in mid-November and speak to us.
I am also thinking of one of the most symbolic of all Palestinian prisoners, Marwan Barghouti, a member of parliament and also someone who is highly committed to the Oslo negotiations and whose prestige, particularly amongst Palestinian youths, could help to persuade the most recent recruits to engage in dialogue rather than in violence.
Lastly, Mr President, I am thinking of Yasser Arafat himself, who has just reiterated his determination to work on achieving a ceasefire and not just a truce, if his efforts and those of the prime minister, Abu Mazen, are not blown out of the water by targeted assassinations and house demolitions.
The President of the State of Israel, unlike Ariel Sharon, has called for this prospect to be taken extremely seriously.
I believe that high-profile initiatives by the European Union in this direction are highly pertinent.
This is the express request of my group, but this is above all the dearest wish of supporters of peace on the ground who would like to be able to say as soon as possible, full of hope 'Europe is back'.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'there is something rotten in the state of Israel', and, as my friend Abraham Burg, former President of the Knesset, recently wrote in The International Herald Tribune, 'a state lacking justice cannot survive'.
He went on to write, 'We must remove all the settlements, all of them and draw an international recognized border between a Jewish National Home and a Palestinian National Home'.
The European Union can protest as much as it wants against Sharon's adopted policy; the real change has to happen in Israel itself, where gradually, people are realising that they are heading the wrong way.
The separation wall will not solve the problem.
We know in Europe that walls are not permanent and that borders do not last for ever.
Israel is a friend on the wrong track.
Who can help this friend at this stage?
Who can bring pressure to bear on the government in Israel?
The United States can, because it can turn off the money tap.
Apparently, we should not expect much from Washington in the short term either.
Is it still serious about the roadmap?
Is it not time to win respect in the Arab world, now that the situation in Iraq is continually deteriorating?
International law should not lose out in the fight against terrorism.
We believe that both camps must disarm.
Arafat's status as the elected leader is a matter of unalterable fact.
The time is ripe, I believe, for a major conference on the Middle East, at which the European Union can speak with one voice.
Only by means of a global solution can peace and stability be established.
The United States is asking for support for Iraq.
The European Union is asking for support for Israel and Palestine.
Indeed, It is indeed possible, Mr Poettering, to moot the idea of an international military force in this context.
Mr President, there is great concern, and justifiably so, surrounding the extremely grave situation in the Middle East.
Prospects for progress are bleaker now than at any time this year.
There has been almost a complete breakdown in the implementation of the roadmap for peace in the region.
The cease-fire announced by Islamic Jihad and Hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on Israel.
Planned Israeli withdrawals from some towns in the West Bank have been cancelled and the Israeli army has been active against Palestinians in Gaza.
The Israeli security cabinet has also decided, in principle, to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories.
This decision has been widely criticised, and rightly so.
On the Israeli side there has been a failure to meet commitments, to dismantle settlement outposts and to freeze settlement activity.
The Palestinian side has also been unable to fulfil many of its commitments on the issue of future security.
New buildings continue to be erected on the settlements in and around Jerusalem and the prospects for the roadmap appear dim unless action is taken in the immediate future.
I believe that imaginative gestures must be the order of the day if the roadmap is to have any chance of survival.
Neither side has met its commitment under the roadmap for peace.
That is one issue that we can all agree on.
The new Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Alaa has international credibility as he is one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accord.
We cannot disguise the fact that the decision of the Israel security cabinet to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories has led to a deteriorating situation in the Middle East.
At the moment the Israelis are insisting that their ban on contacts with those who meet Yasser Arafat also applies to people from within the European Union.
This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region.
I strongly believe that efforts to isolate President Arafat will only exasperate tensions within the Palestinian leadership.
Any attempt by Israel to expel him from the Occupied Territories will only undermine the Palestinian Authority and will further inflame the security situation.
The Palestinian leadership has been presented with a list of security messages by the United States Government that will have to be implemented.
I would also urge the government of the United States to remain fully engaged in the peace process and to press Israel on its commitment to the roadmap.
Finally, I welcome the continued efforts of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten to renew a cease-fire in the region.
This has been a particularly bad year for the Middle East.
Not only is the political situation becoming more unstable now in Iraq, but if we are not all collectively careful, the situation between Israel and Palestine could also deteriorate further.
Mr President, on Saturday 6 September, Mahmud Abbas, having resigned as Palestinian Prime Minister, appeared before the Palestinian parliament to render an account of his brief term of office.
He did so behind closed doors.
What has since been made known of this closed meeting makes a mockery of any Palestinian implementation of the so-called roadmap.
It is abundantly clear from Mr Abbas' indictment that the person responsible for this is the President of the Palestinian Authority.
Mahmud Abbas was, along with his Cabinet, committed to the reform of elementary policy areas such as the coordination of the Palestinian security services and the purely financial management of public funds, but to no avail.
All these praiseworthy attempts eventually foundered on one person's thirst for power, that person being 'raÃ¯s' Yasser Arafat.
Hence Abbas' lament: 'A Palestinian minister does not even have anywhere near as much power as a deputy secretary elsewhere.'
How do we go on from here?
Officially, the President of the Palestinian Authority is very much the relevant political interlocutor for the European institutions.
Given the seriousness of Mahmud Abbas' accusations, I am asking both the Council and Commission what they think the implications of this are.
After all, ignoring this courageous, honest Palestinian self-criticism renders the roadmap to peace in the Middle East politically implausible - certainly when a new Palestinian Prime Minister has to operate from the same position of relative weakness as Mahmud Abbas.
Mr President, taking the floor once again on this issue, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I feel bound to recall the situation of Sarajevo ten years ago and the genuine fury I experienced each time a glimmer of hope that emerged as the result of a painstakingly put together agreement was extinguished by a blast of suspicion and fear.
This blast was sustained, of course, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, by the radical extremists but above all by the negotiators themselves, as a result of the total lack of trust they demonstrated in their partners and due to the fear that if they stopped acting like an adversary, the latter would take advantage of the agreement to consolidate their positions.
It is against this disease of fear that I have fought relentlessly since the renewal of the Intifada re-injected the virus of it into an area where, as Mr Poettering has just said, those who secured peace are today in despair.
I am very aware that speaking here, in these comfortable and safe conditions, might appear to be laughable or even blasphemous to those who are suffering physically or whose nearest and dearest are.
I wish, however, to set an example and offer our assurance that we are willing to help them.
The example we can set involves the reconciliation, here in Strasbourg itself, of nations that have continued, for generations, to live paralysed by the fear of one another.
Our assurance means providing the certainty that when Israelis and Palestinians finally agree on the terms of an agreement, with the assistance of the quartet and as a conclusion to your endeavours, Mr President-in-Office the European Union will do everything it can to ensure the political, material and, if need be, military implementation, by deploying peacekeeping forces to replace a wall whose effectiveness will always be in doubt and - yes, Mr Wurtz - which it is impossible to justify.
Mr President, a few days ago, the UN General Assembly, with negative votes by the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Israel and the USA alone, adopted the well-publicised resolution on Arafat.
This resolution, interpreted politically, does not only have the narrow sense of what Arafat means and what the problem means today; it also expresses the demand of the international community for a solution at long last to this impasse of a crisis which has lasted 40, 50, 60 years, with thousands dead and thousands murdered.
What we are or are not debating today is immaterial in relation to what must be done there.
We here are a political body.
We are not judging intentions.
In this sense, we must only speak about what needs to be done politically.
We are talking about one roadmap in relation to what is happening in the area and we fail to see the other roadmap, the map of violence, of blood, of suicides, of innocent people murdered and so on, of the wall, of anything else.
Over recent days, there has been a new representative of the European Union in the region, Mr Otte. Unfortunately, however, he has been ill-received by the Sharon side, which has refused to receive him, as it refused our other representatives, because they also wanted to see Arafat.
This is not a positive development.
We must send out certain positive messages.
The Quartet is not enough, it is not enough as a body of observers.
It needs to be converted into a task force which will impose terms and conditions and procedures.
Otherwise, every time we come here, we shall list our complaints, some of us from a position of security, others in line with their sympathies, but without any final result.
I therefore agree with the proposal made by my honourable friend Mr Poettering for international blue-helmeted observers to be installed at long last on the border between the two states, as has happened elsewhere in the world.
I agree with all the proposals which do not have us as neutral observers, which do not lead us into inaction.
I agree with all the proposals which, at long last, call for us to take action on our own responsibility and not for us to simply wait and follow others' instructions.
Mr President, I get the impression that too many speakers in this Chamber are referring to the road map without having read it, and that, because of their unfamiliarity with the actual document, they are interpreting it in an ambiguous way.
The road map is a plan in three phases.
The whole thing is summed up in the title of Phase I - Ending terror and violence, normalising Palestinian life, building Palestinian institutions - and its aim is to bring about an immediate and unconditional end to violence on the Palestinian side.
This is the vital point, and if it cannot be achieved everything else will become ambiguous, uncertain and vaguely sermonising in tone.
Frankly, it does not make sense to call on Israel to take further or different initiatives in addition to those it has adopted thus far, if acts of terrorism on the part of the Palestinians are not halted.
No European state confronted with a series of terrorist attacks, especially against unarmed civilians, would agree not to react using force and legal means of suppressing violence.
Nor am I convinced by the exhortations to keep Mr Arafat in place on the grounds that he is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, given that everyone recognises that there are still no democratic institutions within the Palestinian community.
Yasser Arafat is responsible for the failure of the Camp David agreement and for Abu Mazen's failure.
I believe that we in Europe should adopt a more severe approach towards his behaviour if we are to secure a change in attitude.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one minute is not long, but if it is to reiterate what has been said before, then one minute is sufficient.
I concur with what Mr Wurtz has said, but I should like to add something in relation to our own mandate.
When we are confronted with endless violence that always generates more violence, then we are facing a situation that condemns Europeans, Americans and Russians to powerlessness, insofar as their opinions are expressed in a joint phased plan to peace.
There is no phased plan to peace.
I have read it and do not want to read it again.
For what is left of it?
It has been shot to tatters from all corners.
What I am asking you is how we can take a new direction.
With this roadmap, have we not been led to believe in an all too optimistic scenario, the premises of which have not been accepted by the actual state of Israel itself?
Has Israel accepted that it will, from now on, live with a Palestinian state beside it?
Has Israel really abandoned the idea that the occupied territories should be governed by Israelis?
I am coming to the conclusion that it has not and that, instead, it hopes to achieve military dominance in the region with military backing from the United States.
In that case, there will be no peace.
Every nation is entitled to its own home.
I see it as Europe's responsibility to sit down with both parties to find out their real intentions and to stop collaborating with a regime that is using military means to eradicate part of a powerless nation and is trying to kill its elected president.
Mr President, if Abu Allah's period of office is to be longer than Abu Massen's, and if he is to have any kind of chance of combating terrorism, Israel must not provoke the Palestinian population the whole time and undermine all the attempts on the part, for example, of Abu Abbas, to stop the violence.
Remember what happened the day after he had got the Palestinian leaders to enter into a unilateral ceasefire.
Israel liquidated Hamas leaders in the street, an act that was of course no better than a terrorist attack, for, when Hamas leaders are liquidated, their wives and children and casual passers-by are also killed.
Nor, of course, is an occupying power entitled to kill in the street those who are engaged in resistance.
I believe that until the West makes it fully clear that we condemn the liquidations perpetrated by Israel just as strongly as we condemn suicide bombers; until we make it abundantly clear to Israel that it must call a halt to the settlements; and until we make it crystal clear that, as long as it holds Palestine in an iron grip of oppression and violence, there can be no peace, we make it completely impossible for any Palestinian Prime Minister to put a stop to the violence.
When I was last in Palestine with the delegation, there were three deaths in just the few days that I was there.
A little boy died when an olive stone went down his throat the wrong way.
There was a curfew, so no doctor went out to him, and he therefore died.
An old man died at the checkpoint.
He said that he had a bad heart, but the soldiers refused to allow him to pass the checkpoint, and they looked on as he died there of a heart attack.
A patient died in an ambulance on the way to hospital because it too was not allowed to pass the checkpoint.
Until we begin to condemn such things just as roundly, there will be no peace in the Middle East.
We have the honour of welcoming Mr Abdou Diouf, the former president of the Republic of Senegal and secretary-general of the International Organization of the Francophonie to the gallery.
The International Organization of the Francophonie helps with its activities to reach people within the framework of respect for cultural diversity.
Mr Diouf, I welcome you and your representation to the European Parliament.
Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing a catastrophic situation in the Middle East, and one of course wonders who is to be blamed for it.
It would be far too simple to attribute responsibility to one side alone, but it must give us pause for thought when Abraham Burg, a member of the Israeli Knesset whom we welcomed to this House some time ago, tells us that the Israel of today has the choice between Jewish radicalism and democracy, settlements or hope for both peoples, the deceptive visions of barbed wire, street blockades and suicide attacks or an international border between two states and Jerusalem as their shared capital.
I believe that what Mr Burg is telling us calls us back to something present at the birth of Israel and of what could have become Palestine, and that is the decision of the United Nations.
Some of those who spoke before me have made it clear that we have to get the United Nations more deeply involved, with a peacekeeping force to bring peace to this region.
At present, that is not yet accepted, but I hope that the situation does not have to deteriorate still further and become even more extreme before we can accept the involvement of the United Nations and of peacekeeping troops.
Let me add another observation on terrorism, this one from Avi Shlaim, writing in today's Herald Tribune: 'The real obstacle to peace is Sharon, not Arafat.'
I think that is perhaps putting it in rather too simple terms, and provocative ones at that.
I share the view expressed by the Presidency, that neither Sharon nor Arafat are angels of peace, and that what is needed instead is other people who are capable of making peace.
