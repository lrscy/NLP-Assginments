Following the rejection of the proposal by the Commission
Madam President, may I say to both you and the Commission that I believe that Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure applies here, meaning that you have to give the Commissioner the floor in order to ask if the Commission intends to withdraw its proposal.
That is the first step.
I agree, and this is why I was giving the floor to the Commission.
Thank you, Mr Katiforis. I believe Mr Bolkestein wishes to speak.
Madam President, I understand that the report by Mr Katiforis has been accepted.
That means that the Commission proposal is rejected.
I would like to say first of all that the Commission very much regrets this vote, in particular because the Commission's proposal is precisely what Parliament asked for in 1996.
This is an unusual situation.
Parliament asks something of the Commission.
The Commission does what is asked of it and Parliament rejects what the Commission has done.
However I shall apprise the Commission of this regrettable result next week when the Commission next meets, and I shall confer with my colleagues and with President Prodi on the course of action to be taken now in connection with the rules of the Treaty which are perfectly clear.
(Applause)
Madam President, I should only like to comment on this point very briefly.
Firstly, the Commission proposal was flawed, but what is even more important, Commissioner, is the fact that elections have been held in the meantime, and the Commission should also take note of this.
We really cannot spend any more time on this matter.
Madam President, of course it is also a pity that the Council tried to pre-empt Parliament's opinion with a political agreement and did not have the courtesy to let Parliament express its views first.
That by way of a brief reply to what Mr Bolkestein just said.
But may I say that, pursuant to Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Bolkestein's answer is incomplete.
The Rule is clear.
We ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal.
Mr Bolkestein has not said if it intends to do so.
He said that he would confer with his colleagues on the course of action to be taken now, from which I conclude that the Commission refuses to withdraw its proposal.
Consequently, we need to proceed to the third paragraph of the Rule, which states that the matter has to be referred back to the committee responsible, without voting on the draft legislative resolution and I propose that we do precisely that.
I quite agree, Mr Katiforis. This is the view we should take of the matter.
Madam President, Mr Katiforis is quite correct, but if the precedent in this House, is anything to go by, now that Parliament has made a proposal, in five years' time the Commission will come forward with an idea which we will reject again.
(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)
Report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]
Before the vote
chairman of the Committee on Budgets. Madam President, it would be an oral amendment, which would be a new Recital 12.
It would also apply to the draft legislative resolution and would read: "The proposal was not foreseen in the financial perspective.
The financial envelope of the proposal should be covered by additional resources."
Madam President, as rapporteur of this report I would like to make two points: firstly, that this very amendment tabled orally by my fellow Member Mr Wynn has been rejected at the vote by the Committee on Fisheries on the day my own report was voted upon.
The second is that I do not oppose this amendment being tabled and it should be this House that decides upon its content.
Madam President, is it clear that the vote is only on the legislative part of the proposal and not on the budgetary part?
We shall discuss the oral amendment that Mr Wynn has just mentioned, which does, of course, have financial implications. I am sure that everyone understands this.
Madam President, with regard to the amendment tabled by the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgets, I support the proposal made by our rapporteur and, also, in agreement with what the Commission said, I would like to say that we have always spoken about this proposal from the point of view of fisheries and we do not involve ourselves with the budgetary aspects.
However, although what Mr Wynn proposes is true - that, as is stated here, the proposal was not included in the financial perspectives - it is nonetheless certain, and for this reason the House must also be provided with this information, that the Commission has requested the use of the flexibility instrument, providing this proposal, in due time, with EUR 197 million.
Therefore, we are in favour of this proposal from the Committee on Budgets, but we would remind our fellow Members in this committee, and the Council, that they should come to an agreement with regard to the use of this instrument and provide the proposal with this EUR 197 million, which is necessary so that fishermen and the families affected can resolve this problem.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0363/2001) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission Green Paper Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply (COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS))
Before the vote
Madam President, I have noticed that there are not just a few minor linguistic errors.
Entire paragraphs of the text are different.
It looks like the translator has translated a different text.
Please could this be checked. And I should like to take this opportunity to say that errors have crept into Greek translations on other occasions.
If you spoke Greek you would understand what I am about to say.
In one section, the words tuberculosis and malaria have simply been transliterated into Greek instead of using the Greek terms.
I am very sorry, Mr Alyssandrakis.
I can only attempt to ensure that the versions in the various languages are properly monitored and checked.
I am told that this will be done and not only for the Greek version, because other versions are also affected by these mistakes.
We shall, therefore, ensure that everything is put right.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I should like to ask you to look into what this vote has cost European taxpayers.
I should also like you to make money available for a course through which the committee can learn to work together. It is quite outrageous that we should sit for an hour voting on what should have been resolved by the committee.
They really must get their bloody act together before long.
This endless piddling about cannot continue!
. (DE) Madam President, I deeply regret the fact that I must now recommend to my group that it reject my own report in the final vote, because I, like my group, really do not think that it is fair for a national problem to be brought before the European Parliament.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Madam President, I just wanted to follow up the previous point of order and ask when are we going to be able to debate the proposals in Mr Corbett's report - which I understand are stuck in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - so that this ludicrous procedure, with six pages of plenary amendments on one report, can be reformed.
We will be a laughing stock if we do not reform and get our House in order.
Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste 2000/2319(INI)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)]
Before the vote
Madam President, I should like to say that it states on the agenda that voting will be from 12 noon until 1 p.m. and that it will resume at 6.30 p.m.
I really do think that we ought to keep to the agenda.
I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that yesterday, we exceeded the time allocated and that consequently, Mr Posselt' s comment would have applied yesterday too.
I shall, therefore, consult the House: who wishes to continue?
(The House decided to continue voting)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0704/2001), by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks
Before the vote on paragraph 2
Given the uncertainty about the precise position of the President of the United States, I propose correcting the second part of paragraph 2 to say "including the search for effective procedures" instead of "the establishment of existing procedures" .
Madam President, there is a short oral amendment which has been agreed by all signatories of this compromise resolution and reads as follows: in paragraph 2, after the word 'terrorism' , a new sentence saying: 'Demands that national governments assume responsibility for additional security costs.'
If there are no objections to this oral amendment, the motion for a resolution I am putting to the vote will include the oral amendment that Mrs Foster has just explained.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, you have presided over 358 separate votes just now.
I hope colleagues will agree that this underlines the need to reform our Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, I gather from the display that the next report is the Bouwman report.
Does that mean that there is not going to be a debate on the WTO?
That debate will take place in December, Mr RÃŒbig, because, as I said, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to join us in time.
). I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Corbett's point about the votes in this plenary.
There are many committees in this Parliament, which do not have representation from every Member State.
Therefore we will find those people will be disenfranchised and that is becoming a greater problem as the European Union enlarges.
We must have the opportunity for members from every Member State to be able to vote on these reports and on these important amendments.
Madam President, a number of colleagues have remarked that it is a very bad thing to have so many votes on these occasions, but I would like to congratulate you on having kept us going.
I do not know for what purpose my constituents elected me if it was not to exercise discretion and choice in deciding what things to vote about.
I do not think we do a more important thing than cast our votes for and against proposals in this House and objecting to that is a very foolish thing.
Moreover, if one looks at the votes cast today, there were very few foregone conclusions: there were close votes on all the roll-call votes and that seems to me to show the need to test these matters by voting.
The idea that we should have fewer votes seems absurd.
That said, I should like to make a remark about the Watson report.
Once we have got to the point of having Community law, if that law is defied it seems perfectly obvious that there have to be within our nation States - and nations which are not States - criminal rules which uphold it, otherwise the States pass laws which they are not able to enforce and the Community becomes a laughing stock.
Of course, that requires a proper safeguard and proper defence rights.
These days we are thinking about defending our civilisation.
Our civilisation is to do with giving people proper rights of defence and I am sad at recent developments in the United Kingdom that seem to be ending these rights.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Madam President, although I had requested the floor to speak about ten documents, I shall limit myself to the explanations of vote on the Figueiredo and Chichester reports.
Proposal for a recommendation by Mr Watson (B5-0707/2001)
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has voted against this recommendation because implementing it would be synonymous with finally withdrawing vital and crucial policy areas - namely policing and criminal law as these relate to the ordering of our ordinary lives - from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferring them to the EU.
The recommendation is an absurd rhetorical demonstration of the parliamentary majority' s disconnection from reality, and in a double sense.
Firstly, it is - even now - politically unthinkable for the governments of the Member States to endorse the adoption of a recommendation that would make it possible to introduce EU criminal law and to establish a federal police service.
Secondly, adoption of the recommendation would be out of step with actual social conditions which indicate that Parliament' s dream of a European federal state will prove to be a nightmare.
There are not one, but fifteen, different juridico-political cultures and systems in the EU.
EU criminal law and an EU police service would, at best, severely damage the Member States' legal traditions and, at worst, consolidate a centralised system without democratic control and, moreover, do so without solving the problems faced by the Member States.
The core of European cooperation should be diversity and respect for other countries' legal systems.
Figueiredo report (A5-0372/2001)
Madam President, of course, I voted for the Figueiredo report on the conciliation committee text on combating social exclusion.
I have to say that, in Italy, first the centre government, allied with the European socialist parties, increased the minimum Italian pensions greatly, from EUR 382 to EUR 490 per month; now, Mr Berlusconi' s centre-right government has increased them from EUR 382 to EUR 490 for people over 70 years old and has extended the categories of people entitled to receive them.
I call upon the other 14 States of the European Union and the 12 candidate countries to help pensioners and elderly people in the same way, and not just pensioners and elderly people but non-pensioners as well, for the right to life belongs to all people, whatever their age.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and I wanted to take this opportunity to say what a pity it is that the European Parliament and the European institutions are not as popular as they might be with the electorate and the people of the European Union because we are not in a position to respond appropriately and quickly to problems which arise and which we are aware of.
We have already seen this once this week with the transport of animals and now we are seeing it again with cross-border payments.
Over the years the public have become angry and have been forced to suffer losses, and now we are in the situation that we are lagging behind; hopefully this initiative of Mrs Peijs will now at least be implemented quickly.
As early as the time of the introduction of the euro I brought this issue to the attention of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Monti, and I asked the Commission to take action on it as quickly as possible.
As we can see it has taken years, and that is a shame because so much damage has been done.
I believe - to stress this once more - that we need to listen more closely to what members of the public have to say, pay more attention to their problems and then take appropriate action.
I should also like to add that I had indicated that I wished to make an explanation of vote on the Flemming report.
Obviously this will no longer be necessary.
We have voted against the proposal for a regulation on cross-border payments in euro, which is designed to prevent banks from imposing charges, falsely giving the impression that such payments are free.
This absurdity, which is motivated only by the desire to make people think that the euro itself removes all commissions on cross-border payments runs the risk of proving expensive for all of us in all kinds of unwanted ways.
Furthermore, this proposal is of very dubious legal value.
Its legal basis is Article 95(1) of the EC Treaty, which deals with the establishment of the internal market.
It should, therefore, apply in the same way to the fifteen members of the Union.
It does not, however, because three Members of the Union are not part of the euro zone.
Given these circumstances, it would probably have been more appropriate to make the regulation' s legal basis Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty (last phrase) concerning measures to adopt for the introduction of the euro, and does not, therefore, apply to the countries participating in the single currency.
Article 123(4), however, requires unanimous approval in Council, and Article 95 only requires a qualified majority.
This is probably the factor that tipped the scales in making some countries less reticent.
It is nevertheless difficult to imagine the reality of the legal situation in countries that are not members of the euro zone, that are forced to pay a premium for cross-border transfers made out in a currency other than their own.
To this bizarre situation we can add the absence in the regulation of any article referring to possible sanctions against recalcitrant banks.
Of course there is none, since the Community has no jurisdiction on this matter.
The European Parliament has sought to close this loophole by voting for an amendment that calls on the Member States to define and adopt sanctions that will act as a "deterrent" , but this type of request has no legal force.
.
There are only 46 days remaining before euro notes and coins are introduced across the twelve countries that are participating within this new euro currency regime.
Phasing out national currencies and introducing a single new European currency is not an easy task.
There are over 290 million people who live within the twelve new euro zone countries alone.
However, I do believe that EU Governments have been very pro-active with regard to implementing broad information campaigns concerning the forthcoming practical changes.
It is very important that both small and large businesses contact their local banks and estimate how much currency they will require to carry out their businesses commencing 1 January next.
Surveys carried out within the EU have shown that banks are confident that all ATM machines will have all the necessary stock of the new euro currency notes.
The European Central Bank is satisfied that the requisite amount of the new euro notes will be dispersed to financial institutions in non-Euro zone countries.
I believe that the five-week period for the changeover is of the correct duration.
It would simply be too much to ask small companies in Europe to deal with two different currencies for what was originally planned as a six-month period for the changeover.
I welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in Europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover.
I, of course, support the need to introduce measures which reduce costs between domestic and cross-border payments.
There is a very strong consumer case to be made for changing the current system which is in operation.
We must strengthen confidence in the structures of the new euro currency.
However, this proposed regulation which is before us today does not discriminate between efficient and inefficient payment systems.
This regulation does not adequately address the relationship between the euro and other non-euro Member State currencies.
I believe it is fair to say that the euro tends to promote economic stability.
I think there has been clear evidence of this since the tragic terrorist attacks which took place in America last September.
We do not want to give international currency speculators an opportunity to play off one national European currency against another.
This would only result in broader devaluations in the value of the euro which is exactly what took place in the Autumn of 1992.
The euro is good news for European businesses.
It reduces export costs.
It is good news for European travellers and it contributes to the medium to long-term economic stability of the European Union.
I have voted in favour of Mrs Peijs' s report and wish to emphasise the quality of the work that our rapporteur produced.
I am very pleased that our House is finally making a statement on an issue as important as this.
The patience of European consumers has clearly reached its limit.
It has to be said that the banks have gone too far by making one promise after another that they fail to keep, content in their certainty that Brussels would not dare restrict their freedom to impose charges.
The Commission has now been negotiating with them for eleven years... in vain.
The banks have always refused to make the necessary investment to keep the cost of cross-border transfers down.
At the same time, the current system allows them to build up a considerable pot of money for themselves.
Consumers are not the only ones to bear these unjustified bank charges: they have a particularly serious effect on SMEs that export their products and the competitiveness of these companies suffers for no good reason.
This situation, which has been incomprehensible to SMEs since the advent of the euro on 1 January 1999, is in danger of becoming explosive, with the euro entering into circulation in less than two months.
How is it possible that the euro zone is only a single payment area for notes and coins, with all other means of payment being discouraged by punitive bank charges?
How can banks justify a transfer from Lille to Bastia costing less than the same operation between Lille and Brussels?
One fear still remains and that is that the banks will use their freedom to impose charges to increase domestic prices in order to compensate for the lack of earning opportunities in the euro zone.
Nevertheless, as Commissioner Bolkestein said, 'The banks know very well that the public has legitimate expectations' .
We can only hope that the banks really are aware of this.
The European Union is made up of sovereign states, each with a seat in the United Nations and, so far, each boasting its own currency.
The banks form part of national payment circuits and impose a heavy fine on cross-border payments and money transfers.
From January 2002, twelve EU Member States will act as if they are one country financially speaking.
The banks are in favour of this as long as this enlarges their own scope, but not if they have to forgo the additional payments from their customers.
It seems appealing to demand that the costs for national and cross-border payments in euros should become the same.
That has been Commissioner Bolkestein' s wish for a long time and is now also being proposed in the report by Mrs Peijs.
I can endorse this, as long as it means that banks forgo their levies on cross-border payments.
However, recital 5bis does not prevent new levies from being imposed on national payments by way of compensation for the fact that revenue from foreign payments has fallen by the wayside.
Instead of imposing a heavy fine on a small minority of payments, including mainly business payments, all payments will then attract a minor fine.
That means that the large majority of customers will incur higher costs.
I shall vote against this, as this is highly detrimental to the ordinary account holder.
Chichester report (A5-0363/2001)
Mr President, the document tabled by Mr Chichester addresses the issue of energy supply and, in places, advocates the use of nuclear energy.
I have already stated on a number of occasions that both I personally and the Pensioners' Party are in favour of using nuclear energy.
I would like to stress, in particular, before this House, that I feel the candidate countries' nuclear power stations should be allowed to operate at full capacity.
In my capacity as a member of the joint EU-Bulgaria interparliamentary committee, I recently visited the Bohunice power station in Slovakia and the Kozloduy power station in Bulgaria.
Where their reactors meet certain safety requirements, these States should be allowed to use nuclear energy, for they do not have the economic resources to sustain an additional unnecessary cost just so they can replace one type of energy with another.
Where nuclear power stations are safe, we must allow them to be used, particularly those in the candidate countries.
Mr President, I very much welcome the tabling of the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy for the security of energy supply.
It is with great regret that I see that yet again too little attention has been paid to renewable sources of energy.
We will only achieve the Kyoto target if we give preference to these sources of energy.
I am therefore very disappointed at the vote on the Chichester report because here too nuclear energy is still the preferred option.
With the consumption of energy increasing and the sources and reserves of mineral fuels decreasing, the energy supply issue is a very important aspect of the internal and external policy of the EU and the Member States.
The Chichester report may highlight the need to save energy, improve energy efficiency and develop more efficient transmission systems, but it places its hopes for resolving the problem in the liberalisation of the market and competition, on the one hand, and in controlling supplier countries, on the other.
This approach works to the benefit of more general imperialist interests and to the detriment of the workers and society as a whole, in both supplier and consumer countries, which are being sacrificed so that the multinationals which create and exploit recessions and provoke wars which allow them to control the energy-rich areas of the world can make a profit.
Energy policies to make use of domestic energy sources obey the same diktat, with adverse repercussions on grass-roots interests, growth and the supply of high-quality, safe and environmentally-friendly energy to the country as a whole.
The problem is exacerbated by the liberalisation of the energy market and the privatisation of power stations and transmission grids.
We consider that the strategically important energy sector (supply of raw materials, generation, transmission grids) should be in the public sector and should be subject to periodically adjusted national planning which takes account of national requirements and international circumstances.
Energy policy should safeguard cheap energy for grass-roots needs, guarantee the safety of workers and citizens and ensure that the environment is protected.
These should be primary objectives and should take precedence over any economic factors.
Transport policy needs to be revised so that greater use is made of public transport, renewable sources of energy need to be supported and encouraged and research is needed into the most efficient generating systems and the cheapest, least-polluting consumption systems.
The EU and the Member States need to respond to the need to protect the environment and to fail to reduce emissions to Kyoto levels is to practise wicked works.
Major climate problems, the hole in the ozone layer and so on must not be resolved at the expense of growth in the poorest countries, at the expense of the workers or by fatalistically accepting the destruction of our planet.
Workers in Europe and throughout the world and the 2 billion people with no access to electricity are demanding and fighting for a different energy policy which opposes imperialist interests and preferences and the monopolies which are usurping the energy sector.
A policy which respects and protects the environment, a policy which will create the foundations for humane living conditions.
This being so, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against the Chichester report.
By making as issue out of Europe' s energy dependence, the report is masking the fact that we are dependent mainly not so much on other countries as on the huge oil corporations which often also control other sources of energy.
This is the dependence that Europe paid a high price for during the oil crisis in 1973, when these corporations decided to impose a general price increase on oil to increase the profits of their less profitable wells.
It is this dependence on oil companies that has led to the 'serious risk of price instability in the short run and lack of resources in the long run' , which concerns the report.
It is not the unfair distribution of the world' s energy sources, a geological factor, that threatens the rational use of resources in a way that respects the natural environment, but rather the fact that their management is controlled by huge private groups, which are solely concerned with their profit margins, when they themselves are not suffering from the erratic fluctuations of the market or even of stock speculation.
The problem does not only affect Europe: the world' s resources cannot be managed rationally and distributed amongst everyone if a collective effort is agreed on at world level, which would mean an end to the stranglehold of private groups on these resources and a completely different organisation of the economy.
During the debate in plenary on Tuesday evening, I stated my support for the 'Chichester' package on the security of energy supply, despite its calls for the liberalisation of the energy sector that I could not have supported had they been proposed in isolation but which, as it happens, are part of a whole multifaceted and bold 'package' , which takes the European discussion on this matter forwards.
This is why I have voted in favour of the 'package' .
Incidentally, I still do not understand how someone can advocate a liberalisation that seeks to bring prices down and which takes the form of promoting the 'least costly' sources of energy and, on the other hand, complains about being increasingly dependent on external sources as consumption increases (or is not decreasing) due to the fact that prices are very (or too) low.
I hope one day to receive a clear explanation of this point from the 'founders' of liberalisation.
The Chichester report seeks to present a 'European strategy' for the security of energy supply.
It is very difficult, however, to discern in the resolution, even one clearly stated guideline.
It could be saying anything and its opposite.
The resolution dodges the real issues underpinning a 'strategy' .
Is it possible to restructure the energy sector without a real concerted public policy that is supported and has been fully discussed?
Can we leave things up to the 'market' , in other words, to the whim of private financial interests?
Is energy a 'common asset' or just a commodity?
To what extent is the nuclear risk acceptable?
The resolution is dotted with pipe dreams.
For example, in order to permit the renewal of nuclear power stations, it calls for "appropriate measures" that will guarantee the "elimination" of radioactive waste and the "safety" of the power stations.
This is asking the impossible.
Apart from being confused, the Chichester report falls in line with neoliberal policies.
Paragraph 18 wants to "promote further market opening in the EU" and paragraph 42 considers that "it is essential to complete the liberalisation of energy markets' ' .
Whereas only a public service policy can meet social and environmental requirements and guarantee "sustainable development" in this economic sector.
We are voting against the motion for a resolution.
- (PT) Some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur suggest that the increase in installed capacity of nuclear energy in Europe is crucial if we are to comply with the Kyoto protocol.
This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity.
All the information available suggests that the opposite is true.
The European Union has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4% between 1990 and 1999 and will be able to meet the quota for remaining reductions by 2012 (4%) through low cost measures.
According to data from the European Commission, we will be able to comply with Kyoto by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2.
The promotion of nuclear energy does not feature amongst these measures proposed by the European Commission in the European Climate Change Programme and the Framework Directive on Emissions Trading.
The issue of Member States' energy supply is a fundamental aspect of their security which falls mainly within the competence of national sovereignty.
Given the major interactions of energy choices, however, it might be useful to do as the Green Paper does and opt for a longer-term approach and study this issue at European level.
This study must, of course, be carried out without any ideological prejudices that might demonise or romanticise any particular source of energy.
Otherwise, we will be leaving rational discourse behind.
This is the approach adopted by the Chichester report, emphasising, as does the Green Paper, the need for Member States to maintain a balanced combination of energy sources, which gives nuclear energy its rightful place.
This is the only way not to make European countries more dependent on external sources.
It is also the only way to ensure that the European Union can fulfil its international commitments on limiting CO2 emissions.
Research and development in nuclear energy must, therefore, continue in order to build on our scientific and industrial lead in this field, in order to guarantee our countries maximum independence in the field of energy resources, to preserve the environment and to achieve a satisfactory elimination of waste end-products.
I am sorry, with regard to this last point, that the Caudron report has not attached sufficient priority to this line of research, which is crucial.
Unless we move ahead in this direction, the growth in demand will lead us fatally towards fossil fuels, which are as worthy of criticism in terms of the environment as they are problematic in terms of security of supply.
Flemming report (A5-0341/2001)
Mr President, just before I begin on the Flemming report I want to speak about the Katiforis report, which we rejected.
I feel very strongly that by rejecting that report we have done nothing today in this House to promote public health.
We should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness across the EU and that each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco.
The Commission's proposal would have helped people to stop smoking and it is very sad that we did not support this.
However, on to the matter at hand - the Flemming report.
Although the report was rejected, I should like to explain why I and my two colleagues from Scotland supported some of the amendments.
Firstly, we believe that, in line with Amendment No 3, no country may be obliged to hand over water against its will and free of charge.
The amendment speaks for itself, and that it is why we supported it.
Amendment No 5 was concerned with the more technical matter of water basins.
We agree that water basin areas are not suitable bases for water pricing policies in all regions.
Much of our water in Scotland is in inter-basin management and, therefore, we had to support it.
Thirdly, the rejection of the Flemming report probably was ensuring that no one report could be hijacked by such a national interest.
I hope we will continue the discussion on water, as so many of our citizens are very concerned with this issue.
The report fully endorses the Commission communication, the philosophy of which is to treat a natural resource, water, as a commodity and as a basis for implementing other negative sectoral policies, such as agricultural policy.
We categorically oppose this philosophy and the negative proposals tabled in order to implement it.
The report is geared towards "pricing policies to enhance the sustainability of water resources", which involve recovering the cost of water-related services and limiting the consumption and use of water by making it more expensive.
At the same time, the report is gripped by the familiar "polluter pays" principle, resulting in new incentives and profits for business.
The price - and it is a very high price - of the measures proposed on the hypocritical pretext of supposedly securing the sustainability of water resources, will be paid by the consumer, for which read farmers in southern Europe, given that, as both the Commission communication and the report state, it is they who consume the most water and pay less than the "real cost" for it.
This policy will cause costs to rise and will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms, which are already suffering the disastrous consequences of the common agricultural policy.
Predictably, the report divides the cost into financial, environmental and resource costs and considers that only the financial cost has been calculated in the past.
Thus, to refer to the report yet again, it states that the cost of building and operating dams on rivers due to over-extraction (by farmers) "may be passed on to the users" or, if water needs to be treated because it has been contaminated, for example by fertilisers, then farmers should pay the cost.
We are opposed to any attempt to treat water as a commodity.
We categorically refuse to allow the Commission to appoint itself as the guardian of water resources and, on the pretext of "encouraging sustainable water use" to add, yet again, grist to the mill of private interests and allow them to penetrate and operate in what is a purely public utility sector.
The entire endeavour is nothing more than yet another chapter in the Community's catastrophic policy. It will work to the detriment of consumers and farmers and, at the same time, champion the promotion of other policies, such as the policy to wipe out the agricultural sector.
Water resources cannot be protected and managed rationally using suppressive pricing policies and collection measures paid for by the consumer.
Only a few large companies charging a high price for their "environmentally-friendly" profile stand to benefit from this policy, which gives them yet another opportunity to rake in vastly inflated profits.
The report' s recitals state that water "is not a commercial product like any other" and that "access to water is an inalienable human right" .
Such statements, however, carry little weight with Vivendi, Suez and other huge corporations, who have appropriated the water 'market' for themselves in order to squeeze enormous profits from it, with the blessing of the State.
These statements look more like a desperate plea, considering the industries that pollute and ruin the planet' s resources for the greater good of their shareholder' s bank accounts.
In the twenty-first century, at a time when the world has never had such great technical capability, the fact that an entire swathe of humanity does not have access to running water, let alone drinking water is largely due to the social barbarity of capitalism.
The issue of water, which is vital for hundreds of millions of human beings far exceeds the geographical boundaries of Europe and, if we are to solve it, and many other problems, humanity would need to put an end to the dictatorship of the market, of profit and of competition.
The rapporteur supports this system and envisages the "sustainable management of water resources" by means of pricing and rate setting.
This would mean, once again, that those with the means, both individuals and particularly industrial groups, could continue to waste water, even to pollute, whilst others who are poorer, will continue to do without.
Society should provide water, this vital commodity, free of charge to everyone and its management should be planned according to the real needs of the population and subject to democratic control.
It is quite clear that the current organisation of the economy, based on the quest for profit, is fundamentally incapable of guaranteeing a "sustainable management of water resources" and consequently represents a threat to the future of mankind, in this area as in many others.
People themselves consist largely of water, and the bulk of our food is also made up of water.
Similarly, we very often deal with water in our jobs and households.
Without a continuous supply of water, we would not survive.
Whoever appropriates water, takes possession of their fellow people. That is why the water supply should not end up in private hands.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy rightly concluded that access to water is a human right and water is therefore not a commercial product.
The question now arises as to how we manage water shortages and water pollution.
The fair principle that the polluter pays is useful to cream profits from polluting companies, but not a sound argument to considerably increase the costs for households.
It is better to increase the amount of clean and fresh drinking water available by desalinating sea water than by digging deeper for ground water or by redirecting rivers to storage reservoirs.
There was a time when the Soviet Union wanted to fill the Aral Sea with water from rivers which flow to the North Pole.
These days, Spain wants to tap half of the Ebro' s water to promote tourism in southern Spain.
This will be at the expense of fauna and flora in the current river basin.
Thanks to criticism on this, the Right has blocked this decision.
This proves that money and prestige are still worth more than sustainable environmental management.
, in writing.
(PT) Despite protests from Portuguese NGOs and myself, the Portuguese government is insisting on adopting an uncompromising approach to the Alqueva project, by preparing to fill the dam to a height of 152m.
This Communication and the report on sustainable water pricing show that filling the dam to a height of 139m, as I have been proposing, would not only enable more than 600 000 trees and habitats of enormous importance to be saved, but would also be more sustainable in economic terms.
We risk deforesting to a height of 152m and then, due to the price of water, seeing that filling to a height of 139m is enough for agricultural requirements.
Over the past few days, Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Alexander de Roo, has insinuated both in this House and in the media that the Liberal shadow rapporteur, Chris Davies, has changed his position under pressure from the Aznar Government in connection with the possible election of Pat Cox to President of Parliament.
This was an absurd and unfounded allegation.
Mr Davies has conscientiously attempted to reconcile his own dislike of the Spanish project (shared by myself) with the position of the majority of the liberal group that it is inappropriate to criticise a specific country in a general report.
Today' s vote illustrated that our group has abstained and that Mr Davis and various Green members of the ELDR Group have voted in favour of the criticism levelled at Spain.
However, by voting against the Liberal amendment (which, in turn, led to the rejection of the entire report), the Greens have missed a major opportunity of stopping the Spanish project on the basis of general principles.
Although the intentions of the Group of the Greens may have been noble, their method was neither effective nor conclusive.
At the moment, the European Parliament does not have a single position in this weighty matter.
Riis-JÃžrgensen report (A5-0373/2001)
Shipbuilding has for years benefited from considerable subsidies from Member States and from the European institutions.
This has not stopped it from shedding its workforce or even from closing entire dockyards and sacking their employees.
Dockyard owners are attempting to have these subsidies extended in the name of competition, but the money that would be given to them would continue to increase the profit of these companies and to be shared with their shareholders even if the latter withdraw their capital as soon as the dockyards become less profitable and invest elsewhere, without a care for the fate of the workers.
This is made easier for them by the fact that many dockyards are tied to industrial groups such as Alstom, which have interests in several sectors and which make redundancies in some whilst receiving subsidies in others.
As we have no intention of giving any kind of help to the shareholders of the huge shipbuilding corporations, we have voted against the report.
If shipbuilding is necessary for Europe' s economy, it must be brought under state control. The answer is not to subsidise its private owners with money that we will never see again.
I have voted in favour of this proposal because it is the lesser of two evils.
Nevertheless, this feet-dragging over unfair competition, now with South Korea, is allowing business to shift to the Far East, leading to the eradication of all shipbuilding activity in the European Union, including repairs and renovation as well as the building of new vessels.
Without operational and technologically up-to-date shipyards, our strategies for maritime safety, employment and regional cohesion will be at risk, and will be hard to recover with palliative measures.
Katiforis report (A5-0352/2001)
. (IT) Like all the Members in Chamber, I feel that the protection and safeguarding of human health are vital.
I therefore consider that it is of the utmost importance to uphold the position calling for the introduction of both a minimum excise duty of 57 % and a minimum payment - EUR 70 - with the aim of increasing the sales price of tobacco.
The measure is very important in that it will discourage regular consumers from using tobacco. Furthermore, it will have a preventive effect in that it will discourage those tempted to use tobacco for the first time from doing so.
As I have already pointed out in a written question - reference number P-2140/99 - to the European Commission, I find it absurd that we should increase European financing and contributions to tobacco growers while, at the same time, declaring that we are working to combat smoking.
I therefore call upon the European Parliament to support this measure and throw some light on the matter.
Quite clearly, the proviso must be that the Member States, as Community bodies, also increase their endeavours to prevent, control and curb illegal trading and trafficking in cigarettes.
.
(IT) I voted for the Katiforis legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products, which calls upon the Commission to withdraw its proposal for a number of reasons unanimously upheld by the entire Italian section of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (Republicans, Democrats and members of the Italy of Values party).
The proposal to revise the current subsidies for tobacco growing would have had a disastrous effect on the economies of entire rural areas which are some of the most disadvantaged in the European Union, as can be seen from a recent European statistical analysis carried out by Eurostat.
The Commission addresses the 'tobacco issue' purely from the point of view of health, which is why it attempts to question the provision of Community aid to growers and goes so far as to propose an early revision of the COM in tobacco in order to reduce quotas and cut subsidies to the sector.
We feel that this opinion errs in that it is too rash, and I am glad to say that it was amended at the Gothenburg Summit.
We are convinced that it would be wrong to penalise an agricultural sector which is at the heart of the economy of countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.
Instead of reducing cigarette consumption, the Commission' s proposal would have created nothing but problems for manufacturers, who would have been forced to change the process of importing supplies from third countries with the result that national productions would have been replaced by lower quality imports.
Lastly, we feel that the position of those who advocate combating smoking by abolishing aid to tobacco growers is ambiguous.
Strangely, in fact, the Member States which do not grow tobacco but which have not banned smoking would receive sums benefiting their Northern European style of agriculture, which is already sufficiently subsidised, and, what is more, they would hypocritically continue to rake in millions of euro in taxes and excise duties on tobacco products and accessories.
SchÃ¶rling report (A5-0356/2001)

To its credit, the SchÃ¶rling report points out that "The EU is the world's leading producer of chemicals" and that "it is high time that we developed a new strategy for controlling chemicals" . We know that the "vast majority of existing chemicals - that have been on the market for at least 20 years - have never been properly tested" and we discover that certain serious diseases are on the increase and that "a link between these diseases and exposure to chemicals is likely" .
The report therefore recommends the rigorous control of chemicals available on the market, testing prior to any distribution of these products - and the withdrawal of any products that do not pass these tests - and a range of restrictive measures for manufacturers and commercial distributors, intended to force them to guarantee minimum safety standards.
This position does consider the interests of the public but is unpopular with the Union des Industries Chimiques, a French employers' organisation which, in a letter to Members of the European Parliament, protests about the constraints that we are attempting to impose on companies that manufacture or sell chemical products.
This shameless lobbying by chemical company owners is in itself enough to make us vote for the SchÃ¶rling report and for the measures it proposes, even if the rapporteur elsewhere declares herself to be in favour of the market.
.
Both the White Paper from the Commission and the report drawn up by Mrs Schorling are flawed, the latter fundamentally.
The report is based on the general assumption that there are a large number of chemicals that pose a threat to both human health and the environment, and ignores the positive health and environmental benefits to society arising form many man-made chemicals.
Paragraph 16 of the report seeks to extend the REACH system to cover chemicals manufactured in volumes of under one tonne per year; this will lead to a possible twenty-fold increase in the number of chemicals requiring authorisation, and an impossible workload for those given that task.
The scope should be limited to those chemicals produced in volumes over one tonne, as set out in the White Paper.
Paragraph 38, which sets out which substance shall be classified as being of very high concern, is too broad for any authorisation system to be workable.
The definition should be restricted to CMR (categories 1 and 2), and POP substances, as defined in the Stockholm Convention.
The provisions of the report will lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of tests carried out on animals.
A report by the Institute of Environmental Health in the United Kingdom, estimated that 12.8 million animals will be needed in the testing of 30,000 chemicals.
These figures have been echoed by many European animal welfare groups.
The rapporteur recognises this problem, but places too much faith in the availability and acceptability of non-animal tests.
Furthermore, to gather "base-set" level of information simply for chemicals manufactured in volumes over one tonne per year will take approximately 36 years alone, according to the IEH report.
The timescale set out in the report (2008) is thus completely unrealistic.
The European chemicals industry has been consulted far too late, and its attempts at self-regulation (e.g. Product Stewardship, the Long Range Research Initiative and "Confidence in Chemicals") have been completely ignored by the rapporteur in this report.
Since the proposals in the report look likely to increase the administrative burden on the industry (particularly SMEs), as well as dent its competitiveness on a global scale, this is a serious oversight.
.
(DE) I have just voted against the SchÃ¶rling Report.
The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, to which I belong, did not manage to secure a majority in favour of its constructive amendments.
What has now been adopted has clearly been influenced too much by ideology.
Of course this is about environmental safety, but it is also about competitive and innovative jobs in the chemical industry.
Over the last few weeks I have been investigating the consequences of the SchÃ¶rling Report by talking to those whom it will affect.
I have visited production plants and had discussions with management, workers and unions.
None of those parties is calling into question the aim of the Commission's White Paper, which is to secure the sustainability of the chemical industry.
From an ecological point of view, we obviously need the greatest possible protection of the environment and consumers.
From an economic point of view, we need uniform basic conditions so as to ensure that there is fair competition for SMEs, users and processors.
From a social point of view this is about having a high level of health protection and high standards of industrial safety.
At least we were able to prevent the registration requirement for substances with a production volume of one tonne per year from being introduced.
As it is, the current classification of substances above 10 tonnes per year and the reporting requirement before they are put on the market is only being managed by the authorities with great difficulty.
The European People's Party Group did succeed in one respect: there was no majority in favour of double testing all chemicals.
This does not increase safety and is costly in terms of time and money; incidentally it is completely unnecessary because the authorities already examine these data.
I do not consider it acceptable to find substitutes for dangerous substances and methods which should otherwise be banned.
You cannot define a substance as 'dangerous' on the basis of its properties, but only on the basis of its uses.
Take a knife: it is extremely useful at home and in everyday life, but it becomes dangerous if it is used as a weapon for anything from attacking people to hijacking aircraft.
It is also regrettable that it has been agreed that confidential data should be made public: if production volumes, procedures or special compositions, which account for a market advantage, all have to be declared, then we may as well do away with competition right now.
This is the lifeblood of our companies.
Any competitor can easily imitate ingenious systems.
We need to establish once and for all which data are subject to property rights and which are not.
Before the second reading in Parliament, I hope that the three committees working on this will put their heads together and come up with a more balanced proposal.
- (PT) I am delighted, not only with the content of the European Commission' s new policy on chemicals, but also with the importance it is attaching to this policy, as clearly demonstrated in the strategy approved by the European Union for the 'Rio+10' Conference, which is due to take place in 2002.
I welcome, in particular, the following points:
1) A complete ban, within a generation, in other words by 2020, of discharges and emissions into the environment of all dangerous substances.
2) The creation of a single system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), replacing the current system that treats new substances and existing ones differently.
3) The adoption of the precautionary principle, through reversing the burden of proof for substances that cause great concern.
It will now fall to the manufacturer to prove that a product is not dangerous.
I welcome the SchÃ¶rling report but prefer, where the tonnage threshold is concerned, the position of the European Commission.
This system, if it proves feasible, will protect Europe' s citizens.
Using the same system to evaluate substances produced in volumes below and above one tonne per year will make the system too cumbersome and, therefore, contrary to objectives that have been defined.
I wish to explain my reasons for voting in favour of this report as amended.
First of all, I feel that it adopts a balanced position, which will improve environmental protection and public health on the one hand and which maintains the competitiveness of the chemical industry on the other, in line with the strategy for sustainable development adopted in GÃ¶teborg.
We must understand the fact that only a tiny minority of the more than 100 000 chemical substances in existence have to date been tested and that, furthermore, they are being produced in greater numbers each year.
Consequently, only 14% of chemical substances produced in a quantity of more than one tonne are given a classification under the current system.
The tragic events in Toulouse recently demonstrated the urgent need to close this gap in our knowledge.
At the same time, we need to create a system of registration, assessment and authorisation that is 'manageable' for public authorities and that the industry can, in due course, supplement with the necessary data.
The report' s approach seems to be equally balanced because, apart from purely environmental considerations, it takes account of various socio-economic aspects of prospective legislation, not least the fact that workers in the chemical industry are more exposed, and the specific constraints affecting small and medium-sized enterprises.
Similarly, the report favours transparency whilst respecting data protection and industrial secrecy, which I think is to be welcomed.
Clear references to the precautionary principle and the substitution principle have, furthermore, been added to the Commission text.
Lastly, one of the most important points, to my mind, is still the requirement for all substances to be registered, even if some of them are only registered in a simplified form.
It is often the substances produced in smaller quantities that are the most dangerous for health or for the environment.
I also feel that the timetables put forward in the report are appropriate because they are realistic.
I am very pleased that the White Paper will be followed up with a range of legislative proposals by the Commission and I look forward with great interest to seeing them.
The Committee on the Environment' s vote on this report sends a clear message to industry and to the national authorities to thoroughly monitor chemical substances, and this must be accompanied by the elimination of substances that are toxic and harmful to health and to the environment.
We therefore fully support the approach of this report which improves, on a number of points, the already ambitious Commission proposal.
Having said that, in order to be understood, our message must also be balanced.
This is why we support a pragmatic approach and reject a raft of unrealistic demands that would heavily penalise the European chemical industry.
I wish to point out that this industry directly or indirectly involves no less than 5 million jobs.
I shall turn first of all to paragraph 16, which calls for the registration of all substances of less than one tonne in weight: this means that 100 000 products are involved instead of the 30 000 proposed by the Commission, tens of thousands of files, impossible bureaucracy, a nightmare for the numerous SMEs in the sector and all of this for products which, for the most part, never reach the market.
Extending the scope of the authorisation procedure (paragraph 38) is also unfeasible: in order to avoid an unmanageable situation, we call, in Amendment No 68, for substances for which there is no proof of toxicity to be excluded.
In conclusion, although we must send a message that is powerful, it must also be credible.
Sending a declaration of war to industry, to the workers and to the national authorities seems neither appropriate nor productive.
Given the risk that chemicals present to people' s health and to the environment, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe it to be obvious that, in accordance with the principle of 'no data, no marketing' , chemicals which have not undergone certain tests should not be allowed to be marketed, either.
Furthermore, we support the substitution principle which has long been a well-established principle of Swedish chemicals policy.
In the same way, we believe that a reversed burden of proof should apply to substances that give cause for concern, which means that it is the industry, not the authorities, which has to demonstrate that a subject can be used in an acceptable way.
Because chemicals can involve significant risks in smaller quantities too, we believe that chemicals in quantities of less than a tonne which are imported to, or produced within, the EU should also be covered by the new system.
In that way, we shall in quite a few respects be departing from the position adopted by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats.
Corbey report (A5-0323/2001)
These days, outrageous packaging is a form of advertising in order to entice buyers.
A great deal of material is wasted on it.
It sounds environmentally aware to blame the consumers who buy packaged food or packaged products.
However, those consumers do not create waste themselves, but are left with it following their purchases.
They become the victim of conditional sales, because these days, it is often impossible to buy anything without wrapping.
That is why we need to tackle the production and sale of waste at source instead of focusing on the consumers.
In the proposed resolution, Mrs Corbey is right to make manufactures and retailers responsible for the prevention of the production of packaging waste and notes that precious little has been achieved since the 1994 packaging directive.
The European Commission remains disinclined to present fresh proposals, and the Member States implement earlier recycling agreements with a delay of years.
The rapporteur' s proposal is still torn between two ideas.
I wholeheartedly agree with her attempt to prevent waste.
However, I differ with her on the proposal to get the consumer to pay more for all that waste.
Re-use may be important, but is not the most important solution.
Salafranca SÃ¡nchez Negra report (A5-0336/2001)
We are voting against the report in spite of the sound initiatives it contains concerning partnership between the EU and the Latin American countries on, for example, conflict prevention, development cooperation and combating poverty and the drugs trade.
Our opposition is due to the fact that a number of the proposals in the report take supranational cooperation on, for example, defence, security and foreign policy, as well as on areas of institutional, legal and internal concern as something that goes without saying in the EU.
We believe that cooperation in the aforesaid areas can be fully engaged in through intergovernmental cooperation.
The few words the report contains on "health, education and the fight against abject poverty" , "the fight against drugs" and "protection of the environment" , some of the objectives that the European Union claims it is promoting in that part of the world, are nothing more than a smokescreen for considerably more disreputable intentions.
By proposing that "the aim of the new agreement should ultimately be the bilateral and preferential liberalisation, on a gradual and reciprocal basis, of the trade in all kinds of goods and services between the two regions, in accordance with WTO rules," the countries of the European Union are showing that they could not care less about the fate of the peoples of Latin America.
They would like, first and foremost, to make up for their slowness in penetrating the Latin American markets, which are already in a parlous state due to the presence of even more powerful predators, such as the North American multinationals.
Instead of the promised development, the opening up of the markets to huge companies and to the financial establishment has plunged Latin America into poverty.
At least 224 million Latin Americans live in abject poverty, in other words, more than 40% of the population of that region!
And there is not even any discussion of cancelling the debts that are strangling these countries.
We have consequently voted against this report.
- (PT) The Rio summit of 28/29 June 1999 marked the beginning of a new phase in bi-regional relations with a view to creating a strategic partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The main objectives of the new Joint Strategy must, in line with the priorities adopted in Rio, be political, such as with the extension of the Bi-Regional Political Agenda; the update and revision of political dialogue at ministerial level and the creation of a EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly; economic, financial and commercial, such as the conclusion of various Association Agreements and the creation of a EU-Latin America Free Trade Area, which is planned for 2010, and social and cultural, such as the creation of a Bi-regional Solidarity Fund and a global plan to combat drugs, amongst others.
I therefore give my total support to the rapporteur' s position reiterating the need to establish the bi-regional strategic partnership approved at the Rio summit and in the recommendation to the European Council with a view to approving the EU' s common strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean, on the basis of the objectives established in the Rio summit' s priorities.
Lastly, the report highlights the need to improve cooperation on the basis of a sustained and integrated partnership, with a view to promoting human development and the development of civil society and the consequent benefits to all levels of society.
Motion for a resolution on air transport (B5-0702/2001)
Claiming that the airlines are suffering as a result of the 11 September attacks on the United States is a barefaced lie.
Although some carriers have had problems, these are not new and not all airlines are in that position. Far from it.
Air France' s share dividends, for example, have increased by 22%, and this happened three days after the attacks on New York and Washington.
It has just bought out Air Afrique and brought Alitalia under its wing as well as the Czech airline CSA.
And, like other large European airlines, it is also doing very well out of the bankruptcies of AOM-Air LibertÃ©, Sabena and Swissair.
This is the result of giving free rein to the market, which national and European leaders claim should govern everything, the economy and the fate of workers.
In recent years in Europe, this has led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the air transport sector alone, which does not cause national and European leaders to bat an eyelid because huge profits are consequently pocketed by the companies' shareholders, such as the incredibly wealthy Baron SeilliÃšre, the French "bosses' boss" .
The attacks of 11 September have simply been an excuse for the capitalists in the air transport sector to receive new subsidies while pursuing their offensive against their employees.
And they have been aided and protected in this endeavour by the various national governments.
We have seen this again recently in France, in Belgium and in Switzerland with companies going bankrupt and sacking tens of thousands of employees, at no cost at all to the key players who are largely responsible for these bankruptcies, such as Baron SeilliÃšre.
We have, therefore, voted against this motion for a resolution which is cynical enough to claim that it is for the sake of employment that it wants to give further subsidies to the companies and capitalists in the air transport sector, who are already responsible for making hundreds of thousands of people redundant.
The reason why I am unable to vote for this resolution is that it is mainly founded on the idea of protecting the expansion of aviation which, until recently, was deemed self-evident.
To date, this expansion has posed a major problem for the environment, leading to increasing levels of pollution, growing insecurity and increasing pressure on public space for airports.
Furthermore, aviation firmly had the edge on railways in terms of taxes, because kerosene is still not taxed, while all forms of travel on the ground are.
Even before 11 September, there was every reason to search for possibilities to stop and reverse this expansion.
The fact that the number of passengers has now dropped dramatically should not be a reason for supporting airline companies by granting even more tax money, but rather a reason for investing in the improvement of other forms of intra-European passenger transport.
A surcharge on the aircraft rates which have taken a nose dive over the last few years due to competition can cover the dramatic upsurge in insurance premiums.
There is no reason for injecting more public funding into aviation.
However, that money is needed desperately to protect the position of the workers of airline companies.
They thought for years that they had a secure, government-protected job in a growth industry, but the industry is now shrinking or even going bankrupt.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.00 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer
The next item is the report (A5-0348/2001) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer [COM(2000) 832 - C5-0017/2001 - 2001/0008(COD)].
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before we start the debate on my report - and I hope you are also keeping an eye on the time - I should like to raise a matter in connection with the way in which we will be dealing with this report further.
It was scheduled to be debated before twelve noon. It has overrun.
There is nothing that can be done about this, for that is how it is in this House.
It is a report in the framework of the codecision procedure on employees' rights and insolvency.
I, as rapporteur, have nothing against the fact that we are debating it now, but I do disagree with the fact that we would subsequently vote on it during a very vague gathering of votes later on this afternoon.
I should therefore like to request - and I have already discussed this with the larger groups - to decide beforehand that we will debate the report now but that we will postpone the vote to the brief part-session in Brussels and possibly to a later date, although I am very much opposed to this.
That also gives us the opportunity of tabling a number of amendments and changes as a whole.
It seemed a totally uncontroversial report, but nevertheless, there are a number of elements which require further discussion.
That is why I would ask to postpone the vote until the next part-session.
I do not know whether you can respond to this now.
Thank you, Mr Bouwman, I have taken note of your request.
We can have one speaker in favour of your request and one speaker against.
Who would like to speak out in favour?
That is Mrs Van den Burg.
You have the floor for one minute.
I should like to support the request because in my view, it is indeed inappropriate to be voting on a report in the framework of the codecision procedure in a very small gathering of this Parliament.
Furthermore, it will probably give us some more time to consider other compromises for issues which are currently controversial, because it is also a complex report which contains a number of ambiguities about the different amendments.
I would therefore like to support the request.
Thank you, Mrs Van den Burg.
Mr Gollnisch would like to speak against the request.
You have one minute.
I do not really need a minute, Madam President. I requested the floor on a point of order, but, in fact, my point fully echoes the concerns of the rapporteur.
I would like to know whether the Commission might be able to give us any indication of its reasons for withdrawing its communication initially scheduled on the agenda on the World Trade Organisation and, possibly, when this important communication might be given.
Thank you, Mr Gollnisch, I shall deal with that request in a moment, but let us first finish the point that is on the agenda, namely the request by Mr Bouwman.
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee) I would now like to give the floor to Mrs Diamantopoulou and give her the opportunity to state briefly why the WTO debate has been taken off the agenda.
Madam President, I just wish to say that it was impossible for Mr Lamy to be here because the WTO meeting lasted longer than expected.
So the Commission will certainly make a statement to Parliament on the WTO, but I cannot say when that will be.
Mr Lamy will come here as soon as he can.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, I can only endorse what you have just said.
I myself have only just returned from Doha, and it was a tough negotiating round.
Mr Lamy only landed in Brussels at 6 a.m. this morning, so I trust we can all be accommodating in this matter.
Mr Bouwman, I am giving you, as rapporteur, the floor for five minutes to present your report.
I should like to express my thanks once again, for the broad support for the proposals.
This might well be a Pyrrhic victory, but we shall have to wait and see.
I wanted to raise the following matter.
We have here a document on employees' rights in the event of insolvency, that is to say when a business is no longer able to meet its financial obligations.
It is a revision of Council Directive 80/987EEC with a number of improvements on what was in there before.
A directive such as this aims to give a minimum level of protection in the event of insolvency.
Almost at the same time that I was appointed rapporteur for this dossier, a group of people turned up from the Sintel company in Spain - a company that was split off from Telefonica, sold by them, in fact. They had been campaigning in Madrid for months because they had not been paid for months.
In other words, in addition to what I already knew at the time, this realistic description was sufficient to show me at first-hand how significant this report, concealed behind a mass of insolvency terminology, is.
The old document, of course, dates back to 1980.
A great deal has changed since then, especially within the labour markets, in terms of types of employees and descriptions of the same, the economy has become more globalised and internationalised, there are more businesses that operate both within a certain country and outside it.
In addition, there are still cases where it is unclear which country ought to pay out social security benefits.
Of course, there have been a number of procedures for the Court of Justice to deal with, and all these aspects combined have led to the Commission presenting a proposal to change the existing directive.
The three main problems at the time were: the concept of insolvency, the placing of a time-limit on the guarantee and, particularly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension.
I have great admiration for those who have submitted the Commission proposals and who have tabled a few amendments following detailed discussions.
These mainly pertain to the new legal basis following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the clarification of the scope and the possible scrapping of the annexes in which quite a few groups are mentioned which can be excluded or not, as the case may be, the new definition of the term 'intervention' and especially the new provisions establishing the guarantee fund that covers cross-border cases.
In my view, it is important to revisit what I describe as the scope as a whole, for the question as to which categories could still be exempt is still subject to possible debate, especially in the field of domestic staff and the so-called share fishermen.
If I had my way, I would scrap this as a whole, as I have also said during the debate.
I think that the Commission would also be in favour of this, but a number of countries provide for exemption provisions, and we do not want to make life too difficult for them.
What we do consider important is that the Commission has meanwhile included a number of elements which were already being developed within this labour market, where, for example, part-time workers, workers with a temporary agency employment relationship, or workers with fixed-term contracts, are concerned via existing directives in these intervention directives.
Since we are as yet unsure about the implications of this, we have to point out - as have many, as will be clear in a moment - that these days, there are an ever increasing number of categories of self-employed, including the quasi self-employed as they are referred to by some, without staff, with staff who would or would not qualify, and then especially those without staff.
Those with staff are, in fact, employers.
In addition, we still have categories of home workers - mind the translation in this case - because it literally means those working from home, and this could well be the topic of a number of discussions.
In fact, it would also be very useful if some progress were made in the legislative work in line with the discussion in the framework of the social dialogue on modernising labour relations, and that is why we made a number of proposals that are now before you.
In this connection, I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to back amendments which pertain to the self-employed without staff, so as to open the debate with the Council in any case.
I should like to point out that what is at issue is a codecision procedure and that we will be entering into negotiations after second reading in order to be able to take a step forward in the field of social security and social policy in Europe.
Madam President, it is a little odd that I should have to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but that is because Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who has written the opinion for Mr Bouwman' s report - on which I should like to congratulate him warmly - is unable to attend due to a change in schedule.
I can, in fact, be relatively brief about the opinion.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has particularly attempted to underline the legal aspects of this directive.
A number of elements have been adopted, while a number of other elements have not been adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In any case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market deems it extremely important for the opinion to be thought-out well.
That is why it is also important to return it to the committee, so that it can re-examined very carefully.
That also - and perhaps mainly - applies to the position of the self-employed.
Indeed, I welcome the fact that the self-employed fall within its scope, at least the self-employed who can be compared to employees.
However, there is, of course, the risk that we give people who we actually do not want to fall within the scope of this definition at all, a tremendous opportunity, turning them into a kind of preferred creditor in a bankruptcy.
I am not certain whether in the texts as they are worded now, sufficient distinction is being drawn between the two situations, in fact.
That is a problem that will require further examination, also in terms of the position of the self-employed.
Madam President, Commissioner, before I start my speech I would like to inform Mr Bouwman that the company he was referring to is the Sintel company, which went bankrupt, forcing unemployment on a large number of its employees. However, several months ago the Spanish Government took on the responsibility of making backdated wage payments to Sintel' s employees, relocating or finding other such solutions for all those affected.
I say this so that you may be fully informed, Mr Bouwman.
Now I will move on to my speech on this report.
The document we are debating refers to the proposal for amending Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of national laws relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.
Mr Bouwman has, in fact, given a very clear example of this situation.
The amendment aims to take into account changes to insolvency law in Member States and the need for consistency with other Community directives on labour law already adopted.
All of this should be based on a political will to provide employees with a minimum degree of protection under Community law in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.
The difficulties involved in achieving the intended objective of the Directive are, in my opinion, threefold: firstly, the concept of insolvency; secondly, the complexity of the arrangement introduced to allow a time and quantity limits to be placed on the guarantee; thirdly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension.
With the aim of clarifying the situation, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has once again tabled two amendments: No 16, which includes cases of externalisation or similar, subcontracts, the 'fake self-employed' , etc., all of which could conceal a true employment contract.
In our opinion, we need to reveal the truth before protective methods are implemented, to protect the salaried employee.
To not do this would be to open the floodgates which would quickly exhaust the fund in question.
Amendment No 17 clarifies the notion of protectable earnings from the corresponding national fund and prevents fraud.
All of this is inherent to the protective nature of labour legislation and is inspired by the desire to clearly define the concepts needed for the fund to serve its purpose.
This is a clarification of ideas which aids progress towards legal certainty and harmonisation.
Regrettably, this is a case which, as we have recently witnessed with another Belgian company, is taking place in large companies, due to the restructuring of these companies and the relations which currently exist in the economic world.
Madam President, I do not know whether this afternoon was the first time that you have been in the chair, presiding over Parliament.
If it is, congratulations. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his exceptionally good report and sound preparations for this dossier.
I fear that in the current climate, the report is indeed very topical and that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.
All the more reason for ensuring that we protect those employees who are faced with bankruptcy and suspension of payment.
That is the rationale underlying the preparations for this report.
I am also pleased that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have reached overwhelming agreement.
There are a few loose ends that need tying up, a few points on which we do not yet see eye to eye completely.
A moment ago, I heard Mr Pronk say that it is indeed possible that there are still a number of misunderstandings concerning amendments.
I am thinking in particular of the point he made, namely the fact that on the one hand, we also want a number of self-employed, notably self-employed who are very much like employees, to fall within the scope of the regulation, but on the other hand, this should not open the floodgates to mutual aid between employers and service providers who would be able to use those funds.
We are agreed on the intention. We should use the time we now have until the actual vote to consider whether those misunderstandings can be removed and whether this joint intention can be expressed in a compromise amendment.
In my view, the point about the self-employed is a very important one, particularly in this dossier.
However, it also crops up in a number of other dossiers.
That is why I should like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to this point and ask him whether the Commission could show some more initiative both on this matter and on the matter of defining which categories should in fact be comparable with employees.
This is not only of paramount importance for the issue of insolvency, of course, but also for a lot of other aspects of employment protection and labour law.
Those definitions in European law are still left for the Member States to deal with.
We have noticed that there are rather considerable discrepancies between them.
As cross-border employment increases, and this will become ever more popular in the European Union, it will mean that we will be increasingly faced with different definitions and different groups which will cause disruption to labour market relations.
Enlargement in particular is a huge cause for concern, as we have already witnessed in the past and are witnessing at the moment in the EU' s border regions.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she intends to take on this score and urge her to adopt a pro-active stance on this.
Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur on a job well done, together with my thanks for his help in ensuring that the amendments needed to the overall endeavour were accepted.
The amendments to this directive follow on from amendments to two other directives relating to mass redundancies and company transfers, the common objective of all of which is to protect workers' interests when companies are restructured and we must not forget this.
They therefore ipso facto raise the question of coordinating the common concepts used and I think that we need to pay attention to this when the amendments are finalised.
Secondly, this directive also fails to address the question of communitising the definition of salaries.
Despite the difficulties inherent in this endeavour, the Fifteen need to adopt a minimum common definition of the concept of employee if the directive is to be applied uniformly.
Otherwise, every country, depending on whether it has a broader or narrower understanding of the concept, will differentiate the scope of the directive as it sees fit.
We need to tread carefully on this point.
The proposed amendments, which I too support, include extending the scope of the directive to employees under what qualify as "implied" contracts in national legislation.
If we are not mature enough to extend the directive to the self-employed, we could at least extend the scope of the directive to employees who are self-employed but who are treated as employees under special legislation.
Secondly, this amendment is an inclusion in the sense of covered claims and severance pay, as provided for in International Labour Convention No. 173, and I fail to see why we cannot cover them in Europe.
Thirdly, it is the clearest redefinition of the meaning of insolvency so as to include any collective insolvency proceedings and not just traditional bankruptcy proceedings.
In any case it is also in the objectives of the directive and has not approximated any formulation.
The House would be well advised to approve these three amendments.
Madam President, I welcome the favourable reception that the Commission proposal has received and I would like to thank Parliament for its contributions aimed at further reinforcing the protection of workers affected by the insolvency of their employer.
The Insolvency Directive has proved to be an invaluable instrument for protecting employees in cases of economic downturns and it will be a key legislative instrument to respond to the present climate of closures and redundancies.
Although the basic structure of the directive should be retained, specific points of the directive need to be revised.
I welcome Amendment No 2 which aims to prevent the introduction of new restrictions beyond those currently in place in the Member States, and also Amendment No 9 which proposes to prohibit threshold provisions in order to qualify for claims under the directive.
I am also in favour of Amendment No 4 which proposes to extend the protection of workers of employers in other insolvency situations beyond those situations covered by the definition of insolvency proposed by the Commission.
Firstly, the broadening of the definition is fully acceptable.
However, on Amendment No 6, the extension to any other procedure or even to "de facto" situations of insolvency can only be accepted as an option for the Member States and not as an obligation.
I can also accept Amendment No 11, which proposes to add severance pay on termination of the employment relationship, with the addition of the term "where appropriate".
The term "pay" should continue to be defined in the national law of the Member States.
Amendment No 14, which proposes the abolition of a ceiling, is not acceptable in its entirety but I share your concerns on this point and I could accept a provision which allows ceilings which are compatible with the social purpose of the directive in order to avoid a level which is unacceptable for workers.
I am also ready to supplement this provision with a non-regression clause which impedes Member States from lowering the protection already provided when implementing the amended directive.
Finally, I can accept the reintroduction of the old Article 5 of the directive - Amendment No 15 - but this only in the old unchanged version of this article in the 1980 directive.
I am unable to accept the remaining amendments, in particular Amendment No 13 which aims to increase the minimum period for pay to six months.
Such an increase would seriously reduce the chance of the directive being adopted and would place a further considerable financial burden on the public purse and employers which would in turn cast doubt on the system of pay guarantees as a whole.
I cannot accept Amendment No 1, which aims to prevent employees from being "converted" to self-employed persons; Amendment No 7 which proposes the introduction of a Community definition of "employee"; nor Amendments Nos 8 and 16 which propose to add categories of workers who may not be excluded from the scope of the directive.
Efforts to combat illegal "conversion" must be made at national level.
A Community definition of an employed person should not be included in a particular directive, and self-employed workers cannot be covered because they do not have an employer who could be insolvent.
In line with your comments I agree that there are different types of self-employed people.
There are some self-employed people who are economically dependent.
This issue was raised in 2000 when we had consultation with the social partners.
The responses of the social partners emphasised the need to clarify and analyse the situation in all Member States because there is a diversity of situations, there are many different kinds of self-employed people.
This was the reason why we have already launched a study which will provide us with an overview of the nature of the phenomenon across the European Union.
Once we have the results of the study, the Commission will analyse it and after a consultation with the social partners we will present the appropriate way to deal with this issue.
The other categories - home-workers and those in similar categories - are covered to the extent that they are considered to be employees under national law.
There is, therefore, no need to mention them specifically.
Finally, some amendments should be rejected because they would not help to achieve the underlying objective of the proposal.
To sum up, I can accept, subject to some minor redrafting, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, and parts of Amendments Nos 14 and 15.
I reject Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18.
I would like to thank you for your contribution.
I would particularly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bouwman for his contribution and for the report.
The vote was postponed a moment ago, just before the debate started.
You will hear in due course when this will take place.
The debate is now closed.
I thank you.
Oh, I am sorry, Mr Bouwman.
I should briefly like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Vice-President of this meeting at the end of the debate of her first report as Vice-President.
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure to start off with a Dutch rapporteur.
The next item is the report by Mr Nobilia on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on new European labour markets, open to all, with access for all.
New European labour markets
Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Nobilia who is not present and on behalf of my Group, I wish to invoke Rule 146 and ask the House to postpone this debate until the December part-session.
Mr Nobilia has tried various other means to have the debate postponed but, unfortunately, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure do not permit this.
We therefore, have no option but to ask the House, pursuant to Rule 146, as I said, to grant a postponement until December - of both the debate and the vote.
Mr Ribeiro, I have taken note of your request.
I should now like to give the floor to a speaker who would like to speak in favour of this request.
Mr Pronk, you have one minute.
Madam President, allow me to add my congratulations on your first debate in which so many Dutch people have taken the floor.
This sentiment is also shared by the Christian Democratic Appeal as the largest delegation in the largest group.
The request is logical in my view.
The matter has been reassigned, something which Mr Nobilia was not aware of.
It is an important report and it seems that we are doing the right thing.
I do not believe that this is the right time to conduct a proper debate, nor is this the right way.
We have to postpone it.
It is not necessary to reach a vote at all cost today. That is why we support this request.
Mr Pronk is therefore in favour of postponement.
I would now put the request to the vote.
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee) I believe that we do this regretfully, for there are so many things that are being shelved and the year has not long to run.
However, the debate has thus been held over until the next time.
That means, ladies and gentlemen, that we will be adjourning the meeting until 4 p.m. because that is when the topical and urgent debate will commences.
Thank you for your attendance.
I declare the sitting adjourned until 4 p.m.
(The sitting was adjourned at 3.35 p.m. and resumed at 4 p.m.)
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Accident in the Gotthard Tunnel
We shall start with the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0710/2001 by Mrs Wallis, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mr Caveri, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0718/2001 by Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0724/2001, by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0725/2001 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0734/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel.
Mr President, the very recent and all too familiar disasters that have taken place in the Mont Blanc and Gotthard tunnels reveal the terrible truth about Europe' s current transport policy.
And in this case, revealing the truth can only lead to condemnation.
The world of road transport seems to have broken free from any legal framework, from any control standards.
Freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the Union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep.
How many more Gotthards and Mont Blancs must go up in flames before they are covered by strict legislation, by an effective system of controls which is both harmonised and trans-European?
The residents of all sensitive or high-density areas and all professionals are calling for Europe to intervene and the matter is of the greatest urgency.
The most sensible course of action would now be to set up safety escorts for convoys of lorries in every major tunnel.
Until this first safety measure is put in place, lives will still be in danger when these two accident-stricken tunnels are reopened.
We must no longer be asked to show patience over this harmonisation of safety standards for tunnels. Instead, the finger must be clearly pointed and this political nervousness, this lack of commitment on the part of public authorities to the costly but necessary restructuring of underground tunnels must be condemned.
Although a review of practices in the road transport sector is required, an in-depth discussion of our transport policy is no less needed.
The tragedies that have taken place in these tunnels demonstrate the physical and ideological shortcomings of the 'everything by road' approach, which clogs up transport links and chokes the environment.
Let us open up our eyes, then, and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads, and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport.
We will see that some ports, such as those in Italy, offer transit options that are likely to reduce traffic considerably on the road links of European trade.
The memory of the victims of Gotthard and Mont Blanc must inspire us to adopt a new approach, one that is more forward looking and more respectful of our means of transport.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will recall, in the last Strasbourg week we had actually planned to have a debate to celebrate the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.
In fact even then we were already discussing the tragic accident in the Gotthard Tunnel.
If we continue just to talk about this and do not take any measures then we will have to be prepared for the fact that there will be more accidents in these delicate and sensitive areas, in particular in the Alps.
However, in my opinion, and on the basis of my understanding of politics, this is unacceptable.
That is why we must do all we can to actually implement the proposals which the Commission has already rightly made in its White Paper.
I have no doubt that specific safety measures are also needed in the tunnels.
I have no doubt that stricter monitoring of working time, above all, is also required.
I hope that we will soon conclude the conciliation on this and that we will then move on to implementing and monitoring the measures on working time across Europe.
However, the fundamental problem is surely that there is too much freight rumbling through the Alps by road in heavy goods vehicles.
This is certainly not - as time and again it is wrongly assumed, appealing to popular sentiment - about standing in the way of economic links and cohesion; it is simply about this cohesion, these economic links and trade in general being created in a way which firstly is environmentally sustainable and secondly minimises the risk of accidents.
We will never be able to avoid them altogether, but we can minimise them and in so doing we can also above all give the railways a golden opportunity.
I - and I myself have also produced a report on opening up international freight routes - am in favour of the railways being stronger competitors here.
At the same time, I am however, on behalf of my group, also in favour of the transport policy, as postulated and laid down in the White Paper - I will say this once more in conclusion - being implemented quickly, in fact very quickly indeed, so that steps can be taken as soon as possible to avoid there being more accidents like the one in the Gotthard Tunnel.
Who could possibly be against the content of this motion for a resolution when, following the Mont Blanc tragedy, a tunnel has, once again, caused loss of life?
Parliament will, most likely, vote in favour of the resolution.
We will move down the agenda and things will continue as before, because calling for an integrated transport policy for the whole of the Alpine region in one resolution is not enough to ensure that it is actually implemented.
There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level.
There must be the political will to confront the road transport lobby and, above all, there must be investment to develop rail networks to meet the needs of everyone, not just to make profit.
This would require a radical break with your policy of privatisation and of dismantling public services.
Furthermore, the organisation of goods transport is inseparable from the global economic system.
The development, for example, of the zero stock system, which is highly profitable for private interests, is an aberration from the social point of view, because it is responsible, to a large extent, for clogging up the roads.
Giving priority to private interests, therefore, is bound to conflict with the general interest.
This motion for a resolution, for which we will be voting, will just be added to the long wish list that the European Parliament is continually producing.
Mr President, it seems to be fate. On the final day of the last part-session - 24 October 2001 - we were discussing the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
There was a bit of an argument - some were in favour, such as yours truly, and some wanted to put back the date of this major event.
Suddenly, into the middle of the debate came the news of the other incident in the St Gotthard tunnel, an unforeseen incident similar to that which had occurred in the Mont Blanc tunnel and which we had thought would now never be repeated.
Those in favour of opening the Mont Blanc tunnel to traffic immediately were once again advocating this line of action on health grounds, basing their argument particularly on a document produced by the operating company, which, pompously - and maybe rightly - stated that the Mont Blanc tunnel, rebuilt after the accident, is now the safest in the world.
I remember announcements, official pronouncements, so to speak, describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world.
Now we know that a very run-of-the-mill accident was enough in the past, is enough now and will be enough in future to turn these megasafe tunnels into people traps, and the many victims always pay with their lives.
It is difficult to apportion blame for these incidents; moreover, that is not for us to do.
However, one statistic does need to be mentioned here, for it concerns something for which we and, in particular, the Commission are responsible.
Indeed, considering that five times as many vehicles pass through the St Gotthard tunnel as usually run on all the other major routes through the Alps, we are faced with a transport policy error, and that is partly the fault of Europe, for most of the vehicles, particularly the heavy goods vehicles, are European.
I would therefore put two questions to the Commission. What has happened to the directive on harmonising the minimum safety requirements for road and rail tunnels?
And I would ask the Commission, what has happened to the action plan for an integrated transport policy in the Alpine region?
When the answers have been given to these two questions, we can proceed to the usual road versus rail argument.
Lastly, Mr President, I do not agree that heavy goods vehicles should be banned from using the tunnel.
Road haulage contractors have a right of passage and a right to provide a service as well.
Mr President, the dramatic repercussions of the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, especially after the equally tragic repercussions in the Mont Blanc and Val Thorens tunnels, have put the issue of tunnel safety right at the top of the agenda.
We need to push ahead on two fronts at European level. First, we need enhanced specifications and, secondly, we need to support motorrail services through the Alps.
The Commission announced in the White Paper referred to by almost all the members that it intends to propose European regulations setting out minimum safety standards for tunnels.
These standards will apply to technical equipment, traffic regulations, user information, training for staff operating the tunnels, for staff dealing with accidents when problems arise and for rescue services.
It is a complicated endeavour which needs to take account of a plethora of different parameters, given the extent to which one tunnel differs from another in terms of geography, size and traffic density.
At present, the Commission is carrying out pre-preparatory work with the help of first-class experts, with a view to submitting a proposal to Parliament at the beginning of 2002.
In the meantime, it also intends to convene a meeting of political and economic agencies operating in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Of course, even the best legislative proposals are no good unless they are adopted and applied.
And as regards the safety of tunnels in particular, I should like to remind the House of other proposals which have yet to be adopted. I should like to remind the House of the proposal to introduce digital tachographs which allow the time spent on the road by lorry drivers to be controlled accurately and which several Member States have opposed.
Or the Commission proposal on working conditions for lorry drivers, which Mr Swoboda has already referred to.
Then there is the question of certifying professional drivers and the question of small lorries which constantly exceed the 90 kilometre limit and have become accidents waiting to happen on the majority of roads in most Member States.
The fire in this tunnel also illustrates the need for information for tunnel users.
It is clear that, had users been informed, many could have escaped via the emergency exit or by getting out of their cars immediately.
And, of course, this particular accident again raises the question of freight transport through the Alps.
The absolute priority, in the medium term, is to provide rail links to alleviate freight transport with motorrail services as quickly as possible and this is one of the major priorities in the White Paper.
In the period between 1994 and 2000, the European Commission funded studies into the implementation of the new Lyon-Turin rail link. So far 60 million has been spent, about 50% of the total cost.
This project, in which the Community is, to date, indisputably the biggest provider of funds, is one of 14 projects approved by the European Union Council in Essen in 1994 which, unfortunately, it will not be possible to complete before 2010.
The Brenner rail route also needs to be commissioned as quickly as possible, in accordance with the 1996 guidelines on the western European transport network.
So what can be done in the short term following the problem created by the closure of the St Gotthard tunnel?
Immediate use should be made of motorrail facilities in the Alps.
This accident, and its dramatic repercussions, are yet another reason to make every possible effort to shift freight from the roads to the railways, a mode of transport which only accounts for 8% of the market in Europe, compared with 40% in the United States.
The European Commission has also taken new initiatives.
In January 2001, it proposed that the Council sign the transport protocol annexed to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Commission, as a political message on restoring the balance of distribution between the various modes of transport.
Because of difficulty in funding these projects, the White Paper proposes Community legislation laying down fairer pricing principles which take account of all the costs incurred for each mode of transport, together with safety costs.
To conclude, the Commission has taken or intends to take various specific measures in order to resolve the particular problems besetting the Pyrenees, the Alps and other sensitive areas.
And I can assure you that it will make every effort to guarantee users the highest possible safety standards.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
Massacre of 200 civilians in the Federal Republic of Nigeria
B5-0711/2001 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0712/2001 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0713/2001 by Mr Bowis, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the incidents of 22 October in the State of Benue, Central Nigeria;
B5-0720/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the massacre of civilians in Nigeria;
B5-0726/2001 by Mrs Morgantini and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0732/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0735/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the incidents in the State of Benue, Nigeria.
In order to achieve world peace, it is essential for people of different creeds and races to respect each other and live together in peace.
This is not the case in an increasing number of countries in the world, and that is an extremely worrying trend.
Unfortunately, Nigeria is an alarming case in point.
Precious little is left of the hopes which the democratically elected president had raised as successor of the corrupt military regime.
Ethnic and religious feuds are now the order of the day across the country.
Not a month goes by without blood being shed. The number of casualties is running into the hundreds and the situation is getting worse, not better.
In that light, the balance sheet for October is shocking.
There was fighting between Muslims and Christians in Jos and disturbances in Kano where, moreover, there has been a cholera outbreak.
The government army carried out ethnic atrocities and massacres in the Middle Belt.
The government itself was shrouded in silence.
Only after two weeks did President Obasanjo announce that a special committee would investigate the murders.
The billion-dollar question is whether the president is actually up to the task of running this country which is extremely difficult to govern.
Apparently, his position is not strong enough in order to keep the country united and allow the different nations to live together peacefully.
It is frightening.
Just now when we are nearly free of the Taliban, we are lumbered with regions such as the north of Nigeria, where the shari' ah is introduced.
Autonomy for those regions should not go as far as observing their own rules that are diametrically opposed to national legislation and that suppress the population and women, in particular.
To sentence a pregnant woman to capital punishment for having intercourse before marriage is barbaric.
My question to the Commission is: What can the European Union do?
In any event, the dialogue with Nigeria will need to be intensified.
However, Europe' s hands are tied if the president and the government themselves lack the courage to act and to do everything in their power to allow the Nigerians to live together in peace.
Mr President, two years ago, following fair elections in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic state of Nigeria, the military dictatorship was replaced by a parliamentary democracy.
However, veteran President Olusugun Obasanjo is increasingly facing the difficult challenge of keeping riots under control between northern Muslims and Christian southerners, not infrequently culminating in gruesome blood baths.
For example, we were recently alarmed once again by a dubious military reprisal in the federal state of Benue.
I notice with some discomposure that the army seems to be taking the law into its own hands in various cases.
It is understandable that the Tivs, associated with the South, are very suspicious of the fact that the army was siding with the northern-oriented Jukuns, the population group to which the current Defence Minister belongs.
It is of the utmost importance for the military forces to act within the constitutional mandate and ensure the safety of all citizens.
Increasing tension in the Middle Belt has at the same time illustrated my growing concern for the ever-widening chasm between religions that is fanning out towards the middle and south of the country.
In a personal meeting with his American opposite number, President Bush less than two weeks ago, President Obasanja reassured President Bush once again of his support for the International Coalition against terrorism. On that same fateful Friday, 2 November, however, as the representative of the thirteenth federal state incorporating Islamic penal law, he was also faced with implementing the decree in Kaduna to introduce Islamic penal law, the shari'ah.
This will do nothing to promote the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and the large Christian minority in that state.
Finally, I should like to express my emphatic support for the attempts by the Nigerian President and parliament to look into, and tackle, the causes of the continuing ethnic and religious conflicts, to which, inter alia, Paragraph 4 of the resolution refers.
I would ask the Council and Commission to contribute according to their means.
Mr President, those of us who were in Abuja and Kano last year for the ACP meeting welcomed President Obasanjo's move from military dictatorship to democracy.
We were also aware of the simmering tension in the country, particularly in the north, with outbreaks of violence.
Sharia law has been a potent symbol of the cause of that tension, demanded by some Muslims, feared by most Christians and other faiths; partly the result of northern Nigeria not benefiting from independence and oil as the south has done, and a resentment of corruption that they see as chronic in the country.
Thousands have died as a result of violence, especially in Kaduna and many Christian homes, churches and businesses have been destroyed.
The Zanfara state government has given local vigilante groups the power to implement Sharia law.
In reply seventeen southern states have demanded the right to set up their own police forces.
Northerners are leaving Lagos after riots that have led to deaths.
In the north, journalists in Kano are threatened with Sharia law if they represent it in a negative way.
Now we see in Benue and Taraba in east and central Nigeria tribal, not religious, wars.
The Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries, not about religion.
Nineteen soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered.
Then we saw the awful reprisals in which Zakibian, a town of 20 000 people, was destroyed and over 200 people killed.
Of course we welcome President Obasanjo's announcement of an inquiry.
Ethnic and religious violence must be stopped in Nigeria.
There must be equality before the law and not fear and violence.
Corruption from whatever source must be rooted out.
The European Union must support this.
It must also provide humanitarian support for Nigeria, where over 200 people have died of cholera in the last few weeks, and help the people who have been displaced as a result of this violence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in and around Afghanistan have obscured our view of trouble spots in other parts of the world, for example in Nigeria.
The European Union should not, however, be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa.
At the beginning of this year, the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo, declared that 2001 would be the year in which the Nigerian people would reap the rewards of the transition to democracy.
We supported this statement when we met at that time in Abuja in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
The trust has, however, suddenly turned to deep concern.
A split in the ruling party in Nigeria, the absence of economic improvements and the persistence of poor living conditions have made people increasingly willing to resort to violence, thus creating a breeding ground for political extremists.
To keep them in check, President Obasanjo felt it necessary to deploy soldiers in seven Nigerian states.
Since then more than 3 000 people are said to have been killed and there is renewed fear that the military might return to power.
The introduction and application of Sharia law in an increasing number of states has heightened religious and ethnic tensions.
Violent criminals often go unpunished.
The President and all of the forces of democracy in Nigeria are called upon to take determined action against violent criminals using the legal means at their disposal, to secure respect for universal human rights and to hurry through economic reforms which will benefit all parts of the country, if there is to be an end to this misery.
We expect the Commission to monitor this process actively and to do everything within its power to ensure that this trouble spot in Africa once again becomes a place of democracy.
Mr President, I am sure that, like me, when you call for a debate on the Democratic Republic of Nigeria, you know we are actually talking about a corrupt military oligarchy in an African country to which we give our support.
Nigeria is proof, Mr President, that the wealth and value of a nation are often measured according to the priority that it gives to human rights, and especially to women, children and workers.
Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which means that it has vast human resources.
It also has mineral resources and a high oil production that should protect its population from poverty.
Furthermore, its huge diversity could provide real dynamism.
And yet, for decades, a climate of violence towards democrats has been allowed to flourish there and Nigeria' s rulers have never truly sought to punish the extra-judicial murders and violence.
By not taking any preventive action, the military powers have allowed a climate of latent ethnic conflict to evolve and one of these conflicts, in the East of the country, pitting the Tivs and the Jukuns against one another, has just led to the deaths of 200 civilians, who were massacred by soldiers.
The most shocking aspect, Mr President, Commissioner, is that the State authorities are trying to play down this event by explaining that the soldiers involved in the massacre were reacting to the murder of some of their fellow militiamen.
In my view, we must, as we confirmed at the ACP summit on 1 November, force countries that legitimately claim to be our partners in dialogue, that we choose as partners and that request financial support from us, to comply with commonly accepted rules and with international conventions.
With regard to Nigeria, this would involve fighting the implementation of the Islamic sharia - a woman was allowed to be stoned in front of television cameras a few weeks ago and not a single country reacted. At the same time, a climate of Islamophobia is developing, with mosques being burned down, and this too is met with widespread indifference.
Lastly, an independent inquiry must now be opened into the murders that took place in November 1999 and in October 2001.
We should be aware that our colleagues in the Nigerian parliament have called these massacres examples of 'ethnic cleansing' .
I wish to end by saying that I have often called in this House for the debts of third world countries to be cancelled, but this debt cancellation must be conditional, Mr President, on these countries truly respecting human rights, workers' rights and the rights of children and women.
We must no longer accept these countries calling themselves democratic and signing conventions, which they then fail to observe.
Mr President, between 22 and 24 October last, Nigerian soldiers raged among the people of Benue state.
Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down.
There must be a swift, impartial, effective inquiry into these massacres.
The Nigerian Federal government must guarantee full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law without delay.
It is not doing so, despite the hopes placed in it.
The Nigerian army is incapable of restoring law and order; moreover, this is not its role.
Only a police force which respects human rights would be able to rebuild trust between the different communities.
It is the duty of the European Parliament to condemn these massacres, which come on top of religious intolerance and miscarriages of justice.
The way the sharia is currently being wrongly applied in Nigeria is a violation of fundamental human rights, especially the rights of women.
Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria.
There is an urgent need for a humanitarian aid system to be established for displaced persons and refugees.
Lastly, the European Union should implement the procedure laid down by Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mr President, the murder of hundreds of members of the Benue community and the stoning of the pregnant woman in northern Nigeria highlight the desperate situation this country is in.
The European Commission is monitoring the situation within the framework of its powers and capabilities.
In May 2001, the Commission issued a common position making provision for political dialogue with Nigeria to be strengthened.
This common position is based on human rights and missions headed by European Union diplomats have been in contact with the Nigerian government.
One mission was concerned with the economic situation and the other with human rights and the problem of human rights and the need for the government to intervene and take action have been highlighted.
The government has acknowledged the problems and stressed that it intends to continue its efforts along these lines but I believe that parliament has also set limits on the potential for this particular government to intervene.
There are two points in the motions on which I should like to comment briefly.
The first is the education of the security forces in the human rights sector.
This is a new sector for the Community, which has come under military cooperation in the past.
However, the Community is currently supporting this sort of programme in Algeria, Guatemala, the Ukraine and the Palestinian territories.
The Commission is re-examining the potential for intervention in West Africa, Liberia and the Ivory Coast and, as far as Nigeria is concerned, the United Kingdom, France and the United States are involved in similar activities.
The Commission is monitoring the problems within the specific framework of human rights, but it cannot intervene in the education of security forces for human rights unless the Nigerian government asks it to do so.
As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, the European Commission is intervening wherever the national or local authorities are unable to deal with natural or man-made disasters, but only in countries which have asked for help from abroad.
So far, Nigeria has not asked for any help.
The local authorities are more or less coping with the problems arising mainly as the result of movements of the population within the country, but I must stress, as has already been said, that Nigeria's problems are of a seriously structural nature.
Short-term development aid is not enough to cope with them.
However, the Commission thinks it is important to monitor recent developments directly on the ground, which is why it is planning to despatch ECHO delegates to Nigeria to record the dangers already referred to.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Ãatural disasters
Mr President, before beginning my two minutes of speaking time, and as a point of order, I would like to point out to the Presidency that there is an error in the transcribed text.
In paragraph four of the Resolution there is a phrase missing, literally 'which should be compatible with European Union doctrine on cooperation, respect for human rights and democracy' .
This was the text agreed by all of the groups according to a document given to the Presidency by the spokesperson for international relations from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
And now, Mr President, I would like to begin my allotted intervention by pointing out that this resolution aims to tackle the problem of the devastation caused by hurricane Michelle, which has particularly affected three countries: Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba.
The effects of this disaster are exacerbated by the fact that the three countries in question have levels of poverty that I personally would call extreme.
Given that a simple reference was made in the resolution to our recent visit to Nicaragua, in order to provide illustrative evidence of the situation in this country, I would like to point out that Nicaragua is currently the poorest country in Continental America.
Fifty per cent of Nicaraguans live in conditions of poverty and 17% in conditions of extreme poverty - to be poor in Nicaragua means living on USD 1 per month.
In macroeconomic terms, Nicaragua has foreign debt of USD 6 500 million, exports less than a third of what it imports and the country balances its payments and survives, ultimately, thanks to international aid and emigrants' remittances, particularly from the United States and Costa Rica.
With regard to the situation in Cuba, on another delegation visit, I think we all will agree that the situation of that country is extremely gloomy.
Cuba is currently surviving mostly thanks to emigrants' remittances and, secondly, tourism, which represent more than all other Cuban exports put together.
This being the case, what the resolution is aiming to achieve is, first and foremost, to show solidarity with the communities affected and with the human victims of the consequences of this hurricane.
Secondly, and I would like the Commissioner to take special note of this, I would like to express Parliament' s satisfaction with the actions of the Humanitarian Aid Office.
Thirdly, I would ask that, in the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, estimated damages be considered within the framework of the Regional Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America.
Given that we are talking about Nicaragua, there is an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to address the rapporteur here, which says that, as there have been misappropriations of funds - and we are referring to European funds here - certain action has to be taken.
I personally took the trouble to call the Commission delegation in Nicaragua.
I have a fax here in which they tell me that in no case has there been any proof, nor has there been any investigation into these funds, therefore it cannot be confirmed that there have been misappropriations.
During the recent visit we discovered that these accusations had occurred at the same time as an election campaign, but there was no judicial decision in this respect.
For this reason, it seems extremely reckless to me to make statements on this subject.
Mr President, with regard to Cuba, the phrase we have added can be interpreted by the various political parties as they see fit.
But when we say that we want a cooperation agreement to be reached in line with European doctrine, we mean to agree with what was stated in the Newens report and in the common position; that we will only reach a cooperation agreement when the Cuban regime makes significant progress in the improvement of respect for human rights and progresses towards a pluralist democracy.
This is the doctrine of the European Union, which is implicitly expressed in this resolution.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, we did not take into account the time taken up by your introduction so you have indeed spoken for three and a half minutes.
However, what you were saying was interesting. There is no need to worry at all.
I would just like to say that, three years after hurricane Mitch, Central America is once again being struck by the fresh tragedy of hurricane Michelle.
We must not forget that, since then, it has suffered an earthquake, drought and famine.
However, despite these disasters, democracy is slowly being established in these countries once again, and the European delegation, of which I am a member, which has just been to Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, is unanimously agreed on this point.
The proper running of the elections which have just taken place in Nicaragua is also evidence of this.
Therefore, I feel that we can be proud of the decisive role played by the European Union action in the development of democracy in these countries.
That is why I call for two measures: firstly, to increase the funds appropriated to the Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America, which currently amounts to EUR 250 million for the 1999-2002 period, since the latest disasters were not taken into consideration; and secondly, to review the European Union' s outdated position on Cuba.
Also totally devastated by the latest hurricane, the worst it has suffered for 50 years, Cuba is currently the only country in Central America which has not signed a cooperation agreement with the European Union, and its only hope in these times of trouble is humanitarian, emergency aid.
I could smile and tell you, with regard to Cuba, not to be more Catholic than the Pope, in the knowledge that he had no difficulty in identifying the right choice, but the appalling situation of this countries prevents me from smiling.
Rather, I will warn you not to focus on the wrong enemy.
The enemy is no longer communism: it is terrorism and terrorism thrives on destitution; democracy cannot be built on famine.
Cuba is an important, or rather essential part of the process of bringing integration and peace to Central America which is currently in progress.
Therefore, I urge the Council to instruct the Commission to reopen democratic cooperation negotiations with Cuba, insisting on total respect for European democratic values, which will not accept two different sets of values.
Mr President, it is quite sad that when we have these afternoons debating topical and urgent subjects of major importance, we almost always have to ask again for aid for catastrophes affecting the world' s poorest countries.
Both the delegation which, as Mr GarcÃ­a Margallo said, visited Cuba and El Salvador, and the previous delegation that went to Honduras and Nicaragua, were able to see first hand the situation in which these countries find themselves, which, it must be said, is gloomy.
Nobody would say, however, that the situation in Cuba is gloomy; of course there are many problems that Cuba has to resolve, but these are nothing to be gloomy about, as anyone who has travelled to Cuba will tell you.
In any case, Mr President, I think we have to congratulate the European Commission for their speedy reaction to this catastrophe.
We also have to acknowledge the fact that in Cuba there have not been so many victims thanks to the very quick reaction and very good organisation of the public authorities serving both the general public and tourists.
Several Spanish tourists said on TV that they had been looked after very well during this situation of emergency.
I was very happy that the last phrase from paragraph 4 had been removed, which is a last minute amendment.
For the fact that there should be a common position that prevents there being a normal relationship with Cuba, as there is with other countries, is regretted by non-governmental organisations, the church, representatives of the European Union, and even dissidents.
It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement.
We are aware that when a resolution such as this one is approved in this House, it has to be done by a majority.
If it is true that there was agreement on that phrase being included, then it should be; but, naturally, it is regrettable that there is no cooperation agreement with Cuba, because what is required from this country should be the same as for all the others.
Yesterday we debated this issue and we saw that neither Turkey nor Morocco nor a large number of countries in Latin America have been asked to implement measures before an agreement can be reached.
We have only asked this of Cuba.
This is the difference, and it was made clear in this House, Mr President.
For this reason, if the phrase has to be included, then include it, but it is regrettable that it is only Cuba which is required to fulfil these conditions.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I too would like to express our solidarity with the people of Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba, whose countries have been tragically devastated by the effects of hurricane Michelle.
Along with Iris, on 8 October, and Mitch, which we have not forgotten, this hurricane is one of a long list of natural disasters which regularly affect areas which are already suffering, adding tragedy to poverty.
These disasters, termed natural disasters, are a further reminder that climate change and non-sustainable development exacerbate the already substantial devastation and will continue to do so in the future.
Although the European Union is to be congratulated on the aid it is sending to Honduras and Nicaragua, it must be noted that Cuba is totally excluded from this demonstration of solidarity.
Cuba, which has suffered its worst disaster in 50 years, is unable to receive our help, for it is the only country in Latin and Central America which does not have a cooperation agreement with the European Union.
This situation is no longer appropriate: it is our duty to restate the need for a cooperation agreement focusing on environmentally sustainable development to be signed with Cuba without delay, and to review the European Union' s position.
We advocate equal treatment for all countries, and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries.
Moreover, the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba.
The pharmacies are empty and there is a shortage of everything in the hospitals.
We cannot tolerate a situation which deprives an entire people of the aid received by neighbouring countries which have suffered the same disasters.
In order to change this, we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted.
Mr President, our initial reaction is to express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and their countrymen, but we must also immediately re-state our commitment to show solidarity with the affected countries, taking care that this solidarity is shown through immediate, generous and effective action.
The principal role was initially taken by our own European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and it appears that the Commission acted with the necessary speed by means of this office.
But the action of the European Union should not stop at this point and we should make a significant contribution to the reconstruction of everything which has been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Michelle.
A large proportion of our efforts will be included within the Reconstruction Plan for Central America and within the framework of the Union' s agreements with Honduras and with Nicaragua.
This is where we fall down, due to the pitiful lack of a similar agreement with the Republic of Cuba.
This is something that we are continually denouncing here in this House.
It makes no sense that Cuba, for whom, amongst other things, the Member States of the European Union include their main economic, commercial and tourism partners, should be the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has not signed a cooperation agreement.
For this reason, at the present time, the European Union is restricted to acting almost exclusively within the field of humanitarian and emergency aid.
We in this House would ask the Commission to show a high degree of flexibility when considering the suitability of projects which, in addition to this type of aid, also contribute to surmounting the damage and helping with the reconstruction of those sectors that have been most affected on the island by the effects of the hurricane.
It is vital that we revise the European Union' s common position on Cuba, which today is obsolete and even counterproductive, with a view to achieving the objectives that should have been pursued in 1996 when it was established, that is to say, the progress and prosperity of the Cuban people.
I would also have preferred that the paragraph added by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had requested the same from Cuba as is requested from other countries with which the European Union cooperates.
In any case, I do not think that the situation in Cuba is as gloomy as those who are determined to criticise that country would have us believe.
Mr President, we hope that the dialogue, without preconditions and without the exclusion of any particular subject from the agenda, that appears to have been re-initiated with the meeting this Monday in New York between the President of the Council and the Cuban Chancellor, will soon bear fruit and led to the signing of a cooperation treaty that will benefit Cuba and that will allow the European Union to act under normal conditions, with a greater degree of efficiency and with more influence in their relations with this country.
Floods in Algeria
Mr President, Algeria has been a troubled country for many years.
Its reputation and image abroad has been damaged by the violence, massacres and abuses of human rights there, but that is nothing compared with the pain and suffering of its people at home.
One million people died in the fight for independence and another 100 000 have died in the current power struggles between Islamic militants and the military and among the minority Berber community seeking political and cultural recognition.
Now in this country, four fifths of which - ironically - is Saharan desert, we have the catastrophe of flooding in Algiers with the death toll in flash floods rising towards 1 000 as the grim task of sifting through the mud and the rubble goes on.
It is not the first such calamity.
In 1994, 30 000 people were made homeless in the Tindouf area, but the difference is that on that occasion seven lives were lost, while this time 693 people have already died and over 300 people are missing, with some 20 000 people thought to be homeless.
The urgency now is for the European Union to play its part in providing humanitarian aid.
There is a clear need for shelter, for food, for medical supplies and I certainly welcome the EUR 750 000 which has been given for this purpose under the ECHO fund, and indeed the promised EUR 225 million from the European Investment Bank for drinking water supply lines.
There is also a need for adequate heavy equipment to deal with situations like this and even picks and shovels seem to be in short supply.
Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available.
Given Algeria's position in an earthquake area it would certainly be prudent to have such things available for the future.
I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it has to deal with this.
There is also the need to look at the policy of sealing the floodwater drains against terrorist activities, which in this case has clearly exacerbated the situation.
Mr President, we are aghast at the large numbers who have fallen victim to these disastrous floods and I believe that it is the duty of the European Union, of the individual Member States and of the Commission to do all that we can now to give assistance to those affected and help them through this difficult time.
Even though Algeria is further south than our homelands, we know that it can be cold and very wet in winter.
That is why aid is absolutely essential and everything that can be done to reduce the suffering must be done, and it must be done unconditionally.
This does not mean that we will not hope that something good will nevertheless come out of this terrible catastrophe and out of our provision of aid, namely that Algeria will find a way to really step up the necessary dialogue with those who want peace and freedom in that country.
The sacrifices which have been made in Algeria, not only during the war against their colonial masters but also in recent years and months, are horrendous.
The acts are horrendous, and it is high time that the government and the president of this country found a way out of the crisis.
Expectations were high when Bouteflika was elected President, but there have also been many disappointments in recent months: disappointment that more is said than done; disappointment that the people are addressed ex cathedra and not consulted.
The tragic events in Kabylia - a commission in Algeria itself investigated them and uncovered their causes, amongst other things - should be reason enough to change the dynamics of communication and political relations in Algeria.
In the case of the unrest in Kabylia - which, of course, then spread to the whole country or to wide areas of it - it was simply not true that it was started by a handful of anarchists and others who were following foreign orders: the Algerian commission itself established that it was above all the inappropriate behaviour of the security forces which was responsible.
That is why the tragic events of the last few days should also be seen as an opportunity in Algeria to try to pursue a different policy, a policy which consists of offering the people more opportunities and more chances, including economic and social ones.
Mr President, as Mr Swoboda stated, Algeria has already seen a great deal of suffering with the continual deaths in the country, more often than not of innocent people, and also with the poverty that is devastating part of the population.
Therefore, this catastrophe has only made this situation worse, with more than 600 victims, as has been stated, and with more than 20 000 people who have lost any standard of living they may have had.
Also, in this case, the resolution congratulates the European Commission on its speedy reaction, but special emergency aid will probably be necessary.
It is true that the European Parliament colegislates the budget with the Council, and, therefore, the result is what we achieve together, I know, but I am filled with sorrow - especially on these afternoons when we have to talk about so many catastrophes - that there is no sufficient budget heading that can be used in such cases, because we always find ourselves having to beg for, or to transfer some money from elsewhere to deal with these tragedies.
In the specific case of the resolution, the European Commission has also been asked if it could send experts and technicians to help evaluate the damage and find a way to rebuild what has been destroyed.
I know that we ask a great deal of the European Commission, but it is also true to say that the European Parliament is very sensitive to the situation in countries in Central America - as stated previously - as it is with countries in the Mediterranean.
We have to ask - and ask ourselves - as was stated the other day in the Committee on Development and Cooperation when talking about the reconstruction of Afghanistan (after having first destroyed it), that that reconstruction should not be the cause of a reduction in the funds available for Mediterranean countries, countries in Latin America and Africa, who also really have great need of them.
Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my full solidarity and the solidarity of my group with the people of Algeria, which has once again been struck by a huge disaster.
We who support the Algerian people, particularly in their fight for independence, are shocked by the tragic consequences of the floods in that country.
Material and, above all, human loss are jeopardising the country' s development and preserving its excessive structural and political shortcomings.
This disaster reveals once again the incompetence of the Algerian government: the way it builds houses and roads in flood plains and decides to block drains allegedly for safety reasons is proof of the utter irresponsibility of its leaders, and this is on top of the corruption and misuse of funds.
The government has failed in its primary mission of serving the general interests of the people.
It has done nothing to meet the needs of the people or ensure their safety.
Therefore, we must call upon the Algerian authorities to make good their past mistakes.
This situation must on no account be allowed to occur again either in Algeria or elsewhere.
We must no longer allow citizens' lives to be endangered by irresponsible, self-interested or reprehensible behaviour.
Mr President, some people may wonder why we are devoting time to discussing flooding - even flooding on this scale - in Algeria.
In fact a debate is currently raging about this idea of concern.
Recently, at a large meeting in Nuremberg, a leading German Orientalist complained that in parts of the Islamic world people were not concerned enough about the atrocious events in New York.
At the time I replied that we too have shown very little concern about Chechnya, where over 100 000 people have been murdered, or Iraq, where over 100 000 people, mainly children, have starved to death.
In fact there is a kind of partial culture of concern which is divided along cultural and geographical lines.
That is why we need to ensure that we also have compassion for our Muslim and Arab partners when they are hit by catastrophes of this kind, so that terrorists cannot - and after all this was the aim of 11 September - play off one civilisation against another and actually orchestrate the 'clash of civilisations'.
The dead in Algeria are also our dead.
The homeless in Algeria are also our homeless.
If we speak of a global village in economic terms then we must also speak of a global village of compassion and solidarity.
That is why, where our partners in the Mediterranean, in the Arab world, are concerned, who are on our doorstep and with whom we need to work more closely than ever, it is the European Union's duty to provide substantial humanitarian aid, and also to ensure that Algeria is put in a position where it is more capable than it has been in the past of helping itself.
Helping people to help themselves must be our overriding aim, but of course our aim now must also be to provide the victims of this disaster with direct practical help, not only by giving them money, not only by writing them a big cheque, but also by making it clear to them that what happens to them is something which we Europeans are deeply concerned about, something which matters to us as much as what happens to ourselves.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their kind remarks concerning ECHO and I shall convey these congratulations to Mr Nielson, the Commissioner responsible.
Firstly, as far as Hurricane Michelle is concerned, the Commission has been closely monitoring its effects in Central America in the Caribbean area since the beginning of the crisis, in cooperation with our experts and partners in this field.
Michelle started on 29 October as a tropical storm off the northern coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, where it caused severe floods.
The communication systems proved their efficiency as they were the only working systems that allowed for a quick evaluation in areas of difficult access such as Moskita.
On 1 November, ECHO started discussions with the NGOs present in the field to establish emergency systems, particularly in the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua - the areas worst hit.
On 4 November, Michelle became a hurricane that crossed Cuba and touched Jamaica.
Fortunately, the local authorities had undertaken timely evacuation measures.
ECHO services decided on funding once an initial evaluation of the hurricane damage had been carried out in Cuba.
This decision to allocate EUR 1 050 000, should be approved by the end of this week and will cover the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua, Cuba and Jamaica.
The decision will mainly involve the evacuation of people in danger, food aid for Honduras, the provision of temporary shelter in Jamaica and the distribution of water, sanitation and health packages in all countries.
Members of this House have raised two main issues.
One concerns Nicaragua.
I should like to assure you that all the distributed funds are regularly monitored and no irregularities have been detected so far.
That was the assessment of the Parliament delegation that visited Nicaragua.
The second comment concerned Cuba.
Some people wanted a revision of the EU Common Position on Cuba, announced on 25 June 2001.
But it kept being said Cuba had not been given any humanitarian aid until now.
In fact Cuba has benefited from around EUR 125 million in aid since 1993, largely in the humanitarian field, as well as the food security programme and some budget line assistance.
But for the time being, the line followed by the Commission is as proposed in the latest European Union Common Position which I have already referred to.
As far as Algeria is concerned, the situation in the country is very complex.
There are many different kinds of problems, but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend.
