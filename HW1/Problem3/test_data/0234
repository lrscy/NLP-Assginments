This means that there will be no change of objectives, such as the inclusion of objectives relating to economic growth and employment.
He also offered qualified support for the 1997 version of the Stability and Growth Pact, and has stated that the 2005 reform weakened the Pact.
This monetarist, neoliberal blinkeredness, which panders to the profits of the large multinational companies operating in the EU and which places the workers â and their jobs, their rights and their salaries â as an adjustment variable during crises, is in keeping with its role in creating the single currency and the Stability and Growth Pact.
In addition, it should once again be noted that the new faces on the ECB Executive Board are exclusively from the large countries (one German replacing another).
If one adds the rotation of votes on the Council, the small countries are being pushed to the margins when it comes to monetary decisions in the Economic and Monetary Union.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .The illegal copying of designs is one of the causes of counterfeiting.
It constitutes a theft of the intellectual property of businesses, which distorts international trade rules and is responsible for the loss of around 100Â 000 jobs each year in the EU.
It also constitutes a danger for consumers when counterfeit products may harm their health or compromise their safety.
Lastly, it constitutes a source of fiscal and social fraud that places a strain on the Member Statesâ accounts.
All the resources used to fight against this scourge must therefore be continually strengthened.
Design protection â which characterises the creativity and innovation of businesses â is a crucial element of the battery of powers used to combat counterfeiting.
Yet, the international registration of these designs is an often complicated and costly process, especially for SMEs.
All the measures aimed at simplifying these procedures and at making savings will therefore encourage businesses to comply with them and will have a positive effect on research and innovation.
MrÂ Rocardâs report on accession to the Geneva Act concerning the international registration of industrial designs is along these lines, and I therefore supported this report.
Â Â  â We have today voted in favour of MrÂ SousaÂ Pintoâs report on the Interinstitutional Agreement.
The report states that the Interinstitutional Agreement that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have managed to reach is compatible with primary European law and the Treaties.
It is a positive thing that we have finally reached a settlement on the EUâs long-term budget.
At the same time, it is disappointing that no further progress was made in respect of the reform of the budget.
We should have liked to have seen a thorough overhaul of the agreement on agricultural funding and a methodical reform of regional aid.
More of the EUâs resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime, poverty and climate change, as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world.
The reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008/2009.
There are also sections of the report that we would rather have done without.
Amongst these we might mention what is known as the Globalisation Fund and the text relating to âown resourcesâ.
It is our opinion that it must continue to be the Member States that decide what resources the EU has at its disposal.
Â Â  . We endorse the rejection of the interinstitutional agreement tabled by our parliamentary group and voted for by 120 Members of Parliament because, among other reasons, we oppose:
- a mindset that gradually turns every defeat into a mystifying âvictoryâ on the grounds that things could always be worse.
- the blackmail perpetrated by the economically most highly developed EU Member States, the so-called âwealthyâ countries, which have imposed a relative reduction of the Community budget; this at a time when the EU has grown to include a further ten countries with an average level of economic development that is below the Community average and when preparations are under way for two more countries to join.
- this is a process that increasingly favours supranational level decision-making on monetary, budgetary, economic and social policy â pandering to the interests of the economically most highly developed countries and the large economic and financial groups, which are concerned less and less with the rights, needs and aspirations of the workers and of the people of the various EU Member States â and that, at the same time, entirely predictably, reduces the financial resources that could help minimise the consequences of (unacceptable) capitalist competition between countries with very different levels of economic development.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot not support the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and on sound financial management, in particular.
We must be aware, however, that supporting the European Council's decision on the review of the budget means starting to reduce spending, particularly if we aim to use the Unionâs own resources rather than the Member Statesâ contributions.
It will then be easier to do away with that percentage that Parliament overpays on the lease of its seat in Strasbourg, precisely because it appears to be an undue and unwarranted cost.
We must also recognise that the review will include a reduction in workplaces and in the various trips that are sometimes made merely to boost the self-esteem of a specific individual.
Although not exciting, the interinstitutional agreement must also be approved, and we approve of the fact that the negotiations have resulted in the political priorities and the financial requirements being combined.
I wonder, however, whether the clear separation between an own resources budget and the provision of the Member States' contributions might not cause some technical problems in the financing of particular programmes, unless this separation is also applied to the programmes themselves and the political objectives to be achieved.
We therefore hope for a great deal of clarity and transparency and for a clear and inflexible approach to separating expenditure and objectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, one particular reason why I gave my support to the BÃ¶ge report was that it represents a landmark success on the part of this House in establishing that the European Union is social and educational in character.
Whatever else may be said about it, we have succeeded, by negotiation, in getting EURÂ 800Â million more for our young people, money that will make it possible for many young people within the European Union â we estimate that there will be hundreds of thousands more of them than last time â to get better education in another Member State and thereby protect themselves against unemployment.
Â Â  .Europe is undergoing two kinds of crisis: an institutional one and a political one.
It is imperative that a strong relationship of confidence be built up again between Europeans and their institutions.
The first signal that political leaders have a duty to send out to their fellow citizens in order to restore that confidence is one of equipping themselves with a budget that lives up to their much touted ambitions.
At a time when the EU is opening up to new countries and when we more than ever need a social and competitive Europe and one that is strong in the world, the budget now proposed to us is unacceptable.
The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, progress in terms of research and development, education and training, external aid in the fields of development and cooperation, transnational infrastructure projects, and sufficient Structural Funds and a sufficient Cohesion Fund to demonstrate the necessary solidarity with the new countries: all of that will only be achieved to a minimal extent.
Moreover, any new policy is out of the question and any recovery unthinkable â this budget symbolises inflexibility and a desire to give in.
That is why I cannot vote in favour of the financial perspective. It overlooks the European interest to the advantage of national self-interests and disappoints our nations with regard to Europeâs future.
Â Â  . The British Conservative group acknowledge the benefits of the interinstitutional agreement and in particular applaud the provision for the parliament to take a more influential role in the 2008-2009 review.
We also warmly welcome the requirement for the national authorities to accept greater accountability for the money they spend.
We would point out; however, that the compromise deal struck between the parties fails to adequately address the problems that confront the European Union today.
In particular it has missed a rare opportunity to alter the political priorities and instead has continued to fund the traditional spending programmes.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the European Unionâs financial perspective for the years 2007 to 2013 on the basis of the BÃ¶ge report, and I did so having borne in mind the long, painful and arduous negotiations that have taken place since the first half of 2005.
I did so not because I believe that this is the best or the least worst budget but because it is the only budget possible and so as not to side with those who would not have hesitated to exacerbate the crisis that the European Union is undergoing by creating a budgetary crisis that neither our fellow citizens nor the new Member States that joined in 2004 would have understood.
I must point out that it is not the European Union that is in financial crisis but the Member States, some of which are on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of having spectacularly mismanaged their national public finances.
We really need to get over this issue of the UK rebate, which has been poisoning European relations for too long.
Lastly, I am delighted that this agreement, together with the 2008/2009 review clause, paves the way for the crucial reform of the European Unionâs finances, which is becoming a crucial and urgent stage in European integration.
Â Â  . In the negotiations about the financial perspectives covering the period between 2007-2013, Parliament has managed to add another EUR 4Â billion to the EU budget.
This additional amount is unjustified, because those extra resources will benefit forms of policy that cannot be regarded as part of the EUâs core tasks.
Just as I stated earlier, this House pays no more than lip service to the principle of subsidiarity.
The Interinstitutional Agreement contains valid points in terms of improving the management of the EU budget and the more effective combating of irregularities and fraud â areas in which the Member States have their own responsibility to shoulder.
I am expressly opposed to resources being set aside for the globalisation fund, the flexibility instrument, the solidarity fund and perhaps also for European schools.
Â Â  .I abstained from voting because I cannot accept the fact that the budget for research over the next three years has not increased in real terms, even though the Lisbon process and the declarations of the Heads of State or Government rightly consider research to be a key priority for Europe.
Â Â  We have today voted in favour of MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report on the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline.
It is important that a settlement has finally been reached on the EUâs long-term budget.
We are, however, critical of the support in the report for what is known as the Globalisation Fund.
Globalisation entails great opportunities for the Member States of the European Union and, insofar as it poses any challenges, these are best dealt with by the Member States themselves.
Furthermore, we reject the proposal in the report that the EU should have its own resources instead of relying on the contributions of the Member States.
It must be for the Member States to decide what resources the Union has at its disposal.
Any form of EU taxation would be a departure from this principle.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report because the absence of an agreement on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 could undermine the European Unionâs work as from next year.
I should like to pay tribute to Parliamentâs negotiators led by MrÂ BÃ¶ge, who obtained an extra EURÂ 4Â billion for important initiatives in the fields of competitiveness, education, research and youth exchanges.
I deeply regret the fact that the Council did not agree to grant more resources to European farmers, particularly in the field of rural development, in which a sum amounting to EURÂ 20Â billion less than that proposed by the Commission will be made available.
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to remind the Council of its obligations to ensure that the principles of the 2003 CAP reform are respected.
I am completely opposed to the Council proposal on voluntary modulation, which transfers 20% of direct aid to rural development without the obligation of cofinancing.
A system of that kind is unacceptable, given that it could create an imbalance in the market and could constitute a first step towards the renationalisation of the CAP.
Â Â  . It is with but little enthusiasm that I have voted to approve the financial perspectives and the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Whilst the budget lacks ambition, we would, without this agreement, be unable to offer the new Member States any prospects at all.
Moreover, the many programmes would be at risk of grinding to a halt.
A new crisis resulting from rejecting the financial perspectives would represent a huge blow to the European Union.
Â Â  .Like the French Socialists, I voted against the BÃ¶ge report, which ratifies the interinstitutional agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
In January, our Parliament rejected a budget that it regarded back then as mediocre, believing that it was not enough to provide employment, growth, research and the major trans-European networks with the financial levers they require.
On 6Â March, the Committee on Budgets, for its part, unanimously adopted a resolution denouncing this financial perspective, in the hope that the negotiations between the Commission, the Council and Parliament would result in a budget that was more in keeping with Parliamentâs wishes.
The budget is still not large enough now, and the budgetary wrangling needed to satisfy the justifiable and ever-increasing demands aimed at financing all of the EU policies will be very difficult over the next few years.
We shall have to explain to Europeans that this tight budget is down to the intransigence of the Heads of State or Government, who did not want to grant the Union the resources for its ambitions.
Â Â  . We have today voted in favour of MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report on the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline.
The report approves the budgetary and financial consequences of the agreement which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have managed to reach.
It is a positive thing that we have finally reached a settlement on the EUâs long-term budget.
At the same time, it is disappointing that no further progress was made in respect of the reform of the budget.
We should have liked to have seen a thorough overhaul of the agreement on agricultural funding and a methodical reform of regional aid.
More of the EUâs resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime, poverty and climate change, as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world.
The reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008/2009.
There are also sections of the report that we would rather have done without.
Amongst these we might mention what is known as the Globalisation Fund and the text relating to âown resourcesâ.
It is our opinion that it must continue to be the Member States that decide what resources the EU is to have at its disposal.
Â Â  . Parliamentâs negotiating position on the financial perspective 2007-2013, as expressed in its resolution of 8Â JuneÂ 2005, enhanced the financial perspective with quantitative, structural and qualitative elements that were considered ânon-negotiable pointsâ.
These were elements that Parliament claimed it was 'determined to defend', saying it was 'ready to start constructive negotiations with the Councilâ, in the Resolution of 18Â JanuaryÂ 2006, which rejected the agreement of the December 2005 European Council.
That was worthwhile.
Although I acknowledge that the final outcome of the negotiations, especially regarding the quantitative elements, fell short of the position adopted in June, this has, broadly speaking, been a success.
Given the urgent need to obtain an agreement, âthis was the only possible compromiseâ.
In the negotiations, Parliament secured an increase for itself of EURÂ 4Â billion of the total amount earmarked for priority policies, which goes directly to programmes, in accordance with the approach it put forward.
Most of the qualitative elements were reflected in the new interinstitutional agreement.
Of these I should like to highlight Parliamentâs participation on an equal footing in the 2009 review, because this will enable it to find solutions to existing deficits and to improve the forthcoming financial perspective, thus helping us to meet the objective of the abovementioned negotiating position, which remains in place.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .I was unable to resign myself to voting in favour of the amended financial perspective.
Even though Parliamentâs negotiators succeeded in obtaining an extra EURÂ 2 billion over seven years, the difference between Europeâs ambition and the sad reality of the budget is striking.
Even though the needs identified for the trans-European networks come to EURÂ 18 billion, we allocate EURÂ 7.2 billion.
The needs identified for Galileo total EURÂ 2.5 billion, while the appropriations provided for total EURÂ 900 million.
The intelligent part of the CAP, rural development, has seen its appropriations halved.
Research, the Lisbon Strategy, social policy - in short, all of the key policies â have been curbed.
Europe will not make progress with an annual budget that represents scarcely a third of what the US allocates to its military budget alone.
Â Â  Although this compromise, like every other of its kind, has its weak points, it is nevertheless a step forward and one worth supporting.
Accession negotiations, new initiatives in research, and so on, demand more in the way of resources, and Europe would be sending the wrong message to the new Member States and to those with legitimate expectations of solidarity between Europe's regions if the countries had not agreed to this compromise.
It needs to be acknowledged, though, that negotiations of this kind need to be more open and more transparent.
It is not acceptable that certain countries should demand solidarity in one area â agriculture, perhaps â while denying it to others in other areas, such as the structural funds, for example.
It is in everyoneâs interest that a Europe characterised by such âegoismsâ should steadily be done away with.
Â Â  . The proposals for the financial perspective 2007-2013 that we have been putting forward since the outset of negotiations are as follows:
- ensure a Community budget that, on the basis of national contributions commensurate with the relative wealth of each country (based on GNI), will have a redistributive role.
Its priorities will be to bring the levels of economic development of the different countries closer together and to improve the living conditions of their workers and citizens.
- a root and branch overhaul of the common agricultural policy, with the aim of safeguarding each countryâs right to food sovereignty and safety, by means of introducing modulation and a ceiling for agricultural aid, and delivering fair redistribution of agricultural aid among farmers, types of production and countries.
- an end to the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact and the non-application of the N+2 (or 3) rule to this Fund or to the Structural Fund.
- Complete compensation for regions that will suffer from the so-called statistical effect, such as the Algarve.
- Portugal not losing Community funding and the creation of a specific programme for modernising the Portuguese economy in the context of enlargement.
The Community framework that has been adopted runs counter to these objectives and needs.
Hence our rejection.
Â Â  .I voted against the European budget planned for the period 2007-2013 because, in my opinion, it represents a tragic lack of European ambition and the return to intergovernmental practices of which I disapprove and which will paralyse all European public action, and this at the expense of Europeans.
With a sum of EURÂ 864Â billion, or 1.05% of the gross domestic product of the 25 Member States, the financial perspective is not equal to Europe's historic enlargement to incorporate ten new Member States, or the challenges awaiting it for the future.
I believe that we are very far removed from the much-hyped demands made at the start of the negotiations (indeed, in June 2005, the European Parliament voted in favour of a budget totalling EURÂ 974Â billion, or 1.18% of GDP); this budget, I am afraid to say, goes hand in hand with a reduction in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and with a fall in competitiveness, growth and employment, and will rule out any modernisation.
As an MEP, it was therefore my responsibility to reject an agreement such as this, which runs counter to the idea I have of a great Europe.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report on the interinstitutional agreement because I feel that it represents the highest common denominator, following lengthy negotiations in trialogue.
I must register my deep concern, however, about the apparent discrepancy between what is stipulated in the agreement reached in December and its practical application.
It would appear that a discrepancy has now emerged in the funds earmarked for the Algarve region in the context of exceptional measures adopted for statistical effect regions.
If the information is to be believed, the Algarve region will be seriously harmed by the Commissionâs interpretation of the December Agreement, which could lead to the Algarve receiving far worse treatment than any other Objective 2 region, as it will no longer be eligible for phasing out.
In the name of transparency and good interinstitutional cooperation, I feel that it is extremely important that the bases of the interpretation of the content of the 2007-2013 financial package be clarified.
Â Â  . My group has the following reasons for rejecting MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report.
Since it rightly states that Parliament is disappointed in the existing financial framework, it is incomprehensible that this so-called compromise should meet with approval.
Even though the concluding negotiations produced improvements in quality, the underlying problem has not gone away.
This paltry budget will do nothing to help the EU achieve its high targets in terms of cohesion and development.
Today has also seen discussion of the report on the budget for 2007, according to the first paragraph of which Parliament âexpresses concern about the visible discrepancy between the challenges that the European Union faces and the means capable of being made available under the relevant headings of a backward-looking Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 in order for these challenges to be effectively addressed, especially in relation to competitiveness, research and innovation, which the Council and the Commission have categorised as prioritiesâ.
It is to 2007 that the new Financial Perspective will first be applicable.
The adoption of a far too tight framework plan, involving a reduction of 15% in the funds available for the period between 2007 and 2013 over against those originally considered necessary, followed immediately by complaints about the lack of financial resources, does not testify to political farsightedness.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of ratifying the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers, for the following reasons:
1. The excellent negotiations by Portugal and Madeira achieved their goals.
2. Following pressure from Parliament, EURÂ 4Â billion has been added to the spending limit.
3. Rules have been established with a view to the Member States taking greater responsibility for the management of European funds.
4. Parliament has been given a more prominent role in the review of the Community budget, which is to take place by 2009.
I wish to point out that I was one of those who, by voting, contributed towards Parliamentâs decision to reject the budgetary agreement reached by the Heads of State or Government in mid-December 2005.
This obliged the Council of Ministers to sit around the negotiating table with Parliament with a view to reaching a position that would express the common will of both institutions.
I should like to conclude by pointing out that this agreement falls well short of being completely satisfactory.
It is, however, the agreement that was possible under the current circumstances.
Â Â  . I welcome the Interinstitutional Agreement as providing financial stability for the 2007 to 2013 period.
I also welcome the fact that Parliament has been able to add around EURÂ 4Â billion to the original settlement reached by the European Council. This demonstrates Parliament's ability to negotiate effectively with other institutions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the BÃ¶ge report but would like to record my concern about certain elements of the budget agreement which may have a negative impact on the single market.
In particular, the possibility of using 20% modulation in the CAP to fund rural development without having to meet the agreed rules on co-financing and spending guidelines is regrettable and could lead to a distortion of competition between Member States.
It is an attack on the CAP and is effectively a move to renationalise agriculture policy.
Â Â  . If politics is the art of the possible, the search for an agreement on the EUâs financial framework for 2007-2013 has proved to be the art of the minimum possible, which is not a cause for satisfaction.
The EU has over the last few years undergone a major enlargement process to include new countries and political integration.
This needs to be matched by increased funding.
For the prosperity and security project that the EU represents for its citizens to be a reality, it requires a financial framework to match that ambition and its new size.
Furthermore, the notion of solidarity, which has always been an integral part of the make-up of the EU's financial institutions, is justified on the grounds that it is fair and that it seeks to promote a balanced and effective internal market.
In light of these considerations, and in particular the impossibility of going beyond the limited budgetary outcome, my vote in favour is coloured by this regret.
It also comes, however, with the hope that the entire budgetary structure will in due course be rethought with a view to promoting a more development-friendly economy, via the review of the expenditure heading.
Â Â  The final stage has been reached on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 with the vote in favour of an overall package of EURÂ 866.4Â billion.
I should like to quote a figure to you: Europe costs each European 26Â cents a day.
After the standstills on the part of certain Member States â I am referring to the âClub of the six skinflintsâ â which were hoping for a cut-price agreement, we can be satisfied with the compromise adopted, despite its being far below Parliamentâs initial proposal of June 2005, namely EURÂ 975 billion.
Parliament nonetheless managed to extract EURÂ 4Â billion more than what the Council had decided, EURÂ 4Â billion that has been granted mainly to policies regarding education (an extra 40Â 000 Erasmus scholarships!), research, competitiveness and innovation.
On the other hand, other areas have been sacrificed, such as âLifeÂ +â, a far-reaching environmental programme that will only receive 16% of the total funds initially provided for.
To conclude, we have an unsatisfactory agreement and a subsistence budget, which will make it possible to ensure some continuity, but which are nowhere near providing Europe with the resources needed for its ambitions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the proposed financial perspective for 2007-2013.
I still feel, however, that the proposal originally adopted by Parliament was far more beneficial to the EU, not only from the quantitative point of view but also, especially, on account of the methodology used.
Whilst the proposal adopted by Parliament is the consequence of defining policies and priorities and as such is the true expression of a policy, the Councilâs decision, being more of a summary of claims made by the Member States, does not have the same quality.
In spite of this, I voted in favour of the proposal because it would be highly damaging if the European institutions did not have a medium-term financial framework in which to prepare development-related projects.
A further significant reason for voting in favour of the proposal concerns the commitment to review both revenue and spending.
I consider this point to be of major importance, given that I have on a number of occasions expressed the view that the current method of funding the EU has run its course.
For the first time, it has become clear that this reform will take on crucial importance and will require Parliamentâs involvement.
Â Â  . I have voted against the Interinstitutional Agreement.
For the period between 2007 and 2013, Parliament has asked EUR 112Â billion more than the Council.
During MrÂ Blairâs debriefing in December 2005, the group chairmen of the large groups screamed blue murder, claiming that they would not under any circumstances agree to this result.
Five months down the line, it is evident that pressure from the capitals, and particularly from Berlin, has worked very well: all the big promises were taken back.
Parliament has contented itself with an increase of a mere EUR 4Â billion.
This agreement will be unable to adequately meet the major challenges that the EU is facing.
Cutbacks are now being made on the second pillar of agricultural policy which is supposed to fund rural development and which puts quality, animal welfare and environmental care first.
By the same token, not enough funds are being set aside for trans-European networks, programmes such as Erasmus (a mere 140Â 000 students will be placed from now on, compared to 170Â 000 in 2006) and Leonardo (36Â 000 placements compared to 50Â 000), the seventh Research and Development Policy programme, the social agenda, the structural funds, Life+ and Natura, cultural activities, external policy and our dealings with our neighbours.
The people have their expectations of Europe, and it is extremely regrettable that we will be unable to meet them.
Â Â  Between Parliamentâs vote in June 2005 (EURÂ 974 billion) and the agreement reached under the UK Presidency in December 2005 (EURÂ 862 billion), there was a shortfall of EURÂ 112Â billion.Â 
Following many meetings, the agreement reached by the trialogue has made it possible to secure an extra EURÂ 2Â billion, which is far from satisfactory.
Yet, at a time when Euroscepticism is gaining ground within the old and the new Member States, mainly because of the uncertainties linked to the enlargements and to the institutional deadlock, it seems helpful to me to reassure people by adopting the financial perspective for seven years.
Solidarity mechanisms are being preserved, although we will not see them increase in importance, as I would have wished.
It is for these reasons that I will vote in favour of this financial perspective, but I will obviously be unenthusiastic about doing so.
Â Â  . I have voted in favour of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and good financial management, not because these were the financial perspectives of my dreams, but because I welcome the qualitative improvements in financial management and because, since the prospective budgets just about make the grade, we should not throw out the baby with the bath water.
Parliament has, I believe, done a good job â better than ever before and, above all, better than the two other institutions.
It is thanks to our preparatory work and negotiators that we, despite the Commissionâs half-hearted commitment and governmentsâ tight-fistedness, have firm prospects.
In the current circumstances, this agreement is better than the absolute uncertainty surrounding the entire financial policy.
There is one thing that still sticks in my throat, and that is the treatment meted out to rural development, along with the possible moves towards the renationalisation of agricultural policy.
Since we have no guarantees, though, of being able to get agricultural policy on the right track without either the Constitution or financial perspectives, this was not a good enough reason to reject the whole initiative.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, because I believe that the outcome of the negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective is a good one for the 450Â million citizens of Europe.
There is no such thing as a perfect budget.
In the current economic and political climate in the EU, this is a good agreement for Europe and for Portugal, which is set to receive EURÂ 22.5Â billion over the course of this seven-year period.
In addition to the quantitative gains in relation to the Councilâs previous proposal, there are also qualitative benefits that Portugal will enjoy.
What is more, any postponement of the decision would lead to delays in the use of Community funds to resolve people's problems.
Europeâs citizens â the Portuguese in particular â would not appreciate any further delays.
Â Â  I voted against the Sousa Pinto and BÃ¶ge reports, which reflect the way in which Europe has taken a back seat to acts of national self-interest, destroy any far-reaching political project and seriously threaten existing public policies, not least the CAP and the Structural Funds, both of which are tools for showing solidarity with the most vulnerable regions.
As regards agriculture, there will thus be a shortfall of EURÂ 30 billion until 2013 to honour the CAP reform, the negotiators having failed to account for the fact that two new Member States will be joining the Union in 2009.
Having been presented as a way forward for the European agricultural sector, rural development is, for its part, showing a 21% decrease in the appropriations that were allocated to it in comparison with the previous period and is paving the way for the abuse of our rural territories.
The Unionâs Cohesion Policy is undergoing the same drastic cuts, recording a 10% decrease in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, despite the fact that many European regions are lagging behind in terms of development, and thus instead required a substantial effort to be made regarding Community solidarity.
Directly affected, as they are, by this climb-down on the budget, the outermost regions will, moreover, be unable to rely on the development of new regional synergies, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument having lost an extra EURÂ 6 billion.
Â Â  We have chosen to vote against both of these reports as we consider that the total payment appropriations should be below 1% of the total GNI of the EU Member States in accordance with the proposal from the G6 countries.
Nor do we see any reason to celebrate the fact that the EUâs budget has been increased by EUR 4 billion by means of yet another round of negotiations initiated by the federalist majority in the European Parliament.
This money would have been better spent on the political priorities of the Member States in respect of expenditure.
We therefore reject the agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
We also emphatically take exception to the debates in the European Parliament in relation to there being a need to reform the system for own resources and to the EU needing its own source of income, for example by means of a tax being levied on mobile phones across the entire Union.
The EU budget must depend on membership fees from the Member States, and the size of these membership fees must be decided by the Council of Ministers.
Â Â  .In June 2005, Parliament estimated that the Union required a budget of EURÂ 974 billion in order to face up to the challenges of the future.
The agreement on the financial perspective, which was reached on 4Â April at the end of the trialogue between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, is EURÂ 112 billion below our position in JuneÂ 2005.
We have recorded a 35% decrease in the budgetary resources allocated to growth and competitiveness (heading 1a), a 10% decrease for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund (heading 1b) and so on. With such a tight budget, it is very hard to imagine the Unionâs being able to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
This is a minimalist agreement that does not provide the Union with sufficient leeway to conduct new policies for the future.
The only thing going for this financial perspective is the fact that it exists.
We can no longer postpone our vote for fear of not being able to start the new programming period in time.
The Member States and the regions must, in particular, be able to develop and launch their projects in good time so that the latter can be cofinanced as from 2007.
It would, in fact, be tragic if the poorest regions in Europe were unable to have access to structural aid as from 2007.
Those are the reasons justifying my abstention.
Â Â  .I am not going to get into a dispute over figures in order to explain to you why I voted against the reports by MrÂ BÃ¶ge and MrsÂ Sousa Pinto, both of which relate to the financial perspective.
The advocates of this compromise, which they themselves describe as 'tolerable', will not hold it against me, I hope, if I harbour a different ambition for Europe and its citizens to theirs.
I do not want a Europe that is reduced to being a mere free-trade area copied from the Anglo-Saxon model, but rather a Europe founded on the values of solidarity and of sharing among nations, something that has always been the vehicle for European progress.
This financial perspective is tragically lacking in ambition for the future of the European project and merely helps to promote intergovernmentalism.
With a 37% reduction under the heading of growth and competitiveness, and a 10% reduction in the Cohesion Fund, the financial perspective destroys any notion of a revival of Europe and precludes any new policy for seven years.
Â Â  It is regrettable that the European Parliament has not heeded the 1% target of the G6 countries but has instead worked for a budget framework far in excess of this amount.
The agreement also lacks ambition in respect of the necessary reforms of both agricultural policy and regional policy.
Within the framework of a long-term budget of 1% of GNI, there must also be room to invest in scientific research and to support enlargement.
The overhaul of the EUâs system of financing must not under any circumstances cause the EU to be granted its own right to levy taxes, and it is therefore unfortunate that there are wordings that implicitly suggest that this is necessary.
I have therefore chosen to reject the financial consequences that would be associated with the Interinstitutional Agreement and have voted against the reports in their entirety.
Â Â  â Mr President, I voted in favour of the Rack report even though I believe that trafficâs considerable impact on human beings and their environment makes it essential that more freight be carried by rail.
This is an area in which there is ever-increasing, and ever-tougher, competition in the private sector, and, although the Austrian railways, among others, were able to increase the amount of freight they carry, it became evident at the same time that margins were becoming tighter.
A study has shown that an increase in the toll levied on HGVs would result in the transfer of scarcely any traffic onto rails, instead doing no more than speeding up the large-scale closure of small haulage firms at the same time as imposing burdens on the economy and businesses.
The only thing that would promote the transfer of goods to rail would, it appeared, be qualitative and structural improvements.
I believe that the only rational approach to resolving this problem would be a radical reshaping of our transport system, which has, to date, favoured transport criss-crossing the EU from one end to the other.
If, though, this crazy approach to transport is to be maintained, then support should from now on go only to what are termed âroll-on roll-offâ trains.
Â Â  This programme is of great value as a means towards more 'environmentally friendly' mobility, but, if we want to take the pressure off the roads, other means of transport, ranging from waterways to railways, will have to be highly efficient.
Even so, multimodal transport is as strong as every link in the chain, although railways in particular are still the weaker partner and a more recent inventory of the multimodal platforms clearly shows where the weak points are to be found.
The Commission and Parliament would therefore be well advised to concern themselves with this issue over and above these programmes, failing which even the best support programmes will be pulled up short by a lack of efficiency in rail transport and elsewhere, and transport businesses will see no advantage in using railways.
Â Â  . The compromise adopted today introduces various amendments that improve upon the text of the Commissionâs original proposal.
For example, it includes in the scope of application of this regulation more environmentally friendly means of transport, such as rail and inland waterways, and it takes account of the needs of the SMEs and the more remote and vulnerable regions, with a view to delivering better economic and social cohesion.
Bearing in mind these important changes, and bearing in mind the fact that, as the text states, âthe present regulation establishes a financing instrumentÂ âŠ should reduce congestion, improve the environmental performance of the transport system and enhance intermodal transport, thereby contributing to an efficient and sustainable transport systemâ, we cannot accept the drastic reduction in the budgetary envelope laid down for the programme.
Let us not forget that the initial budget came to EURÂ 740Â million and the amount adopted today only comes to EURÂ 400 million, which means a 46% reduction.
We hear about the fight against climate change, honouring the Kyoto Protocol and developing more environmentally friendly means of transport, yet we note that insufficient support is given to implementing those objectives.
Â Â  . Europe's transport system is expected to see an increase of road freight by 2013 of more than 60%.
The results will be greater congestion and environmental degradation, more accidents and a loss of competitiveness of European industry, which must rely, for the management of its supply chains, on cost-efficient transportation.
In this situation, a greater reliance on intermodality is necessary.
In my own constituency of Munster, I have just learned that the port of Limerick is to lose substantial facilities through sale of important land.
This will cause an increase of heavy road traffic in the Limerick city area.
I see my vote today as a support for not only maintaining existing water-borne freight traffic, but also for moving it from road to water.
I know that there are no Marco Polo projects in Ireland, but I intend to urge the interested parties in Munster and Ireland to look for projects that are acceptable under Marco Polo.
Â Â  â The group of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas in the European Parliament would point out that the drastic cut of 50% in the financial framework, from 740 to 400Â million euros, and the criteria for the selection of projects for the implementation of the second Marco Polo programme for the period from 2007 to 2013 are designed to increase the profits of big business and will not mitigate â let alone resolve â the serious problems relating to the major traffic congestion which exists and is worsening in internal and international freight transport, resulting both in an increase in accidents and destructive consequences for the environment.
This choice forms part of the more general anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU, as applied to maritime cabotage in Regulation (EC) No 3577/92 on the responsibility of the Nea Dimokratia and Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima governments in our country, in collusion with shipowners, with painful consequences for workers in maritime and shore transport, professional artisans and small and medium-sized farm owners.
That is why the group of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas in the European Parliament did not vote in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation establishing the second Marco Polo programme.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats have voted to support the compromise amendments to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendtâs report on TSEs that have been jointly tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
We think it important that Parliament be able to demonstrate a broad majority in favour of measures to fight and eradicate TSEs.
Our view is that ruminants should not be fed animal protein.
Experts in the field believe that this may, however, be justified in one exceptional case, namely fish bone meal as a protein replacement for calves.
Our view is that, in such a case, this process must be preceded by careful monitoring in order to ensure that the feedstuff in question is fish bone meal rather than any other animal protein.
Â Â  . This report follows the Commissionâs original proposal of December 2004, which had two objectives: to prolong the validity period of transitional measures and to establish rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, one of the key issues of which is the ban on feeding livestock on processed animal proteins.
The compromise adopted today establishes a series of rules regarding breeding programmes to select for resistance to TSEs or to export and import animal feed.
Nevertheless, despite the food and veterinary crises that have struck in recent years, and their impact on public and animal health, the interests of animal ration companies have taken precedence insofar as they have been granted derogations to the existing general ban; for example, such companies are allowed to use fish flour, and the Commission is allowed to grant partial derogation for certain types of animal such as young ruminants.
We oppose this position, which, apart from the problems already mentioned, raise issues as regards the intensive, verticalised production development model so prevalent nowadays in agriculture and fisheries.
Hence our decision to abstain.
Â Â  â The prevention, combating and elimination of the transmission of spongiform encephalopathy is needed in order to protect public health and livestock.
This is the way to safeguard consumer confidence in the food chain.
Outbreaks of BSE are declining; nonetheless, we must aim to put the crisis well and truly behind us by adapting to the new circumstances and taking preventive measures which make use of scientific studies and findings.
Today's report has several positive proposals in this direction.
However, it does not avoid contradictions with certain amendments that leave the way open for the adoption of the use of animal proteins in ruminants, thereby negating the positive points of the report.
Double standards are also applied, allowing the exportation to third countries of certain processed animal proteins from non-ruminants, in order to save the costs of destruction, thereby using third countries for EU rubbish.
This way of thinking disregards and puts public health in third place, setting profits above all.
This is also the main element of the capitalist system, which is why it is barbaric and inhumane.
It is also dangerous for the food chain and the public health of the peoples.
We have every reason to fight to overturn it.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report which seeks to amend the EUâs current rules on controlling transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in order to bring the EU into line with international agreements reducing BSE risks categories from 5 to 3.
TSEs are brain disorders in animals and include sub-categories such as BSE and other diseases.
The aim is to streamline the risk categories while improving EU animal health controls and maintaining consumer protection.
Â Â  . The Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) voted in favour of the Roth-Behrendt report today, even though it is not entirely satisfied with the compromise between Parliament and the Council.
In the compromise, steps are being taken to relax the ban on feeding non-ruminants animal meal, provided that animals are not fed animal meal originating from their own species.
In this respect, we would refer to the by-products regulation (1774/2002/EC) which lays down the ban on feeding animal by-products to animals of the same species for reasons of possible food safety risks.
While the VVD welcomes this development, we are dissatisfied with the fact that in the compromise, nothing is being said about imposing the same requirements on imported products.
Indeed, non-ruminant products from third countries need not meet any conditions in terms of feeding animal meal.
The VVD believes that third-country products should meet the same requirements, certainly where food safety is at stake.
Despite this, the VVD has voted in favour, because the compromise, in many ways, represents an improvement on the current situation.
Approval of the compromise means agreement at first reading, which means that these improvements can actually be carried out in the short term.
Â Â  The extension of the prohibition on feeding animal-based feedingstuffs to animals other than ruminants is a positive development, but it is most unfortunate that an exception has been included to allow the feeding of fishmeal to calves.
I am therefore voting against this part of the proposal, although otherwise this is a good compromise.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrsÂ Plestinska, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing of European standardisation.
The text proposed by the European Commission and adopted at first reading makes it possible to give a crucial legal basis to the financing of European standardisation.
Standardisation is one of the tools needed for applying Community policies, especially those concerned with the internal market and with increasing the competitiveness of businesses.
I am delighted that access to this financing has been extended beyond the traditional beneficiaries that are usually referred to as 'European standards organisationsâ and will include more activities.
This is a significant show of support, particularly for those European standards that are in competition with other standards worldwide.
Â Â  Technical measures implementing standardisation are a precondition for the satisfactory functioning of the internal market.
It is thus necessary to grant funding to those institutions that are to develop such common standards.
The financing of the institutions and organisations in question should nonetheless be debated and established within the framework of the regular budget negotiations.
It is irresponsible to lay down at this stage the indicative amounts that the institutions in question are to be granted.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  This legislation is based on the fundamental misconception that the aim of standardisation is to increase the competitiveness of businesses rather than to make life easier for consumers.
What is more, it is only logical that industry should pay for standardisation itself if, indeed, it is only businesses that are to benefit.
I therefore oppose the EU granting funding to this work, which should be self-financed through charges.
I am thus voting against the proposal.
Â Â  . The proposal is constituted by a series of technical and procedural regulations that aim at improving competition.
It creates a framework for financing standardisation activities for the implementation of Community policies.
One more proposal, which, if seen as what it is, introduces a better financing framework and facilitates the adoption of European standards, particularly for very small enterprises and manufacturers.
The Commission must be subject to censure, not only for what it does but equally for what it does not do.
Obviously, for the Commission, the prosperity of citizens and the harmonisation of social models and systems of social protection â upwards not downwards â is not a priority.
This Commission continues to ignore the voice of the people calling for harmonisation of social systems before any such internal market is put in place, resulting in social dumping.
Instead it presents a new Lisbon strategy and a directive on liberalisation of services (Bolkestein) as the panacea to all our problems.
Abstention would be the best choice, as a protest vote against the general policy of the Commission and especially the fact that European citizens are at the bottom of its list of priorities.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, MrÂ Rosati, on public finances in economic and monetary Union.
It was crucial to declare that the public finance situation is very worrying to say the least, with some Member States going bankrupt.
Furthermore, it must be noted that Community procedures, whether we are talking about the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) or the excessive deficit procedures (EDP), only partially resolve this tragic situation and are, indeed, ineffective in a context in which weak economic growth and social demands are compromising the European Unionâs capacity to reform itself.
The absence of political will to bring some sense back to the crucial budgetary adjustments is reflected in a tragic increase in debt.
How long is this irresponsibility going to last?
It has become impossible to comprehend how the leaders of the executives in the Member States concerned cannot understand, by using their common sense and by looking at the world's success stories, such as Canada and Demark, that healthy public finances are crucial to achieving higher growth and employment.
Â Â  â Recent developments in public finances in the ÎU show an increase in deficit and debt, and yet no mention is made of the increase in the profits of the plutocracy and of who wins from this policy.
Similarly, there is no mention of the elements of poverty and unemployment for the peoples, who are called upon every time to pick up the bill, so that big business can maintain its profitability and exploitation.
The slow rate of the structural reforms ordered by the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy is presented as the cause of the debt and deficit.
That is why the measures proposed are a higher retirement age, flexible forms of work, lifelong learning and the strengthening of companies, in other words measures and objectives that want slave workers to work without rights to employment, a pension and the basic human necessities, so that euro-unifying capital can increase its competitiveness and profits.
That is why deficits and debts are used as a pretext for new waves of austerity programmes and for the removal of vested rights, which will bring more poverty, unemployment and uncertainty to the workers.
These are the results of the capitalist barbarity from the policy of the ÎU and the governments.
This policy is inhumane and must be overturned.
The message from the grass-roots fight is the need for grass-roots prosperity.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrÂ Rosati on his important and timely report on public finances in the economic and monetary union, to which I give my full support.
I especially welcome the reference to the need to channel efforts into increasing the effectiveness of the preventative and corrective political measures for strengthening and consolidating the EU's public finances.
The fact that the necessary reforms were not carried out reduced growth and jobs and put pressure on public finances.
This question will only be resolved when a question of common interest to the EU is addressed by all Member States.
Â Â  . Europeâs public finances remain in a precarious state.
European growth remains worryingly slow.
The drop in deficits that we have seen is more an indication of the economic adjustments following expectations of greater growth in the economy, rather than the necessary structural reforms that are so vital to the future of the European economy.
Against this backdrop, this report highlights the effects on growth, employment and macroeconomic stability of public finances and calls on the Commission and the Member States to work together to take measures to reverse the slow growth of the European economy and to pave the way for the smooth functioning of the single currency.
These measures are crucial for the European economy to grow strongly on sound foundations, in such a way that it can provide fresh business and job opportunities for its citizens.
We cannot, however, overlook the difficulties that some Member States have had in recent years in keeping public deficits within the levels of the Stability and Growth Pact.
A further reason for us to follow this issue with concern and to call on the Commission and the Member States to take structural measures and be prepared for genuine coordination of economic policies.
I therefore voted in favour of the Rosati report.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0158/2006) by Mr Howitt, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EUâs Policy on the matter (2005/2203(INI)
Â Â  .
Mr President, the job of the European Parliament is to scrutinise and hold to account the institutions of the European Union, yet every year since 1988 in this Parliamentâs annual human rights report, we have scrutinised the record of governments across the world, but never asked the hard questions about what impact the EU itself has had in promoting compliance with international human rights law abroad.
This year we are doing so.
I would like to thank colleagues from the Austrian Presidency who have agreed with us an enhanced role for Parliament, as the Council prepares its annual human rights report on behalf of the Union as a whole.
This is not so much a question of institutional sensitivities: it is more that a unified and strengthened EU human rights report can provide a stronger voice for Europe and our commitment to human rights in the world.
I hope our proposal for an annual EU list of countries of concern will be considered in that context.
I would like to thank the Commissioner, too, for her support for this approach and for listening and responding to Parliament by agreeing to a separate legal instrument for human rights.
This will allow us to continue funding human rights projects, despite opposition from governments responsible for oppression and abuse.
It is the right choice.
Of course Parliament will, this year and every year, offer constructive criticism.
Why does the Council support UN reform which puts human rights onto an equal footing, yet itself have a part-time working group, compared to other foreign policy working groups which are staffed by permanent Brussels-based officials?
Human rights are not a part-time occupation.
When UN troops in Liberia stand accused of rape and torture, how can Europe launch its own ESDP mission in Aceh, Indonesia, without any human rights monitoring?
Why do the EUâs human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation?
And does Europe really apply human rights consistently when it fails to support criticisms of the abuse in both China and Russia, but is prepared to do so for less strategically important countries like Nepal or North Korea?
Explain to the families of 99 trade unionists murdered last year in Colombia, which has the worst record in the world, why Europe actually offers trade preferences to that country for its supposed protection of internationally agreed workersâ rights.
Why have nine Member States, including Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, failed to sign the UN optional protocol against torture?
Eleven EU countries refuse to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, including Britain, France and Spain.
Why have seven of our members considered signing so-called immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court?
When human rights defenders face death threats for upholding their rights, how can evidence show that in Zimbabwe â scene of political imprisonment, mass evictions and the persecution of journalists â the European Commission delegation itself said that it was not aware of the EUâs guidelines for human rights defenders?
We can do better.
We must stop the navel-gazing by EU representatives in international forums and, for the first time, genuinely link multilateral and bilateral negotiations in the EU so that abusive countries know they will face adverse consequences in the EUâs diplomatic trade and development policies.
We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them.
We should ensure that one staff member in every Commission delegation, in 118 countries worldwide, is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations.
We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation, association and accession process, starting with ourselves.
Finally, as far as we ourselves are concerned, let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country, the United Kingdom, on how human rights can be reconciled, given the changed threats of terrorism, people trafficking and organised crime.
It is time to say that the threats might change, but that human rights are inviolable.
When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist, when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall, when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history, the threats of terrorism, trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights, not to tear them down.
So if our generation is sincere in seeking the freedom of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi, tackling the despicable trade in women and children for sexual exploitation and bringing the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Darfur and in the Balkans to justice, we have to defend the concept of human rights at home as well as abroad.
Europe must practice what it preaches.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin on a personal note: this is my third opportunity to speak in this House about the broad issues of human rights.
As far as the Austrian Presidency is concerned, this issue is very dear to our hearts and we want to deal with it in a way that corresponds to what the rapporteur has just said.
We want the European Union as a whole to be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the European Union.
As MrÂ Howitt said, we have to practise what we preach. This is very much what the Presidency is trying to do.
I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for its cooperation and we should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for their contributions.
We are grateful this year that, for the first time, Parliament has adopted a comprehensive approach.
It has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy, which the Council very much appreciates.
To those â be they women or men â who are threatened and tortured for standing up for human rights, it is irrelevant whether the European Union now speaks through Parliament, the Council or the Commission.
The important thing is that we in the European Union should speak at all.
People who rely on help from the European Union do so irrespective of the institution, and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important.
I would like, at this point, to make reference to something that is very important to me personally, even though it may well not be directly connected with the report.
The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring, if at all possible, to set up the Fundamental Rights Agency, and to bring about a final agreement on it, before our presidency comes to an end.
We had, this morning, a highly constructive sitting with Parliament and the Commission, in the course of which we agreed on the basis outlines of what this Fundamental Rights Agency is going to be like.
I would ask you all to play your parts in this, in order that this important institution, which is to represent the European Union as a whole to the outside world, may take concrete form as soon as possible.
The Presidency will be working very hard to that end.
We have closely examined the report, and we are appreciative of the efforts of the rapporteur and of all the Members of your House who worked on it.
I would just like to give particular attention to a few points.
The first has to do with the human rights guidelines, which the report quite rightly emphasises, and which is of great significance in terms of the more effective implementation of EU policy.
At the heart of all that we do is the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and of torture, along with the protection of human rights activists and of children caught up in armed conflict, and I would like to mention the fact that Austrian foreign policy over recent years, not least under the aegis of MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner â who is now a Commissioner â focused particularly on these issues.
We welcome your Houseâs work, in particular that of the Human Rights Sub-Committee, towards the better implementation of the anti-torture guidelines and also your time-honoured commitment to the prevention of human rights violations.
The present Austrian President of the Foreign Affairs Council, MrsÂ Plassnik, takes these matters extremely seriously; in the run-up to the summit between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean, she received human rights campaigners from that region and assured them of the European Unionâs support.
Passing on to the subject of the anti-torture guidelines, we repeatedly hear it said that the European Union does not do enough in individual cases.
We are of course well aware of the fact that whether or not people detained in police custody are treated humanely is often something that is determined within hours, and, true though this is, we must also be honest with ourselves and admit the regrettable fact that our options are often limited.
Within the scope afforded by those options, the European Union does speak out very strongly in cases where people face the threat of torture and inhumane treatment, but we regret our inability to prevent them in every case.
The implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, and cooperation with the UNâs human rights apparatus generally, was, during our presidency, an essential part of our human rights policy; in this respect we were doing no more than continuing the European Unionâs traditional policy, and initiated dÃ©marches on the subject in over twenty-five countries.
The subject of torture and inhumane treatment is of course an important one, and it is one that we keep on raising in our human rights dialogues with third countries.
Having visited Kazakhstan, where we engaged in political dialogues with the countries of Central Asia, and more recently, the region of the Southern Caucasus, I myself can say that the European Union has always been very forthright in addressing the issue of torture and inhumane treatment, as well as human rights matters in general.
Elections to the UN Human Rights Council were held a matter of a few days ago, and I am sure that we can generally be satisfied with them, since it turned out that certain states who are notorious violators of human rights were not elected after all, and the European Union had in fact given an undertaking not to vote for countries known to have a poor record on human rights.
The Human Rights Council will meet for the first time on 19Â June, in other words, before the end of our presidency.
Our desire is that this new United Nation body should, in future, make a constructive and essential contribution to working for human rights around the world.
In conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise the great importance of exchange between the institutions in terms of our work for human rights.
Only an even-handed and universal human rights policy on the part of the European Union will get a hearing and, eventually, bear fruit.
The presentation of the European Unionâs annual report on human rights to your House in December, an occasion on which you traditionally highlight human rights priorities by presenting the Sakharov Prize, and your Houseâs response to that report, makes an important contribution towards that end.
Our common goal is an effective and visible human rights policy for the European Union, which will see us standing up for our values.
The European Parliament is making a significant contribution in this respect, to which tribute was paid in the European Unionâs annual report for 2005.
The European Parliamentâs achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report, which will be prepared under the Finnish Presidency.
I would like, once again to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this outstanding report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity for a human rights debate.
I thank Mr Howitt for his excellent report. I also welcome the comprehensive analysis of action.
As the President said, both the Commission and the Council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy.
Let me make a few comments and raise a few issues.
First, I acknowledge the strong support of Parliament for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and its continued interest.
I assure you that all the elements that contribute to the success of this initiative will be maintained for the period 2007 to 2013, for instance independence from government approval and support for civil society organisations.
I share the concern to make our actions in the area more flexible and in tune with the needs of the grassroots organisations.
This year we are already trying out concrete improvements in our procedures, notably in the calls for proposals.
We also need to better adapt the programme to the sensitive situations and restrictions often faced by civil society organisations.
I will certainly continue to rely on your support to carry through those changes.
Secondly, I am grateful for the recognition of the effectiveness of the EU election-monitoring activities. They clearly demonstrate the commitment of the European Union to the democratic process and the sustainable resolution of conflicts.
That is clearly reflected in the significant increase in the number of observation missions over the last two years, particularly in post-conflict and transition situations.
The professional and independent approach of EU electoral observers is highly regarded and enjoys credibility and leverage.
I am sensitive to the need to ensure that any further increase in that area does not squeeze resources from other priorities and I can assure you that I will do my best in that regard.
Thirdly, I welcome your positive comments on the human rights work of the EU in multilateral fora.
Great efforts go into consolidating EU positions in such fora, which are often instrumental in achieving progress.
As the President has already said, that leadership role of the European Union was clearly visible in the negotiations establishing the Human Rights Council.
I should like to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, which capably steered through somewhat difficult waters.
Now that elections to the Council have taken place, the real work of this new body at the helm of the international and human rights system begins.
I am confident that it will prove more efficient than the old Commission on Human Rights.
Fourthly, I should like to pay tribute to the work leading to the report on gender equality and womenâs rights.
The mainstreaming of womenâs as well as childrenâs rights remains a priority for this Commission and for me personally. The ongoing work on a comprehensive communication on childrenâs rights encompassing the internal, as well as the external, affairs of EU action is testimony to that.
I welcome the recommendations made by the rapporteur on the format of this and future reports.
I hope that it will be possible to make the 2006 EU Human Rights Report a truly interinstitutional report.
In that respect, my services have already suggested to the Member States that, as suggested by Parliament, the 2006 report should include a section on human rights guidelines, more emphasis on the use and impact of human rights clauses, and it should also aim to cover the activities of all three institutions â the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
That should not in any way be interpreted as impinging on the prerogatives of Parliament to scrutinise the work of the Council and Commission.
But there will be space and need for a separate report by Parliament on the European Unionâs human rights policy.
I agree with Mr Howitt that a reinforced effort should be made by the European Union as a whole to address human rights concerns more systematically and to mainstream human rights considerations in EU policies.
In that task, cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is crucial.
You can be sure that we are a partner in it.
Â Â  . Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I am happy to welcome the content of MrÂ Howittâs report, particularly the sensitivity he has shown in terms of dealing with the gender perspective in a transversal manner.
As we pointed out in our opinion attached to the report, we believe that the international legislation supporting and protecting women's rights should systematically become the cornerstone of all bilateral relations, particularly in the case of third countries with which the European Union has signed association and cooperation agreements.
Furthermore, since the Summit between the European Union and Latin America has just taken place, we wanted the report to condemn the dramatic phenomenon of feminicide, which consists of torturing and killing women merely because they are women, and to highlight the need to put an end to the impunity relating to it.
Finally, I would also like to point out that we have noted once again that women are the main victims of armed conflicts and, at the same time, from a positive point of view, we must stress the crucial role they play in terms of building peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly, I welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot.
I want to thank the chairmen of the various groups for that. It is recognition of the importance of this report.
This year, we have a very different report, in style and in content.
We are essentially undertaking an experiment.
Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy, in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines.
We are doing this on the understanding that the Council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the EU.
That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges, as well as the more local challenges.
In the past, as you know, Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each otherâs work to a certain extent by producing similar reports.
Certainly, as rapporteur last year, I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced.
However, if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year, we will have to revert to our previous approach.
I appeal to the Council, therefore, to make the new formula work so that we can have a common, strong, unified human rights report, representing a European view on human rights, that we can send to all corners of the world.
Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do: assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people.
Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances.
The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done.
I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report.
Â Â  . Mr President, everybody should read and study the excellent report by my friend MrÂ Howitt very carefully, because in it they will find challenges and responses.
At a time when the great debate is security â and there is no question that security is a great issue â our fears must not lead us to question our basic principles in terms of human rights.
There can be no European political project without making human rights a priority.
Lowering our guard in terms of human rights â and that may be what we are doing â means surrendering democratic standards and the European Unionâs greatest values.
We cannot permit this kind of double standard for the sake of . Such double standards are unsustainable since they greatly harm the credibility of our democracy.
People suffering from persecution, torture, discrimination fear and death expect us to take decisive and coherent action to defend their rights.
Furthermore, speaking with one voice within international bodies â as the Commissioner and the representative of the Council have said â defending human rights with the voices of twenty-five countries behind us, with the energy that the Union must apply at this time, will strengthen all of us and will at last make it possible for us not to have to go back to thinking, as we are at the moment, about what we call torture, what we call murder, what we call security and what we call the crucial defence of human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this human rights report is clear, comprehensive and ambitious.
It is an appeal in favour of more coordination and more coherence in the human rights policy of the EU and of the Member States.
We all know that the rapporteur dreams of a single human rights report reflecting the viewpoints of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and that dream can, and will, become reality one day, provided that, in the short term, the Council takes Parliamentâs advice seriously and in the longer term, places economic and commercial considerations second to the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible.
I endorse the rapporteurâs point of view that the European initiative for democracy and human rights is an extremely important instrument in the EUâs human rights strategy.
I also share Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnerâs view that more funds need to be set aside for election observation missions, which, certainly in post-conflict situations, are crucial in strengthening democracy and human rights.
I also have high expectations of the inclusion of human rights clauses in all EU agreements.
Setting up sound instruments is one thing, but applying them consistently and courageously is quite another, and so it is baffling that the Commission should continue to dither about applying ArticleÂ 96 of the Cotonou Agreement in certain cases of blatant human rights violation in ACP countries, of the sort that are, for example, currently going on in Ethiopia.
A policy of double standards threatens to make the EUâs human rights policy less credible and should be avoided at all costs.
What is so good about the Howitt report is that, in moving away from situation ethics, it finally offers a prospect of a more systematic and integrated approach.
That is something I can support with a great deal of enthusiasm.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the subcommittee decided this year to change the structure of the annual report on human rights.
Thus, we will no longer have an assessment of the situation in countries, but a report on the Commission's, the Council's and Parliament's implementation of the EU instruments regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy.
We achieved this result despite the difficulties involved.
We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups.
Parliamentâs role consists in guiding, monitoring and assessing the policy of the Council and of the Commission.
That is why it is crucial that Parliament continues to draft its own report.
If we had to draft a report with the input of three different parties for example, we could not criticise a Member State's action â which we can take the liberty of doing with the current report â because all that that Member State would have to do is to veto it.
The amendment to ArticleÂ 8 that we have tabled is along these lines.
MrÂ Howittâs report presents a number of interesting and innovative proposals concerning the mechanisms for promoting human rights.
The report specifically calls for qualified majority voting within the Council and for possible restrictive measures against a third country.
It logically follows on from the report adopted by Parliament: the Agnoletto report.
The report also proposes to ensure that the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, which has recently been set up, is not chaired by a State that is responsible for human rights violations.
Furthermore, it proposes to implement a system aimed at keeping MEPs regularly informed of the actions carried out by the Council and the Commission.
The report also stresses the need for cross-cutting human rights policies to be drafted within Parliament.
It is in this spirit that the subcommittee proposed to allow the delegations to put forward candidates for the Sakharov Prize.
The report refers to the violations of rights, or forms of intolerance, that are practised in certain Member States, to the use of torture, to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or to the banishment of people to countries that use torture, to the use of diplomatic assurances and to extraordinary rendition.
That is why we must establish a close link between the European Union's internal and external policies and perhaps contemplate having just one European Parliament report on human rights, drafted together with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the issues related to asylum and immigration require.
As such, I reject paragraphÂ 97, which in some ways supports the implementation of the pilot Regional Protection Programmes.
The Commission plans to implement one of these initial programmes in Belarus, a country responsible for numerous human rights violations, which maintains no diplomatic relationship with the Union and which offers no guarantee regarding the protection of migrants.
These programmes do not seem appropriate to me.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Howitt report represents a significant advance on the past insofar as it tries to analyse the effects of the European Union's human rights policies and, above all, their effectiveness with regard to third countries.
The first, significant difference of this report comes in the shape of a request for subsequent annual reports to include an assessment of whether the democracy clause, which was adopted on 14Â February, is actually being complied with.
I must point out, however, that neither the Council nor the Commission has given any precise indication of the way in which it intends to incorporate that human rights and democracy clause in the commercial dealings between Europe and third countries.
As regards the fledgling UN Commission for Human Rights, the document to be voted on calls on the European Union to support the activities of that body and, at the same time, promotes the universal ratification of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, especially on the part of the United States, for which no legal exception can be made.
The document in question also specifically condemns the bilateral agreements that a number of EU countries have drawn up with the United States for the purposes of guaranteeing impunity to US soldiers.
Lastly, it calls on the European Union to take a consistent approach to human rights, in the specific cases of China, with regard to the Tibetan people, and of GuantÃ¡namo, on the subject of which it calls for the immediate closure of all of the detention centres.
Nevertheless, I cannot fail to mention some shortcomings of the report too.
It does not in fact make any reference to the European Unionâs failure to commit itself to supporting human rights on the occasion of the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong.
On the subject of Iraq, moreover, ArticleÂ 38 is too vague: it does not criticise the human rights violations carried out by the occupying forces, or the use of illegal weapons such as, for instance, the white phosphorous used in Falluja.
Finally, on the subject of Colombia, ArticleÂ 41 is not as explicit as the situation of the Latin American country's citizens would, on the contrary, require, such as in the case of the residents of peace communities who have been affected by countless massacres where the perpetrators have gone unpunished.
The report fails, in fact, to firmly condemn the climate of violence in the country and to acknowledge a correlation between this situation and the recent legislative measures, such as the âPeace and justiceâ law, which actually allow paramilitary forces to become part of the Colombian army.
I have one final observation to make: although I support the request for the European Union's annual report on human rights to provide for the involvement of the European Parliament, I do, however, think it just as necessary that Parliament continues to draft its own specific report, with the aim of ensuring that Parliament monitors the European Commission's practical commitment towards human rights and of assessing that monitoring effort.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wonder what human rights we are talking about, when our economic policy creates an eminently class-ridden society.
If we really want to consider human rights, we will not do so in this House; let us go to the rest rooms so you can see the women working there.
No relation of ours is working there; poor, respectable women from North Africa are working there.
So who is talking about human rights?
Those who exterminated, who eliminated an entire race from the face of the earth?
The Red Indians.
Who is talking about human rights?
Those who based their wealth on the natives in their colonies for centuries on end?
Who is talking about human rights?
Those who, with a beer in the evening, enjoy the charms of some beautiful, poor, weak girl from the former eastern bloc?
Who is talking about human rights?
Those who support and coexist with dictators who torture their people in order to invade another country? Or is that not what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq?
Who is talking? Those who turn a blind eye to what has been happening for three years now in Iraq?
Who is talking?
Those who accept Turkey in Europe, when a month ago they murdered a Catholic priest there, burned the effigy of the ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Christians and set light to the synagogues?
I therefore am not prepared to talk about human rights.
My conscience forbids me with everything it sees happening around it, with everything that we all allow to happen.
Â Â  . I would like to thank MrÂ Howitt for the enormous amount of work he has done in preparing this excellent report, which reflects the European Parliamentâs role in the European Unionâs human rights policy strategy.
For a successful human rights policy it is essential for the EU Member States to implement a joint, consistent and visible policy in bilateral relations with countries that do not respect human rights.
Our relations with Russia, as a strategic partner, are very important.
It is therefore essential that in the report the Commission and the Council are requested to discuss violations of human rights in Chechnya during talks with Russia.
In the report, hopes are expressed concerning the newly-created UN Human Rights Council.
The election of Cuba, Nigeria and other similar countries, however, prompts concerns regarding the election mechanism and whether the Councilâs work will be more successful than that of the Commission on Human Rights.
The European Union must therefore systematically object to the allocation of the presidency to such countries and the Council must express the common EU stance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the report overplays the role that the EU carries out on the world stage regarding human rights, so much so that it highlights the inconsistency of the measures taken against third countries.
The request for the Council to identify those countries that give particular cause for concern in terms of human rights violations would have counted for something if, at the same time, it had produced measures against those countries; above all, if it had the courage to implement those measures against large countries too, such as China and the United States.
We must certainly make respect for human rights obligations a priority in the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, and the same goes for the stabilisation and association negotiations with countries from the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
The Commission must therefore demonstrate that no grey areas exist in that regard.
I acknowledge the fact that the fight against trafficking in human beings, which underpins illegal immigration, particularly from eastern Europe, Africa and China, is now regarded as a priority that is widely shared by the Community institutions.
As for the concerns expressed by MrÂ Howitt on Iran â with reference to the first few months of President Ahmadinejadâs term of office â I frankly regard such concerns as simplistic and demagogic, in the same way that I regard the EU's supportive stance towards US policy in Iraq and the violations in GuantÃ¡namo as servile and counter-productive.
To conclude, I believe that a progressive scale of measures and sanctions to be applied in the event of a human rights violation should be defined as a matter of priority.
Arrests on political grounds, the persecution of minorities, acts of torture and the repression of a personâs freedom of religion, speech and expression are acts that, wherever they take place in the world, require practical action from the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, this annual event clearly demonstrates this Parliamentâs total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights in the world, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature.
We must welcome the constructively critical approach that MrÂ Howitt takes in his report.
We should accept that, on many occasions, we should take a good look at our own house before throwing ourselves into putting the world right.
This Parliament puts its commitment to human rights into practice by means of its resolutions, by means of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought and by means of the strong positions it has expressed with regard to the International Criminal Court and the death penalty.
I believe that we must support the European Commission and the Councilâs efforts to introduce the human rights dimension into the European Union's external actions with regard to the candidate countries, Mr President; with regard to the neighbouring countries, within the context of the neighbourhood policy, Commissioner; by means of the democratic clause that we have with third countries; by means of the instrument for the defence of democracy and human rights; and, in particular, by means of the initiative that the Commission has implemented in the form of electoral observer missions in third countries, which are a privileged instrument which enhance the image and the respect for human rights that the European Union must try to communicate throughout the world.
Mr President, the Union's three institutions â the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament â must work together and make every possible effort to ensure that this 21st century is the century of human rights and that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms become the norm in every region of the planet.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Unionâs policy in the field of human rights should shape the European Neighbourhood Policy and also become an effective instrument in todayâs global civilisation for the protection of people threatened by genocide and war crimes, people fighting for democracy and fundamental freedoms and all those who experience discrimination due to ethnic origin, religious beliefs, gender, disability or sexual orientation.
Human rights policy cannot apply double standards â one approach for small countries and a different one for large countries that are of strategic importance to the European Union.
The policy should be effective.
In view of this, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights takes on particular importance, as does increasing the budget of this institution.
The European Parliament must take on the responsibility for raising the importance of human rights protection in the European Union.
It must become a place where new initiatives in this field will emerge, and the institution which coordinates the human rights actions of the different Union institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report.
I am pleased that we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses are a problem and I welcome the new measures we are taking in this report.
I hope we continue in this way.
Having said that, I am pleased that the situation in Kashmir has been included.
I hope we will eventually find a just solution involving the Kashmiri people that will end human rights abuses from all sides.
I am also glad that we call in this report for the Americans to close down Guantanamo Bay.
I think it is very important that we do this and that detainees have a fair trial.
Again, that is included in this report.
I am sorry, however, that my amendment on CIA flights was not accepted by the committee, but I note Amendment 5, which seeks to rectify this situation.
It is very important that we include CIA flights in this report.
I would have liked a stronger statement on people with mental health problems, as the rapporteur knows, but I am pleased that they have been included.
I am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally, with a particular emphasis on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.
As many of you know, I was Parliamentâs rapporteur on that issue.
I am glad that there is a strong mention of trafficking in human beings.
I, along with Mr Coveney and various other Members, have been campaigning on this subject for quite some time.
I am sorry, however, that we are told repeatedly in our committee that we cannot mention human rights abuses within the European Union.
That, I believe, takes away from the strength of our argument when we are talking about human rights abuses in other parts of the world.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EU's human rights policy is one that I welcome, agree with, and endorse, in that it sheds a self-critical light on the EUâs human rights dialogues and gives a balanced evaluation of them.
Despite the progress that has been achieved, through, for example, the initiatives taken by the human rights sub-committee and the appointment of a personal representative for human rights, deficits are still apparent, particularly in the EUâs dialogues on human rights with third countries.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the pre-eminent importance of human rights, which are universal, and it is vital that greater account be taken of them in every area of policy and that they become a permanent component of them.
Among this Houseâs essential functions are the global prosecution of violations of human rights and the promotion and defence of those rights.
What I would like to see in future would be closer attention given to the human rights situation in the countries that are applying for accession to the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, another year, another report, but what real change?
Still we trumpet human rights and democracy clauses in partnership agreements with third countries, but non-compliance largely seems to go unmarked.
Apart from a single suspension in the case of relatively insignificant Uzbekistan, these clauses might as well not exist, especially with regard to major economic forces like China.
There it seems to some of us that the value of trade persuades the EU to do less than it could about flagrant breaches of human rights and instances of religious persecution.
Indeed, one is tempted to say that such is the EUâs apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations.
Likewise, when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning Zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions, the EU countries also avoided that issue.
It is true that we talk the talk of human rights, but too often, it seems to me, we hold back when there are economic interests which we seem to hold dearer.
Â Â  Today we are discussing a truly important report on the human rights situation in the world in 2005 and European Union policy in regard to this matter.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, for his cooperation.
Mr President, the European Union continues to be leading in the world in the area of human rights, and of all the European Union's institutions, the European Parliament is the fiercest defender of human rights.
The bad news is however, that Europe is much better at making declarations than it is at adhering to them.
The Union is able to take up some sterling work on human rights, but in some strange way is unable to integrate decisions on human rights into its policies and programmes.
If we sincerely cherish our values and want to defend them, this situation must change.
I believe it is high time to identify the countries raising the greatest concern in each annual report, and thus develop an initiative facilitating the establishment of priorities.
In order to provide short and concise information about countries which are prone to crisis and to trigger joint actions by the Council of Ministers and foreign ministers of Member States, the Council already has drafted the monitoring lists which are revised every six months.
Such information could be used to draw up the lists of countries causing particular concern with the aim of drawing special attention to them.
It is also clear that significant improvements are needed in respect of the visibility and dissemination of the reports, especially amongst journalists and the national parliaments.
To conclude, I would like to draw your attention, Mr President, to a provision in the report which I feel is very important.
I quote, âthe European Parliament welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme during the UK Presidency; is concerned at the high number of journalists worldwide being convicted for alleged defamation of public officials or politicians; asks the Council to advocate a worldwide moratorium on such imprisonment of journalists as a first stepâ.
I am firmly convinced that in this context we, the European Parliament, must mention countries where the situation is particularly bad, that is, Cuba, Belarus, North Korea and the People's Republic of China.
And this must be included in our resolution.
Â Â  I am truly satisfied with Mr Howitt's report which I believe is exceptional in the way it does not distinguish between large and small States and treat them under equal standards.
However, in my opinion the paragraph on China lacks some highlighting of the Tibet problems.
Tibet, as we know, was occupied by China, but for some reason we have recognised it as an inseparable part of China.
China is committing genocide against the Tibetan people, but nowhere have we even mentioned that.
The fact alone that each year around 3Â 000 children, and I stress children, escape to India via the Himalayas and Nepal just so that they can learn their own language, is worthy of notice.
The Tibetan nation and its culture are being extinguished right in front of our eyes.
For Tibetans even cultural autonomy is an unattainable dream, and negotiations about this between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and China are fictitious, as being conducted on the expert not on the principle level.
I believe that we must change our position in respect of Tibet, if we really do not want to see the Tibetan people and their culture destroyed.
Â Â  Mr President, we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world.
I thank the rapporteur for his evident hard work in compiling this comprehensive report, for the cooperative attitude he has demonstrated throughout and his support for the inclusion of Kashmir.
For this, I personally thank him.
Colleagues, we often speak of human rights in the abstract, in terms of well-rehearsed subjects and themes, but in this instance I should like to ask colleagues to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday abroad.
You take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy.
There are no witnesses, for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find.
You say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence.
This leads to a legal process which finds you innocent, then finds you guilty, then starts over again until every appeal is exhausted and you are ultimately condemned to death, with due legal process having been thrown out of the equation.
All this takes 18 years; half your life on death row: a cruel life sentence in itself. This is not an abstraction.
This is the tale of the rough justice of a British and EU citizen, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death on 1Â June â his 36th birthday â a matter of days away.
Today, we reaffirm this Houseâs role as a defender of human rights with a long history of opposition to the death penalty.
I implore you all to live up to the responsibility this position carries and make representations to the President of Pakistan, appealing for clemency for Mirza Tahir Hussain.
Â Â  Mr President, during the recent UK Presidency, the European Union intervened diplomatically in 26 separate matters related to human rights, and published 49 statements on the issue.
It is laudable that we are spending so much time here at the European Parliament on issues related to human rights in the broadest sense.
During each Strasbourg session we hold debates on infringements of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.
However, while we debate the situation in African or Asian countries, we cannot forget about the Member States.
Such problems affect a large number of them, and especially some of the new Member States.
Let us therefore protect and fight for human rights throughout the world, but let us keep our eyes and ears open and remember that just next door, in a neighbouring state, they are not always respected.
I say this with the utmost conviction as a practising lawyer who sees clear evidence of this happening.
Â Â  â The Howitt report contains a fresh approach to the manner in which Europe views its fight for a global human rights culture, an approach that abandons the purely descriptive method and challenges the European institutions as regards the effectiveness of their actions.
Greater institutional integration for the Union, political, not just technical, relations with the Council of Europe and a binding charter of rights: this is the basis of a European front that takes rights seriously.
Parliament is today calling for all European political institutions to play their part in this master plan of spreading the sacred principles of humanity and the rule of law around the world.
Europe cannot be an end in itself.
The enlightened ideal at its core implies that it must take its crusade of rights around the world, and that it must have the courage to resist the temptation of , because the politics of interested parties leads to uneven demands on the Member States in the area of rights.
I wish to stress the importance of concerted action on the part of the Union and all Member States on human rights, because on this issue there remain a great many contradictions that diminish the moral authority of the Union's political system in negotiations and weaken the impact of European policy.
The Union presidencies have a great responsibility to ensure that the human rights policies of the Union and its Member States are consistent across the board.
A strong, concerted European rights policy would address the litany of horrors that, unfortunately, is not exclusive to underdeveloped countries.
The death penalty, and even the exploitation of work that leads to company relocations, to give two very different examples, can only be combated with a tough concerted rights policy.
Furthermore, an increasingly ambitious Europe in terms of military presence can only be an increasingly ambitious Europe if it has a culture of rights, a political Europe that has people at its core, because that is the nature of Europe.
Â Â  â It is clear that Europe is becoming more visible and more active when it comes to addressing the issue of human rights.
However, the amount of human rights breaches taking place around us which are being addressed, and whether Europe is showing its teeth, is debatable.
It is also very clear that many of the different institutions are giving the impression that they are acting alone.
I am not referring to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, but, for example, to the banking institution.
I think that Europe should use the power that it has.
There is compatibility, and I believe that there should be collaboration between tackling the problems of human rights on the one hand, and economic power or the power of the assistance that Europe should provide on the other.
I am aware that this is difficult.
Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by referring to paragraph 14 of number 90, which states: 'welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme'.
I would like to mention this because in my country, Malta, two journalists, Daphne Caruana Galizia and Saviour Balzan, have just been the victims of arson attacks.
I would like to express my solidarity with Maltese journalists against these attacks, which are a direct attack on their fundamental human rights.
Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr President, emphasis on the importance of human rights has been a special feature of pan-European organisations during the entire period since the Second World War.
The importance of human rights has not waned as the years have gone by; on the contrary, it has grown.
At a time when trade between the EU and third countries has increased and the EU is involved in counter-terrorist activity, it is important to remember that human rights are not of subordinate importance or completely insignificant.
Human rights are not subordinate to terrorism or active commerce.
The EU can have a huge influence on human rights if it speaks with one voice.
The EU has not always managed to do that, although of course it has sometimes.
At present one would hope that the EU could concentrate more than it does now on eradicating hunger and poverty.
Hunger and real poverty are among the worst violations of human rights right now in the world.
I wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Howitt, for the excellent cooperation that he has shown, and for taking into consideration the many amendments we have tabled.
Furthermore, I was delighted to see that the rapporteur expressly emphasised the importance of the fact that the report resulted from cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Only in this way will NGOs representing different political groups and their views come to the fore.
Â Â  Mr President, in my speech I would like to point out three issues related to the Howitt report.
First of all, the European Union should have an effective financial instrument along the lines of the American foundations that support those who fight for human rights across the world.
The organisations and societies which often work illegally and which build and defend democracy, freedom of speech and respect for basic rights deserve our support.
Meanwhile, over the last 12 months, debates within the European Union institutions have centred solely on the creation of a new agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, which is supposed to deal with respect for these rights, but only in the Member States of the European Union.
In view of this, I would like to quote paragraph 56 of the report, which âcalls on the Commission to take seriously into consideration the position of the European Parliament seeking a specific human rights instrument for 2007-2013; looks forward to receiving the Commission's communication in this matterâ.
The second issue is the deplorable fact that the European Union refused to support the resolution on Chechnya at the 61st session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Atrocities are carried out by the Russian army in Chechnya and between 3Â 000 and 5Â 000 Chechens have disappeared without trace.
These were unarmed civilians who were detained by the Russians.
The rapporteur is quite right when he states in his report that the attitude adopted by the European Union suggests that the Union is applying one set of rules in the case of small countries and a different set of rules in the case of larger ones.
The third issue I wanted to mention is the critical situation of Christians living in Muslim countries.
This situation has deteriorated in the last few months.
The war in Iraq and the outrage sparked by the publication of the caricatures in European newspapers have created a state of constant danger for Christian minorities in the Muslim world.
Â Â  Mr President, we must regard the process of globalisation as an opportunity for freedom and social progress.
Globalisation is associated with a higher demand for fundamental human freedoms, but only if the opportunities it provides are utilised appropriately.
I have been thinking about the thoughts expressed by the President of the Republic of Greece today.
Europe is the strongest bastion of humanism.
It is important that we can continue to say the same in the future, to make this clear to the rest of the world, and to make it into an example to be followed.
The European Union is an international player with a crucial mission to protect human rights, strengthen democracy and ensure that globalisation actually means the achievement of social cohesion.
I believe that it is important for the European Union to insist on the enforcement of fundamental human rights in its relations with third countries.
It must employ pragmatically the opportunities for political dialogue provided by foreign trade.
The strength of the report is that it warns us not to monitor compliance with human rights only outside of the borders of the European Union, because there is enough to be done in this respect within our own borders, too.
The report can serve as a firm foundation to ensure that in the future we will not just accept statements regarding human rights, but we will also excel in complying with them and in ensuring their enforcement.
My thanks to the rapporteur.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion it is perfectly natural for Parliament to make greater demands of the other institutions and, of course, I listened to your speeches with close attention.
I think that criticism is necessary if we are going to make progress, but I have also noted, both in MrÂ Howitt's report and in this debate, some positive comments regarding our policies, for which I would thank you once again.
In a field such as the promotion and protection of human rights, the assessment is inevitably mixed.
I should like to tell you how I see the situation.
First, is the EU an important player in this field, which counts and is counted on?
My response to that, without doubt, is yes.
We have continually seen this demonstrated.
Our state and non-state partners, both States and international organisations, are continuing to turn to us and to see us as a major player, and sometimes as indispensable, owing to our political credibility, our influence, our expertise and the instruments we have at our disposal.
Secondly, does the EU have the right tools to perform its activities?
My response to that too is yes.
We have access to international instruments as part of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, to name but two.
We have the framework of our widely quoted bilateral agreements, including human rights clauses, and common political guidelines in many sectors, political dialogues and approaches of all kinds.
We also have the financial, geographical and thematic instruments.
Thirdly, are we contributing and doing enough?
To that, I would tend to say no, particularly if our actions are examined in general terms.
If we look at specific situations, however, such as the adoption of the resolution establishing the new Human Rights Council or cases relating very specifically to countries and individuals, there are many instances where we made a difference.
In any event, the EU, including the Member States, has certainly been the player that has made the most important contributions at global level and really has had a very strong presence, even though we are not always as visible as you or we would wish.
Finally, is the human rights policy we are pursuing effective?
Are we having an impact?
For my part, I, like Parliament, should like us to increase our effectiveness and impact.
To do so, we need to take a big step forward in quality terms, particularly in terms of consistency: consistency between the policy pursued at EU level and those pursued by the various Member States, and consistency between the EU's political will and the national interests that come to light at certain key moments in bilateral relations.
And we need, in some cases, to create a better balance between our multilateral agenda and the bilateral agenda.
We also need to mobilise all the institutions of the Union, including, of course, the European Parliament.
As I have already said, we are very much in favour of a report drawn up jointly by the three institutions.
Let us work towards this!
Parliament can certainly count on me.
Neither I nor my services will spare any efforts.
You can count on us for the assessment and also the implementation of the human rights policy, even if we too are often faced with a political reality that is not easy to control.
However, if we want to increase the impact of our policy, particularly by improving the consistency of our actions at European and national levels and between the various institutions, Parliament's annual report, like MrÂ Howitt's, must in my opinion be the inspiration for our actions.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in saying, at the end of this debate, what a joy it is that we are all agreed on the need for the three institutions of the European Union to speak to the outside world with one voice if they are to be effective.
A very large number of issues have been addressed in this debate, but, whether our concern is with human rights or with development cooperation, the fundamental question every time is whether we are doing enough, and the answer to that question is always ânoâ; there is always more that we could be doing.
All of us â Parliament, Commission and Council â must be at all times capable of that sort of self-criticism, for whenever human rights are at stake, when people are tortured, when their rights are trodden underfoot â as they are in many countries â then what that means is that we, who are tasked with the defence of human rights, are not doing enough.
That is why we need to give constant thought to how we could improve our performance, and what this debate has done is to help us to do just that.
A range of issues have been addressed, and I would just like to touch very briefly on one or two of them.
It was said, and quite rightly too, how important civil society is in terms of human rights.
Institutions of state and governments are particularly dependent on the cooperation of civil society and non-governmental organisations.
Thinking back, for example, to our recent experience with the EU/Latin America/Caribbean summit, there was much evidence at it of civil society involvement in human rights matters, and both governments and parliaments had to take this very seriously.
Human rights and good governance have an increasing role to play in development cooperation.
I am sure we are all agreed â and this has become evident to me from my conversations with the Committee on Development Cooperation â that the deliberate promotion of good governance and human rights is a vitally important part of development cooperation.
MrÂ RomevaÂ iÂ Rueda was quite right to mention, in this debate, the issue of violence against women, but I would like to point out that my colleague MrsÂ Plassnik will be devoting particular attention to this issue.
Mr Coveney said that the Council and Parliament should not duplicate each otherâs work.
I fully agree with that.
Of course we must respect each institutionâs individual role. That is what the three institutions must do.
However, at the same time, we must cooperate where necessary in order to be more efficient.
MrÂ Agnoletto and others discussed the human rights clauses and raised the issue of whether the European Union, the Council and the Commission, should actually apply these clauses â which are to be found in a range of treaties â or whether we should do no more than apply ourselves to a sort of
To that, I would like to say that I regard the human rights clauses as very important, in that they do not only provide for sanctions or for the suspension of treaties.
Above all â and this is what strikes me as of the essence â they constitute a reason for engaging in dialogue with states, and this right to engage in dialogue, which we enjoy by virtue of the human rights clauses in the various treaties, is one of which we make use, and we do so irrespective of whether the states in question are large or small.
I can do no other than concur with MrÂ Vaidere, and say that we all hope that the Human Rights Council will be more efficient than the Human Rights Commission, for that was, after all, the reason why the European Union was so committed to it being set up.
I would ask, though, that you should not, at this early juncture, even before the Human Rights Council has met for the first time, throw in the towel in the belief that the people elected to it make further improvement impossible.
This is where a certain realism is called for, without losing a firm hold on the relevant principles.
I do believe that the chances of the Human Rights Council becoming an effective instrument will turn out to be unaffected.
MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and others stressed the European Unionâs role in the World at large, not least in connection with the accession negotiations and the relationship with the Balkan states.
I would like to point out that the Copenhagen criteria continue to be the most important factor in determining whether or not states can begin negotiations towards accession, that respect for human rights is a quite essential criterion even before such negotiations commence, and that it must â self-evidently â also be one while they are in progress.
Mrs Lynne talked about trafficking in human beings.
I fully agree that this issue is very important.
I should just like to mention that the European Union cooperates closely in this respect with the OSCE, which is very active in this field.
We should continue this cooperation and, again, there should be no duplication but rather a synergy effect.
Mrs Lynne and others talked about the question of human rights in the European Union.
Of course there are human rights violations in all European Union countries, including my own.
However, what makes the European Union different from other regions in the world is that we have effective instruments to deal with human rights violations.
All European Union Member States are also members of the Council of Europe and signatories to the Convention on Human Rights.
There is the unique instrument of the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, and within the European Union we also have the necessary mechanisms and instruments to take care of any violations.
We should not confuse the situation within the European Union with that in other states where such instruments do not exist.
I fully agree with Mrs Esteves and others that there should be no double standards and that the credibility of the European Union is the most important thing.
That is why I reject all allegations that we distinguish between small and large countries.
I do not think we treat one country differently from another, which is important.
So, assuming I have understood the report correctly, I thank you all very much for the support the Councilâs policy has received.
Let us continue to defend human rights everywhere in the world and let us do so together.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The EU is the world's standard-bearer where the protection of human rights is concerned.
On countless occasions, this Parliament has come out in favour of improving living conditions and human dignity with regard to various situations that sadly continue to be under the gaze of international public opinion on a daily basis.
Much still remains to be done, however, if we are to turn our intentions into practical actions aimed at creating effective strategies to improve the international human rights situation.
The EU itself must first of all ensure that European policies on external relations, international trade and development make this commitment one of their priorities and incorporate a human rights perspective in every activity that they give rise to.
Consistency is also duly required between the Communityâs actions and those carried out by each individual Member State.
Special attention must be paid to countries with which the EU has closer links: candidate countries â especially Turkey â and partner countries in the Neighbourhood Policy, and I am specifically referring to the Caucasus republics which, despite the significant progress they have made, still have many unresolved issues with regard to ethnic and religious tolerance and to freedom of expression.
Â Â  I would like to congratulate MrÂ Howitt on his report.
Our twin reports in Parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the Union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue.
Our consistent campaign against the death penalty, whether in the United States or China, Iran or Japan, is to be welcomed.
My own Government in Britain was influential in pushing this forward during its Presidency last year.
My only criticism on this Foreign Affairs Committee report would be its unevenness in places and its over-reliance on third-hand reports.
For example, Saudi Arabia barely gets a mention.
The situation is that the majority of the population â its women â face vicious discrimination.
Followers of all faiths, save its own peculiar form of Islam, face persecution and where torture and mutilation are rife.
Equally, it reports persecution of journalists in North Korea.
Yet as someone who follows the country closely, it is a complaint I have never heard.
There is much rightly to raise with the Government of North Korea regarding human rights in the prisons and camps, plus the humanitarian situation in the countryside, rather than these blanket and unsupported catch-all allegations that do no credit to our work.
Â Â  When we talk about the European Community and common European values, the first issue we must mention is the protection of human rights.
The European Constitution will represent a further, considerable step forward, by giving constitutional status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and by creating an independent European human rights protection system.
The increasingly intensive involvement of Europe in foreign affairs means that it can exercise an important influence on human rights when it speaks up as a unified body, and it can be a particularly influential player on international fora.
The report, too, shows that the current situation is mixed and contradictory.
Although the European Union continues to be one of the main protectors of human rights in the world, it excels much more in issuing statements than in following them up, and in many cases it does not integrate or enforce human rights considerations in its other policies and programmes.
However, we must welcome the fact that last year the European Union supported, as a priority, the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, and it addressed intensively, among other things, the situation in China, Chechnya and Zimbabwe, as well as the consolidation of union rights in Iran and Cambodia.
I believe it is important that during the negotiation of both stabilisation and association agreements, human rights are given primary emphasis, in the spirit of Copenhagen.
I, too, advocate that compliance with United Nations and Council of Europe treaties â among the latter, for instance, the treaties on minority rights â are also given priority in contractual relations with candidate states and states participating in the Stabilisation and Association process.
I am convinced that as the only directly elected body of the European Union, Parliament must play a leading role in the development of human rights, and it must ensure that the other European Union institutions also bear in mind human rights, at all times.
Â Â  I welcome this report by my colleague Richard Howitt on Human Rights in the World 2005.
He is right to draw to our attention to the fact that while the EU is vigorous in promoting human rights, its efforts are largely confined to specialist and one-off representations.
There is, sadly, a general failure by the EU to address human rights concerns systematically and continuously with respect to third countries and to mainstream human rights policy with respect to the Unionâs trade, development, and other external policies with such countries.
We need a common, consistent and transparent policy for dealing with abuses of human rights in third countries.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- the second report A6-0109/2006 by MrÂ Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a financing instrument for development and economic cooperation [COM(2004)0629 C6-0128/2004 2004/0220(COD)];
- A6-0164/2006 by MrÂ SzymaÅski, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument [COM(2004)0628 â C6-0129/2004 â 2004/0219(COD)];
- A6-0157/2006 by MrsÂ Beer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Instrument for Stability [COM(2004)0630 â C6-0251/2004 â 2004/0223(COD)];
- A6-0155/2006 by MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) [COM(2004)0627 â C6-0047/2005 â 2004/0222(CNS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I greatly appreciate that Parliament has decided to discuss together the package of instruments for the delivery of external assistance for the future period spanning 2007 to 2013.
It is over a year and a half since the Commission tabled its proposals.
I wish to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by Parliament and successive Council Presidencies to find imaginative and constructive solutions to the challenges that we have encountered on these innovative proposals.
The new simplified architecture was the first attempt to streamline all the instruments for external spending.
The simplification proposed was welcomed by both Parliament and the Council.
And soon after Parliament began its work, a certain number of important questions were raised.
These matters were set out in a letter in April last year from the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Brok, and the rapporteur for the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, MrÂ Mitchell.
There were six issues in total and on these I believe Parliament has obtained full satisfaction.
Your first concern was to ensure that the instruments were adopted under codecision whenever the Treaty made that possible.
In response, the Council and the Commission agreed that the Stability Instrument should pass from consultation of Parliament to codecision.
Three of the four instruments are codecided.
This gives Parliament a fully legitimate but unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending.
Parliament also wished to ensure that the instruments would be subject to a mid-term review and to expiry dates.
These points were accepted.
We have also agreed that before undertaking the review, Parliament should examine the operation of this instrument to identify any dysfunctional situations that may have arisen, and Parliamentâs report would be considered by the Commission in carrying out the review of the instrument.
Should the review identify problems that require an adaptation of the relevant instruments and regulations, the Commission will submit the necessary legislative proposals.
That review should be carried out in 2009, as requested by Parliament.
Parliament also wanted separate financial envelopes for different geographic regions and thematic sectors.
The Commission has provided a breakdown of the envelopes for the codecided instruments and agrees to the inclusion of a breakdown in the regulations.
One of the most challenging points has been the involvement of Parliament in priority-setting and strategy documents.
So far as priority-setting is concerned, the necessary policy elements will be included in the draft regulations.
This has been done both for the Stability Instrument and for the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
Unfortunately, the progress achieved on these instruments has not yet been mirrored in the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument.
Parliamentâs future involvement in strategy documents is now covered by two declarations annexed to the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I have written to Mr Brok on how these could be put into practice.
We envisage a mechanism for a dialogue with Parliament, which should allow us then to present the selected strategy documents, explain our choices and receive Parliamentâs view on the choices and how the strategy should be implemented.
Finally, for the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, Parliament wished to have a clear distinction between policy towards developing countries and towards industrialised countries.
We have no difficulty in accepting that.
There has been a strong demand from Parliament for a separate instrument to support democracy and human rights.
In January 2006, the Commission set out its vision for the thematic programme on democracy and human rights.
I recognise that Parliament is not convinced on this.
I have listened to Parliament and I understand its reasons.
I am committed, therefore, to resolving this point to the satisfaction of Parliament as part of an overall agreement on the instruments.
This is a clear commitment on behalf of the Commission to a separate human rights instrument.
This position is shared by the Council.
I should now like to say a few words on each of the instruments that are before this House today.
The Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance â the IPA â has been welcomed by Parliament for its policy-driven approach.
There has been a fruitful dialogue on the proposed regulation with Parliamentâs rapporteur, MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi.
Indeed, a compromise text for IPA, addressing a number of issues of concern to Parliament, was agreed by COREPER on 3Â May.
The Commission fully supports this compromise, which reflects to a large extent the amendments proposed by Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi in his report.
I am pleased to make a formal declaration today, which I hope will also solve the major outstanding issue of Parliamentâs involvement in the suspension of assistance:
âThe Commission will take due account of any request made by the European Parliament to the Commission to submit a proposal to suspend or restore Community assistance, and will provide a prompt and sufficiently detailed reply theretoâ.
For the Stability Instrument, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Beer, for the central and positive role she has played in the negotiations to date, which have touched on sensitive institutional issues.
The report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs has had a very positive impact on the political compromise reached in COREPER, for which I thank you.
That compromise is very finely balanced.
I believe it will form the basis of a deal between the institutions.
Reflecting concerns of Parliament, we have also agreed more policy content under the Stability Instrument.
There are strengthened references to respect for human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism.
The Commission is ready to make a political declaration further underlining this and confirming its commitment to informing Parliament of exceptional assistance measures as they are adopted.
I shall be writing to you shortly setting out some ideas on the establishment of a Peace-Building Partnership to improve practical implementation of civilian peace-building projects.
For the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, we have worked intensively with MrÂ SzymÃ¡nski, Parliamentâs rapporteur, and the Presidency.
As a result, we now have a text which addresses the concerns of Parliament.
An agreement on this text was reached in COREPER last week and we are very hopeful that, on this basis, an agreement is now within reach.
For the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, work is not as advanced as for the other instruments.
I am convinced that the main building blocks of a compromise are, however, within reach.
Thanks to the cogent arguments of the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, it is agreed that the new legislative set-up must preserve Parliamentâs codecision rights.
It is now a question of the best way to do it.
The Commission is calling for pragmatism, given our shared objective of achieving genuine simplification of external assistance.
In more concrete terms, let me come to the main amendments proposed in Mr Mitchellâs report.
Given their total number, I will concentrate on those that relate to the architecture of the instrument.
First of all, a series of amendments â Amendments 48, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 65, 66 and 67 â propose to establish separate policy-setting regulations and a multiannual financial framework to be adopted by codecision in addition to the DCECI.
This alternative to the incorporation of policy content and financial provisions into the regulation goes against the objective of simplification.
The Commission is more than willing to expand the geographic and thematic policy content of the DCECI to preserve Parliamentâs rights.
We have said so on several occasions.
However, we consider that the best way to achieve this is to follow the Council Presidencyâs proposal and to do it in a single regulation.
Secondly, three amendments â Amendments 4, 23 and 114 â reflect one of the general points made by Parliament which I referred to earlier: the continuation of an instrument in favour of human rights and democracy.
Thirdly, five amendments â Amendments 1, 5, 6, 23 and 115 â build on the initial request to establish a clear distinction between cooperation with industrialised countries and cooperation with developing countries.
They actually go further and propose the splitting of cooperation with industrialised countries from the DCECI.
The Commission understands the underlying concern behind these amendments.
The Commission could consider, for instance â if this is a condition for a final compromise on a clear and logical structure â the splitting of cooperation with industrialised countries into a separate instrument.
Fourthly, three amendments â Amendments 2, 25 and 26 â call for a change in the legal basis, that is, a single legal basis, Article 179, without Article 181a of the Treaty.
I know legal advice differs on this.
For the Commission, the issue is one of legal security.
The Commission also understands Parliamentâs argument that a wide understanding of development cooperation should offer the necessary comfort.
I would be ready to re-consider our position if a wide definition of development cooperation based on Article 179 is ensured.
Fifth, one amendment â Amendment 51 on sectoral spending targets â is of particular concern.
This is the establishment of sectoral spending targets.
This would run contrary to the principles of partnership and ownership with beneficiary countries and it would introduce rigidity in programme implementation.
There are also a number of other amendments that would need to be discussed in more depth.
A document has been submitted to Parliament setting out the Commissionâs position on each of the amendments(1).
I do not want to give the impression that our positions are far apart on all these issues.
Out of 117 amendments, the Commission can accept 26 in full and 40 in part or in principle.
This means that half of the amendments are totally uncontroversial.
Finally, I should like to say a few words on nuclear safety.
This has been an important part of our past work and will remain so.
Originally included within the Stability Instrument, the change in the legal basis made it necessary to create a separate Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation.
I understand that the draft text has now been sent by the Council to Parliament to allow you to begin preparing your opinion.
I should like to finish by saying a few words on the way forward.
There are grounds for optimism that agreement could be found on the text of two of the codecided instruments: the Stability Instrument and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
Similarly, I hope that the declaration I made concerning the Pre-Accession Instrument is sufficient to allow Parliament to give its opinion.
What now of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument?
This is a key element in the architecture.
This instrument covers assistance to Asia, Latin America and South Africa, as well as key thematic programmes.
It is central to the package and too important to be left behind.
I am convinced that we can do what needs to be done to ensure that the complete legislative framework is in place before the end of the year.
The Presidency has already done considerable work on the policy content of the DCECI.
There will be a window of opportunity following Parliamentâs first reading to reach a consensus on the key issues of substance before the adoption of the Councilâs common position.
This could cover some limited changes in the architecture, which would not undermine the principle of simplification and the essential policy provisions.
The consensus reached would be reflected in the Councilâs common position, which the Council Presidency hopes to adopt in June.
This would greatly facilitate a timely agreement on second reading.
Finally, the provision of effective assistance to our partners from 1Â June 2007 onwards is a shared responsibility.
With the agreement on the financial perspective and the advances made on this legislative package, I am convinced we are within striking distance of achieving that goal.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have today, as far as the Financial Perspective and the various instruments are concerned, grounds for a certain optimism, and this morning afforded us the opportunity to sign an important document.
You have, by a very clear majority, adopted an important compromise, and I believe that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnerâs speech just now gives us reason to take a fundamentally optimistic view of things.
I hope, in my capacity as a representative of the Council, to be able to contribute to the generally optimistic mood.
Much of what the Commissioner has said reflects the Councilâs way of thinking.
Here, too, we are singing from the same hymn sheet and hoping that we will succeed in very soon putting the finishing touches to the instruments we are discussing today.
Working together over the past few weeks has not been an easy matter, but it has, at the end of the day, proved to be constructive, and has shown just how much, in the final analysis, the institutionsâ interests coincide with each other.
On behalf of the Council, I would like to express gratitude for this cooperation, which was tough but constructive. It has already enabled us, as early as first reading stage in this House, to achieve agreement on the substance of three of the four instruments â the pre-accession instrument, the neighbourhood instrument, and the stability instrument.
Given the complexity of the subject matter, this could certainly not have been taken for granted, and it amounts in itself to a gigantic leap forward.
I would also like to do as the Commissioner has just done and remind your House that the Council has adopted a number of amendments â and not the least significant ones â to every single one of these instruments and not just to those legal acts that are subject to the codecision procedure but also to the pre-accession instrument, which is subject to the consultation procedure.
Nor do I wish to gloss over the fact that the package now before you was the cause of a great deal of contention in the Council, and that it took some effort â and a great deal of effort on the part of the President of the Council in COREPER â to get some of the delegations to accept it.
I would now like to say something in brief about each of the instruments in turn.
As is well known, each of these instruments has its own history of negotiation behind it, and I would like to begin with the two that are subject to the codecision procedure, those being the Neighbourhood Instrument and the Stability Instrument.
We are glad to be able to say that, where the Neighbourhood Instrument is concerned, we have largely achieved agreement, and I would like to thank MrÂ SzymaÅski for his very constructive cooperation in this respect.
I believe that I can say â speaking as the Councilâs representative â that we have accommodated virtually all your Houseâs demands, in that we have made the instrument more flexible, done away with the restriction on the eligible priorities, have imposed further conditions on cooperation, and have made it clear that international conventions, particularly in relation to human rights issues, have to be adhered to.
I would remind you of the debate that we had on this subject earlier on.
We have also come to a firm agreement on the importance we attach to the role of civil society and our desire to support and promote it.
As for cross-border cooperation, we have not only laid down the partnership principle but have gone further and stressed â as your House demanded â that the regions have to be involved.
As you will be aware, the stability instrument â and this is where it is only right that I should thank MrsÂ Beer â is a particularly sensitive instrument, and it needs to be handled with a great deal of care, for it occupies a grey area between the first and second pillars, and I, speaking as a representative of the Council, will readily concede that this raises serious institutional issues.
We have, though, made a good deal of progress, and the Council has endeavoured to meet your House halfway on a number of issues in this respect.
We have accommodated Parliamentâs desire that it should not merely be consulted but also enjoy the power of codecision.
We have managed, albeit as a result of difficult negotiations, to accede to Parliamentâs request for a broad scope.
The Commission has already made reference to this.
The present constitution specifies what is to be done in the areas of disarmament, improved crisis prevention instruments, crisis management, mediation and measures to take account of the position of women and children in crisis situations.
All these things are requirements on which we have insisted, or which we have supported, in the previous debate on the coherence of European human rights policy.
We eventually succeeded, in the 10Â May trilogue, in finding solutions that took account of Parliamentâs demands for a conditionality clause for measures to combat terrorism by means of statements on the subject from the Commission.
I am sure that I can say, on behalf of the Council, that this made it possible for us to come up with a good result.
I have to thank MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi now that I come to speak to the pre-accession instrument, which is, by its very nature, particularly important.
Nor do I need to explain just how important it is for the Austrian Presidency of the Council and its priorities in this very area, quite simply because it is inseparable from the future development of the European Union.
The Council therefore saw it as important that it should negotiate with your House in the substance of the act and, in the same way as with the other instruments I have mentioned, to take on board Parliamentâs concerns, even though this instrument is not subject to codecision.
We have, for example, laid greater emphasis on the gender aspect and on social cohesion and made programmes for potential candidates more widely accessible.
We have also agreed to Parliamentâs demand that it should be consulted on strategic issues such as the suspension of IPA funds.
Our common objective is that the European Union should be capable of acting in every sphere of foreign policy, and it is regrettable that this â despite some encouraging progress â has not been achieved.
What matters now is that we do something of some practical usefulness in moving the process forward as swiftly as possible and adopting the draft acts and regulations in short order.
That must now be the common goal of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and it is one that we must take seriously.
I would like to take this opportunity to once more explain in detail why this process needs to be completed, and these draft regulations adopted, as soon as possible.
The existing regulations on the neighbourhood and stability instruments are due to lapse at the end of this year.
If we do not ensure that they are replaced, we risk being unable to fund cooperation with the neighbourhood policy countries â which should be a particular matter of concern to all of us â with effect from next year, with it not even being possible to intervene in crisis and disaster situations if these instruments are not wrapped up in good time.
A substantial implementing regulation for the pre-accession instrument still needs to be worked out and adopted if the financial resources â in respect of which negotiations were so long drawn-out and laborious â are to be put to work.
It is for that reason that your House needs to vote on this by June at the latest.
We do not want a financial black hole here.
I therefore want to appeal to you all on behalf of the Council not to jeopardise the timely adoption of the instruments.
That brings me to the next â and perhaps the most difficult â heading, which is the instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation, which, it has to be conceded, is our problem child and on which I would like to touch briefly.
Here, the Council has shown itself willing to take your Houseâs main concerns on board, and I hope that this is a matter of common knowledge.
We are certainly willing, then, to divide up DCECI into two instruments, one for development and another for economic cooperation, and I am sure this will meet one of your Houseâs fundamental concerns; as the Commissioner has already mentioned, the Council also looks with favour on the idea of creating an additional instrument in the field of human rights, something that your House has also called for.
In order to fully respect your Houseâs rights of codecision, the Council has for some considerable time been willing to have in-depth negotiations with your House on all the essential elements of the geographical and thematic programmes and to formulate them together in the same way that was done in respect of the other instruments.
As you can see, the Council is prepared to meet your House more than halfway on the things that matter to you.
The only thing I have to say â and I have to spell this out â is that the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument must not be broken down any further.
To reduce it to still more component parts would quite simply make an absurdity of our aim of simplifying the overall structure of the European Unionâs overseas aid.
To do so would be the very opposite of what we are endeavouring to do under the heading of âbetter regulationâ.
The Commissioner has already said the same thing, and I â speaking on behalf of the Council â would like to back her up in the strongest terms.
The Council therefore finds it regrettable that, despite the willingness to negotiate and to make a variety of concessions, it has still not yet proved possible to find a solution to the problem of this instrument any more than it has to the other three.
We do not doubt that the European Parliament attaches every bit as much importance as does the Council to this deficit being made good as soon as possible.
The poorest countries on this planet of ours would find it beyond their comprehension if they were, so to speak, to be presented with the bill for a controversy between one institution and another.
I would therefore hope that we will succeed in finding a solution that would prevent us from ending up in a legal vacuum after 1 January 2007.
This is a task that we cannot put off to the crack of doom, and I would like, by way of conclusion, to repeat what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has already said, namely that the Council needs this agreement in order to put the final finishing touches to the other three instruments.
As we see it, the concessions we have made in respect of the pre-accession instrument, the neighbourhood instrument and the stability instrument, and our willingness to consider a separate human rights instrument, are absolutely conditional on agreement being reached to the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument.
That much is essential, and it is something on which both the Commission and the Council agree completely.
What is needed, then, is a package solution, and, in order to obtain one, we are relying on your Houseâs goodwill and willingness to compromise.
That is something we owe not only to our partners, but also, in the final analysis, to the European public, which expects us to come up with solutions and has no interest in, or sympathy with, interinstitutional squabbles, and would certainly be disappointed if we were unable, from January 2007 onwards, to give overseas aid to the extent that we have all, together, undertaken to do.
Â Â  . Mr President, before going into the substance I would like to welcome the presence of the Commission and the Council.
I particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original Commission proposal on the DCECI.
When debating this instrument, our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries, and in particular the poorest sections of their populations.
The remit of the Committee on Development is to represent their interests at European Union level and to ensure that they are kept on the EUâs political agenda.
That is why we argue in favour of a specific instrument for the needs of the developing countries, namely poverty alleviation with true economic cooperation and sustainable development, and not just a default instrument for all countries not covered by any other instrument.
I believe that this view is now widely accepted and I hope that the Commission now accepts it also.
This Parliament obviously shares the Commissionâs desire for greater efficiency, simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain, but cannot allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself.
Parliament essentially exercises its competences in the policy domain at three levels: determination of political priorities â which means codecision at policy-setting level, monitoring implementation, and budgetary powers.
Those three levels are complementary and Parliament, being the only institution directly elected by the European citizens, should strive to have a greater say in all three of them.
We should not, however, accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level.
Codecision is not negotiable.
Parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the Treaty.
I am pleased to hear the Commissionerâs assurances on codecision here today.
May I say to the Presidency that the difference with the DCECI is that it seeks to replace 16Â codecided regulations with one regulation.
I am absolutely amazed that the Commission and Council can so easily agree on taking away the role of Parliament.
We should also not permit the human rights instrument, which Parliament has consistently been calling for, to be used to make us relinquish our policy-setting powers.
Human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations.
The ball is now in the Commissionâs court.
My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks, but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the unpredictability of political life.
Priorities may change rapidly, according to our political agendas and those of our partners, but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered.
As rapporteur on the DCECI, I am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year.
Now that the Commission has recognised that the policy content for development cooperation must be established by codecision, it is time for it to submit formal legislative proposals on geographical and thematic priorities, so that Parliament and Council can finally start the process of legislating.
Both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the European Parliament and require a thorough debate.
We are talking about priorities for our cooperation with Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, the Far East and South Africa; our priorities in the fields of human and social development; sustainable management of natural resources such as water and energy; the environment and the role of non-State actors.
These require a full and proper debate in Parliament.
Since we know that the debate on such vast and sensitive issues will be difficult and the time is now running out, I want to inform the Council and the Commission that the Committee on Development is setting up a working group to discuss the policy content.
This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals.
As I said at the beginning, we are talking about cooperation with hundreds of millions of poor people in the world.
They need our continued support.
For that, we need a legal base.
It is up to the Commission to propose it in time.
I welcome the tone and content of the Commissionerâs contribution here today, but there is a lot of work to be done and I hope we will soon get down to doing it.
Â Â  . Mr President, if someone in Parliament wanted to adopt a good cop, bad cop approach towards the Commission and the Council, it would be difficult to find a better way of doing this than to schedule speeches by MrÂ Mitchell and myself one after the other.
When the European Commission presented its package in 2004, one thing was uncontroversial and universally praised, and that was simplification.
Simplification is a great virtue of the whole package presented in 2004, as it makes it easier for parties from outside the EU to use our legal bases for external aid.
However, Parliament clearly believes that this simplification cannot be implemented at the cost of restricting the political aims of our external aid, and neither can it be implemented at the cost of Parliamentâs monitoring powers.
This is why 124 amendments appeared in my report for the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I would like to thank the people responsible in the political groups for their work and dedication. They include MrÂ Tannock, MrsÂ Morgantini, MrsÂ Napoletano, MrÂ Belder and MrÂ VÃ€yrynen.
Without the involvement of the secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and also of the political group to which I belong, it would not have been possible for us to have such a clear negotiating position today.
Furthermore, without the enormous commitment and dedication of the Austrian Presidency headed by Ambassador Woschnagg, without the involvement of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and without the involvement of MrÂ Brok, who leads our negotiating team as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we would not realistically be able today to think about accepting this instrument at first reading, something that is extremely important.
We must remember that at the end of the year our current legal basis, in the form of MEDA and TACIS, the main instruments of neighbourhood and partnership aid, will expire.
We should give our external partners as much time as possible to prepare for this enormous and important change with regard to the legal basis for the provision of external aid.
In the course of 18 months of parliamentary work, we have made significant progress.
First of all, we have broadened the palette of political aims for the funding instruments of the Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy and we have introduced clauses making the provision of aid dependent on respect for human rights and democratic standards.
We have introduced changes which will allow the Neighbourhood Policy to be applied to countries such as Belarus which avoid cooperation with the European Union.
We have safeguarded the role of the EEA and of Switzerland in the performance of tasks associated with the Neighbourhood Policy, and made it possible for these countries to participate in the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy in the European Union.
In spite of what I would call the governmental character of the Neighbourhood Policy, we have increased the role of non-governmental organisations.
Having heard Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and MrÂ Winklerâs speeches, we could say today that, thanks to the interinstitutional agreements, we have a guarantee that a new, separate human rights and democracy instrument will be introduced.
This instrument will be flexible enough to achieve our aims in a legally and politically hostile environment.
As we all know, we face such hostile situations fairly frequently.
Today everything points towards our ability to achieve a compromise on this most important matter, namely the European Parliamentâs monitoring role, in terms of both planning and implementing the Neighbourhood Policy.
Of course, I am aware that any compromise is uneasy, as this one is for Parliament.
However, I will recommend that it be accepted, as everyone who takes part in a compromise has to bear in mind that it will give us the satisfaction of having brought a great process to a close, but that it will also be a slightly uneasy compromise.
I am sure that this compromise does not sit easily with any of us, but I am certain that the most important feeling here is that of satisfaction at having been able to reach an understanding.
I hope that this agreement will be reached before the summer break and, more importantly, before the end of the Austrian Presidency. The Austrian Presidency has put a lot of hard work into this matter, and they deserve credit for their work.
I hardly need to add that our southern and eastern neighbours are eagerly awaiting the completion of our work.
Once again, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the completion of this work.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Winkler, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the stability instrument, I would like, once more, to briefly look back and emphasise just what a good idea on the part of the Commission the so-called Prodi package was, in that, whatever else may be said about it, forty instruments have been whittled down to six in order to speed up foreign policymaking and make it more effective.
We were happy to go down this road hand in hand with the Commission, even though this was not always characterised by complete harmony.
The profound reform of the Communityâs foreign policy that we are debating today cannot be considered in isolation from the upgrading of Parliamentâs role, which is long overdue, for we, considering the extent of the European Unionâs activities as a global player, are no longer prepared to stand looking over the fence while the governments take the decisions; on the contrary, we want to get actively involved in taking them.

It is for that reason that I have included in this report on the stability instrument a proposal for the introduction of a call-back procedure, which is intended to allow us in this House to bring politically irresponsible measures to a halt at the planning stage.
As I see it, there is a correlation between our increased activity in the sphere of foreign policy and the need for Parliament to have a greater say.
I want to emphasise once more that Europeâs 450 million citizens expect this democratic legitimacy, and expect it to be monitored.
