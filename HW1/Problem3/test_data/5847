This is a process that for some is merely the first step, as part of a broader drive, on the part of the USA and its allies, to dominate and manipulate the UN.
Â Â  . In the context of the vote on the joint resolution on the 62nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC, Geneva), I wish to mention what I consider to be a possible solution, albeit not an ideal one, as regards one of the most significant points raised in the debate.
One of the UN's biggest shortcomings on human rights has always been the lack of legitimacy of some of its Human Rights Commission members, especially when they have chaired it.
The list has been well-documented and I do not feel the need to repeat it here.
The outcome, namely the method of electing the members of the future Human Rights Council, does not guarantee that this will not happen again, but at least represents an attempt effectively to legitimise its members, and this should be acknowledged.
I also feel that this is an opportunity to reinforce the idea that EU Member States and their allies should try to set an example on human rights, in their own countries or in their international relations.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this resolution, although we feel that some of its points are unclear and somewhat incoherent.
We feel that biological diversity must be protected and that there should be the broadest possible global agreement on the protection of biodiversity. The Convention on biological diversity gives practical form to this.
Accordingly, the EU and its Member States must take an appropriate stance at the Conference of the Parties taking place in Curitiba, Brazil, at the end of the month.
We know, however, that equally important, if not more so, is the need to stem the loss of biodiversity, by incorporating the aims of the Convention into development policy in Community policies such as agricultural and forest policies aimed at halting the spread of GMOs, supporting family farming and traditional forestry, as this is the best way of protecting biodiversity.
Marine biodiversity must be saved from destructive practices.
Traditional coastal fishing, the best protection for biodiversity, must be supported.
Lastly, previous resolutions on the issue must be taken on board, particularly regarding the fight against the illegal felling of trees and the trade in those trees.
Â Â  I voted against the resolution on the Curitiba conference on biodiversity.
Parliament is making a big mistake in confusing biodiversity and genetic engineering.
All the diversity of living things is the result of changes in the genetic structure of all living organisms.
Those people who, in Europe, continue their reactionary battle against transgenic agriculture do not want to know that it causes no harm to human health in the rest of the world.
In 2004, nine million small farmers cultivated almost 90Â million hectares of GMOs in the world, while in the European Union of 25, 11Â million small farmers cultivated 97Â million hectares, of which some tens of thousands consisted only of transgenic crops.
Europe is in the process of losing another battle.
Â Â  . â We agree with the majority of the findings, which confirm the deterioration of the environment, the destruction of forest ecosystems and the continuing loss of biodiversity.
We also agree with many of the proposals, except for those which are referred to within the framework of the existing legal order, because in many states, as in Member States of the ÎU, these things are happening legally.
For example, the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agricultural production and in the production of foods which threaten the environment and biodiversity was liberalised under Community regulations.
Forests are being commercialised under Community regulations, with the result that they are being destroyed even faster, and so forth.
We disagree radically with the proposal in the motion for a resolution which 'calls on the European Commission and the Member States to show leadership and conviction, by agreeing to and facilitating concrete measures for the protection of biodiversity, both domestically and internationally', because it is like asking the wolves to look after the sheep.
They are calling on those responsible for the destruction to lead according to their own policy.
We call on the grass-roots movement and its organisations (trades union, ecological organisations, agents and so on) to fight to impose measures and policies which will prevent any further deterioration of the environment, destruction of forests or loss of biodiversity.
Â Â  Mr President, the protection of biodiversity is a fascinating subject.
My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, is completely satisfied with the resolution that was approved by a very, very large majority of the European Parliament and it is completely satisfied also that Parliament is sending to the eighth Conference on biodiversity, three years after Kuala Lumpur, a delegation that will defend the protection of biodiversity.
With this in view, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you of some basic principles that are all too often forgotten here in this Parliament.
Food safety depends on three things: water, soil and phytogenetic diversity, and only 12 plant varieties, including wheat, rice, maize and potatoes provide virtually 80% of the energy requirements of the worldâs population.
It is a great temptation, therefore, for industry to acquire the monopoly on seeds by making use of technologies derived from biotechnology.
Consequently, we call on the Council of the European Union, which will be present, to support the moratorium that is currently in place on trials and commercialisation of genetically modified varieties in order to restrict their use.
Put more simply, ladies and gentlemen, the Terminator must not re-emerge in the guise of some biotechnological innovation.
Furthermore, in order to limit the invasive nature, for our ecosystems, of varieties of biotechnological origin, biological diversity must be protected by protocols that force researchers to carry out their experiments in confined areas.
In conclusion, we must remember that the fight against the erosion of biodiversity presupposes some action on conservation.
Of course, it is not a matter of putting away biodiversity in test tubes, but rather of allowing indigenous populations, which, moreover, we support, to continue to make use of their traditional expertise and of their supremacy over genetic resources.
It has to be recognised that here too, money is the sinews of war.
I shall therefore be asking you also to support the Global Environment Facility.
We know very well that, in the case of Natura 2000, if the European Union does not allocate money to this network, biodiversity will not be protected.
In the same way, if we do not give money to the Global Environment Facility, nature conservation will be, once again, nothing more than a tissue of fine words spoken in plenary.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by MrsÂ Thyssen on the Community action programme in the field of health and consumer protection (2007-2013) â consumer aspects.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank MrsÂ Thyssen for her report and for her cooperative spirit.
Although it has been adopted unanimously within the parliamentary committee responsible, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has asked for a debate on this report.
In fact, even if the groups as a whole agree in good faith to afford the highest political priority to consumer protection, I can see that there are still differences of opinion about the right way to go about it.
Also, while the feasibility of this programme is on hold pending the outcome of the negotiations on the financial perspective, I should like to go over a few basic points from the Socialist Group.
First of all, I should like to remind you of our support for separating the two action plans, for public health and for consumer protection.
Next, in relation to the horizontal objectives of the plan, the Socialist Group considers that the means of redress, both for individuals and for groups, available in some Member States, constitute real progress for consumers.
That is the reason for our Amendment 55.
Next, with regard to the specific actions of the programme, I should like to highlight the importance of the following: the development of tools to enable scientific assessment of the effects on consumers of exposure to chemicals released from products; the compilation of an inventory, what one might call a , of the existing legislation, regulations and practices in the Member States in relation to consumer protection and including an assessment of the implementation of Community legislation at national level; and exchanges between national and local consumer associations in order to assist public authorities to make legislation at a European level in matters concerning the protection of users in the field of services of general economic interest, and that is the meaning of our Amendment 58.
Thirdly, regarding the legislative measures to accompany this programme, I wish to address myself in particular to MrÂ Kyprianou concerning the political and legislative measures that he has promised to present to us in the autumn, specifically to accompany this programme.
The terms of the debate are familiar.
How best to intervene at European level?
Is it better to favour European law or to favour self-regulation on the part of the economic operators?
How are we to link emerging European law in relation to consumer protection with national laws that are older and that often afford greater protection for the citizens in some Member States?
In my view, while our fellow citizensâ mobility is increasing, I consider that the role of European public authorities is to ensure the best possible protection for consumers.
I do not object at all to initiatives concerning self-regulation, but they must be the responsibility of the economic agents themselves and their aim must be to improve on the minimum standards fixed by the legislator.
Finally, we should be extremely careful in respect of two dossiers that relate to todayâs debate.
The first concerns discussions about the common framework of reference in relation to European contract law and the second concerns the extension of standardisation procedures in the services sector, including services that are given collective preferences, such as social housing.
These are the comments that I wished to make on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, because we had so much to do this morning, this debate has been rather delayed, and it is unfortunate that the rapporteur and many others who have worked on this issue cannot be in the Chamber.
However, that is the way it is.
I was suddenly given a very great deal of speaking time by my group and declined to use the last five minutes, even though I was offered the chance to sing a song.
That is not something I shall do, however.
The internal market has created millions of jobs, as well as increased prosperity.
It has torn down borders and opened doors.
We can do whatever we want: travel, study, work and set up house.
Consumers have been given access to a host of new products.
We must therefore go further and also create an internal market for consumers.
That means common regulations and a high level of consumer protection throughout the EU.
As border trade increases, so too does trade at an individual level, so people need to know what kind of goods they are buying, what to do if there is something wrong with them, how to complain and what kind of regulations exist.
How are they to know that a particular product really does what it purports to do?
What is available in terms of service, warranties and the resolution of disputes?
If we are to win back peopleâs confidence, there must be guarantees regarding these matters, for they are day-to-day issues concerning the conditions encountered by consumers every day.
These are the matters we need to engage with at EU level.
It is therefore really excellent that the Commission has put forward this proposal for a long-term multiannual programme in the field of consumer protection.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe does not, however, agree with the Commission about the need to combine consumer protection and public health.
We share the rapporteurâs view that they should be kept separate.
Even though there are naturally points of contact, they are two distinct policy areas requiring different approaches, and the two should be kept separate.
We do not want to see any special authority or agency in this connection, either.
Other important elements we are delighted to see included in the proposal include the views that consumer policy needs to be integrated into all policy, that it is important to cooperate with the various consumer organisations in our Member States and that additional support and attention might be given to those states that have not yet managed to make much progress in the field of consumer protection.
I am delighted that we have been able to agree on these matters and that there is a broad consensus among the groups regarding them.
I wish to than MrsÂ Thyssen â hopefully, she will read the Minutes â for the far-sightedness and willingness to cooperate that she has shown.
We are ambitious when it comes to consumer matters, whether what is at issue is cooperation, evaluation or the provision of information.
There must, of course, be a proper budget, therefore.
I hope that, in the future too, there will be constructive cooperation when it comes to the consumer programmes that the Commission is to present this autumn.
Perhaps we really should have proceeded the other way round and first dealt with the major policy guidelines and then this programme, but what is done is done.
We back what has been proposed and shall support the report by a large majority â or, I in actual fact believe, unanimously -âwhen it is voted on during the next part-session.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union wants to fund consumer organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, to the amount of EURÂ 1.2Â billion, to bring them into line with existing and future legislation.
Like so much that comes from this Parliament, it is not possible to object to the subject-matter itself.
Who would object to better and more efficient consumer protection measures where they are required?
In Britain we already have high standards of consumer protection legislation and have had for many years.
No doubt European countries should learn from each other and from non-European countries by adopting international best practice on a national basis, selecting that which is best suited for their particular needs.
But as we would expect, this report speaks of uniformity, integration and harmonisation.
The objective of this report is not the adoption of legislation â that is good in itself â but, like everything else that comes from this Parliament, it serves the purpose and process of extending power and dominion to the European Union.
It will add to the , the body of law that, once accrued to the European Union, is never returned to nation states.
There are also some disturbing overtones contained in suggestions that patterns of consumption, linked to sectors of the population, should be adopted.
Such intelligence-gathering in terms of consumer consumption could compromise the privacy of the citizen.
That is already being done in Britain by private retail companies using such devices as loyalty cards.
However, the consumer has some choice about whether to participate, depending on where and how they choose to shop.
That kind of information-gathering on the citizen is not something that should be undertaken by the state; certainly not in the form as represented by the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Community action programme in the field of healthcare and consumer protection for 2007-2013 defines the way in which the EU intends to improve healthcare and boost consumer confidence by applying the provisions of the Treaty.
The joint strategy in the field of consumer protection in the European Union is a collection of actions such as better understanding of consumers and markets, better consumer protection regulations, improved means of implementing the law, monitoring and settling claims, and better provision of information to and education of consumers.
The problem lies elsewhere, however.
Food safety is becoming worse in Europe.
Genetically modified foods are multiplying on the EU market.
These foods are unwanted and are potentially damaging to human health and to the environment.
Society feels threatened by GMOs. This has been expressed in numerous protests, in a growing anti-GMO public movement and in local authority regulations.
Another threat to health and consumers, aside from the spread of genetically modified food, is the increasing concentration of agricultural production which squeezes out family farms producing healthy food.
Chemicals in farming and the pollution of the soil, the water, the air and of many food products are not beneficial to humans.
The time has come for human health and wellbeing to become the highest value of all, so that humanity may benefit.
Â Â  Mr President, contrary to the opinion that prevails in many economic circles, consumer protection has nothing to do with protectionism.
Quite the opposite: industry cannot flourish without the confidence of consumers, and customers are more capable of mature judgment than the multinationals and the EU generally give them credit for.
The Commissionâs attitude in this field is strangely contradictory.
On the one hand, with the Green Paper on healthy diet and physical activity, for example, it initiates coordinated policy, while on the other it undermines consumer protection with the Services Directive.
Among other things, for example, the latter makes the nuisance of telephone advertising, which has been prohibited until now, suddenly legal, provided it is not done from domestic call centres.
Then again, it worries about the level of its citizensâ debts and wants to deter even slight overdrafts at great bureaucratic expense.
But those overdrafts are the consequence of our consumer society and a life on credit, with the budgetary policies of many EU Member States setting the example.
As the latest scandal surrounding bad meat in Germany once again proves, there are not enough inspectors to deal with the black sheep in the food industry.
In the field of electrical goods and toys, too, the number of dangerous products has almost doubled.
Publishing the names of the firms concerned would be more effective than any fine.
Perhaps then we would have real consumer protection.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, first of all IÂ would like to thank MrsÂ Thyssen for her work on this report, which has not been particularly easy.
I fully support the rapporteurâs justification as to why the action programme in the field of consumer protection cannot be integrated with the programme for public health protection.
By separating these programmes, the two policies, both of which are very important to our citizens, will gain in significance.
Despite the fact that the original European Union, and also the new Member States, are now paying more attention to consumer issues, we should not be complacent about the current situation.
Support for consumer protection chiefly involves the funding of consumer organisations, particularly in the new Member States, and current levels are inadequate, not to say worrying.
For instance, in Slovakia, subsidies amount to less than a tenth of the comparable aid granted in neighbouring states.
Scheduled payments tend to be delayed, and subsidies, already low, are very often cut back, jeopardising the survival and creativity of these organisations.
I am convinced that a joint action programme would only worsen these negative consequences.
Consumers form the bedrock of a market economy.
It is becoming increasinglyÂ more complicated to be aÂ consumer, especially after EU enlargement.
We, the 450 million citizens of Europe, are directly affected by issues ranging from the safety of the goods that we buy and our trust in retailers to on-line shopping and advertising.
Since many of these issues traverse national borders, we need intensive and preventive awareness-raising campaigns that will equip us with the self-confidence to prevent us becoming the pawns of big corporations.
The Commission must surely find these reasons sufficiently compelling for it to approve a separate and adequately funded action programme for consumer protection policy.
The Community action programme for consumer protection in the period 2007â2013 provides an important framework for achieving equilibrium in the internal market, meeting consumer needs and requirements, and creating a balanced and proper relationship between consumers and businesses.
The independent European organisations that are educating the European consumers of tomorrow wantÂ substantial change and financial security.
They expect the European Union to supply a clear vision and a set of rules, and to eliminate bureaucratic and administrative obstacles.
However, particular attention should be paid to aiding the new Member States and accession countries.
The date set for the debate on this report is symbolic, as 15Â March is World Consumer Rights Day.
By approving this report we will send aÂ message that the European Parliament considers it a priority to create in Europe aÂ decent and just society for consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, like many or almost all of the Members who have spoken before me, I, too, would again like to stress that it is not sensible to combine consumer protection and public health in a joint action programme.
We need two different action programmes, because a very large number of very different questions are discussed and dealt with here.
As regards consumer protection, I would like to say that it is very important â that is why I would also like to urge you to pay great attention, in Parliamentâs motion, which I hope will be accepted as it stands, to the fact that we are especially supportive of consumer protection organisations in particular.
We have found that there is still some catching up to be done in the new Member States in particular, and we want to ensure that consumers there get the highest possible common standard of consumer protection, just like we do; there is still room for improvement here, too, it is not as if we were always the best.
This is a matter of great concern to us.
That is why we need to ensure that consumer protection organisations are well able to be effective on the publicâs behalf.
Citizens have repeatedly told us that consumer protection is what they want.
We want a Europe where the citizens, the people, are at the centre, a Europe where their rights to protection are respected.
For that reason, my Group is also particularly concerned that we should get harmonised consumer protection legislation in the field of services of general economic interest.
Where, if not in water, postal services, gas or electricity and other areas, is it important to have a minimum of harmonisation so that a high level of rights relating to access, safety, reliability, price, quality and choice is guaranteed and these forms of protection are as high as absolutely possible.
These are the things that concern our citizens, what they need and what they want.
Â Â  Mr President, international cooperation in the field of consumer protection pursues the goal of protecting against risk and increasing the opportunities available to citizens to make their own choices.
It results in better quality of life for EU citizens by increasing safety and confidence in products on the internal market.
For this reason the Community networks that provide consumers with essential information and support in terms of legal aid, mediation and other forms of dispute resolution should be supported and developed.
The Solvit system is of great importance in this respect, since it is a mechanism for serving consumers that already exists.
It is also important to build confidence in products by taking action to step up the fight against counterfeit goods, which should be regarded as common theft of a brand or a trademark.
Particular attention should be paid to providing consumers with better information about the dangers to health and safety that may arise as a result of using certain counterfeit products such as drugs or cosmetics.
Consumer protection policy must also be implemented through consumer organisations.
Such organisations are active in the majority of Member States, but their budgets and scope for action are often limited, especially in the new Member States.
There is an unquestionable need for additional funding for organisations of this kind.
Consumer protection may cost money, but it is a cost we have to bear.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with all the arguments brought by the rapporteur and the Conference of Chairmen to support the separation of health and consumer protection tasks, and I support the separation.
I would like to present a further argument.
Consumer protection faces very specific challenges both in the new and old Member States, which are totally independent of health issues.
These challenges should be treated with the highest degree of independence.
Consumer protection had initially involved goods, and in particular food and household items.
However, this situation has changed radically over the past decade.
On the one hand, together with market integration, consumer protection, too, must extend beyond goods to include services.
On the other hand, consumer protection must adapt to the market restructuring caused by the rapid development and expansion of information technologies.
Nowadays it is possible, for instance, for a French consumer sitting in a Belgian home to ask for a consumer loan from a Dutch bank by sending an SMS text message, and then, with a few mouse clicks, to purchase a Swedish electronic product from a Lithuanian Internet store, to be delivered by a British service provider.
Such situations are quite usual these days, and they only reflect the normal operation of our internal market.
And yet, within the current legal frameworks, it is not only difficult to guess which consumer protection regulation of which country is applicable at any given time, but even the competence of the various possible authorities is difficult to determine, especially for the consumer.
For this reason, with the integration of the services market and the irreversible expansion of online purchases, the future European Consumer Protection Agency will also have, apart from the traditional task of consumer protection, other crucially important tasks in the areas of research, analysis and planning.
Like industry, our legal system and institutions also need innovation.
The frameworks ensuring protection for the European consumer in the 21st century must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the immeasurable variety of potential real-life situations.
In order to accomplish this work, we need independent resources, excellent and versatile specialists, and I am convinced that it is in the joint interest of the 450 million European consumers that the Consumer Protection Agency becomes an independent pole of excellence.
I ask for the support of the Commissioner to achieve this.
Â Â  I beg your pardon, but allow me to make a suggestion to our fellow Members from the new Member States, who are accustomed to reading out their speeches in Parliament.
Reading out the speech too quickly compromises its translation and makes it impossible to understand the speech itself.
I therefore suggest that you omit a sentence, provided that the speech is read out at a manageable speed for the interpreters, or else that you submit your speech to the interpreters beforehand so that they might keep up with the speed of your delivery. Doing so will help us understand our parliamentary business.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to protest against the accusation that âcolleagues from the new Member Statesâ read too quickly.
If a Member reads too quickly, he reads too quickly, regardless of whether he is from a new Member State or an old Member State.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall briefly make a few comments on the issues raised by the Members.
I would like to thank them for the very interesting debate we had, and now we have the advantage of having them split into two parts, but I still think the issues raised here today were very interesting.
I know I tend to repeat myself, but many of the issues raised will face financial challenges; so issues such as support for consumer organisations or increased support for consumer organisations, or even more active/strengthened initiatives in the new Member States will be affected by the final outcome of the budget discussions.
Nevertheless, especially on the issue of the new Member States, I agree that there is a need for priority, not so much having a separate strategy â and this has already been described in the morning session â but rather giving priority and emphasis and focusing on the newest Member States, at least those where the consumer protection tradition is less apparent than in other Member States.
These will be reflected, as you will see in the near future, in the consumer strategy which is being drawn up in a more detailed way, and you will see how the focus will be concentrated on the new Member States, especially in education, in the training of consumer organisations and in areas where we could strengthen consumer protection mentality.
On the issue of vulnerable groups, I agree that certain consumer groups need increased protection.
Again, I am not sure if inclusion or specific provision in the programme is the best way to achieve this; nevertheless, in specific actions, in specific initiatives and legislation, we should take into account the particular needs of vulnerable groups, children for example.
I refer you to the relatively recent legislation we have adopted jointly on unfair commercial practices, where we take into account vulnerable consumer groups.
There is a misunderstanding about the agency.
I see that MrÂ Stubb is not here this afternoon, but the proposal for an agency is not in the sense of an agency that will be formulating policy or taking initiatives in the area of consumer protection; it will be an executive agency, it will be a management body which will do the accounting and all the practical aspects that do not involve policy.
It will actually operate from the practical accounting management aspect, so it will free the resources we have in the Commission actually to promote and propose policies.
We already have an executive agency for the health programme, and this is something that has been working very well because it makes better use of resources, and we propose something similar now for consumer protection.
So, it is not a separate agency or institution in the sense that it was described today by the speaker of the group concerned.
I said a few things about splitting this morning.
I understand Parliamentâs position.
Before we take our final decision, we will wait to see the outcome of the discussion on the financial perspectives, so at this point we do not agree: we still feel that there are benefits in having a joint programme whilst safeguarding the specific needs and financing provisions of the two areas.
Nevertheless, we will revisit this issue once we have a specific picture in front of us regarding the budget.
Finally, I have taken the point on services on board.
We are already funding programmes for consumers in relation to services as well.
One point on the consumer protection area in general is that we should always bear in mind the benefits of offering consumer protection, not just for the consumers, not just for the protection of the citizen, but also the benefits that increased consumer confidence will have on the internal market, the economic growth that this will promote and, of course, the competitiveness of the European economy.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the committee for their strong support of this programme, and I am looking forward to working with them in the consumer protection area in the following period.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 23Â March 2006.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Moldova and in Transnistria in particular(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, despite an international outcry, Transnistria, which illegally declared independence from the Moldovan Republic 12Â years ago after an armed conflict involving Russian military support, continues to exist, along with the deep-rooted corruption within its undemocratic authoritarian regime.
The situation is of great concern, not just because of the violation of the human rights of the citizens of this region, but also because it continues to be a source of conflict and instability between Moldova and Ukraine.
A border crisis could easily escalate, with unforeseen consequences.
It is of the utmost importance that, through the exhibition of goodwill, common sense and a desire for peace and reform, all parties directly involved in the Transnistrian dispute â namely Moldova, the Transnistrian region of Moldova, Ukraine and Russia â refrain from any action that may cause the deterioration of the already heated situation and proceed immediately to fully engage themselves in honest negotiations in order to speedily reach an amicable solution to the problem.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the political situation in Moldova is an example of how political declarations fail to tally with either the opportunities available to implement them or the goodwill to do so.
In 1999 Russia undertook to withdraw its troops stationed on Moldovan territory in Transnistria by the end of 2002.
As yet, however, Russia has failed to acknowledge the sovereignty and constitutional integrity of that countryâs territory by withdrawing them.
Transnistria is one of the most industrialised areas of Moldova.
The continuing existence of a self-proclaimed political entity stands in the way of any chance of the countryâs economic situation returning to normal, or of the country being able to start the necessary preparations for any kind of talks with the European Union, whether about membership or even just about association.
Russian policy strives to use all possible means to retain its superpower influence in Central and Eastern Europe, which it regards as its natural sphere of influence.
The Transnistrian regime, supported by the former Red Army, is a blatant example of disregard for people, citizens and their rights.
Corrupt troops carry on large-scale illegal arms trading there, along with many other criminal activities.
The Russian Governmentâs promises to withdraw its army have yet again proved to be a political ploy made without any respect for political partners, including the Member States of the European Union.
It is a ploy aimed at allaying public opinion.
My question is as follows.
How do we intend to formulate a European defence policy if we are unable to force our partners to abide by such clear obligations in respect of areas so close to us?
Where can we show the power of persuasion of the 25 EU Member States if not in urgent matters like this one, which is key from the point of view of our own safety?
If we want any of our declarations on defence policy to have any meaning at all, we need to prove ourselves equalÂ to the task in specific cases such as this one, and to demonstrate our will to ensure that every partner, no matter how powerful, observes his undertakings.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst the diverse political forces in Moldova are keen to join the European Union, that country is not a candidate country and is unlikely to become one in the foreseeable future.
Today, we voted on the enlargement strategy as proposed in the Brok report.
If we, on that basis, restrict access to newcomers, the only chance Moldova has of joining is by circuitous means, according to the model of German reunification from 1990.
This would mean that, in due course, Moldova would have to relinquish its independence to return to Romania, from which it broke away in 1940.
A solution of this kind was also mooted straight after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but Romania appeared not attractive enough at the time to implement this plan in the short term.
This may change if Romaniaâs EU membership proves to be a runaway success and if Moldova realises that as a neighbouring country, it is much worse off.
A reunification of this kind has never met with the support of the Slavic-speaking minority, though, who are mainly to be found in the east of the country and would much rather maintain the old ties with Ukraine and Russia.
A solution may not present itself for the factual separation of the eastern fringe, the long and thin region of Transnistria situated along the border with Ukraine, until Ukraine joins the European Union.
In the mean time â which can be some time â we should look to find peaceful solutions, cooperation and democratic changes within Transnistria, which is still being ruled with an iron fist.
My group has highlighted this in its own draft resolution.
We regret that the joint resolution mentions a weakening of the Transnistrian Government, rather than its reform.
For the rest, we can endorse the compromise document because, on the one hand, it does not incite violence against Transnistria and, on the other, this resolution does not seek to isolate Moldova by way of punishment for the strong position which the Communist Party has been accorded in that country by its voters.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can tell from the speeches that many who are working on Eastern Europe are aware of the situation in Belarus, which is getting worse every day.
As Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is present, I will also again point out that the way she behaved towards Parliament in this matter was extremely unfortunate and a considerable violation of the rights of European parliamentarians themselves.
We are aware of the correspondence with Mr Klich, but that is no way to behave!
I have been involved in policy towards the country of Belarus for 12 years and I can only say that in that time the Commission has never behaved as she did.
I just wanted to say that straight away because she is present.
In contrast, while the Republic of Moldova is ruled by a communist party, it is interested in a rapprochement with the EU and is, at least as I see it, an active partner in the neighbourhood policy.
The problem is a completely different one: it lies east of the River Nister.
There are still Russian troops there, outside Russian territory, 15 years after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
That is precisely the problem: the stationing of Russian troops and the violation of the integrity of the Republic of Moldova, that is the conflict we are talking about.
It is not an ethnic conflict.
I therefore believe the problems can only be solved by very tough talking between the EU and Russia, with an ultimatum for the complete withdrawal of the troops.
That is also in Europeâs interest because it is the only way the border can be completely controlled.
The regime that is living on those troops in Transnistria can then become a democratic part of Moldova instead.
The poverty in the country has greatly encouraged the trafficking of women, and that is another reason why it should also become part of the neighbourhood policy towards Moldova.
Â Â  , . â Mr President, the dictatorship of the self-appointed authorities in Transnistria, characterised by severe repression and ideological backwardness, has aroused great concern in Europe.
While Moldova has already taken significant steps on the path towards democracy and respect for civil liberties, Transnistria continues to violate fundamental human rights.
Brutal arrests, inhuman detention conditions and a lack of freedom of speech or assembly are facts of everyday life in this region, and cannot be tolerated in todayâs Europe.
Transnistria is well known for ignoring the rulings of the international community.
Eighteen months have passed since the International Court of Human Rights issued its judgment in the case of Ilascu and other opposition figures, but not one of them has yet been released.
An important step towards resolving the conflict with Moldova is Russiaâs withdrawal of troops from the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in line withÂ the resolutions of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in 1999.
To date, Moscow has violated its undertakings by continuing to give economic and political support to the local dictatorship and its repressive regime.
At the same time as welcoming Moldovaâs efforts as regards institutional reforms and respect for the rights of national minorities, including the Romanian minority, as a real step towards democratic dialogue with the European Union, we are at the same time aware of information about rampant corruption and illegal trafficking in women and children.
The Moldovan authorities must continue their efforts to establish a stable and independent judiciary, as well as political pluralism in their country.
For its part, the European Union must take decisive steps to resolve the issue of Transnistria, and increased dialogue between the EU and Moldova can help to resolve this long-standing conflict and to stabilise the situation in this region of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our colleagues who initiated this very important debate and resolution on the situation in Moldova, and Transnistria in particular.
The Transnistrian conflict, frozen since 1992, was recently described as a front line in EU-Russia relations.
Following long discussions and major preparatory work, last December the EU finally launched a new mission â the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine â thus contributing to both countriesâ joint action to fight against smuggling and black-market trade in the region.
Surprise, surprise! This very balanced move led Russia to put its 1100 troops â so-called peacekeepers â in Transnistria on alert last week.
The illegal regime of Transnistria, which is not recognised by any democracy in the world, broke off the 5+2 talks.
We should express our concern about the human rights situation in Transnistria, where people do not have the right to hold democratic elections, where harassment, repression and intimidation of the independent media, human rights defenders, NGOs and opponents to the self-proclaimed regime is common practice.
In addition, we should express our support for the Moldovan and Ukrainian authorities working to stabilise the situation in the region and free it from corruption, smuggling, etc.
I call on the Commission and the Council to support the Moldovan authorities in their democratic reform process and use all diplomatic means available to solve the Transnistria conflict.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the so-called Moldovan Republic of Transnistria, which covers one fifth of the territory of the independent state of Moldova and the majority of its industry, is being recognised as a state despite international opposition.
I urge you to pay attention to the violations of human rights, media restrictions and the populist-authoritarian system in Transnistria, which flies the flag of the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.
Non-governmental organisations are having particular problems functioning in Transnistria.
The new political initiative of President Igor Smirnov and the international youth corporation Proryv is modelled on Nashi, the pro-Putin youth movement in Russia.
Proryv is an extreme populist organisation whose aim is not to allow democratic changes in Transnistria.
Its ideology is based on a Soviet/Slavophile ideology of pro-Russian nationalism.
Proryv is associated with the Transnistrian section of Vladimir Zhirinovskyâs Russian party, and collaborates closely with the Eurasian Russian movement.
The European Union must take a closer interest in the situation in Transnistria from the viewpoint of human rights and democratic development in this part of Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, today we have talked a great deal about Belarus, and I should like to speak out in defence of the country.
It is untrue that Belarus is the least democratic country in Europe.
The leader of this black list is the so-called Moldovan Republic of Transnistria.
Nobody in the world recognises this country other than Russia, a country which does not recognise human and civil rights.
Evidence of this includes the political prisoners being held and the attacks on non-governmental organisations, which the press has described as parasites.
This situation does not prevail in the Republic of Moldova either, but we welcome that countryâs efforts to move towards full democracy and, in time, the European Union.
The conflict between Transnistria and Moldova is proceeding in the shadow of Russian interests.
Russia appears to be stoking the flames of the conflict, and this aspect cannot be ignored.
The Moldovan President, the Communist Mr Voronin, talks of the demilitarisation, democratisation and decriminalisation of Transnistria.
For its part, the official newspaper of the regime of Transnistriaâs President Smirnov is advocating the of Moldova and calling for help to democratise the country, or in other words to rid the Republic of Moldova of the Communists and their leader.
This may be laughable, but it stops being funny when human rights are violated and people are locked up in prison.
That is when the joke turns sour.
Â Â  Mr President, the only reason why the territory of present-day Moldova will not be joining the European Union next year or the year after is that the country was forcibly detached from Romania under the Hitler-Stalin pact.
We should not forget that piece of history.
It is a deeply European country and we must make intense efforts to bring about three things.
Firstly, the dismantling of the criminal and militaristic structure in Transnistria by peaceful means.
Thank God, Hitler was defeated and had to surrender his spoils.
Stalinâs spoils were not released until 1991, and there are still forces in Moscow today that are keeping this dangerous structure alive.
The second major task is the democratisation of Moldova with the rule of law and minority rights, and the third major task we have is the fight against cross-border crime.
I am very grateful here to our fellow Member Albert DeÃ as the representative of a border region of Upper Palatinate, who is vehement in urging us to fight, jointly as a European Union, against trafficking in drugs, human beings and arms, which originates with this criminal structure in Transnistria; that is in the interests of this beautiful country on the eastern edge of Central Europe, which needs to be integrated because otherwise it will fester like a wound between Romania, which is soon to be a Member State, and Ukraine, with which we have entered into a more intensive partnership since the orange revolution there.
The process of democratisation in this region that is so important for our own destiny will only succeed if this militaristic, tyrannical structure finally makes way for a democracy based on the rule of law.
This is our duty as the European Parliament, and I am therefore grateful to Mr Sonik and others for getting this debate held.
The European Parliament must send out clear signals here.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me first answer a few of the political questions, then also say a word about Belarus.
I will also be very happy to respond to MrsÂ Schroedter before talking about the real substance of todayâs debate: human rights.
First, on the political issue, Moldova is a country in the European Neighbourhood Policy and we are trying, through that policy, to bring Moldova closer to the European Union and â I point this out to Mr Posselt â slowly democratise it, although a lot still has to be done.
However, this is the way forward.
For that purpose, it is also very important to cut the illegal trafficking of goods, people, arms, perhaps also drugs, and to cut criminal activities.
I thank all those who have mentioned a border mission.
The European Union has introduced a border mission very recently in Transnistria, between Moldova and Ukraine.
We have to thank Ukrainian President Yushchenko who, when he came to power, really started this initiative and has taken it up together with President Voronin.
With my colleagues the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Moldova, we have succeeded in putting this in place.
I think it works quite well, by the way, under a Hungarian leader in this region.
Its real objective, in my view, is to cut illegal trafficking.
That is not always easy, but in the long run it will reach its goal.
You all spoke about the Transnistrian conflict and how we can resolve it.
Indeed, the OSCE has been trying to do everything to help and the European Union is more and more involved too.
By the way, we have achieved some progress because the Russians did in fact accept the âfive plus twoâ talks to which we, the European Union, together with the United States of America, have been invited as observers in order to find a settlement.
It is true that Russian troops have not yet been withdrawn, as had been foreseen at the OSCE in Istanbul, and this still has to take place.
Of course, the question is, what will replace them?
First, all things political have to continue, although, unfortunately as someone said, Transnistria did in fact walk out of the talks before.
Therefore, a lot still remains to be done.
Now I come to Belarus and, with your permission, I will continue in German.
Mrs Schroedter, I believe to begin with I was completely misinterpreted here.
The journalist who was sitting in our room at the press conference in Brussels asked me as Commissioner whether we as the European Commission were sending an EU election observation mission to Belarus.
I said: âNo, the observation is being done by the OSCE/ODIHRâ.
You know that is the case.
I then added that the parliamentarians were not part of an official EU mission, because we do not have one.
That was completely misinterpreted.
Please accept that again as my explanation.
I am glad you raised the matter because it has allowed me to clear it up.
I not only wrote a letter to Mr Klich yesterday, I also spoke to him; he understood completely.
I have also already issued a statement today on Belarus, where I am of course following events in the run-up to the elections, in which I also said how much I regret that the parliamentarians were denied admission by refusing them visas; they are of course always welcome here, that goes without saying and you ought to know that, since I am so much in favour of EU observer missions and am doing something for them to actually strengthen them.
I am coming to my third point, which concerns todayâs debate on the resolutions on breaches of human rights in Moldova.
The motion for a resolution draws attention to the failures of the judicial system to secure fair trials.
I should note that in 2005 Moldova adopted three laws which significantly strengthened the independence of the judiciary.
So far as the Pasat case â the case of the former Defence Minister â is concerned, the Commission has raised the problems surrounding this case several times.
I am in direct contact with MrÂ Stratan, the Moldovan Foreign Minister.
I have just written a letter to President Voronin on this issue, in order to have transparency and not to delay Mr Pasatâs appeal.
Democracy, the rule of law and human rights will feature very prominently at the forthcoming Cooperation Council meeting with Moldova.
Todayâs debate puts special emphasis on human rights in Transnistria. However, as you all know, because of its status as a self-proclaimed independent republic, we have only limited insight concerning developments in Transnistria.
However, it is clear that there are very significant problems.
In summer 2004, for instance, the Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed six schools that taught the Moldovan language using the Latin script.
We are pleased to see that negotiations between Moldovan and Transnistrian officials on the issue of these Latin-script schools restarted in February after a hiatus of seven months.
The Commission will follow the development of these negotiations very carefully.
Let me say a few words about the Ilascu case, which remains a very serious example of the violation of human rights.
Since Moldova is unable to intervene in Transnistria, we raise the issue with Russia whenever the opportunity arises.
The last occasion was about two weeks ago in Vienna at the Troika of Foreign Ministers, when I met Foreign Minister Lavrov.
The recent reports that Andrei Ivantoc, one of the two prisoners, has begun a hunger strike underline the need for the immediate release of both prisoners.
We have to apply pressure to make that happen.
The Commission is working with all the partner countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, in order to achieve a withdrawal of the Russian troops, the demilitarisation of Transnistria, the democratisation of Moldova â including Transnistria â and the establishment of effective and legal control of Transnistria by Moldova proper.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Kazakhstan(1).
Â Â  . On 13Â February, the well-known Kazakh politician and opposition leader A. Sarsenbayev was brutally murdered in Almaty, along with his driver and bodyguard.
Not long ago, another opposition leader Z. Nurkadilov was found with three gunshot wounds after he accused the government of corruption and of being responsible for the killing of the freelance journalist Sharipzhanov.
The official version of the investigation suicide.
As one of the most advanced states in the region, Kazakhstan is trying to include itself among the democratic states of the world.
Moreover, it aims to chair the OSCE from 2009.
An organisation which has to ensure democracy and stability within the Community and beyond its borders.
An organisation which in December acknowledged that the presidential elections in Kazakhstan did not comply with international requirements.
We recognise that Kazakhstan's economy is growing rapidly.
Kazakhstan is a very important trade partner for the Community, but colleagues, we are not just an economic union, but also a union of values.
In foreign policy, we cannot pursue narrow economic interests and under no circumstances can we allow the violation of human rights.
President N. Nazarbayev openly admits that in the past there was no democracy in his country and says that we cannot expect it to appear overnight.
This is an attempt to assure us that there can be a controlled democracy in Kazakhstan, but essentially, it is a desire to justify an authoritarian regime from the Soviet period.
Mr President, we all know that democracy either exists or does not exist.
It cannot be controlled or partial.
Â Â  . Mr President, we would not have held this debate this afternoon.
It is not that we do not care about Kazakhstan or that we think that nothing is wrong there; of course, we worry, but in the last term of office, this House accepted a strict resolution on Kazakhstan, one which both this Parliament and the Government of Kazakhstan took seriously at the time.
It has led to the admission of more political parties and has, in any event, resulted in a step forward in the freedom of the press.
We worry again today, but what is striking now compared to the previous resolution on the situation in Kazakhstan, is the fact that the government, the President, is at least trying to introduce transparency, in the sense that in relation to killings, or matters that can be called into question, there is in any event every opportunity for foreign observers to watch what is happening.
One thing is for sure.
Something is brewing in Kazakhstan, that is true, but that does mean that you cannot assess the situation in the right manner, and we think that in that light, this resolution is premature at the moment.
Another reason is that whilst we do not think that everything is wonderful, we do see for the first time that in sensitive areas, where people may have been killed and people have definitely been killed, although the circumstances or perpetrators are unknown, there is a willingness to show what is happening, how the process is drawing to a close.
It is these points we should like to highlight in order to strengthen the relationship that we in the European Union have with Kazakhstan.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats propose, then, that we should make use of the cooperation between the parliamentary delegations.
The parliamentary delegation from Kazakhstan will be visiting Brussels in May, during which we will have an opportunity to discuss all these issues as fellow-parliamentarians.
We in the PPE-DE Group would like to see some progress in relation to the countries in Central Asia.
As for Kazakhstan, we must clearly debate the topic of partnership to find out whether we can team up in those areas in which we cooperate well.
In a nutshell, we are concerned about Kazakhstan.
While we are not always impressed by democracy in that country, we can see at this very moment that there is more transparency, that something is brewing, that there is much uncertainty.
I should in any event like to congratulate the Commissioner on the sound information we have received from her representative in Almaty on this score, which we greatly appreciated.
As far as the vote is concerned, although we have contributed to this resolution, for not doing so is excluding ourselves from the game in hand, we did apply for five split votes, the outcome of which will determine whether we will back this resolution or not.
In short, although we have concerns, we would like to talk these over with our Kazakh colleagues on amicable terms to see whether we can take a few steps forward in relation to democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, just a brief word.
This lunchtime, Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ said that people are putting candles in their windows in Slovakia and many other countries today as a sign of solidarity with the opposition and the freedom movement in Belarus.
To avoid setting off the fire alarms, we have only brought a small symbolic candle into plenary, which is burning at Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡âs place, but it is intended to make clear the strength of our ties with the freedom movement in Belarus.
Â Â  In reaffirming our support for the initiative, I must point out that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, it is strictly forbidden to bring any incandescent or burning object into the Chamber, and so I kindly ask our fellow Member to extinguish it.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, the political opposition in Kazakhstan is protesting against the murder of Altynbek Sarsenbayev, the former minister and ambassador who joined the opposition in 2003 and started criticising the political system under President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
On 26 February this year in Almaty around 1Â 500 people took part in a demonstration, and 43-year-old Sarsenbayevâs body was found with gunshot wounds to the shoulders and the head beside the bodies of his bodyguard and driver.
The National Security Committee officers suspected of the killing have been arrested, and the head of the National Security Committee, Nartay Dutbayev, has resigned.
I would also like to point out that the organisation Reporters without Borders has accused the Kazakh authorities of Internet censorship and restricting freedom of expression in traditional media.
On 15 December last year, the security forces searched the offices of the weekly after it published a letter signed by the head of the Election Commission stating that electoral fraud had taken place to some extent in the 4 December presidential elections.
Furthermore, on 20 December the weekly was closed by a decision of the court in Almaty after being accused of libel against President Nazarbayev.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the collapse of the Soviet Union has not proved to be a guarantee for democracy â quite the opposite, in fact.
Some politicians with Communist pasts may have abandoned their ideology, but are for that very reason now even less hindered than before in their manoeuvring to remain in power for the long haul or to transfer state power to their offspring.
One of those sleights of hand is to extend the term in office of presidents in power by ten years or even to the end of his life by means of a referendum without the option of putting forward one or two rival candidates.
Another technique is to eliminate serious opponents by locking them up on the basis of false accusations, getting them killed in car accidents or having them simply disappear.
In Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, widely-supported popular uprisings against regimes of that kind have been successful, but it remains to be seen whether those countries will be better off in the long term.
So far in Belarus, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and the much larger Kazakhstan, those in power have managed to break any opposition.
Some have been able to use their role in the supply of energy to buy themselves powerful foreign friends.
For a long time, Kazakhstan was mainly a dry and sparsely populated area where, in the middle of a small population speaking a Turkic language, Russian colonisation took place in areas where industry or mining appeared possible or where an experimental space rocket base could be set up.
Meanwhile, a new capital has been created, far from the large city of Almaty, and the influence of the Russian inhabitants is being reduced considerably.
Kazakhstan is a large, sparsely populated country, with two large population groups and the remainder consisting of minorities banished to that country from the Russian empire, and its future is extremely precarious.
In our relations with it, the resolution is right to insist on due account being given not only to economic relations, but also, and above all, to political prisoners, scope for opposition, democratic decision-making and human rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, not everything is pitch-black in Kazakhstan.
Compared with a number of other countries in the region, positive things too are happening, for example the moratorium on the death penalty and the prosecution of policemen accused of torture.
The latest development is, however, that, paradoxically, when the opposition is growing and becoming stronger, so too is the oppression directed against it.
These two murders have exacerbated the situation.
The OSCE said that the election did not proceed correctly.
In reality, it was quite unnecessary to rig the election, because, according to all the opinion polls, MrÂ Nazarbayev would still have won it.
Given the media situation in Kazakhstan, these developments are not perhaps so odd.
A climate of fear also prevails.
Governors did not dare report the worst voting figures and did not hesitate to season them with a few extra votes out of a fear of seeing their positions, financial or otherwise, undermined.
We cannot have such a climate in a democracy, and we must be on our guard.
In reality, the European Parliament is not demanding a lot: only that Kazakhstan obey its own constitution and that court decisions be required in connection, for example, with arrests.
In paragraph three, we state that we want international observers to monitor the murder investigation.
The FBI has been invited to take part in the investigations of the murders, and we should ensure that other international bodies too be allowed to study information concerning these crimes so that we have some grasp, and clarification of, the investigation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Kazakhstan is an important country with a great history, and one of the largest countries in Europe â yes, Europe, because about 150 000 km2 of its territory is within the geographical borders of our continent.
It is a country where, to this day, thousands of my Polish compatriots live, having been exiled there at the time of the Stalin regime.
Historically and politically, however, it is obvious that Kazakhstan belongs to Central Asia.
It is also a post-communist and post-Soviet country.
We have to take this history into account and remember that the word âdemocracyâ is not always understood there in the same way as it is here in the countries of Europe, with their centuries of democratic tradition.
I was one of the European Parliamentâs observers in Kazakhstan during the presidential elections.
The country is by no means a model of democracy, but in fairness it must be said that the authorities there are doing a great deal to democratise public life and, above all, to bring the country closer to Western values and to modernise it.
This is something we should appreciate, and we should offer prudent support for this process.
The motion for a resolution under debate deserves support insofar as it demands an investigation into the death of MrÂ Sarsenbayev, the opposition politician, but it also has some elements that are an expression of unjustified suspicion.
Politicians are killed in many countries in assassination attempts or accidents, without the cause always being political intrigue.
For this reason I appeal for moderation in the contents of the resolution, and for several of the proposed amendments to be adopted.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, like all my MEP colleagues, am horrified by the brutal murder of opposition leader Altynbek Sarsenbayev on 13Â February.
I welcome the fact that President Nazarbayev has called in the FBI to track down the culprits, and his statement of 21Â February on punishing the perpetrators.
I am also encouraged by the recent arrest of five suspects.
Of course there are still concerns regarding democracy and human rights in Kazakhstan.
We in the EU are rightly concerned about any instability in this key strategic central Asian Republic, which is anxious not to get too close to Russia or China, but to get closer to us in the EU.
As the rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, I have suggested including Kazakhstan in that policy.
This follows a tradition in which it was the European Parliament that first raised the question of such a status for the three Caucasus republics, which was duly granted by the Council in due course.
Kazakhstan has a westward extension, which makes a strong case geographically for its European Neighbourhood status.
It also has a strong secular tradition inherited from its Soviet past, with a very large European Christian minority living in harmony with the indigenous Kazakh Muslim people.
Of strategic importance to the EU are its vast oil and gas reserves, which it is anxious to sell to the EU without depending entirely on Russian pipelines to transport its natural resources.
Moreover, the Kazakh Diversification Policy includes plans to liquefy its natural gas for export via the trans-Caspian route.
In this context, and less appreciated, is the vast potential supply of Kazakh yellow cake uranium from mines coming onstream, which will be vital to supplying the EUâs future nuclear energy needs.
The EU must extend every help to this vast, under-populated, geopolitically key country and we in the PPE-DE Group will not support the biased joint text unless our amendments are carried.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to speak in my own language.
It worries me to hear a speech like the one that has just been made.
I worry that, because the West and the United States have an interest in Kazakhstan â mainly because it is rich in minerals and an ally in the war against terrorism - its government might feel able to do certain things with impunity.
This is something we should be on our guard against.
Some time ago, Kazakhstan applied to become a member of the Council of Europe, and I went on a mission there.
It is true that, geographically, part of Kazakhstan is in Europe, but everybody knows that this country still has a lot to learn in terms of acquiring democratic credentials.
It is clear, moreover, that, in recent times, the political climate has deteriorated.
We know that, over a period of three months, two opposition politicians have been killed and that human rights are in one way or another being denied.
We should not therefore allow Kazakhstanâs wealth and the fact that the country is an ally against terrorism to delude us into thinking that there need be no controls whatsoever on its conduct.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, up until now Kazakh President Nasarbayev has acted according to the old proverb âkeep your friends close and your enemies even closerâ and tried to include them in his regime.
Although he spent a week at a spa in my home province of Carinthia only recently, evidently to recover his strength, he seems to be enjoying less and less success with this, because criticism of him is growing, as you know.
It may be no coincidence that, as we have heard, two opposition politicians died in mysterious circumstances after revealing dishonest machinations by the presidential clan.
In my opinion, it really is essential that these murders be investigated transparently by independent parties.
Progressive as Kazakhstan may be in its economic development â not least because of its many mineral resources â we are all agreed that it is equally halting when it comes to democracy.
There were complaints of vote rigging in last Decemberâs presidential elections, and the daughter of the president elected under such dubious circumstances is known to be the director of the largest television station, her husband head of the tax authority.
Some parties are being refused registration and activists are known to be persecuted.
So it is not surprising if the murdered manâs mourners are punished.
When it is so doubtful that Kazakhstan is capable of behaving like a democracy, it cannot be allowed to take the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009 as it wishes.
The EU must in my opinion stand strongly against that.
It is perhaps also worth considering following the US lead and making financial and economic assistance more dependent on progress being made in the areas of democracy and civil and human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, it is now a month since the prominent politician Sarsenbayev was brutally murdered, and I believe now is the right time to hold an urgent debate here on the situation in Kazakhstan.
Two prominent opposition politicians have been murdered in the space of three months and the political climate has greatly deteriorated.
We call on the Kazakh authorities to allow a full, independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances of the deaths and to allow the presence of international observers.
Politically motivated murders are only the tip of the iceberg.
Internet censorship has been mentioned and pressure on opposition politicians and journalists has increased over all.
We condemn the detention of the people taking part in a peaceful gathering to mark the death of Altynbek Sarsenbayev and call on the Kazakh Government to comply with its obligations under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and in particular to ensure respect for democracy and human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is much to say about Kazakhstan.
On the one hand, Kazakhstan is and should be a key partner for promoting stability and regional cooperation in Central Asia.
Indeed, it is the most important of these countries and it is also rich in energy supplies and therefore it is being courted by many countries today.
Let us analyse President Nazarbayevâs State of the Nation address on 1Â March.
It was very comprehensive on economic development. However, it was not very detailed on the programme of democratic reforms, despite promises of a programme of democratic changes and promises to the international community.
The concept of âmanaged democracyâ was reconfirmed; in fact, it was reinforced.
Let me say a few words about the positive side and the negative side, because we have to see both sides.
On a positive note, I would like to welcome Kazakhstanâs ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in January this year.
This is a good step.
We also hope that Kazakhstan will now take steps to ratify the optional protocols allowing individual complaints.
The continuing moratorium on the death penalty is also a step in the right direction.
On the negative side, and as regards issues we should criticise, what has happened to the leading political opposition leader Mr Sarsenbayev is of the utmost concern to us.
His murder points towards a very dangerous trend of criminalisation in Kazakh politics.
In the absence of clear constitutional mechanisms guaranteeing a peaceful transfer of executive power in Kazakhstan, this development is clearly worrying.
We have therefore urged the authorities to ensure complete transparency in the investigation process.
I am pleased that the FBI can go there, but some Europeans should be there as well.
We are also following very closely the investigation into the murder of Oksana Nikitina, the daughter of another prominent member of the opposition.
I have also been very troubled by reports on harassment of opposition figures following two peaceful memorial marches in Almaty, held after Mr Sarsenbayevâs funeral.
Some of you have alluded to that.
I would also like to mention the two essential issues of media freedom and restrictions on civil society.
We are concerned at reports of numerous instances of harassment of journalists and actions taken against five newspapers and one opposition website.
The new law on national security, adopted in July 2005, also permits undue restrictions on civil society and NGO activities.
We have welcomed, on the one hand, improvements noted by the OSCE/ODIHR in the administration of the December 2005 presidential election â a few of you were there to observe them.
However, we also regret that the election did not meet a number of OSCE commitments and that no action was taken to amend the legislative framework in line with OSCE/ODIHR recommendations.
We will certainly want to continue to monitor the investigations about alleged malpractices.
One lingering core concern is political freedom.
For the sake of its internal stability, Kazakhstan needs a political opposition and it is urgent for the authorities to legalise political opposition parties and open a real dialogue with them, for example through the state commission on democratisation, which is to be established soon and chaired by President Nazarbayev.
In particular I think that the Kazakh authorities will reconsider their refusal to register the opposition political parties Alga and True Ak Zhol.
I would very much welcome it if you form a parliamentary delegation and if you reinforce your cooperation with delegations from Kazakhstan.
It is another very important channel to give them clear messages and it is also an opportunity.
Let us not prejudge a decision on Kazakhstanâs bid for the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009.
Perhaps it might provide Kazakhstan with an important challenge in achieving higher standards of democracy.
Finally, we are also concerned about reports of numerous instances of harassment of journalists and actions taken against five newspapers and one opposition website.
The new law on national security that was adopted in July last year also permits undue restrictions on civil society and NGO activities.
I think therefore that this is a country with which we have to engage very strongly but at the same time we have to deliver firm messages.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on impunity in Africa and in particular the case of HissÃšne HabrÃ©(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, many opportunities are currently opening up in Africa to come to terms with what is often a blood-stained past.
Nevertheless, moving towards peace requires that impunity be combated unequivocally and this means, in turn, that the truth must come to light, however painful that may be, and justice must be done.
The trials of Pinochet or Milosevic, though imperfect and sadly incomplete, are clear indications of the direction things should take in Africa as well.
Names such as Charles Taylor, Mengistu Haile Mariam and HissÃšne HabrÃ©, amongst others, must be added to the list of ex-dictators who must answer to national and international justice.
There are already various mechanisms for calling people to account by means of ad hoc tribunals for the perpetrators of crimes and atrocities, such as those that exist in relation to Rwanda or Sierra Leone, for example.
Unfortunately, however, a lack of resources, and in some cases of political will and of capacity, mean that these tribunals are often inefficient and insufficient.
Combating impunity is undoubtedly one of the pillars of the Union's policy in the field of human rights.
We must therefore remember that, without an International Criminal Court to establish individual responsibility as a mechanism for applying the law, acts of genocide and flagrant violations of human rights will often go unpunished.
We would therefore urge the States of the African Union that have yet to ratify the Rome Statute, to do so and to set up an action plan for its effective application as soon as possible.
It would be presumptuous â and that is not my intention â for Europe to lecture Africa, when we too have many open or unresolved cases of impunity or insufficient justice in relation to ex-dictators.
But I do firmly believe that this is a task that must be tackled in a universal manner, jointly by Europe and Africa.
Without truth, without justice and without reparations for the victims, peace can be no more than a dream, but combating impunity may help us to one day make that dream a reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the case of the former dictator of Chad, HissÃšne HabrÃ©, should not be viewed in isolation but must be considered in the African context, because impunity of former despots is still widespread in Africa.
I need only remind you of Charles Taylor from Liberia or Mengistu Haile Mariam from Ethiopia.
African Dictators have ruled with extreme violence, suppressed their own people and maintained their positions of power through torture, murder and tyranny.
What all of them also have in common is that they have found refuge in other African countries unpunished and have nowhere been called to account.
That is the very thing we can no longer accept, however, because the victims and their families have been fighting for a long time for a trial at which the despots will have to face up to their responsibility.
I therefore very much welcome the great amount of progress that has been made in the case of HissÃšne HabrÃ©.
In September 2005, a Belgian judge issued an international arrest warrant, as a result of which HissÃšne HabrÃ© was placed under house arrest in Senegal in November.
Senegal has stressed, however, that HissÃšne HabrÃ© should be brought before an African court and that the African Union should decide about it.
At its last meeting in January, the African Union set up a committee, which will report in July on what such a court should look like.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe there are several possible ways of bringing HissÃšne HabrÃ© to court.
The most realistic is his extradition to Belgium, since he could quickly be examined by a fair court in Europe.
The International Criminal Court might also take on the case.
An ad hoc African court, on the other hand, will require a tremendous amount of political will and is probably scarcely possible without an enormous amount of money, time and administrative effort.
It is now up to the African Union to make every effort to ensure that the case of HissÃšne HabrÃ© is finally brought to a conclusion before a court.
If, on the other hand, extradition to Belgium is ruled out, then the African Union will have to put forward a precise plan as to how an African court can deal with the matter as quickly as possible.
I would be pleased if a precedent were set here and HissÃšne HabrÃ© were brought to court.
The many victims demand it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we in Europe are dismayed that survivors of the genocide orchestrated by Slobodan Milosevic could not see him convicted in the Hague.
In Africa, the victims of governments that violate human rights and of war criminals have the right to justice and are seeking justice.
Their names are: HissÃšne HabrÃ©, Charles Taylor, Mengistu Haile Mariam and Robert Mugabe.
A few days ago in the Committee on Human Rights, we heard a lawyer from Chad underline this in relation to the dictator HissÃšne HabrÃ©, who has lived in exile in Senegal for a number of years.
The lawyer advocated his extradition to Belgium, where a court is seeking him at the request of the victims.
She also explained that extradition is needed because in the context of the African Union, there are unfortunately no mechanisms yet in place, nor is there the political will, to try this criminal, who was responsible for the political assassinations of over 40Â 000 of his compatriots and the detention and torture of many more.
She went on to say that the Senegalese authorities referring the matter to the African Union was intended not to facilitate justice and to preserve African dignity, but to block justice and to cause further offence to the victims seeking to bring HissÃšne HabrÃ© to justice.
Mr President, Commissioner, I was recently in Senegal, where I spoke to human rights activists, members of the Senegalese Parliament and journalists.
All confirmed the same impression, unfortunately: The EU has responsibilities in Africa and this is why we have adopted this resolution today.
Hopefully, as a result, Portuguese politicians will use their influence and seek an end to impunity for all of these criminals in Africa.
Â Â  . â Mr President, African states do not owe their origins to the African people themselves, but to European colonisation.
Their boundaries were drawn by foreigners and sliced through population groups who wanted to stay together, while people were lumped together who had very little in common in terms of history, culture, language and religion.
It is impossible for those people to see the authorities as something that is their own.
In practice, this translates into a serious barrier to democracy.
In those situations, there is a great deal of scope for people who, by violent means, favour one population group while suppressing another.
Only by horrific means can they keep their unstable states together.
Under those circumstances, it is only violent profiteers who manage to hold onto state power for any length of time.
Situations of this kind can be found in all parts of Africa, but particularly where Arabic-Islamic and non-Islamic population groups have been combined in one country.
Everyone is now familiar with the tragedies, permanent civil wars and streams of refugees that have cursed Sudan.
We adopted a resolution on its neighbour Chad only yesterday.
HissÃšne HabrÃ© was once the leader of that desert country, and was automatically accepted by the outside world, holding on to power in part of it until 1990, when he was forced to escape to Senegal.
Even after his departure, there is no room for political opposition, the people are starving and terrorised by armed gangs, while neighbouring countries try to gain control over part of the territory.
Charles Taylor fled from Liberia to Nigeria; Mengistu Haile Mariam fled from Ethiopia, and now lives in Zimbabwe, and for such as these, sentences imposed by a court of law might be appropriate.
They might even deter future African politicians from developing into violent dictators.
The situation in Rwanda is not completely comparable.
Some see the present dominance of the Tutsi minority as fair punishment for the Hutu majorityâs attempt at driving out and massacring their age-old oppressors.
The long-term continuation of the present situation â for indeed we must take into account the possibility of this situation continuing for the foreseeable future â continues to feed an age-long feeling of mutual hatred.
That is why we should not lump all the countries together, but instead give due attention to the atrocities that have been committed in them.
Â Â  . Mr President, the fight against impunity should be one of the cornerstones of the Unionâs policy in the field of human rights.
That principle applies only too well to Africa, in parts of which numerous horrific human rights abuses have occurred, sometimes on a massive scale.
Unfortunately, however, the perpetrators of these crimes have rarely been brought to justice and the victims are very frequently denied any form of effective remedy.
It is imperative that infamous people like Charles Taylor, Colonel Mengistu and Chadâs devious exiled former President HissÃšne HabrÃ© face trial in an internationally recognised court of law in respect of the atrocities and crimes against humanity they have allegedly carried out.
It is truly shameful and distinctly disgraceful for the governments of countries like Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Senegal to continue to be an obstacle to the course of justice by providing a safe refuge to such alleged criminals.
It is my view that if these governments ignore what this resolution calls for, then the EU, in conjunction with the international community, must consider taking more drastic, peaceful action to force a proper remedy.
Â Â  . Mr President, today we are discussing impunity in Africa and it has already been said how important the institution of the International Criminal Court is.
But we are also specifically discussing the case of the former dictator of Chad.
HabrÃ© ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990, and his one-party system was marked by severe violations of human rights and large-scale campaigns of violence against his own people.
The US and France backed HabrÃ© for a long time, because they saw his regime as a bulwark against Gaddafi.
During Ronald Reaganâs period of office, HabrÃ© received massive military aid as well as paramilitary aid through the CIA.
That also has to be said.
It is not simply that we should not be teaching other continents lessons; we must also be clear in our minds that for many years major Western countries gave their backing wherever bloody dictators were in power.
The question now is how to end HabrÃ©âs impunity.
I welcome the search for an African solution.
If that fails, HabrÃ© should be handed over to the Belgian authorities to put an end to the impunity of a bloody dictator.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs debate on human rights violations relates to the impunity of various former heads of African states accused of dictatorship and of barbaric methods of rule.
The matter raised in Parliamentâs resolution relates specifically to the former President of the Republic of Chad, HissÃšne HabrÃ©, who is responsible for 40Â 000 political murders and 200Â 000 cases of torture.
However, the resolution also names other dictators from Libya and Ethiopia, and examples cited include the conflicts in Sierra Leone, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where three million people have died during the six-year conflict.
An analysis of the political situation in Africa leads one to ask questions about the causes of the conflicts between African ruling elites and the masses of their compatriots who are subjected to such inhuman treatment.
It should be remembered that the composition and role of the African elites were largely determined by the colonial powers, as were any changes to these elites.
As in the majority of colonised societies, in Africa too the elites were formed under the influence of European models and Communist interference, which was decisive in shaping the administrative and intellectual character of the elites who came to power.
The colonial powers, focusing on the exploitation of manpower and the export of raw materials, deliberately restricted political activity together with the development of these countriesâ economies.
At the same time, the elites who were given access to education at European and American universities adopted a style of rule in which vast budgetary resources were allocated not only to the military, to swelling the ranks of the administration, to trips abroad and to delegations, but also to civil servantsâ salaries, ostentatious lifestyles, luxury houses and cars, or in other words to models of life that were far removed from the conditions in which the majority of starving Africans lived.
Economic dependence was aggravated by the fact that key industries were run by foreign capital, and that these were also environmentally harmful.
The ongoing economic drain of Africa has been perpetuated by unequal economic exchange, and instead of development opportunities, the policy pursued has been one of systematically indebting the poor countries.
We support a resolution which calls for criminal rulers to be made accountable, but it is a matter of greater urgency to improve the overall situation of the African population in such a way as to secure sustainable development, which the aforementioned conditions make difficult to implement.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are very pleased that there has been a discussion on impunity.
The Commission is committed to fighting impunity by all means at its disposal, be they political or financial.
At the international level, as you know, we have consistently expressed strong support for the International Criminal Court through both our common position and our action plan.
In addition, the European Union, through its Member States, is the largest contributor to the ICC and its budget.
The Courtâs credibility and chances of working effectively are largely dependent on the international communityâs general acceptance of it.
That is why we are really working towards making the Court truly universal by encouraging as many countries as possible to ratify the Rome Statute.
I am particularly happy that the European Union and the 77 ACP countries agreed to include in the revised Cotonou Agreement a commitment to take steps to ratify and implement the Statute.
This is a good step forward.
In July 2004, the International Criminal Courtâs prosecutor opened investigations into crimes allegedly committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda after 2002.
These notifications, followed by arrest warrants in Uganda, are clear indications of the contribution that the ICC can and will make to the fight against impunity on the African continent.
In addition, in March 2005 the UN Security Council â after much lobbying from the EU and other players â adopted a resolution referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC.
It is unfortunate that it was not possible to resolve the case of HissÃšne HabrÃ© in Senegal, but I welcome the African Unionâs decision of January 2006 to set up a Committee of Eminent African Jurists to consider the case further.
The committee appears to have quite a strong mandate.
Of particular note is its adherence to âthe principles of total rejection of impunityâ.
I hope that a solution that meets the requirements of justice is reached soon.
In addition to the case of HissÃšne HabrÃ©, a pragmatic way forward must be found â as some of you have said â to bring to justice Charles Taylor, who is currently in exile in Nigeria.
In terms of funding, we are contributing to the international criminal tribunals of Sierra Leone and Rwanda.
In addition, a large project is being prepared for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which will seek to underpin our work in the ICC.
Finally, states have a duty under international law to try or to extradite those charged with international crimes, such as crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.
It is primarily, therefore, a matter for the Heads of State concerned to ensure that this happens in the cases of HissÃšne HabrÃ©, Charles Taylor and Mengistu Haile Mariam.
The importance of the role of the International Criminal Court comes into play when states refuse to observe their duties in this regard.
That is why it is so important that the European Union should continue to support the universal ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  â Impunity is the greatest enemy of justice.
Nameless crimes, crimes that go uncondemned, criminals living with a sense of impunity, and often even in luxury, all lead to the trivialisation of death and human suffering.
The peoples of Africa have suffered a great deal under their rulers.
It is our duty to help them, and to help them not only in terms of material aid, but also in terms of aid associated with higher values, such as a sense of justice.
Modernisation has meant that evil people can cause others greater harm.
Modernisation should also mean quicker and more effective justice for those who blatantly abuse their power.
Immunity and privileges were designed to protect people from abuse by the authorities, and not to protect those who abuse power.
Forgiveness can come from high moral authorities, but there is no real forgiveness without repentance.
Unfortunately, those criminals who do not have a sense of individual responsibility, and do not recognise the right of others to condemn their actions, are rarely mature enough for feelings such as repentance.
We must therefore support any actions that will force them to answer the questions: why did they kill, why did they rape, why did they torture?
It is not a question of revenge, but of restoring a balance between what is evil and what is good.
Without a fundamental balance like this, the future of humanity will be under persistent threat, and not only in Africa.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
I should like to change the wording of âwhereas on 12Â November 2005 another opposition leader, Nurkadilov Zamanbek, â to ââ.
That reads better in the Dutch and English translations, so that is my proposal.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 March 2006.
Â Â  Before we look at the agenda, I must tell you of some news which is positive for once: a positive piece of news relating to a situation in Spain, but one which I believe is good for the whole of Europe.
I am referring to the communiquÃ© issued today by ETA, announcing a permanent ceasefire.
We are being offered a glimpse of a future without terrorism.
This is a time to act calmly and prudently.
It is also a time to remember the victims of terrorism, and there have been many.
It is a time for hope, for the uniting of all democratic political forces.
I would say again that this is good news not just for Spanish society, but for the whole of Europe, because it shows that terrorism can be fought through the power of democracy.
Thank you for your applause, ladies and gentlemen.
Would the political groups like to speak following this communication from the Presidency?
Â Â  Mr President, as you can imagine, the information you have given this House has provoked a lively response within our Group today.
One of the 200 members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is herself a victim of ETA terrorism, since her husband was murdered by ETA.
I hope you will agree to my asking my colleague MrsÂ DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop to say a few words on behalf of our Group.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ETAâs announcement of a permanent ceasefire, which has been confirmed, is extremely hopeful news for all of the citizens of Spain and hence for all of the citizens of Europe.
We would call for unity amongst all European democrats now and in the future, in order to achieve a definitive peace.
As you have said, Mr President â and I say this with profound emotion â this is a time to remember the victims.
Â Â  Mr President, our highly respected fellow Member Mrs DÃŒhrkopâs concluding remarks would also have been my first, namely that our thoughts today are with the men and women murdered by ETA and with their families.
Pleased as we of course are at this announcement, we are equally firm in saying there must be no political reward for such an announcement by ETA.
At a time such as this, when we hope for a peaceful future for the whole Basque country and the whole Spanish nation, our thoughts go out to people all over the world who are dying because of terrorism or who are being deprived of their individual liberties, as at present in Belarus, where some of the opposition is being imprisoned.
As freely elected Members of the European Parliament, it is our moral duty to speak out whenever the protection and dignity of human life are at stake.
Because the dignity and the protection of human life is the supreme value in Europe and in the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, normally if you invite the political group leaders to take the floor it is because of some tragedy which has afflicted our world.
It is a pleasure today to be invited to celebrate something which can only be regarded as a victory.
In western Europe, thanks to the political leaders of the post-war generation, we enjoy democracy.
In a democracy, a change comes through the ballot, not through the bullet.
The actions of ETA, the IRA, the Red Brigades and the other terrorist groups we have known in the past have been unjustifiable terrorist actions.
On behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I welcome the process through which ETA has announced this ceasefire.
I look forward to seeing dialogue and democracy as the basis for change in Spain and across our continent.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, our group heard the news about ETAâs communiquÃ© around two hours ago, and we would like to make the following statement.
This statement from ETA demonstrates two things.
Firstly, that democracies are right to oppose terrorism.
Secondly, the statement shows that, although democracies are right to oppose terrorism, they must also be able to negotiate and talk things through.
That was what happened in Northern Ireland and that is what is happening in Spain, too.
I congratulate all the political forces in Spain, which have been able to take a stand and negotiate since, in order to prevent a massacre from taking place, the different sides must be able to talk to each another.
I therefore congratulate the Spanish Government and I congratulate all those who have had the strength to show that they are taking a stand and that they are not giving way but, rather, that they want to have done with terrorism, and the end of terrorism always hinges on negotiations.
Moreover, we have requested that ETA send its ceasefire letter to Hamas so that Hamas might take inspiration from it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to join my colleagues in welcoming this decision by ETA.
Unfortunately, it is too late for many of the victims, but just think of the future victims whose lives have been saved because of the decision taken today.
As we look to the future of peace and negotiation that will take place in Spain as a result of this decision, I want to put into peopleâs minds the idea that ceasefires and negotiations do not mean subjugation.
There must be a parity of esteem between the different sides of the argument; there must be respect for the divergence of opinion; but, most importantly of all, we must never forget that lives have been sacrificed needlessly because people refused to talk to each other on an equal basis and on an equal footing.
If anything, the European Union has proven, over its 50 years of existence, that it is the best possible peace process that can be seen, because it is based on dialogue, mutual respect, understanding, tolerance â not acceptance â of all different ideas.
It is based on respect for people with different ideas and focuses on ways to work together.
Finally, the opportunity that is now presented by this decision from ETA is a groundbreaking one, but do not forget that opportunity comes to pass, not to pause: we must grasp it now and work to fulfil the ideas within it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to endorse everything the previous speakers have said and to thank Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop in particular.
I want to make one thing perfectly clear: nothing can justify terrorism.
It is important that all democratic parties, all citizens who live in democracy and peace, clearly say: there is no way we will accept terrorism, that is not what we want, we want to live in peace and friendship with one another.
Every victim of terrorism is one victim too many.
Democracy and human rights: these are the values for which we all stand.
I hope that this day with the ETA announcement really will result in a political and peaceful solution to problems in Spain.
Â Â  Mr President, I certainly join in welcoming this announcement.
I also join in the expressions of regret and sympathy in respect of ETAâs very many unnecessary victims.
I do that somewhat from a personal perspective in that we, in Northern Ireland, likewise suffered unnecessary decades of terrorism.
I would join in your words of caution from the experience in Northern Ireland.
Certainly it is good to see this ceasefire.
We hope it is permanent, but MrÂ Poettering is absolutely right: there can be and should be no reward for doing what is right.
The mistake that was made in my country, when the associate organisation of ETA declared its ceasefire back in 1994, was that everyone rushed forward with political rewards for that which had been done.
That proved to be disastrous, because it encouraged a belief that you could keep a foot in both camps.
You cannot be a terrorist by night and a politician by day.
There must be a total transition to exclusively peaceful means.
The Spanish authorities should therefore learn from the experience in Northern Ireland.
They should test ETAâs commitment and bona fides and realise that you should not and cannot give rewards for doing that which was necessary and right.
In welcoming the ceasefire, I offer that advice and that caution from the experience in my country.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to welcome the ceasefire and the fact that weapons are being laid down and replaced with voting papers.
I come from an area between Denmark and Germany where there have been war and conflict for donkeyâs years and where, by granting reciprocal rights, respecting national minorities and having the border determined by referenda, a situation was achieved in which old enemies became friends.
I have experienced this process in Northern Ireland.
When we visited the province for the first time as Members of the European Parliament, we were thoroughly checked for weapons before we went into our hotel.
On subsequent occasions, it was a peaceful Northern Ireland that we visited.
The process is possible.
I hope that peace will also finally be established in Spain and the Basque country.
Â Â  Mr President, the communiquÃ© from the terrorist group ETA does not alter the situation in Spain in any way.
The communiquÃ© tells us that ETA is going to stop killing for as long as it sees fit and that it is doing so in order to achieve its supposedly political objectives.
The communiquÃ©, which does not contain a single word of remorse, which does not contain any request for forgiveness, which does not contain the least demonstration of submission to the rule of law, does nothing more than demonstrate the cynicism and moral meanness of this criminal group once again.
I hope that the Spanish Government will only accept one kind of communiquÃ© from ETA: one which announces that it is disbanding and handing over its weapons and one which asks for the forgiveness of so many people who have undergone such suffering and such unjust pain at its hands.
Â Â  Thank you to everybody for your reactions to ETAâs communiquÃ©.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join with you and the people of Spain in welcoming the good news you have received.
I think it is very good for your region.
As someone who also comes from Northern Ireland, during the earlier part of my 16Â years in this House, I had to rise nearly every month to express condolences to the people of my area.
It is the one thing I do not miss having to do in this House now that we have some degree of normality in Northern Ireland.
I hope that goes for the people of Spain as well.
I would echo the words of Mr Poettering â and indeed I have learned from my own experience â that it is much easier to make war than it is to make peace.
I agree with Mr Poettering when he said that those who have been waging that war and taking those lives should not be rewarded for bringing an end to that now.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that we are dealing with a very important piece of news, not just for Spain, but also for the European Union, because ETA's announcement is a fact.
A new prospect is opening up for exploring a process of negotiation which could lead to a definitive peace in the Basque Country and hence in a part of the European Union.
We are entering a complicated and difficult stage and I hope that this European Parliament will, in second place â because Spain is in first place; it falls to the Spanish Government â help to overcome all of the obstacles which I am sure will arise during the process of negotiation.
I therefore believe that we are unquestionably facing a new situation which deserves the attention and support of all of us in seeking a definitive solution to this problem.
Â Â  Mr President, I also come from an island which had suffered almost 30 years of terrorism.
We have had a peace process in place for ten years or more.
I very much welcome the announcement today by the ETA organisation.
My criticism of it would be same criticism I have applied to the IRA in Ireland for very many years: that it was engaged in a useless, pointless, undemocratic way of seeking to pursue its objectives.
However, at the end of the day, as politicians, we have to find a way of achieving a democratic political solution to the problem.
It seems to me that the Spanish Government is to be congratulated in bringing about a situation in which a ceasefire has been announced.
It is a matter for all democrats â both in Spain and in Europe â to back the Spanish Government in taking the process forward, because if we allow organisations like ETA or the IRA to see a gap between democrats as to how peace can be built, then we will fail and they will win.
Â Â  Mr President, I had no intention of speaking following the heartfelt speech of my colleague, Mrs DÃŒhrkop, but following the speech by the Vice-President, Mr Vidal-Quadras, I just wished to say one thing, because I believe that all of us here are united in calling for European democrats to come together in order to support this process.
I just wish to say to Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca that I hope that his political party and his group will behave in the way that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament did when the Peopleâs Party and the People's Party government were responsible for starting a negotiation process following a ceasefire that was similar to this one but which did not have the same content.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches on this subject.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that a delegation from the Danish Parliament, headed by its President, Mr Christian Mejdahl, is currently attending our sitting from the official gallery.
I have had the opportunity to hold a meeting with MrÂ Mejdahl and his delegation and now I would like to welcome them most warmly to our Chamber; I hope that your stay in Brussels and your visit to the European institutions are fruitful and positive.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 16 March 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
Â Â  Mr President, I refer to Rule 103 and Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure.
Rule 130 is concerned with the agenda, Rule 103 with statements and proposals by the Commission.
I am not referring to todayâs agenda, however, but to the agenda for the next plenary session, and I have the following request.
On the agenda for the next plenary session of the European Parliament we have a debate and a resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in Belarus.
Since the President, Vice-President and other members of the Commission are present, I am taking this opportunity to ask the following.
The situation in Belarus is cause for concern.
I do not believe the European Union can stand idly by while a dictator shamelessly destroys democracy in Europe.
Thought must therefore be given to the measures the European Union can take to put Mr Lukaschenko in his place.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission today to put forward suitable proposals on this agenda item before the debate in the next plenary session and to explain the measures which it â the Commission â is proposing or is able to propose for taking action against Belarus and its present government and for strengthening the opposition there.
Â Â  Mr Schulz, the agenda for the next sitting will be set by the next Conference of Presidents.
We take good note of the fact that you want this item to appear.
It will be discussed by the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Mr President, then I request that the item be placed on the agenda of the next Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Very good, it will be on the agenda of the next Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Mr President, with reference to Rules 133 and 144 of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Schulz is talking about the following plenary part-session, but I wonder why we are not taking the opportunity of this part-session of this House to discuss the situation in Belarus.
We can indeed wait for the Commission to come up with measures, but we can also produce some of our own.
It is absurd that we should not make use of the momentum generated by the people who are taking to the streets.
I propose that we have a debate on Belarus either today or tomorrow.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert.
We are making considerable progress because the Members asking to speak on a point of order are now saying which Rules they are invoking.
This is progress.
But as well as invoking them, you should read them, and then you will see that they say that these requests must be presented in writing at least three hours before the beginning of the sitting.
Pursuant to these Rules, therefore, I cannot put your proposal to the House.
I am sorry, but that it is what our Rules of Procedure say, and we will therefore discuss this issue at the next Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief; I refer to the Strasbourg part-session.
Specifically, I request an explanation of the statements by the Presidency during the Strasbourg part-session on the composition of the IND-DEM Group.
I would like to inform the Presidency that today the members of the delegation to which I belong and the members of the Polish delegation have been called to a meeting of the IND-DEM Group to be held at 2 p.m.
We would like to know, however, under what status we have been called, since the Presidency announced that the IND-DEM Group had excluded us, using a procedure that was totally incomprehensible and completely irregular.
I would just like to state that this meeting does nothing to resolve the irregularities committed by the leadership of the IND-DEM Group towards 11 Members forming the so-called minority within the group, who, perhaps not by chance, are also declaring that they are totally unconnected with the obscure events which have brought the leadership of the group to the attention of the European Court of Auditors.
Â Â  Mr Borghezio, Members cannot come to the House and ask for the floor simply in order to explain any problem they may have.
You have not invoked any Rule to justify your words.
The problem you are raising is strictly one involving the internal organisation of your political group.
The Presidency knows nothing about it and has no power to interfere in the way your political group does or does not call meetings for any reason.
I therefore regret, Mr Borghezio, that I was not able to cut you off as I should have done.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to come back to the points based on Rules 133 and 144.
I understand that, technically speaking, you may well be right about the fact that the request should have been submitted three hours before the start of the sitting.
That was a mistake.
But does that mean that we in this House are not now going to discuss Belarus, where people on the streets are demonstrating, simply because of the technical problem that we did not submit a request three hours before the sitting?
Politically speaking, that is completely ridiculous!
Please disregard the three hours and let us vote on whether we are going to discuss Belarus.
Maybe people do not want to discuss it: fine, they can vote ânoâ.
However, let us not allow bureaucratic reasons to stop us discussing something which is so topical and in so doing make ourselves completely useless as a Parliament.
Â Â  Mrs Buitenweg, when Rules do not suit us, we call them bureaucratic.
But the Rules are the Rules, and if you want me to tell you what the Rule says â and you should know it â it does not just talk about presentation in writing before the sitting: it says that it must be presented by a committee â which is not the case â by a political group â which is not the case â or by at least 37 Members â which is not the case either.
None of the requirements laid down in our Rules of Procedure are fulfilled, therefore.
The President must conform to the Rules of Procedure and act accordingly: the matter is closed.
It is closed: 37 Members before the sitting; before the sitting.
I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen: the Rules of Procedure demand presentation in writing before the sitting.
If it was so important to you, you could have taken the trouble to present the request in writing before the sitting, because I imagine that you did not just discover the issue of Belarus half an hour ago, did you?
Please take the trouble to read the Rules of Procedure and apply them.
Â Â  Mr President, there are situations where one has to come to an understanding.
You are no doubt correct in your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, but we have another sitting tomorrow morning and I request, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we debate the situation in Belarus here in this House tomorrow ...,
in order to express our solidarity with the democrats in Belarus.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Poettering.
The plenum is sovereign and the appropriate action will be taken according to the support expressed, but the President must conform to the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree; our Group accepts that.
We can debate Belarus here tomorrow morning, that is no problem at all.
But we shall also have to discuss the hypocrisy that has just been shown here.
If a Group believes that this subject ought to have been debated here today or tomorrow, MrÂ Poettering, then a telephone call would have sufficed.
I spoke with you by telephone five minutes before the start of this sitting and I heard not a word from you on this subject.
I have just requested here that we debate it in the next sitting, then a fellow Member asked that we do it now.
You also show your democratic credentials in your ability to listen!
I have nearly finished.
A fellow Member asked that we do it now; that can be discussed quietly.
But to rehearse this revolt here, as though you â and you alone â were the defender of Belarusâ interests, we cannot go along with that.
We can debate the matter tomorrow, but not with your farcical behaviour.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not have a special theme I would like to discuss with you: this still concerns Belarus.
We are now collecting 37Â signatures.
I think we can proceed very early tomorrow morning with the request of our group chairmen.
I do not expect to submit a written statement on it, but the 37Â signatures collected here during the sitting should be enough, and I look forward to receiving your confirmation.
Â Â  â I should like to alert my fellow esteemed colleagues who are currently calling for us to become involved as soon as possible in the situation in Belarus â some of whom are from Austria â to the fact that the EU imposed sanctions on Austria some time ago.
While Mrs Ferrero-Waldner calls for pressure to be put on Belarus, she was a member of the SchÃŒssel Government that faced sanctions from the EU.
Please think carefully about the steps you are taking, so that you are not faced with the embarrassing prospect of having to ignore them in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am always pleased when the grand coalition starts to shake.
That is always good for Parliament.
The second thing I would like to say â and there is no need for excitement, because I think Mr Poettering is quite right, even if he did perhaps only see the light when he was in this Chamber, which would not be a bad thing either, MrÂ Schulz â is that we, the European Parliament, must debate this situation and take a clear stance towards Belarus and towards Russia, because MrÂ Lukaschenko would no longer be in power at all without MrÂ Putin!
If we do that tomorrow, we will have earned the stars of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr Cohn-Bendit, we are dealing with points of order; I would ask you not to get into the matter itself.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to commend you for ensuring respect for the rules of the House, for showing the flexibility to meet the demands of our colleagues for a vote tomorrow morning and I move that we proceed forthwith to next business.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I came into the Chamber just now â and I am only speaking because MrÂ Schulz addressed me â I thought, this is the first sitting since I have been Group Chairman in which I do not need to speak.
It has turned out differently â you made the announcement about ETA and I responded because others spoke.
When I spoke on the telephone with Mr Schulz, on his initiative, at five minutes to three or five minutes to two â I do not exactly remember â I certainly had no idea that there would be a debate on Belarus here today.
Please believe me, I am putting my cards on the table, when I say that if I had wanted to instigate such a debate I would have spoken not only to Mr Schulz, but also to Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Wuertz, Mr Cawley, to everybody.
I came into the Chamber not knowing about this debate, heard my fellow Membersâ reactions and thought I would show my good will by suggesting that we debate in the morning.
I still believe that is a good suggestion.
Â Â  Alright, let us adapt the Rules of Procedure, but we must respect them, because if we do not respect them today on the grounds that we think a Rule is nothing but an irritating bit of bureaucracy, then tomorrow others may take the same line and we will end up without any Rules at all.
So if a request is presented this afternoon signed by 37 Members or by a political group â as the Rules of Procedure stipulate â the debate on Belarus will take place tomorrow.
But please conform to the procedures laid down.

Â Â  Before giving the floor to the Members who are speaking on behalf of the groups, I would like to inform the House that the Foreign Affairs Minister of Peru, Mr MaÃºrtua de RomaÃ±a, is in the diplomatic gallery.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Peruvian Government for the wonderful way it helped us in holding the Latin America and Caribbean Conference in Lima, in June last year.
All of the Members of this House who took part in that Conference â in particular Vice-President dos Santos â talked about how well they were treated and about the excellent organisation.
Please pass on our thanks to the government of your country, Minister.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the 2007 Annual Policy Strategy.
The President of the Commission has the floor, I would apologise to him for the delay.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today consists of taking stock and planning for the future, as well as finding a consensus regarding the priority actions for 2007.
It is a question of working together so that we can properly prepare the ground for future actions.
The Commission has placed the effective implementation of its policies at the heart of its objectives, but if we are to implement them effectively we need a genuine partnership between the European institutions.
The 2005 report shows that the caricature of a Europe in the grip of paralysis was far removed from reality.
We have in actual fact made considerable progress.
The Commission has focused on its objectives and has achieved a rate of implementation of nearly 90% for its priority actions.
The Stability and Growth Pact, the revised social agenda and the sustainable development strategy have been steered in a new direction.
Above all, however, I believe that, this week, we will see that the revision of the Lisbon Strategy on employment and growth has been a turning point in terms of finally providing the strategy with the tools it needs to turn aspirations into reality.
The Hampton Court Summit helped achieve a new consensus on the key elements of the Unionâs action in a world that is heading in the direction of globalisation.
It opened the door to the measures that are emerging today.
I am thinking, for instance, of European energy policy and of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
The Union demonstrated its ability to respond rapidly to peopleâs needs after the tsunami and the London bombings.
It has also shown that it is capable of working as one body, with the European consensus on development, to which the European Parliament itself also subscribes, being the expression of a genuine common approach.
Admittedly, our task is not complete.
As far as the financial perspective is concerned, however, I believe that we are closer than ever to reaching an agreement.
If we find a solution very soon, then we will still have enough time to get under way with implementing most of the programmes at the start of next year, something that is particularly important for the less wealthy countries and regions of our continent.
As for the future of the European debate, we can still take advantage of the events and make use of that period in order to find a genuine consensus regarding which direction we need to take.
I believe that we are on the right track: the annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, the Green Paper on energy policy, biofuels, the European Institute of Technology and the road map in the field of gender equality are so many major initiatives that are already on the agenda.
So, what about 2007?
I believe that 2007 will be a crucial year in terms of achieving the strategic objectives set by our Commission for its term of office.
Our strategic objectives over five years â prosperity, solidarity and security â and, of course, their influence outside the EU remain fully relevant.
They form a coherent political framework designed to guide the action of the European Union.
They reflect the challenges facing Europe and the main anxieties of Europeans, which they strive to address.
They will remain the cornerstone of the Commissionâs action.
I believe in fact that they constitute a sound basis from which to re-assess the direction that our Union must take.
With the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome coming up in 2007, attention will rightly be focused on the great values and the general objectives of the European Union.
The main target must continue to be sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe.
With a more positive macroeconomic outlook, we must seize every opportunity to accelerate reforms and put them into practice.
I know that this Parliament is committed to playing its role in a real partnership for growth and jobs.
In 2007, several Member States should be speeding up their preparations for adopting the euro.
Provided they meet the necessary conditions, in 2007 we shall see the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and I look forward to their contribution to the European Union.
Energy will continue to attract our attention. We will pay special attention to the promotion of sustainable management and the protection of natural resources.
We will make proposals for a European Union maritime policy.
We will follow up on the Green Paper on labour law.
The year 2007 will also be the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
In the field of security and freedom, the main target will be the extension of the Schengen area, migration and border controls and the fight against crime.
Health issues will remain central, with greater preventive efforts against pandemics.
Beyond our borders, we will ensure a proper follow-up to the Doha Round, progress in the stabilisation of the western Balkans â in particular in Kosovo â and completion of partnership agreements with the ACP countries.
As you can see, we will be very busy in 2007.
The year 2007 will also see new directions for the second half of the Commissionâs mandate.
We shall be preparing for the future, with intensive work on the comprehensive review of the Unionâs budget leading to a White Paper in 2008-2009.
This review needs to be based on a profound reflection and must take the full range of views into account.
This will naturally include the European Parliament and I welcome your intention of close association with this process.
Let me also say a few words on our ability to deliver on these priorities.
We need to translate them into practical actions and implement them through the most appropriate instruments.
The Commission has made progress in this direction.
Firstly, we have a strategic planning and programming cycle ensuring an effective and timely delivery of our priorities and concentrating our resources on these tasks.
The Commission states its intentions, consults on them, adopts its work programme and reports regularly on its implementation.
However, we need to further strengthen the political relevance and substance of our discussion on our strategic planning and programming.
Secondly, we have implemented a range of instruments to promote better regulation and good governance, which I believe is having a real impact on the rigour of our work and the quality of our output.
We have made significant efforts to carry out impact assessments on our major proposals.
We have completed more than one hundred so far, and we will continue to improve their quality and ensure that they make a real difference in our decision-making process.
The Commission will also carry through its simplification agenda, covering various fields from environment to industry, the modernisation of labour law, the promotion of consumer rights or key internal market sectors.
However, let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States.
As I have said before, better regulation is crucially important for liberalising our economic potential, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.
What our business needs in Europe is a red carpet, not red tape.
Efforts must be pursued at all levels to show that European initiatives are well founded and add real value.
In many areas â be it at European or national level â we do not need so many regulations.
As Montesquieu said â in the best possible way â and I shall say it in French:
Roughly translated, that means âuseless laws weaken indispensable onesâ.
This is the very principle of the good European tradition.
So what are the next steps?
The annual policy strategy decision forms the basis for our dialogue in view of preparing the Commissionâs work programme for 2007.
Every Commissioner now stands ready to discuss with committees the political priorities put forward in her or his area.
It is crucial to take time away from the topic of the day in order to prepare for the future.
I very much welcomed Parliamentâs initiative last year to draw together the threads in its report.
That had a real impact on this yearâs work programme.
Mr President, honourable members, the Commission puts this strategy forward in a spirit of partnership.
I look forward to your views on where Europe should devote its energies in 2007.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005, the people of Europe had the opportunity to tell us not only that they were expecting great things from us, but also that they were wondering about their future and about that of Europe in a context of globalisation.
The political strategy for 2007 must enable us to provide sound answers.
Without either the interinstitutional agreement or the financial perspective for the moment, where do we go from here?
We are in a situation that I would describe as complete hypocrisy.
We want to debate actions that are important for Europeans, while, for its part, the Council, ever deaf to our arguments, is proposing practically no budgetary development.
Our Parliament will not give up on the financial perspective.
The needs are huge: youth training, research, transport, health programmes, the environment; a full list would be too long.
MrÂ Barroso, you talk to us about a potential forthcoming agreement, but I have not heard you say the word âambitiousâ â an ambitious agreement â and I therefore remain sceptical.
In the dialogue that we are embarking upon, you can count on the momentum of our Assembly in formulating its political priorities for 2007.
I am pleased, moreover, to see that the European Commission is finally recognising that economic cohesion, solidarity and environmental protection can be reconciled with our objectives regarding growth and employment.
You propose four priority areas: knowledge, businesses â and specifically SMEs â employment and ageing and, lastly, energy.
We must in fact represent the best of the knowledge-based society.
We can see what is happening in Asia and we must not remain helpless in the face of it.
The European Union will only cope if it rises to the challenge posed by knowledge, knowledge that takes the form of technical and industrial developments.
As regards SMEs, we must create a competitive regulatory environment and help our businesses to gain a better foothold in international markets.
You also intend to do away with the European laws that serve no purpose, those notorious useless laws that you just mentioned to us, which weaken the necessary laws.
We totally agree with you, MrÂ Barroso, and our Parliament plans to be closely involved in the decisions taken to simplify legislation.
Being simple, however, also means expressing oneself clearly.
You want to make 2007 an important year where communication is concerned, and I approve of your ambition.
Coining new words, however, has never been part of a good communication strategy.
In the context of the main priority, that of employment, you introduce an awful word, âflexisecurityâ.
What does that mean?
Europeans are going to run away faced with that highly technocratic word.
âBrussels has invented yet another forgettable wordâ â that is what we are in danger of hearing.
Energy is the fundamental issue.
The year 2007 will have to be a decisive one where the guidelines on energy policy are concerned.
We will have to be objective, disregard all ideologies, no longer treat nuclear power as a taboo subject and keep in mind that our energy dependence must never exceed 50%.
As we have seen recently, energy is becoming a genuine weapon with which to exert political pressure.
Furthermore, if, in the future, a non-EU country decides to cut the supply and plunge Europe into darkness, how will we respond?
We therefore need to improve the means of transporting energy and to think, first and foremost, about solidarity among the Member States.
In the area of security and freedoms, the extension of the Schengen area worries our fellow citizens.
They still have the impression that our borders remain porous and that the debate on immigration is still at the stage of wishful thinking.
The future enlargement to incorporate Romania and Bulgaria will have to be decided in the course of this year.
While I am on that subject, we note with interest your indispensable condition: that those countries will have to comply in full with the Moreover, if the neighbourhood policy becomes a policy in its own right, then I regret that more is not being done in terms of establishing the strategic partnership.
The 2007-2013 period will also mark the launch of new European programmes. There will be a large number of them, and, if we are to launch them, then we need the financial perspective.
We are only too familiar with the debate on Erasmus.
Finally, we will pay a great deal of attention to the preparation of your White Paper on the reform of the EU budget.
We ask you to involve our Parliament in this task.
The year 2007 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
Might not this be an opportunity, on the one hand, to see the European Constitution enter into operation and, on the other, to make 2007 the year of Europe in all of the Member States, so that the double standards stop at last and so that the truth can be told about how Europe benefits peopleâs everyday lives?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are talking about the Commissionâs strategic programme, we must also ask what role the Commission itself will play in putting that strategic planning into effect.
That is what I want to speak about.
We are all in broad agreement, Mr Barroso, about the content of what you have said and what you have presented in writing.
A revised Lisbon Strategy?
Of course!
Defining Europeâs role in the globalised world as regards migration?
Fine!
A key challenge!
Improving Europeâs energy supply, greater energy efficiency, greater energy security?
Unity throughout the House!
Promoting technology, investing in the technologies of the future to preserve and enhance Europeâs global competitiveness as a knowledge-based continent?
Agreed!
Strengthening internal security and expanding Europeâs role in international security?
Agreed!
Wonderful!
Great!
We will hear many more speakers today saying, âthis is just what we need!
Mr Barroso is right, that is the way forward!â
What we have not been given, however, is a Financial Perspective to match, that is the necessary resources to achieve that.
We haggle with the Council â MrsÂ GrossetÃªte is right there â for a billion more or less.
The bold approach which you and your Commissioners pushed for when presenting your Financial Perspective, Mr Barroso, was cut by EUR 200 billion in the European Council.
You asked for EUR 1Â 022 billion for seven years, the Council decided on EUR 840 billion.
I wondered what happened to Mr Barrosoâs strategic outcry against such incorrect financial policy.
You told this Parliament you would fight for these strategic objectives with this financial allocation.
And then you told Parliament the Councilâs decision was a success.
There is nothing else you can do, I understand that, because you will not get any more money, at least not unless we fight a bit more for it.
As Commission President, you have to live with the stupidity of the Heads of State or Government.
My criticism is therefore directed not so much at you and your Commission as at the partners on the other side.
We will not achieve these strategic objectives if we define the objectives without making the necessary resources available to the institutions that have to act.
That is certain!
That is why I am saying that the Commissionâs strategic objectives are the right ones, but you must also argue the matter with the individual States!
As President of the Commission you must call a spade a spade!
In every single case, you and your Commissioners must go and say that we cannot announce we are going to give Europol more power, that we can fight terrorism and crime more efficiently at European level â incidentally, the joint fight against crime and greater internal security are the European matters getting the highest rate of approval from Europeâs citizens â and then have the Council cut the appropriations by EUR 7.8 billion â and that three days before adopting the additional programme for Europol that sounds so good in the newspaper.
Your strategic objectives are the right ones. But the Commission must take up the cudgels with those Heads of State or Government, with those ministers and councils of ministers, that are not willing to pay the price on Monday for the speeches they made on Sunday.
I expect the Commission to do that.
You can expect us to support your strategic objectives â you have named the right strategic objectives â but we expect you to stand at our side in our battle, as Parliament, with the Heads of State or Government for a little more credibility for European policy.
If we agree this together for 2007, it will be an exciting year and I am sure a successful one for the European institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, today we debate the Commissionâs priorities for 2007, but tomorrow our Heads of State and Government must find the means, the guts and the grit to make these priorities a reality.
We have before us a blueprint for the future with its emphasis on knowledge, enterprise, jobs and energy.
The 2007 Annual Policy Strategy succeeds in putting flesh on the bones of the Hampton Court proposals, which could help make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world, if Member States would only move beyond the platitudes dished up at the annual Lisbon Spring Council.
I have seen the draft Council conclusions.
Fine words from such faint hearts!
Europe deserves better.
It deserves the shared responsibility of which Mr Barroso spoke.
That is why Liberals and Democrats welcome the ambition displayed by the European Commission.
This paper promises what previous annual policy strategies manifestly failed to provide: practical proposals for European renewal by creating legal migration channels and a common European asylum system â and their corollary of better border management â to provide the workers and security that Europe needs; by fast-tracking a European energy policy; completing the internal market for energy and gas; investing in clean coal technologies; and balancing flexibility and social protection with the demands of markets to boost growth and competitiveness.
There is one thing that the Commission has not learned.
It puts the use of resources and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity.
It should put them under the heading of prosperity, because until we learn that the environment and green growth is part of prosperity rather than solidarity, we will not have the correct perspective on such matters.
Add to these the enlargement of the eurozone and the welcoming of Bulgaria and Romania, and 2007 could be a seminal year for Europe, particularly if we get the constitutional process back on track.
However, success hinges on a factor that has been absent up to now, and cannot be replaced by any number of Commission proposals: national ownership of necessary reforms by Member States.
Who will trust leadership which says one thing and does another; which agrees policies, but then backtracks, disrupts and weakens their implementation?
I refer not only to attacks on the services or takeovers directives from economic protectionists, I am talking about a more general myopia that prevents Member States from seeing the bigger picture; the myopia which prompted the Council to throw out proposals to name and shame poorly performing countries and refuse adequate funding for Europeâs priority areas.
It is also one reason why the ambitions of last yearâs annual policy strategy to make progress on Doha, on the Lisbon goals and on the Constitution came famously unstuck.
So that is the challenge facing Europeâs leaders when they convene for tomorrowâs Spring Council.
Europe needs them to construct a coalition of the coherent.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing another strategy, another paper and another set of priorities; in the same way in which we debated the others, we would like to place the emphasis on two or three issues â firstly on the agreement concerning the financial perspectives.
MrÂ President, you know very well that coming to an agreement now, today, with the Council would mean a dramatic reduction in our ambitions and, naturally, those of citizens.
We therefore call on you to make an agreement and to work for an agreement, but subject to our conditions, which ought also to be yours.
I fully agree with the agreement on the financial perspectives, but not subject to the Councilâs conditions.
Until we can count on agreement and a clear alliance with the Commission on this point, debates like todayâs will remain somewhat devoid of substance.
Secondly, you mentioned other topics and I would like to refer to two in particular: one is the issue of immigration and internal security.
You said that the priorities will be Schengen, controls and borders, but you said nothing about one point although it is mentioned in the text: the problem is an aspect that we consider a priority, which is legal immigration procedures.
This element is present in your texts, but it is absent from what is done and what is said!
The fact that the Commission is not able to say one word â not even one â on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country, Italy, still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament, which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert, means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words.
We would be delighted to hear just one word from you on this subject that is not merely a general remark.
