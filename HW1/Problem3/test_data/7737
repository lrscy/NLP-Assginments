The Convention on Childrenâs Rights contains specific provisions on discrimination on the grounds of disability â Article 2 â and on mentally and physically handicapped children, in its Article 23.
The Council will remain constantly committed to respect for human rights and to the outlawing of any form of discrimination.
Â Â  I am somewhat surprised by the Council's response, as I think we should be aware of the issue of caged beds.
Not only is it cruel, unjust and undignified, but it causes the children concerned anger, aggression and depression.
The use of caged beds breaks international law: it is contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is condemned by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
I have a number of supplementary questions.
How will the Council monitor the situation?
What pressure can the Council bring to bear to end this outrageous use of caged beds?
They exist not only in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.
What support can be given to the various countries to ensure that a ban is properly implemented?
And finally, what is the Council proposing to do in terms of the enlargement negotiations with Romania, where I believe this is also a problem?
I would welcome your response, Mr NicolaÃ¯.
I urge you to take this issue very seriously.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Stihler will also be aware that the Councilâs options and powers are of course limited, but there are, fortunately, other channels and other bodies that can deal with situations of this kind; subject to these limitations, the Council is, of course, always alert, and she will also be aware of the ways in which it can exert influence and become involved should information come to its attention.

Â Â  . Mr President, the Western Balkans are still among the European Unionâs priorities.
Mr Bot, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited the region between 21 and 23 July; this was one of his first journeys in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers and emphasised that the region will remain a priority for the EU under the Dutch Presidency and that those countriesâ future lies within the European Union.
The importance that the Dutch Presidency attaches to the Western Balkans is apparent from the various other ministerial meetings, including the very first meeting of the stability association council with the FYROM and the preparations for the first military mission, Operation Altea, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At Thessaloniki, in June 2003, the European Union again promised its strong support for the efforts to consolidate democracy and stability in the Western Balkans and undertook to promote their economic development and regional cooperation.
The European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans already share a strategy and an agenda, the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), with which you will be familiar.
What has to be done is clear and apparent from the new instruments, known as partnerships, which lay down priorities for action and offer the countries of the Western Balkans a coherent framework for their drawing closer to the EU.
Further progress with the SAP will be dependent on both parties, the EU and the countries of the Western Balkans, being determined to discharge their obligations.
The speed at which the countries of the Western Balkans move forward on their way to the EU will depend on the results achieved by each of them in carrying out reforms.
In certain countries, progress must be accompanied by increased regional cooperation, and the European Union will continue to cooperate with the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the SEECP, and the other actors concerned in further improving regional cooperation.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Minister, for your reply and confirmation of the commitment of the European Union and, more specifically, the Council, to the process of stabilisation in South East Europe.
As the European Parliament noted in its annual report and as clearly formulated at the summit in Thessaloniki, we need to start taking stock and evaluating the implementation of the commitments undertaken by the countries in the area in question.
My question addressed precisely this point.
I too have taken a stand by saying that there is a further source of assistance over and above the familiar financial framework and over and above the 2004 budget: are you assessing whether these countries in South East Europe are honouring their commitments?
Â Â  . I think that the honourable Member has raised an important issue and I was happy to be able to enlighten her about it.
Other than what I said in my first speech, I have no more detailed information to give in response to her comments.
Â Â  . Mr President, the EUâs policy on climate change is clearly recognizable in the EUâs external relations.
The Council regularly puts climate change and climate issues on the agenda, thereby stressing time and time again the particular importance of the prompt implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
This is the case with a number of meetings forming part of policy dialogue, some of which are held at the highest level with partner states such as the United States and Russia, ratification by both of whom could, as you know, tip the balance in getting the Kyoto Protocol implemented.
Furthermore, I would remind the House that sustainable development, of which climate policy forms a very important part, is a concept featuring in all areas of cooperation with third states, the Cotonou agreement with the ACP countries being one example.
Â Â  I am particularly disappointed by the answer given by the Council, as we know we are bringing pressure to bear on the United States and on Russia, but today we know that we have certain means at our disposal, including conditions relating to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in the agreements with the Member States.
What I wonder, and what I want to ask you, then, is whether the EU is ready, whether the Council is ready, when negotiating with third countries, to make trading agreements conditional upon the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
You gave no reply.
It is obvious, though, that if you want to fight greenhouse gas emissions, that is where you have to start.
Moreover, the means are there.
We lead the world.
Let us use this lever to have the Kyoto Protocol enter into force.
Â Â  I would like to add to Mrs Isler BÃ©guinâs question by asking whether the Council is really in a position to try to defend the Kyoto Protocol in its relations with third countries, when I still do not know the Councilâs true position on that Protocol.
How much harmonisation is there amongst the Member Statesâ policies on the implementation of the Kyoto Treaty and what position will the Member Statesâ take on 28 September when the International Civil Aviation Organisation considers an amendment which would turn the ICAO regulation on its head in terms of emissions from aeroplanes on international flights?
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to answer the second supplementary question.
The Councilâs powers are in fact limited when it comes to exerting the pressure of which the honourable Members spoke.
We do what we can, and I can produce evidence of that.
Perhaps, Mr President, I can do that by adding that the Dutch Minister concerned, as part of the presidency of the European Union, will this autumn be undertaking an international climate tour, against the background of the problems that the two honourable Members have raised.
He plans to visit the United States, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Qatar, and also a number of EU Member States, in an effort to mobilise the positive forces around international climate policy and the intended outcome of the tour is that the countries he visits should come to recognise that there is a climate problem and are willing to talk about a long-term climate policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, this question has everything to do with the debate that we have just had in the plenary on communication with the public, on the poor turnout at the most recent elections to the European Parliament, and on the subject of greater involvement by the public, which is also important to the Council, and on which it made a statement in July.
The question also indicates the importance of dealing with the public and with the problems that they see themselves as having most to contend with.
That is precisely the approach that we will be considering at the meeting â to which reference has already been made â on 5 October; the Ministers concerned will be getting to grips with them and will report to the European Council of 5 November; another aspect will be the need to deal not only with day-to-day problems but also to discuss the crucial issue of how to bring Europe closer to the people.
I think that this subject was adequately discussed in the debate we have just had, but perhaps I might make an additional comment on the procedure.
This is in particular a matter for the four presidencies following that of the Netherlands to deal with, and needs to be addressed not only in the referendum context but more broadly in the context of communication with the public.
Â Â  I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response to this question and also for his earlier remarks.
Under the Irish presidency, Minister Roche set up a working group in the Council to look for better ways in which to inform citizens of the benefits of Europe.
There is a need for greater communication and understanding not only of what Europe does but also of the responsibility of its citizens to ensure we are as good as we can be.
The only way to guarantee that is by involving the people more directly in open fora and in communication, etc.
I would like the President-in-Office to reaffirm his commitment to continue this kind of process to find the best way of ensuring that people know exactly what we do and what we do not do at European level.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will quite willingly reiterate the undertaking I have already given that we shall continue to carry the torch that was indeed lit by my predecessor Dick Roche, Minister for European Affairs during the Irish Presidency, for at least the next four presidencies, and that this torch shall continue to burn.
Â Â  â I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he would allow me to extend the search for the positive profile of Europe somewhat, beyond the Europe of the twenty-five to the rest of the world.
We should not forget that the European Union, with its Community budget and its Member States, is the biggest source of development and humanitarian aid in the world.
It is clear, however, from the experience of numerous honourable Members who have visited the developing world that this is not visible: the citizens of the developing world are more aware of individual Member States or international organisations, such as the International Bank or the United Nations, than they are of the European Union.
I believe that, in the effort we are making today to raise our political profile and increase our intervention in the world, we must also pay attention to our image in the outside world.
Â Â  . Mr President, the debate on âCommunicating Europeâ has, as the honourable Member said, everything to do with the image of Europe both within and outside Europe, and on that I am in full agreement with her.
What we are focussing on is public concern in Europe as regards the European Union, which certainly does include discussion of the role played by the European Union in the world, for this too is something that the public increasingly expect of their European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, as the honourable Member rightly observed in his question, the positive agenda for trans-Atlantic relations goes far beyond economic cooperation and trading relationships; it does indeed encompass a whole range of subjects.
Our partnership with the United States is founded upon shared values and common concerns; our relationship across the Atlantic, as set out in the European security strategy, is unique.
The European Union and the United States are working on common strategies for dealing with emerging threats such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, rogue states and organised crime.
Both are working closely together to promote respect for human rights in the countries belonging to the United Nations.
They take joint action to promote peace, stability, democracy and development in such regions as the Balkans, the Southern Caucasus and in countries like Afghanistan.
They both want to see Iraq develop into a stable, democratic and self-governing country.
As regards the peace process in the Middle East, they are both committed to working towards a peaceful solution in line with the road map.
They also work together in crisis management, Darfur in the Sudan being one example.
It became apparent at the recent EU-US summit on 26Â June how strong, deep-rooted and significant the relationship between the European Union and the United States is.
This summit was an outstanding opportunity to draw up a forward-looking agenda, and, as you know, was the occasion for the adoption of seven joint declarations on the main priorities for cooperation between the EU and the United States.
The Councilâs priority is to concentrate on purposefully following up these declarations.
As regards cooperation between the EU and the USA in the field of development aid, the EU, in its capacity as donor, is given the opportunity at tripartite meetings to raise issues relating to support.
The EUâs development policy is framed by poverty reduction, the Millennium Development Goals and agreements on development funding.
The EU is open to further discussions with the USA relating to these projects.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, relations with the United States are also a factor in many international agreements, for example the Kyoto Protocol, which has not been signed by the United States.
Do you believe it would be possible for us to conduct negotiations with the United States, with the aim of still reaching an agreement on the Kyoto Protocol?
The principle would be to strive for common legislation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Â Â  . Mr President, the subject of Kyoto has of course been discussed with the United States.
When discussing Kyoto and the matter of its ratification a moment ago, I stated how we in the Council were handling it and, to be specific, I also stated that the member of the Dutch Presidency concerned is engaged in dialogue, including with the United States.
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 7 to 23 will be answered in writing.(1)
That concludes Question Time.
()(2)
Â Â  The next item is two oral questions to the Commission on the Dutch boat belonging to the âWomen on Wavesâ association:
- oral question (B6-0010/2004) by Ilda Figueiredo, Francis Wurtz, Eva-Britt Svensson, Miguel Portas and SÃ©rgio Ribeiro, on the ban on entry into Portugal of âWomen on Wavesâ boat.
- oral question (B6-0011/2004) by Lissy GrÃ¶ner, Edite Estrela, Jamila Madeira, Emanuel Vasconcelos Jardim Fernandes, Hiltrud Breyer, Jillian Evans, RaÃŒl Romeva Rueda, Maria Carlshamre and Claire Gibault, on the banning by the Portuguese Government of the Dutch boat belonging to the âWomen on Wavesâ association.
Â Â  Mr President, it is well known that in Portugal the social stigma attached to women who have abortions is actively encouraged and that the political and legal apparatus is used and abused in investigations and court cases of women accused of back-street abortions.
This is because of the continued existence of an unjust and disgraceful law that takes no account of social reality or of the reasons why women turn to abortion.
It is against this backdrop that we have been seeing significant acts of international solidarity towards Portuguese women, including the recent attempt by the Dutch ship belonging to the organisation âWomen on Wavesâ to enter Portuguese territorial waters.
It was disgracefully refused entry by the Portuguese Government, thereby preventing debates from being held and information on sexual and reproductive rights from being provided.
This intolerance reached ridiculous proportions when the Portuguese Government sent two Navy corvettes to surround the Dutch organisationâs ship.
Following declarations made at the Cairo and Beijing United Nations Conferences, Parliament, in its resolution of 3Â July 2002, recommended that governments should develop high-quality national policy on sexual and reproductive health, in conjunction with pluralist civil society organisations.
Ample information should be made available on effective family planning methods, with high-quality access to all forms of contraception, which does not happen in Portugal.
It was also recommended that, in order to safeguard reproductive health and womenâs rights, voluntary interruption of pregnancy should be legal, safe and universally accessible.
Governments were called upon to avoid taking legal action, under any circumstances, against women having illegal abortions. Again, this does not happen in Portugal.
Against this backdrop, we feel that the European Commission cannot turn its back on what is happening in Portugal, on the appalling hypocrisy and violence against women, which clearly encourages back-street abortions and pushes women on the lowest incomes and those with the poorest access to information into the most dangerous activities for sexual and reproductive health.
We therefore hope that the European Commission will show solidarity with Portuguese women, that it will oppose intolerance and will fall into line with positions that Parliament has already taken in this regard.
In so doing, it will promote the actions needed to raise awareness of defending and promoting womenâs rights and dignity.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, too, âWomen on Wavesâ are having an impact.
Why is this so?
Ever since the end of August, the Portuguese Government has been preventing the Dutch vessel from entering a port on the west coast of Portugal.
This Dutch vessel belongs to the âWomen on Wavesâ organisation, which Portuguese womenâs organisations have invited to Portugal to give out information on abortion, contraception, and the RU 486 abortion pill, which is the least traumatic method of terminating pregnancy.
The Portuguese Government evidently regards this as putting Portuguese women in grave danger, or else it would not have taken this drastic course of action.
The Portuguese Government thought it was worth violating two of the European internal marketâs fundamental freedoms: the right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU.
This is a serious political incident; never before has the right to freedom of movement been violated for purely political reasons.
We in the Socialist Group cannot accept this, and so we are asking the Council and the Commission what they are proposing to do to prevent this unprecedented occurrence in the history of the European Union from being repeated.
I see this as an important question and one that has to be put to the incoming Commission right now, and we want to see it made perfectly clear that this is not acceptable.
The incident has had repercussions right across Europe; it is all over the media, for there is of course more to it behind the scenes.
The fact of the matter is that women in the European Union really are having their freedom curtailed, and we cannot accept the creeping rollback that is going on here.
We see from the Treaties that, at the level of the nation state, the freedom of movement may be restricted only in the case of a danger to public safety, from terrorism for example, but is that what is at risk in this particular instance?
Is womenâs health threatened by an epidemic?
If so, perhaps it is an epidemic of free thought or of the freedom to decide; I adopt this rather ironic tone in view of the very different views expressed even in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, where the Christian Democrats wanted this case to have a lower profile.
I do think, though, that it is a very important one, and one that needs to be dealt with here in the European Parliament.
We want all women in Europe to know how to get access, in the safest possible way, to contraceptives and terminations and to information about them and the safest ways to use them and then to be free to decide for themselves what they want.
It is clear that this case, at the end of the day, not only has the most profound effect on individual womenâs right to choose, but that it is also and at the same time a highly political act, and that is why we cannot accept the violation of two of the four basic freedoms.
Although we want Mr Barroso to say where he stands on this, I would also ask Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to add her weight to the womenâs case.
MrÂ Barroso is presenting eight women as Commissioners and claims to want to give women a better future, but it may be that the substance of his programme will suffer a setback.
That is something we want to prevent, and that is why we are having this debate today.
I hope that both the Commission and the Council will clearly state their positions on this.
If they do not, then I think the or the âWomen on Wavesâ organisation ought to write a thank-you letter to the Portuguese Government for giving us the opportunity to discuss the principle whereby women must be able to decide freely when and how they want to receive information on the termination of pregnancy and what they do with it, and, at the end of the day, also have a free choice as to when and how they want to have a child.
This is a fundamental issue, and it needs to be discussed in this House.
Â Â  Mr President, as the last speaker said a moment ago, a debate on âWomen on Wavesâ soon changes into a debate on abortion, about a womanâs right to choose.
This happens, of course, in the debate in this House, but also in the media, where the discussion about the reproductive rights of women, which are not recognised in all EU countries, is once again cranked up.
This is exactly what the âWomen on Wavesâ association wants.
Consequently, any politician who speaks for or against this organisation and wants to enter into the fundamental debate about abortion, does complete justice to the objectives of this womenâs organisation.
I myself can be brief about this.
I fully support this Houseâs position, as set out in Mrs Van Lanckerâs report, which is that, although a termination should not be decided upon lightly, women should, have the right to decide in favour of a safe, lawful termination.
That is what was said by the majority in this Parliament, as indeed it is what is said by âWomen on Wavesâ.Portugal, however, has refused to allow the ship access to the port, which is bizarre.
âWomen on Wavesâ is not engaging in illegal activities in Portuguese waters; what it is doing is providing information about a topic which is not to the governmentâs liking.
This may well be the thin end of the wedge.
Indeed, it is only a matter of time before Greenpeaceis refused entry to ports if it says something not to the governmentâs liking, and that we cannot accept.
The Portuguese used the argument that the ship is a threat to public health.
Is the European Commission of the same mind?
Mr Bot has already stated that refusing a ship entry on those grounds is not justifiable.
Does the European Commission share his opinion?
Access should not, however, be denied on the grounds of public order either.
Information activities are not violent.
They take place in the privacy of the ship in the spirit of dialogue and respect, so the governmentâs tough response is unfounded.
The ship has now crossed the border again, just as some 10Â 000 Portuguese women do every year in search of the treatment they need.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite simply in my capacity as a European woman that I would like to speak today on the issue of âWomen on Wavesâ.
Like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE Group), I wonder whether the Portuguese Governmentâs decision to prevent the Dutch ship from entering its territorial waters was a breach of international law. I also, however, view it as a ban on the provision of care to fellow European women.
Although in my opinion the âWomen on Wavesâ campaign is conducted in a somewhat provocative manner, I still believe that it is fundamentally legitimate.
The associationâs campaign is concerned with two womenâs rights which to my mind are indispensable: the right to health and the right to dignity, both of which are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In many Member States these rights have been defended for decades by women who fight to win governments over to their legitimate cause.
This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle.
I am not here to reprimand those Member States which have chosen to restrict, prohibit or punish the practice of abortion, but I believe that the event of which I am speaking today should be an opportunity for these Member States to reopen the debate on this difficult issue.
Women often have to take the serious decision to end a pregnancy on their own, and it is always a time of great distress.
It is a choice which is never made casually, but in all conscience, and accusations of guilt or even criminal guilt are not the right response.
Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward.
Incidentally, repression is a godsend to illicit businesses which exploit ignorance and social weakness.
This type of network should have no place in our Europe of freedoms.
It is the duty of the European institutions to set an example in this field and to ensure that individual freedoms are respected.
If the Commission fails to take a clear stance, it will be seen not just as a social injustice for these women, but as an unacceptable setback for their fundamental rights.
I would like to add that the problem does not affect women alone.
I find it a pity that there are so few men in our Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who have realised that we must unite to defend our ideas and to demonstrate our commitment.
Our duty as Europeans is to use our judgment and compassion to help the women of our Member States confront their problems.
This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE/ADLE Group) calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt a clear and democratic position.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission has been following developments in this situation.
According to the information available to the Commission, 'Women on Waves', together with other persons and organisations, appealed against the refusal of entry of the vessel into Portugal.
On 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra adopted a decision on the appeal which has been the subject of a further appeal by 'Women on Waves'.
The Commission would recall the principles of Community law in connection with the free movement of persons.
European citizens are entitled to have access to the territory of other Member States in accordance with the various rights to freedom recognised by the EC Treaty, subject to the conditions and limitations provided for by that Treaty and its implementing provisions.
Member States can restrict this fundamental right enshrined by Article 18 of the EC Treaty solely when this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
Where a Member State adopts a measure refusing entry to its territory based on one of these grounds, it must respect the general principles of Community law.
It must respect fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of expression, and in particular the proportionality principle, as well as the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25Â February 1964 on the coordination of special measures justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
When decisions are taken on grounds of public policy or public security, the conduct of the persons in question must pose a real and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society.
Only the diseases or disabilities referred to in the annex to Directive 64/221/EEC can justify refusals to enter Member States on grounds of public health.
Under Directive 64/221/EEC, decisions refusing entry or ordering expulsion from the territory must be notified to the person concerned, informing him or her of the grounds of public policy, public security or public health upon which the decision has been taken.
The person concerned must be able to lodge a complaint against this decision.
It is for the Portuguese national courts to rule on the validity of the decision, while respecting the general principles of Community law and the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC.
The Commission has not yet received a complaint about this incident from the representatives of the 'Women on Waves' organisation.
However, it intends to contact the Portuguese authorities to obtain more detailed information on the facts related by the honourable Members.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no reason to hold this debate.
In the case in question, a Portuguese court ruled that the Portuguese Government had acted within the law.
Under due process of law, the judiciary is independent of the other authorities.
The Portuguese Government does not give orders to the judiciary.
Parliament cannot give a ruling on voluntary termination of pregnancy, nor, indeed, on the legality of a judgment.
Voluntary termination of pregnancy is a matter of exclusive competence for each individual Member State.
Portuguese law is not substantially different from that of most Member States and was approved by a democratic parliament.
In a recent referendum, it was decided that it should not be changed.
I understand that pregnant women must be able to make their own decisions in this delicate matter, but we must also respect the fact that a majority of citizens expressed a different view.
This is a majority and we operate under due process of law.
I should like to inform you, Commissioner, that no member of âWomen on Wavesâ was refused entry.
They had previously enjoyed complete freedom of movement and expression in Portugal.
They had no restrictions â they spoke where they wanted to, with whom they wanted and gave the interviews they wanted to give. That was until they helped people to obtain and take medicines that are prescription-only because of their potentially harmful side effects.
One woman, whom I understand to be a doctor, confirms that she obtained this drug over the counter in a Portuguese pharmacy, in violation of basic public health rules.
Given that these allegations have come from a doctor, this is very serious.
Long-standing members of the Portuguese Medical Association and of the Portuguese Pharmacistsâ Association have protested.
Limiting freedom of movement in the European area is intrinsically linked to protecting public health and to preventing the practice of illicit acts.
What actually happened was an incitement to clinically unassisted â I repeat, unassisted â abortion, with the aim of exploiting the fact that many pregnant women are needy and ill-informed, encouraging them to break the law purely for propaganda purposes.
This really is an appalling violation of human rights, which Parliament should condemn outright.
Mr President, you would have been better off, and the Conference of Presidents would have been better off, having this debate aborted.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is a victory for democracy, and is entirely appropriate here today in the European Parliament.
This is an issue that concerns not only Portugal and women; it is also an issue for men and women throughout the European Union.
It also concerns the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
When it refused the Dutch vessel entry into its territorial waters, the Portuguese Government breached not only international law, but also Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Citizens of Europe and defenders of womenâs rights have been prevented from entering a European country and treated as though they are criminals.
The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent when men and women belonging to a non-governmental organisation from one Member State, invited by an NGO from another Member State, with the aim of jointly promoting awareness-raising activities on sexual and reproductive health, have been compared to drug traffickers, illegal fishermen or smugglers.
The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent.
The Portuguese Government cited compliance with national law and protection of public health, yet which Portuguese laws were breached, when and how?
The law-breakers here were not the womenâs organisations, but the Portuguese Government, which violated womenâs rights.
There is also no substance to the alleged danger to public health, since no one aboard the vessel was carrying an infectious disease.
The Lisbon government made its decision, an incorrect decision, based on assumptions and hearsay in order to intimidate women who support voluntary termination of pregnancy.
The Portuguese Government prevented the free movement of European citizens within the European area, by means of deliberate obstruction, in order to prevent an awkward debate for the ruling coalition.
Stranger still, while the vessel was in Portuguese waters, it was watched at all times by two Portuguese Navy corvettes.
Should Portuguese warships be used to intimidate citizens who are peacefully and courageously promoting their causes?
In a democracy there is no such thing as the crime of expressing your opinion.
What happened in Portugal with the âWomen on Wavesâ ship must not be allowed to happen again and must not go unpunished.
If it does go unpunished, it will set a worrying precedent that may lead to restrictions of the rights, freedoms and safeguards that belong to all of us, the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  This debate may be divided into two parts.
Portugal is said to have at least 20Â 000 illegal abortions per year and to have some of Europeâs highest figures for teenage pregnancies.
Midwife Maria do Ceu, who carried out illegal abortions, was sentenced to seven and a half yearsâ imprisonment.
Portuguese women are not alone in being refused the right to free abortion.
Irish, Maltese and Polish women are in the same position.
Women have rights over their own bodies, and the right to sexual and reproductive health is part of the Convention on Human Rights, ratified by all the EU countries.
States that have ratified international conventions must also respect those conventions.
The second part of the debate is about the measures actually taken in connection with âWomen on Wavesâ.
When it became a member of the European Union, Portugal promised, as a state, to respect the four freedoms of movement.
The exemption invoked is that of national security.
In this case, I wish to invoke both Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea.
I do not believe that Portugal is so unstable a country that six people in a boat can jeopardise national security.
Consequently, the proportionality principle may not be invoked in this case.
Finally, Portugal has broken its promise to the EU, other Member States and the European people when it comes to the freedoms of movement.
I would ask MEPs to reflect upon how it would look in Europe if other European governments were to ponder which groups of citizens did not share their own views and were then to call out their navies to prevent these groups from entering their ports.
Such a situation would clearly be unacceptable.
Through its action, the Portuguese Government has challenged not only women and others throughout Europe who wish to defend human rights and respect for international conventions, but also the whole European idea, together with freedom of movement in Europe.
I thus wish to call upon both the Commission and the Council to take clear action on this issue without delay.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that we are not debating here whether or not Portuguese law is among the most backward in Europe â it is â given that, in the area of abortion, it is worse than, say, Tunisia.
We are not debating why Portuguese women have to go to Spain to have abortions that could be carried out in Portugal, or why those without the means to go to Spain have back-street abortions, which is a matter of concern for Portuguese public health.
This is not what we are debating.
It is not even because Portuguese women still have to go to court to expose their pain and their intimate details in a humiliating ordeal.
No.
Nor are we discussing why the Administrative Court of First Instance took the decision that it took in Portugal.
No.
What we are actually discussing here is whether it is legitimate in Europe â because this is a European issue â for a military corvette to confront three men and three women on the high seas and prevent them from reaching a Portuguese port, when they were on a legal vessel and were providing a medical service that has been duly legalised in another Member State.
This is what we are debating.
We are debating whether it is possible to create a European project when the Portuguese State, in defence of the vilest and most controversial law in Portugal, is able to, and gives itself the right to, send a military corvette to the high seas against a civil vessel.
It is this and nothing else that we are discussing.
Mr GraÃ§a Moura may, therefore, wish all he likes to abort this debate, but he has no way of doing so.
The Commissionâs response was an encouraging one, which, while falling short of what was required, ensures that the kind of incident that took place recently will continue to be met with firm opposition by the many people in Europe who believe that the free movement of people and ideas is an integral principle of the European project itself.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank God for giving me the chance to speak before Parliament on the most important issue of modern times, namely the defence of life.
This is of particular significance at a time when over 50 million children are killed each year in their mothersâ wombs, which amounts to genocide on a considerably larger scale than the millions of Holocaust victims.
Many people the world over are asking whether there can be any greater degeneracy and bestiality than the murder of a child in its motherâs womb.
A mother ought to be the embodiment of love and affection, and her womb should be the safest of places.
Unfortunately, however, it can become a grave.
The killing of a child in its motherâs womb is not a human right.
What kind of rights do âWomen on Wavesâ therefore wish to defend, if the leader of this organisation was not even entitled to practice medicine in the countries where they landed, and nonetheless prescribed life-threatening hormonal medication to induce early abortion, as well as publicising drugs which can terminate pregnancy and carrying out abortions?
I wonder whether twenty-first century Europeans really do desire a freedom allowing free rein to people with disturbed personalities, no conscience, higher feelings, dignity or compassion, that have of late been described as immature, in order to not awaken dormant consciences.
After all, such people were formerly classed as psychopaths.
Rational and responsible doctors and researchers have observed with horror the manipulation and degradation of science taking place in laboratories and under the microscope.
It amounts to thinly disguised terrorism inflicted on the weakest of children, and the creation of modern extermination camps.
In what way does the killing of defenceless children in their mothersâ wombs differ from the bloodbath in Beslan?
Against the publicâs wishes, the death penalty for the most serious of crimes has been abolished in Europe. Yet at the same time, and invoking this same public opinion, the death penalty for the most defenceless and innocent is being advocated.
Upon what basis does the European Union venture to assume the right to decide on the life and death of human beings?
It is because of the adoption of such an approach to an issue involving the most fundamental of values and human life that Europe and all of Western civilisation is now increasingly at risk of collapse.
Anyone who cannot see this has been blinded and deafened by political correctness.
I have the highest regard for the Portuguese authorities, and commend them on preventing this ship of death from entering their territory.
Finally, I call for the sanctity of life to be respected from conception to a natural death.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today, or rather which we are unfortunately discussing, has two dimensions.
One would appear to be obvious in this House, namely whether an EU Member State has the right to prevent an act from being committed on its territory if it is a crime under the laws of that country.
This issue seems to me to be completely clear-cut.
We want a Europe in which each country is able to lay down laws for its own territory and use every means to uphold those laws.
In my opinion and in that of my colleagues, the Portuguese Government was fully entitled to prevent a ship bearing death and crime from entering its territorial waters and reaching the Portuguese coast.
Of course this debate has a further dimension too, as a speaker from the Left quite rightly noted.
That Member was absolutely right to point out that this debate is also about the way in which contemporary Europe treats unborn children.
The fact that in many countries the fundamental right to life is not respected is deeply shameful for todayâs civilisation and todayâs Europe.
Praise God, since the recent European elections there is an increasing number of Members in this House with the courage to proclaim that unborn children do have the right to life, in Europe and the world over.
It is a very welcome fact that there are now a great many more people in this House who do remember the words of our Saviour 2Â 000 years ago, when He said: âAs you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to meâ.
These words have underpinned human civilisation for 2Â 000 years.
They must never be forgotten!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two aspects of the ban on the entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to âWomen on Wavesâ which are worthy of consideration; firstly, the violation of the principle of free movement of goods and persons, as the Dutch ships were expressly prohibited from entering Portuguese territorial waters and thus from berthing, and secondly, the propaganda spread by âWomen on Wavesâ.
This ship, nicknamed the âabortion shipâ, has been transformed into a floating clinic in order to supply the RU-486 pill, known as the âabortion pillâ. It should be noted that this pill is banned in Portugal and hence not sold in the country.
As it is, we do not believe that the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality has the necessary competence to deal with these two subjects, one relating to the application of international law and the other, concerned with abortion and contraception, relating to morality, ethics and religion.
In this context, I should like to note that in its resolution of 3 July 2002, Parliament called on the Member States to conduct information campaigns on sexual and reproductive rights, and not to encourage women to use abortion as a method of contraception.
With regards to this extremely sensitive issue, there is no place for politics, to say nothing of politicking, especially if the issue is used purely to win votes, as appears to be the case here.
The European countries and their governments have the right to ensure that their cultural, ethical and religious sensitivities are respected, and they have the necessary authority to do so.
The protest by our fellow Members appears to us to be nothing but a political act against the Portuguese Government, and this is an act with which we do not wish to be associated.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the third time the boat has put out to sea.
As you know, it has already sailed to Ireland and Poland.
According to the agenda, the boat is Dutch.
That is incorrect, although it does sail under the Dutch flag.
The boat is an initiative by a handful of Dutch women, and in view of that, I am amazed that it features here on the agenda.
We are not going to discuss boats by Greenpeace or other organisations.
I set great store by a debate on ethical questions, such as abortion and womenâs rights, and indeed applaud it, but the discussion is specifically about this boat and what happens on it.
I think that what happens on this boat is unfortunate.
Attempts are being made to change the law in Portugal, but in a democratic culture, this is hardly the way to persuade another country to do this.
Interference of this kind from abroad in respect of Dutch legislation in the areas of drugs or euthanasia, for example, could equally meet with the same wave of protest in the Netherlands.
We should enter into a debate with each other in a different manner, not like this.
I also consider this action to be irresponsible.
Given that the boat sailed to Ireland without permission, it did not even comply with Dutch legislation, which is already very lenient in this respect.
Following the trip to Poland, a heated debate arose about the use of the non-approved abortion pill, and there are now discussions about the aftercare that cannot be provided.
âWomen on Wavesâ has now published on the Internet a way to induce a termination yourself using over-the-counter medication, and this is accompanied by a word of caution about the gigantic risks that this entails.
The boat then leaves again a few moments later.
I do not think this the right way to go about things, not even to promote what you want to promote.
Countries think differently about matters such as abortion.
We must enter into a debate with each other about this.
I am all in favour of that.
We may be a community of values, but not in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to address the Commission about European citizensâ, and particularly womenâs, right to information.
Since this right aims to enhance and share knowledge for the benefit of womenâs health and sexual rights, it is perfectly compatible with the Lisbon strategy.
It was not the intention of the âWomen on Wavesâ ship to export the Dutch achievements in the area of abortion to Portugal, but rather to give Portuguese women and men objective information about their sexual rights.
It is up to them what they do with this information.
Two years ago, by means of a resolution following a report by Mrs Van Lancker, this House called on governments to provide objective, scientific and clear information about sexual and reproductive health.
This also included the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and the risks of dangerous terminations performed under inadequate circumstances.
By foiling the activities of âWomen on Wavesâ which aims to provide information, the Portuguese Government has not given evidence of having taken this Houseâs resolution seriously.
Although the ship has now left Portugal, âWomen on Wavesâ has indicated its intention of returning in time for the forthcoming elections in Portugal.
This could provide the Portuguese Government with a good second chance to act upon this Parliamentâs resolution and to demonstrate that it does not want to deny its citizens the right to information.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, can the Commission ensure that best practice in the area of providing information about womenâs reproductive and sexual rights will again be put more firmly on the map, and will it take concrete steps in this respect, for example in the form of organising a conference on this topic in Lisbon?
Â Â  Mr President, the Portuguese Government claims that the activities on board the 'Women on Waves' ship violate Portuguese law.
I cannot judge if this is so, because I do not know exactly what activities were taking place on board that ship and, indeed, I know nothing of Portuguese law.
I believe the case will be judged by a court that is competent to do so.
However, I also believe that this was a provocative act by 'Women on Waves' and an attempt to undermine the principle of subsidiarity because, while in this House we may or may not agree with Portugal's stance on abortion, we must at all times recognise its right as a democratically elected government to make these decisions.
In this House on Tuesday, I listened carefully to one speaker after another talking about 'respecting the dignity of difference, respecting the right of Members to hold different opinions and showing tolerance to those opinions'.
Indeed, the President, Mr Barroso, said: 'nobody has a monopoly on truth' â and that includes the Portuguese Government and 'Women on Waves'.
We must all have respect and tolerance for different opinions, different laws and the right of any state in the EU to legislate and enforce that legislation within its borders.
Surely, in this House, we must recognise and value that principle of subsidiarity.
It is my understanding that the EU and the Court of Justice have stated that laws relating to abortion are dealt with at national level only and that the EU has no competence in this area.
So, while the Portuguese Government has no monopoly on truth, it has competence, which it considers was threatened.
Finally, a parallel: we in Ireland have introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace.
This extends to Irish ships.
If a Portuguese or Dutch citizen were to smoke on board an Irish ship in international waters, that would break Irish law.
It is not the same situation, but this example helps to illustrate how complex and sensitive these situations are and how the principle of subsidiarity should apply at all times.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as all my fellow MEPs know, women have had the right to vote and the power to take decisions concerning themselves and their assets for more than a century.
In addition to accepting responsibility for their own lives, women have had responsibility for their childrenâs lives too.
In spite of the fact that women have been empowered in legislation etc for such a long time, we women are clearly still incapacitated when it comes to taking decisions concerning our own bodies and sexuality.
There is no other way of interpreting the Portuguese Governmentâs action in connection with âWomen on Wavesâ.
The action taken by the Portuguese Government is not only a declaration of womenâs incapacity but also breaches the European Parliamentâs resolution to promote information campaigns concerning sexual and reproductive rights.
I do not want only to debate womenâs rights, but also to put children at the centre of this debate.
Taking a different view from certain participants in this debate, with their lack of empathy and understanding, I wish to say that childrenâs lives are too important simply to depend upon chance.
Children have an unrestricted right to be welcomed into the world with the prospects of a good life.
I do not usually go in for conspiracy theories, but I cannot refrain from reflecting upon whether the action taken by the Portuguese Government does not in large part have to do with the fact that it is precisely women and womenâs own organisations that are at issue.
If this vessel, that is the subject of our debate, had been called âMen for violence as a means of conflict resolutionâ, would it, I wonder, not, in all likelihood, have been permitted to enter the port?
If the Council and the Commission are serious in their talk of a womenâs Europe, they cannot refrain from taking issue with the action taken by the Portuguese Government.
We must now side with women and children.
Â Â  Mr President, I could not agree more with Mr GraÃ§a Moura.
It is beyond me as well why we here in the European Parliament are debating an issue between Portugal and an action group sailing under the Dutch flag.
The case is to be judged by a court, and it does not fall within this Parliamentâs remit.
The whole issue would therefore seem to be resolved, were it not for the fact that this case is not only judicial in nature, but also moral.
Since when does the attack on legislation of another Member State fall under the scope of the free movement of persons, goods and services?
That is precisely what is happening here with âWomen on Wavesâ.
In Last Saturdayâs , this organisation urged people to back the fight for free abortion in Portugal.
That is quite different from providing a service, and in doing so, this organisation is showing its true colours.
That is indeed something completely different from providing information on board the .
I would note in this connection that the Dutch Public Health Inspectorate is launching an inquiry in order to assess whether the activities by âWomen on Wavesâ are permitted.
Progressive activism is testing the boundaries of the law. is not automatically accepted in the Netherlands either.
At the time, only a narrow majority was in favour of a statutory regulation to make possible.
Even to this day, a large minority is having great difficulty accepting this abortion legislation, coming from the standpoint that life is worth protecting.
The Netherlands need not show the way in this matter.
I should like to address the questions that my fellow Members have put to the Commission.
They state that the Commission should take steps on the basis of Community law.
Article 28 of Community law stipulates that there should be free movement of goods and services.
Article 30 of the same Community law stipulates that free movement of goods should not apply when common decency, public order, safety and public health need to be protected.
It follows that Portugal has every right to refuse an action ship access, even if a Portuguese organisation has invited that ship to be there.
It is therefore quite a privilege for the EU Member States to still have the right to adopt their own policies.
In that light, it is a sign of little respect if attempts are made, via European legislation, to prove that the progressive line is right.
The Portuguese Government should be praised for considering the unborn life worthy of protection.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware that when we discuss the âWomen on Wavesâ boat, the discussion relates in large part to the problem of abortion, which is an entirely new problem for the EU.
It should be borne in mind that in the majority of European countries abortion has only been permitted in the past few decades, and even now it is not permitted in all of them.
I rejoice that there are still countries where it is not permitted.
Even those supporters of abortion who believe that it is a matter of moral indifference must be aware that this discussion will give rise to much opposition.
They must appreciate that for a great many people in Europe and for a large majority of people in many European countries abortion is a serious crime.
Both supporters and opponents of abortion on demand are aware that it is one of the great problems of civilisation.
If this problem is reduced today to a debate on whether Portugal has violated the right to information or the right to freedom of movement, this will be an exceptional display of hypocrisy, ill will or stupidity.
As Members of this House, we cannot allow ourselves to act as villains or idiots.
Consequently, if this House begins to consider this problem in terms of the freedom to travel and the freedom of information, it will send out the worst possible message about itself and contribute to the collapse of civilisation, and thus also the collapse of the European Union and the European Parliament.
It is important to remember that in many European countries, including Ireland, Malta and Portugal, abortion is not permitted.
Abortion is not permitted in Poland either.
The ship belonging to the âWomen on Wavesâ association also sailed to Poland, and its presence in Poland was an incitement to criminal behaviour.
Members of this association who entered Polish waters should be aware that if they ever enter them again, they will not only have to answer for the crimes they committed previously, but they will also, I hope, encounter restrictions and not be allowed into Poland.
I believe the Portuguese Government took the best possible decision in this regard.
Clearly, Portugal did not act under Community law.
This point has already been made.
Portugal is a sovereign state with independent courts.
I would like to call once again for the problem not to be reduced to mere discussion on information and freedom of movement.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliamentâs attention, and that of the Commission and the Council, ought to be directed, as others have stated here, towards the pathetic way in which the pathetic mission by the Dutch vessel ended and towards the unbridled, irresponsible propaganda on illegal abortion that women can carry out themselves, by means of the illegal acquisition and use of medicines.
I am not talking about the RU-486 pill, which, as in many EU countries, is not licensed in Portugal and which was being transported on the ship, but about the irresponsible acquisition and use of medicines that can be obtained in pharmacies, albeit subject to certain restrictions.
The unbridled propaganda presents extremely serious risks not only to the right to life of the child that dies when an abortion is committed, but also to the woman, whose health may suffer severely, as documented in pharmacological literature on the subject.
This debate is, furthermore, a waste of time, out of place and improper.
It is also offensive.
I must say that frankly it pains me to see my country slandered abroad and it pains me all the more to see my compatriots taking a leading role in doing so, giving a distorted picture of the facts to those who do not know better, and seeking to caricature the people in question in a propaganda circus.
I have the greatest respect for the Netherlands, for the Dutch people in the European Union and for the Dutch Presidency, but we have our laws.
We have always debated these issues freely without the need for such digressions.
As we all know, we are a democratic and free country.
Our laws are the fruit of our democracy.
In other words, Portugal is not a colony of the Netherlands or of any other country, and less still, the target market of some opportunist group that comes along to educate the local population, as happened during the 1975 âcultural dynamisationâ and when the PREC (Ongoing Revolutionary Process) was at its peak.
We practise respect and democracy; we demand democracy and respect.
It has been suggested that freedom of movement was violated.
This is ridiculous.
Dutch women may go wherever they want to, as everyone knows.
It is the boat that cannot go wherever it wants to.
It has been suggested that freedom of expression was violated.
This is ridiculous.
We all took part in the debate and said whatever we wanted to at the time, just as on all other occasions.
The only acts of violence committed were the extremist and intimidating language â laden with hate and intolerance â used by the supporters of the Dutch groupâs nautical circus to condition the Portuguese people and dilute their rights as citizens, the bias on the part of the media, which was in thrall to the boat tripâs demagogical populism and the vandalism perpetrated at our partyâs headquarters.
In conclusion, the Portuguese Government acted within the law.
The court found in its favour and this matter has nothing to do with the European Union.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I should first like to mention the first victory in this debate.
It has become clear that the Commission will request explanations from the Portuguese Government as regards the .
In Portugal, at least one in four women has had a back-street abortion, which is, as much as anything, an extremely serious public health problem.
That statistic speaks volumes; we cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand.
How, therefore, shall we, the European Union, condemn these women?
Should we have them arrested?
What about those who terminate their pregnancy in London or in Badajoz?
Should we close the borders?
Should we keep them under constant European Army surveillance?
Should we have all of the Portuguese newspapers that publicise foreign, or more specifically European, clinics carrying out safe and legal voluntary terminations of pregnancy confiscated?
What if the were a train, or a TIR lorry?
Would army tanks be stopping the train or the TIR from entering Portuguese territory, so as to make sure that there was no chance of the law being broken and so that the Portuguese people were not informed?
Is the Commission aware that, although the two Portuguese war corvettes were in permanent use, no military or civil authority ever asked to board the and check for any potential dangers on board?
Is the Commission aware that the Portuguese Ministry of Defenceâs only information had come from a series of media cuttings and not from first-hand observation?
Against this backdrop, it was important to know that the Commission clearly intends to ensure compliance with the Treaties.
Otherwise, if Turkey accedes to the EU, the Commission will have to take military action in the case of a married Portuguese man moving to Turkey, having announced that he has a girlfriend there and who will therefore be committing adultery.
Commissioner, it is crucial that action is taken at this time, so that we are not faced with the warped logic of âmore of the sameâ, also in the EU.
This is not a question of morals or of personal opinions, Commissioner; this is a question of legality.
Â Â  Just imagine that fanatic, aggressive anti-abortion activists were to descend upon the Netherlands in order to protest there against abortion using the kind of improper arguments I have heard from that side of the Chamber, and they were stopped at the Dutch border by military police.
If that were to happen, this House would be up in arms.
Abortion legislation is indeed a national issue, but freedom of expression of opinion is a fundamental right of all European citizens across Europe.
Every six minutes, somewhere in the world, a woman dies of the effects of an illegal termination, and in Portugal alone, these practices have already claimed one hundred casualties in the last two decades.
In that light, the Portuguese Governmentâs blocking of information and debate is incomprehensible, and, as far as I am concerned, a disgrace for democracy.
Our fellow-Europeans in Portugal have the same right to information and debate as all others.
I therefore rely on the Commission to uphold European basic rights.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June of last year I witnessed the entry into Polish territorial waters of the , a Dutch vessel housing an abortion clinic belonging to the organisation âWomen on Wavesâ.
We of the League of Polish Families, an organisation defending the life of unborn children, decided that we would not allow this monstrous provocation to occur.
For two weeks I saw how the organisation âWomen on Wavesâ repeatedly mocked Polish law by violating a large number of regulations, for example by entering the port of WÅadysÅawowo without the consent of the port authority.
This posed a navigational risk to other seafaring vessels in the port.
A further instance in which laws were broken was the import of drugs prohibited in Poland.
I would also like to stress that the hygiene and sanitary conditions on the ship were appalling.
If âWomen on Wavesâ wish to enter Polish ports again in the future, we will not allow this to happen.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are differing views as to how the law should treat abortion, but, listening to some of those who have spoken, I got the impression that they regarded abortion as progress.
I think we should, at least, be united on one point, that being that every abortion is a catastrophe and a failure.
An abortion is a catastrophe for the unborn child, who is killed.
An abortion is a catastrophe for the mother, who is often emotionally scarred for the rest of her life.
An abortion means failure on the fatherâs part, for he has often made off in a funk.
An abortion is a failure on the part of the state and of society, which have not created the conditions in which life can be adequately fostered.
For these reasons, we should deal with this issue very carefully and with a deep awareness of our responsibilities.
States decide in different ways how this is to be dealt with by the law, or, to be more precise, in a democracy, it is the people who take that decision, and their decisions differ.
What made Portuguese law what it is was not some sort of shadowy conspiracy, but the Portuguese people â who, in a democracy, decided that they wanted to combat abortion by restricting it, and, indeed, by the use of the criminal law.
Poland and many other Member States do likewise, some of them very effectively.
Let me say yet again that this is a subject on which opinions can differ.
I do, however, find it unacceptable to behave as if information were the point at issue.
Not one Portuguese citizen, whether male or female, is not fully at liberty to seek out information about anything.
Anyone would think that the Portuguese were ill-informed yokels.
Portuguese men and women are extremely well informed and have access to every possible source of information.
What is going on here is agitation and an attempt at undermining the law of a Member State and an important principle of the European Union, that being the subsidiarity principle, and the most important principle in our Charter of Fundamental Rights, the right to life.
Â Â  Mr President, just because abortion in Portugal is illegal in most cases, it does not mean that it is not needed there.
Women in Portugal need help and advice on abortion, sexual health and reproductive rights.
I would remind this House that in most Member States abortion is legal.
I would also draw your attention to the Van Lancker report, which has already been mentioned.
Here we are talking about abortion, which is accepted throughout most Member States of the European Union and has been accepted by this House.
We need to be very clear on this.
We also need to be very clear that illegal, unsafe abortions present not only danger to the women concerned, but danger of death.
We have already heard from Mrs Madeira about the fatalities which take place in Portugal itself and I would like to remind all of you that every six minutes across the world one woman dies from an illegal, unsafe abortion.
I put it to all of you that we have a duty to deal with this and put an end to this suffering and this toll of death.
It is also important to recognise that 'Women on Waves' is only called into countries when women's organisations in those countries concerned actually request it.
We are not talking here about something being forced on people, we are talking about something being requested because there is a clear need and demand for it.
We also need to be aware of the position on the free movement of people within the European Union, which is one of our fundamental principles.
I would like to end by quoting from the Treaty on European Union: 'to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime'.
This is what we are about. We are about basic human rights, and this is one of them.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The political events which we are considering so diligently today have been the subject of wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
I should like to confirm that every member of our committee has been able without exception to express his or her views.
The committee has devoted sufficient time to discussion of these events, even in a situation where we did not have sufficient information and in-depth analysis, especially with regard to the possible contravention of human rights, community rights or rights of freedom of movement or information.
Despite completely open and lively discussions, the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, in view of the divergent opinions expressed, was unable to reach a consensus on a common standpoint.
I should like to turn to a more fundamental aspect, however.
This goes far beyond political polemics and even the legal advisors do not have a clear solution for it.
The following reflections are simply the reflections of a woman in solidarity with other women.
I should like to point out that a woman who feels compelled to have an abortion never does so with relish.
This often involves a situation where the woman does not believe she will be able to cope with pregnancy and childbirth and where it seems to her that, in this confused situation, she has no other option.
This personal upheaval may be associated with extreme situations, when the woman is compelled to stop work, is deserted, raped or suffering from other physical or mental trauma or abuse in a family, economic or social environment.
The situation today is a manifestation of the failure of a developed human society which is incapable of contributing to the needs of all human beings, including the poorest, smallest and weakest.
We must work towards an internal stability pact, which will give people more trust in society, supporting inter-generational solidarity and enabling us to engage together in this direction.
Â Â  Mr President, the fight against terrorism and organised crime must be a priority at the moment for any European government.
Prioritising means mobilising all available resources â police, investigation and intelligence resources â and ensuring that the legal system is ready and able to take quick and effective action.
The Commission recommends that Member States strengthen all resources for this fight.
Nonetheless, in spite of notoriously scant resources, Portugal has been diverting important investigation and legal resources into a different objective: punishing illegal abortion.
The Portuguese police have been bugging the telephones of law-abiding citizens and of their family members or of medical professionals whom they suspect may be involved.
They have spent years observing them and hounding them; legal professionals have spent years of working time â in an already overloaded, understaffed and poorly equipped system â putting women accused of abortion on trial.
Taxpayersâ money is spent on criminal investigations into medical operations that Portuguese women can go to Spain to have, perfectly safely and legally.
Women who have the wherewithal to pay can have these operations in Portuguese private hospitals disguised as other kinds of surgery.
The many women who do not have the wherewithal have no choice but to have back-street abortions, where they risk their lives, and risk being arrested, taken by the police to hospitals, forced to have gynaecological tests and then put on humiliating trial.
The hypocrisy has now, however, reached new levels of insanity, with the ban on entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to the âWomen on Wavesâ organisation.
The Portuguese Government, the one that Mr Barroso has left, has sought to stifle information and debate on family planning, in clear breach of human rights, international law and Community law.
It has done this by using totally disproportionate methods, police and even military resources, without hesitating to use warships.
Resources have thus been diverted, once again, from important activities, such as the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, and observing vessels used in drug-trafficking that use Portuguese waters as a point of entry into the rest of Europe.
As Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m â whom I welcome here today â has stated, the Commission is to seek explanations from the Portuguese Government.
I should like to ask the Commissioner, in addition to the points that she mentioned, not to ignore the unjustified, excessive and almost obsessive use by the Portuguese Government of criminal, legal and even military resources in the fight against abortion and against providing family planning information.
In so doing, they have removed the resources and the efforts that Portugal ought to be putting into EU crime prevention policies in the joint fight against international terrorism and organised crime.
Â Â  I wish to join other colleagues in showing solidarity with the Portuguese Government for its decision not to allow the ship âWomen on Wavesâ in Portugal.
I show my solidarity and congratulate the Portuguese Government for its courage and, why not, also its moral courage when taking this decision.
It is not easy in todayâs world with, pressures being exerted from every quarter, that one makes a bold stand and adheres steadfastly to the decision taken more so when knowing that one would not necessarily be popular by taking such a decision.
I must say that I do not agree that the abortion issue should be raised in this Parliament for any reason except to put pressure on one country or another.
I do not agree as all of us are aware that this Parliament has no power to decide or to legislate on abortion.
In the same manner the Commission has no jurisdiction concerning abortion.
This is a matter that should be decided at a national level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and every country should decide according to its circumstances and according to how its society looks upon such a sensitive issue.
This means that, by raising this issue here when we know that this Parliament has no jurisdiction, all we are doing is mixing people up and creating total confusion, when, in fact, this is a clear issue and upon which there is no place for confusion.
This confusion has even caused a number of countries, including Malta, my country, to seek clarification regarding this issue in the context of negotiations by negotiating a specific protocol regarding the abortion issue.
The same was done by Ireland, and, if I am not mistaken, even Poland, not because there was any legal doubt about this issue but so that there would be certainty and all would have their minds at rest.
Therefore whilst again congratulating the Portuguese Government that set an example to others, I appeal that we should not muddle peopleâs minds regarding this issue by entering into matters that do not concern us.
Â Â  Mr President, I find it somewhat ironic that all of the men who have spoken on the other side of this House have had the temerity to tell women what they should do with their bodies.
I am proud to stand here and defend a woman's right to choose.
That is fundamentally what this is about.
It is about choice.
It is about informed choice.
I find it sad that there are people in this House who want to imprison citizens and women, in ignorance.
This is about a fundamental freedom, with the focus on abortion, a highly emotive subject.
It is easy for you to try and divert this debate, but it must not be diverted.
It is about fundamental freedoms: freedom of information; freedom of movement; freedom of expression; and it is about intolerance.
That is why I am proud to stand here and say that if we allow this to happen in Portugal, what happens when there is another government that has another view about opinions that are different from their own?
What happens then?
If we stand here and do nothing, we condone these undemocratic attitudes.
I have heard religion mentioned.
I am very sad.
I see the fingers of the Vatican all over this.
Women need no lectures from men in frocks, telling them what they should do with their bodies.
Please keep your religion out of our lives and please keep it out of politics.
If we could separate politics and religion, I tell you now that the world would be a safer and better place in which to live.
I condemn the actions of the Portuguese Government and I urge this House to do likewise.
This issue goes to the heart of Europe.
Ours is a Europe based not on suppression of information or repression, but on fundamental freedoms and human rights.
The actions of the Portuguese Government must not and will not go unchallenged.
Finally, as I said previously, this is about informed choice as opposed to enforced ignorance.
Therefore I call on the Commission to act in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties and the fundamental rights enshrined in those Treaties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all Members for this lively, controversial and important debate.
The Commission has been informed by the Portuguese Permanent Representation in Brussels that the 'Women on Waves' association, amongst others, appealed against the decision to refuse entry of the vessel into Portugal.
As I said earlier, on 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra concluded that there had been no violation of Community law.
This decision is the subject of a further appeal.
The Commission intends to seek information on the precise motives and implications of the decision of the Portuguese Government.
Member States enjoy discretionary powers to determine the scope of the concepts of public policy, public security and public health on the basis of their legislation and national case law.
However, measures restricting freedom of movement adopted on those grounds must comply with the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC, which limits Member States' discretionary powers.
As I have already stated, the Commission believes that any Member State adopting a decision restricting the free movement of persons must respect fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, as general principles of Community law.
Â Â  I thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is oral question (B6-0012/2004) on the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, I am wearing several hats this morning, so I apologise for the confusion.
First of all, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, MrÂ Karl-Heinz Florenz, I should like formally to move the oral question, the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention.
Specifically, what are the key strategic objectives for the European Union at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora â CITES â to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2 to 14 October 2004?
I am also here in the absence of Mr John Bowis, our coordinator, and would like to include my contribution on behalf of the PPE-DE Group while I am on my feet, rather than speaking again after the Commissioner.
CITES is a global conservation agreement on trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, which is implemented in the EU through the even stricter EU wildlife trade regulations.
However, there is an urgent need for greater cooperation between the 25 Member States' enforcement agencies, especially now that our land borders, post-enlargement, have increased by over one third to more than 3Â 000 km and also because of the acknowledged links between the significant, though unquantified, illegal wildlife trade and organised crime.
The EU Enforcement Group, which has been set up under Council RegulationÂ (EC) No 338/97, needs to be revisited somewhat urgently.
It needs to be made much more effective: we need systematic compilation on the illegal wildlife trade to determine the numbers of seizures and confiscations.
This must all be put on a database, so that information can be shared by all enforcement officers throughout the EU.
I underline my concerns and those of my Group on the lack of proper enforcement and assistance to the enforcement agencies in this particularly important area.
CITES regulates trade in some 30Â 000 species of plants and animals.
The EU is a major legal market.
Over the five years up to 2001, for example, imports into the EU have included 5.4 million live birds, equal to 87% of global trade, with Portugal and Spain being the main importers; over one million live reptiles, equal to 16% of global trade, with Spain and Germany being the main importers; seven million live cacti and 15Â million live orchids, mainly going to the Netherlands; and 383Â tonnes of sturgeon caviar, 40% of the global trade, which went mainly to France and Germany.
In July 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the Community position, to be adopted on certain proposals submitted to the 13thÂ meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
This proposal has been discussed at a number of meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues, which is made up of scientific and management experts from Member States.
I understand the final meeting is to take place today.
It would have been useful if we had known the outcome of the final meeting before this debate, but unfortunately I do not have any information from it and it is probably not possible to obtain it.
In relation to the CITES itself, Appendix I is reserved for the most critically endangered species. International commercial trade in wild-taken specimens of these species is prohibited in Appendix I.
Appendix II contains most of the species regulated by the Commission.
Regulated commercial trade in these species is allowed, however, such trade must not be detrimental to the survival of the species concerned.
It is really only Appendix I and Appendix II that require the sanction of the Conference of the Parties in this area.
Let me turn to some of the specific points in the resolution before us, which I largely welcome, although I find it rather long and verbose.
However, I fully support the resolution, as does the PPE-DE Group, with perhaps a couple of caveats.
First of all, the PPE-DE Group will be having a free vote on paragraph 3, as requested.
I will be supporting paragraph 3 myself and will be indicating this to my Group, but there are those who have concerns about it.
Likewise, our Group will have a free vote on paragraphÂ 7, indentÂ 1, on African lions.
I will be voting against that and I will explain why in a moment.
In relation to paragraph 5, I need guidance from the Commission.
It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds.
I understand, and I would like it confirmed, that the proposers â the Australians â have now withdrawn the proposal for a zero quota.
As it stands in our resolution, therefore, it may not make sense.
Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES, Appendix II, full stop.
Others may make the case for reintroducing a zero quota if they wish, but as it stands, it makes no sense.
On the great white shark issue, the Community has generally supported the AppendixÂ II listing, but rejected the zero quota on legal and scientific grounds.
While I support the precautionary principle, I do not support a 'preventionary' principle.
Generally, I believe in rewarding those states that have made tremendous efforts in the area of conservation.
What we do must not dilute the credibility of CITES itself.
Any decisions we take, even as a Parliament, apart from what the Commission and others might decide, must be scientifically grounded to ensure the credibility of CITES.
That is the general thrust of the position we have taken in these areas.
This applies very strongly to the points on the black rhinoceros and the leopard.
The proposal on the African lion is scientifically weak and is strongly opposed by the range states where the lion population is stable or increasing.
I have an open position on this.
I hope that we can find a compromise solution with the range states.
However, we must not erode the credibility of the Convention by supporting scientifically weak proposals on this.
Although it is a free vote, I will be recommending that we vote against, in the hope that a compromise will be found in that area.
In the case of the Irrawaddy dolphin, I recognise that the proposal has some merit.
I am leaning in favour of it, but the scientific and practical doubts remain.
Again, I hope that, on the basis of sound scientific principle and with proper use of the precautionary principle, which is not a 'preventionary' principle, we will be able to look after endangered species as we should.
The rest of the world will follow what the EU-25 does at the Conference of the Parties.
It is not just our 25 votes, but the other votes that we will attract from among the 166 parties voting on these issues.
Â Â  I thank Mr Doyle for elucidating the question and for making a contribution on behalf of his group, even though it meant running slightly over time.
Â Â  . Mr President, the next conference of the parties to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species â CITES â has a very full agenda.
However, I am pleased to inform you that preparations in Council have proceeded smoothly and we have already reached a consensus.
In doing so, our position on some high-profile issues has evolved.
For example, we are now leaning in favour of the proposal to outlaw commercial trade in the Irrawaddy dolphin.
CITES has been in force for nearly 30 years and has proved a very effective tool in reducing the threats to wild fauna and flora posed by unsustainable international trade.
Since its entry into force, other agreements relating to biodiversity have been adopted, most notably the Convention on Biological Diversity.
One of the Community's strategic objectives is to achieve greater synergies between these agreements, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010, as endorsed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
The Community also believes that CITES should remain a vehicle for the sustainable use of wild fauna and flora.
Increased protection is often required to safeguard the conservation status of some species in trade, but we must also acknowledge the efforts of those countries that have already implemented effective conservation measures.
For this reason, we have to consider seriously the proposals for easing trade restrictions on some species, such as the Christmas orchid from Colombia, black and white rhinos, the leopard, and so on.
CITES is a science-based convention, as has already been underlined, and sets out detailed criteria for determining the level of protection that should apply to individual species.
The Community supports this science-based approach and therefore is hesitant about the proposals concerning the African lion and endemic reptiles.
Finally, the Community wishes to maximise the efficiency of CITES by minimising unnecessary administrative burdens.
While we must avoid illegal or unsustainable trade, we should also ensure that parties' resources are directed towards issues of real conservation concern.
Â Â  â Mr President, the resolution on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is an important step in preparation for the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
I agree with its recommendations.
Because the Convention divides protected species into different categories of commercial exploitation, it provides a sufficiently versatile tool for keeping problems in check.
The proposal before us now will in some cases mean protection will be more rigid, while in some cases it will be slacker.
Both of these gestures are appropriate and justified, and they reflect a balanced, scientific perspective.
A few icons of animal protection, such as the classic bald-headed eagle, will be moved from the total-ban category to one of tightly controlled trade.
It may be interpreted as an encouraging sign that the fact that it was an icon proved useful.
Certain protected species have begun to recover.
A sound basis on which to proceed is scientific evidence: the content of the appendices can be made more stringent or more relaxed if the scientific evidence suggests there is a need to make it so.
The all-important issue is not strictness, but sustainable development.
It is nevertheless important that it should be harder to relax the rules than tighten them up.
The reason is that the stakes are very high indeed: we are gambling with nature, which will not be recovered if it is lost.
For that reason it is vital that the precautionary principle is still cited as a basic tenet; this, despite the fact that, to the ears of many of my colleagues and associates, that phrase sounds flat and empty, as the use of the phrase âthe precautionary principleâ has not always meant that the principle has been followed.
Now, however, the phrase is apt.
Although the scope of the CITES Convention is only restricted to trade, perhaps models for further international environmental agreements could also be found by analysing it.
At the same time, we have to remember the concern raised in the resolution and focus more attention on the monitoring of implementation.
The EU is unfortunately one of the largest markets for the illegal trade in wild animals and plants.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Doyle has just said when putting our written question to the Commission, this position statement affects not only the 25 Member States of the European Union, but is also a signal to the remainder of the 166 states that have signed up to CITES, known also as the Washington Agreement on the Protection of Species.
That is what makes it important that we in this House should send out a clear signal.
At present, the Agreement on the Protection of Species applies to some 30Â 000 species.
We know that, beside the destruction of their habitats, international trade is the greatest threat to the survival of many endangered species.
That is what makes CITES necessary, and that is why I have been heartened by many of the positions taken by the Commission, which, at the conference of states party to the Convention, is speaking out loud and clear in favour of strict restrictions on trade.
Mrs Korhola said that she sees it as being very, very important that all decisions should be founded on the precautionary principle.
Discussion of this oral question, and also of todayâs resolution, has been dominated by two issues, one being the protection of minke whales and the other the trade in ivory.
It is no secret that Japan wants to reintroduce commercial whaling and is working towards it.
It did not manage to get its position accepted at the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission in July 2004.
We call on the European Union and its Member States to reject Japanâs demand that three types of minke whales be transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II and hence also to unambiguously retain a higher standard of protection for the whales.
This resolution constitutes a clear demonstration by this House that we welcome the call by Kenya and other African states for the introduction of a 20-year moratorium on trade in ivory.
Between 1980 and 1989, the number of African elephants dropped dramatically, from 1.2 million to 600Â 000 and halved again by 2001 to 300Â 000, a rapid decline explained largely by the demand for ivory.
The former system of quotas for ivory exports from specified countries did not work, as demand is so great that enormous quantities are smuggled out illegally.
For consumers and for those who monitor the trade, the situation is highly confusing, but it is a very agreeable one for those who want to smuggle ivory illegally.
Over and over again, ivory is seized at our European airports because the documentation does not conform to what is required under the Agreement on the Protection of Species.
Supplying, with intent to deceive, false information on customs declarations and CITES approval forms is widespread in the illegal trade in wild animals.
Yesterday, we also started considering the issue of African lions.
My group wants item 7, as it stands in the resolution, to be retained.
It is clear from the information we have about the threat to the African lion that there has been a dramatic reduction in their numbers over recent years, and so I am very glad to see the Commission take up a clear position on the subject.
Â Â  Mr President, as this will probably be the last time that I will speak in a debate on the environment to which Mrs WallstrÃ¶m will respond, I should like to thank her for her commitment and efforts over the past five years.
I am glad she is not going to be leaving us.
Faced with the enormity of problems concerning the environment, she once said that we cannot cry about everything all the time.
That is very true, but, when we consider how we are diminishing life on this planet, it is certainly worth at least some tears.
Virtually no animal on this planet can exist without the agreement of humans.
We are the dominant species.
If animals are to survive, they do so because we allow them to do so, because there is no economic incentive to kill them or because we actively want them to survive.
In nearly all cases, habitats have to be managed and somehow protected.
This is how mankind now manages the natural order.
The pity is that we are terrible managers.
We cannot see beyond the present: we think everything is still there for the taking and need not consider the consequences.
We preside over one of the world's great periods of extinction.
Within a generation we have wiped out a vast proportion of the animals of Africa and now we are doing the same to the seas.
Shark numbers in many cases are said to have dropped by 90% since Spielberg's film 'Jaws' was released.
The great white shark is the ocean's top predator, the lion of the seas.
To lose a creature that has changed very little in tens of millions of years would not only be a tragedy but would further change the ecology of the waters, upsetting a balance already damaged by over-fishing and certainly entailing damaging consequences.
Trade in its parts must be curtailed.
However, the issue of land animals in Africa highlights the complexities involved in securing solutions.
We know there has been a huge loss in elephant numbers, much of which is attributable to poaching.
However, curtailing the ivory trade seems to have been successful in preventing a complete wipe-out.
Yet the picture is mixed: elephant numbers are recovering in some areas, but this causes the destruction of the natural habitat.
As the government of Botswana pointed out in a very well argued paper, numbers have to be managed if the competing demands of people, vegetation and habitats are to be met.
In principle, I have no objection to increasing the trade in ivory selectively, provided that the money raised is for conservation purposes.
For the same reasons I have no objection in principle to trophy hunting, although I cannot understand the mentality of rich people who want to kill great creatures.
My concern is that the money will not be spent in this way and that the increase in the ivory trade will stimulate poaching everywhere, with catastrophic results.
I hope Member States will stand firm and support a total ban, but they should also be realistic and accommodating.
If we in Europe want to deny poor nations the right to sell harvested ivory legitimately and sustainably, should we not be contributing financially to meet our desires and their needs?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that we can congratulate ourselves today, as this House is putting forward a resolution supported by all political groups.
I would very much like all Members to vote for it as it stands.
Our message is of course also directed to the Council, which is not present, and this is a pity as it is the Council which will represent us in Bangkok. We are also inviting the Commission to comply with this resolution, which will reflect the voice of the peoples of Europe during the final votes in Bangkok.
The resolution calls for better protection of endangered species, and follows on from the most forceful measures taken in the fight against the decline of wild fauna and flora.
We are all aware, and it has already been noted by a number of Members, that all possible steps should be taken to support every initiative aimed at saving species which can still be saved, because nature continues to be destroyed at a breathtaking speed.
Having followed the work carried out in this House on an action plan for biodiversity conservation and on the Convention on Biological Diversity, I can state that biodiversity obviously remains the poor relation among our environmental policies.
I would even go so far as to say that this is undoubtedly the weak link of sustainable development.
We are aware that, as the 25 Member States of the European Union, we are the largest consumers of wild species.
MrsÂ Doyle has drawn up a list, and it is truly horrifying; millions of species are taken from their habitats around the world for our pleasure alone, not for our survival but for our pleasure alone.
Legal trade in species is an enormous market.
It is therefore easy to imagine the volume of illegal trade, and indeed some say that its value is equal to that of drug trafficking.
This would explain the problems encountered in implementing more stringent protection measures for certain species.
Be that as it may, we are calling unanimously for the precautionary principle to be adopted as a basic rule for all decisions taken in the framework of CITES.
Let us take as an example the white shark, made famous by the film âJawsâ.
This is a perfect illustration, as we are well aware of how difficult it is to carry out studies on this animal.
Given that this species is endangered, we are therefore calling for a zero quota in the name of the precautionary principle, and this is why we continue to support this proposal.
The 20-year moratorium on all ivory trading proposed by Kenya, and supported by 12 countries which are also home to a large number of African elephants, needs our support.
As the world expert on elephants, Professor Pfeffer, has said for many years, legal trade in an endangered species has the immediate effect of reviving illegal trade in the species.
We know that it is the survival of a species which is at stake, and the 12 African countries concerned have also realised this.
As European countries, we should therefore support this position, and we must also support the transfer of the lion from Appendix 2 to Appendix 1.
Why?
Because, Mr President, we, as Europeans, are going on holiday and hunting the male lion, which contributes to the destruction of this species on a global scale.
It is for all these reasons that we should support these proposals, and I would ask you, Mr President, to allow me to say something on the issue of secrecy, which is an extremely important issue.
We have discussed this issue in committee, and we cannot accept a vote by secret ballot when putting final resolutions to the vote.
Such a practice would leave the door open to all kinds of bargaining, and out of respect for the Member Statesâ commitments and for our own principles, a transparent decision-making process should remain the golden rule in international conventions.
Â Â  Our group has also signed the motion for a resolution, and we think it is a very good resolution, all parts of which we support.
I should, however, like the Commission to clarify the position to be adopted by the EU in these negotiations with regard to two points.
The first concerns the issue of secret ballots.
There is now a debate about not having open votes with due reporting of the way in which countries vote on a number of positions.
I think that, if it is to be possible to demand political accountability, it is absolutely crucial that countries be answerable for the way in which they vote on this convention.
Can we rely upon the EU doing everything in its power to oppose the holding of secret ballots in these votes?
That is my first question.
My second question is a special one concerning the protection of the great white shark.
On this issue, there appears to be a consensus to the effect that a higher level of protection is required, but I believe that, given the uncertainties that exist concerning what stocks remain, the demand for a zero quota for export is extremely sensible on the grounds of the precautionary principle.
I wonder if we can rely upon the EU also supporting the demand for a zero quota for export.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wholeheartedly endorse this resolution.
Our primary goal is the conservation of nature, which in the first place means protection of the environment, in other words, the maintenance of the ecological balance.
Secondarily, it means protecting the diversity of species, which is precious and at risk.
Thirdly, it means protecting animals, both as regards the trade in them, the protection of their natural habitats, and, of course, the ways in which people keep animals.
For that reason, I believe that we have to take a very nuanced approach to the trade in animals, as Mr Davies, for one, has done.
There must of course be restrictions to prevent the extermination of endangered animal species, but there are species that would have disappeared without the trade in animals, without their being bred in zoos, and that would have disappeared had they not been preserved for future generations outside their original areas, which have been ravaged by such things as war, civil strife and natural disasters.
So let me make it abundantly clear that I am in favour of this resolution, whilst believing that this is where we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater; I believe it to be obvious and reasonable that the trade in animals should continue to be engaged in within certain tight and restrictive parameters.
Our zoos are doing great things; our geozoo in Munich, for example, has bred very valuable species that would otherwise have disappeared from the face of the earth.
For that reason, it is crucial that we take a measured approach to this.
When it comes, though, to such things as elephants and the trade in ivory, or the trade in rhinoceros horn and much else, that is where we have to take very tough action; on that I agree absolutely with my fellow Members.
As Mrs Isler BÃ©guin said, it is of course the case that it is in these areas that massive profits are to be made, illegally and with relatively little effort, on the black market.
This is where much more use must be made of Europol.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am a little surprised that we are to debate lion hunting in this Parliament.
That is not something I ever thought would happen to me in an assembly with which I would otherwise have thought I was more or less in agreement.
Lion hunting was, in fact, what was wanted, as a split vote was requested, and we are in actual fact still short of an explanation from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as to its wishes in connection with a species 90% of which has disappeared over the last decade.
A second, and probably just as important, question is one to the Commission as to why it has gone easy on the demand for the protection of freshwater turtles.
The IUCN regards them as threatened, but millions of them are killed each year.
They are used for food and for natural medicine, and this, of course, quite obviously threatens these speciesâ long-term prospects for survival.
If I have been informed correctly, there is nonetheless a proposal by the Commission that nothing special should be done to have them protected, and that is a matter in connection with which we should basically very much like an answer.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say to the Commission and Parliament that I fully support what CITES is doing.
However, I question why the CITES conference is to be held in Bangkok.
In Thailand there is still a lot of illegal trading in orang-utans, monkeys and leopards.
So if the conference is to be held there, we need to question the Thai Government about this problem.
I have seen examples of 50 illegally imported young orang-utans found hidden in cramped cages in private Thai zoos.
In my constituency there is an organisation called Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre which wants to get a particular chimpanzee called Naree out of Thailand, but the Thai Government has not been helpful in this regard.
If the conference is held in Thailand, it is very important for both this Parliament and the Commission to raise these issues with the Thai Government.
We cannot allow this to happen.
We have to highlight it. This is an opportunity to do so.
While I welcome CITES and everything it is trying to do, the fact that the conference is to be held in Thailand will give us an opportunity to raise these issues with the Thai Government, so as to help stop such things happening.
Otherwise this trade might seem to be acceptable because the CITES conference is being held there.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for the debate and MrÂ Davies, in particular, for his kind words in favour of the conservation of the rare species of Swedish Commissioners!
I will comment briefly on some of the questions raised.
Firstly, on the issue of enforcement and information exchange, last week Member States agreed to step up activities in this area.
I should like to tell Mr SjÃ¶stedt that we are totally against secret ballots and I can confirm that we will vote against that.
Mrs Auken mentioned sea turtles.
The Convention accords the strictest protection to sea turtles and we support the proposed protection for freshâwater turtles as well.
The location was decided at the last conference and it will not be changed now.
On the great white shark, Madagascar and Australia have informed us that, in the light of widespread legal and scientific objections, they have amended their proposal, removing the demand for the zero quota.
We can now give this proposal our unqualified support.
Finally, we welcome Parliament's initiative in bringing forward this resolution.
We are pleased that so many of the views expressed on issues such as bush meat, Napoleon fish, minke whale and ramin, are in accordance with the Community consensus.
Ideally, we would have preferred to see a resolution that balances the need for greater protection of some species with the sometimes conflicting considerations of promoting sustainable use and, above all, respecting the scientific integrity of the Convention.
This would be in the best interests of CITES and of nature conservation in general.
Nevertheless, I am pleased that Parliament has prepared a resolution in such a short time and I thank you for the debate.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner and, on behalf of all my fellow Members, I think I can express our universal appreciation of the species of Swedish European Commissioners, who we do not think need specific protection since it is not an endangered species.
At the end of the debate, I received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5).(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(1)
(2)
Â Â  Mr President, I propose adding the following to the end of paragraph 8:
... and to ensure that any such sanctions do not add to the suffering of the population of Sudan.'
Â Â  .Â âÂ Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?
(3)
Â Â  Mr President, before moving on to the vote on the joint motions for resolutions on Iraq signed by five political groups, I would like to point out that there has been an error on the part of the services of the sitting who have omitted three references which were part of the compromise resolution.
Paragraph 1, according to the terms of the agreement between the political groups, should read as follows:
âVigorously condemns all indiscriminate violence, in particular terrorist attacks against the civilian population, religious minorities, police forces or soldiers of the international force, as well as kidnaps, which also affect journalists and staff of NGOs, and the horrendous crimes committed and which still go unpunished; states that everything possible should be done to put an end to these attempts to use violence to undermine the will of the Iraqi Government and the international community to promote the democratic process;â.
Furthermore, as Mr Tajani will point out, the reference to the return of the body of Mr Enzo Baldoni in paragraph 2 has been omitted.
Finally, in paragraph 6, referring to the elections, âwith the full participation of womenâ should be added.
These elements were part of the agreement.
I do not believe they should be included as an oral amendment but as an error on the part of the services of the sitting.
Â Â  I can confirm what Mr Salafranca has just said; the text which has been tabled is the one which Mr Salafranca has just read out.
A mistake has therefore been made by the services concerned.
I see that other Members have asked to speak.
I cannot see any problem with including what you say.
Â Â  Mr President, I was referring precisely to the request to repatriate the body of Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni, provided for in the motion for a resolution.
From what you said, you appear to me to understand that it is unnecessary to table an oral amendment.
Since three other people have been abducted this morning, however, I feel that the text should be brought up to date with todayâs events.
I would therefore like to request the floor to table an oral amendment in this regard, before we vote on paragraph two.
Â Â  You will be able to speak when the time comes, MrÂ Tajani.
I have made a note of this.
Â Â  Mr President, all the points raised by Mr Salafranca are correct.
However, I would like to add another point.
Paragraph three has been submitted in a previous version, whereas it should be replaced with the following wording: âasks the Council Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission to support the initiatives which the interested Member States are taking in this regardâ.
Paragraph three must therefore be amended as well.
Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that it is annoying, but I assure you that we tabled the correct version of the text.
I know that Mr Tajani will ask to table an oral amendment and I can already foresee that we will agree.
Â Â  Â âÂ There is no problem.
A few minor errors have been made, but the texts tabled by the different authors, and these texts alone, are the original versions.
I can provide full reassurance on this point.
We can now move on to considering the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to ask whether paragraph 1, upon which we are about to vote, was originally tabled in English.
The French and English versions differ, and I presume that the text should be based on the English original, which says âthe determination of the Iraqi Governmentâ, and not, as in the French version, âthe determination of the legitimate Iraqi Governmentâ.
Â Â  Â âÂ I have been told that theÂ resolution was indeed tabled in English, so it is the English text which is the original version.
All the other language versions will be brought into line and your request will be complied with.
Â Â  Mr President, as the Members of this House know, this morning in Baghdad three people were abducted from their home, two of whom are US citizens and one a European citizen of British origin.
I propose to the House an oral amendment to paragraph 2 to add, after the reference to the Italian humanitarian workers, Simona Torretta and Simona Pari, the words âand the British citizenâ â followed by his full name â so that the European Parliament can issue a timely call for the release of this other citizen of our Union and guarantee him the support of all the political forces represented within it.
Â Â  Â âÂ Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?
Â Â  Mr President, an issue has arisen overnight concerning paragraph 5 of our resolution.
The original paragraph 5 referred to an 'Australian proposal to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II with a zero quota'.
That was correct on going to print, when all the Groups in this House agreed to the resolution.
However, the Australians have now withdrawn the reference to a zero quota on legal and scientific grounds, as I mentioned when I moved the question and as the Commissioner has confirmed.
It would be very untidy of us as a parliament to vote on a contradictory text in light of this most recent information.
We should not be supporting a reference to a zero quota, which is no longer the Australian position.
May I remind colleagues who support the zero quota â and I know many do â that withdrawal of this section of paragraph 5 today, that is, all the words after 'AppendixÂ II', would not preclude another party to the conference re-tabling the zero quota request, if they wished to do so.
I feel we cannot welcome an Australian proposal which is no longer an Australian proposal on this particular issue.
However, we can welcome the first sentence 'to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II'.
I need your guidance, as I know it is late procedurally, MrÂ President, but we need to be sure that what we do and vote on today makes sense and is factually correct.
Â Â  Mrs Doyle, I must consider your intervention to be an oral amendment.
In order to make it clear to the other Members, could you please state very clearly the text you wish to put to the vote?
Â Â  Mr President, my point is purely procedural. I am not making any statement in relation to zero quotas or otherwise.
I would like to amend paragraph 5 of our text: 'welcomes the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES Appendix II'.
The rest of the text would have to be deleted because the Australians have removed it from their proposal, although that will not preclude others retabling it at the Conference of the Parties, if necessary.
Â Â  Â âÂ That is clear.
Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?
Â Â  We do not consider this report to be an issue for the European Parliament and have therefore chosen to abstain in the vote.
Â Â  The NATO and EU war against Yugoslavia was unjust and offensive and violated international law and the founding principles of the UN.
It resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people, tremendous damage and the imposition of occupation on Kosovo and was the climax of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the imperialist intervention in the Balkans.
Those who should be tried for crimes against humanity are the leaders of NATO who attacked an independent member of the UN.
The Council regulation brought before the European Parliament for voting today is part of the effort to legalise this American-inspired 'court', which is a parody, as proven by the constant infringements of Milosevic's rights.
It is clear as the case proceeds that foregone conclusions riddled with holes have been reached in a bid to conceal and expiate the real culprits.
The rulings by what is referred to as the 'International Criminal Tribunal' are not accepted by the people, who alone have the authority to judge their leaders and sentence any defendants.
This parody must be stopped, the so-called court disbanded and Slobodan Milosevic freed.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of Parliamentâs draft resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation imposing certain restrictive measures in support of effective implementation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), because this is a matter of adopting measures relating to defendants who have yet to be captured and who continue to escape justice.
These measures are specifically intended to prevent them from travelling and from using their own personal effects.
My vote in favour is also based on the fact that it is a joint action between the United Nations and EU Member States, by means of applying the specific Treaty provision.
Â Â  . British Conservatives recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges to be faced by our generation and those that will follow us.
Whilst we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which temperatures will rise, we can be certain that the risk of abrupt climate change exists.
If we are serious about tackling man-made climate change then we must be serious about reducing global aviation emissions, which are expected to double by 2020.
That is why we support action to include aviation in a global emissions trading scheme.
If the global authorities will not act, then the EU must be free to introduce its own scheme.
We have severe reservations as to the effectiveness of fuel and emissions taxes.
These would have a negligible effect on demand for most air travel, but would have a disproportionate effect on the budget airline sector.
It is unlikely that the proceeds of such taxes would be used to mitigate the effect of the emissions, leaving such schemes as nothing more than revenue-raising exercises.
Nor do we believe that the Commission needs a seat on the ICAO Assembly.
Â Â  .
The coordinator of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Georg Jarzembowski, makes the following statement, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to the meeting of the ICAO:
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will abstain in the vote on the joint resolution, as the resolutionâs demands are too indiscriminate and as the pressure of time has prevented a nuanced debate, such as these matters require, on these demands with the Member States represented at the ICAO and with the industry and consumers affected.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is firmly of the opinion that further steps to reduce damage to the environment, including that caused by air transport, are necessary at both global and European level.
At the same time, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the potential side effects of such steps must be carefully discussed with the industry and consumers concerned.
It will also be necessary to take into account the extremely grave economic damage already sustained by European airlines as a consequence of the events of â9/11â and the drastic rise in the price of oil.
Hasty reactions by Parliament do not do justice to the seriousness of these issues.
Â Â  . Aviation has long been a privileged industry.
Old international agreements prevent the taxes imposed on transport on the ground from being levied on aviation.
At the time, that was a way of affording a new, up-and-coming, yet economically still weak form of international transport a chance of survival.
Since then, this situation has been turned on its head.
Air traffic is growing exponentially, the old airline companies are being elbowed out by cut-price operators, noise pollution is making those living in the vicinity of the ever growing airports ill, global warming is continuing and international rail traffic is being competed out of the market.
Society must now be protected against this increasing growth in aviation, and this will certainly not happen as long as aviation retains an artificial competitive edge.
In order to limit the environmental damage, to pay for the costs of pollution caused by aviation and protect other modes of transport, normal taxes should be imposed on air traffic.
That is why any decision taken at world level and leading to the maintenance of the ban on taxes or prejudicing the reduction in pollution is unacceptable.
It is astonishing that, on 1 September in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the largest group opposed, as it is doing now, a resolution intended to put a stop to the United Statesâ attempts at giving aviation permanently preferential treatment.
Â Â  .
I abstained on the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the 35th session of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) Assembly of 28Â September to 8Â October 2004.
By voting this way, I wished to express my opinion that Parliament must not meddle in the affairs of the ICAO Assembly before the session gets underway and, what is more, must not adopt positions on matters that, as far as I can tell, are simply proposals for amending a resolution that is to be debated at that Assembly.
In spite of the fact that this issue is worthy of our attention, the actual text approved by a majority in Parliament provides the basis for our position, given that it acknowledges (NoÂ 3) that the Commission should have a seat at the ICAO Assembly.
In any event, if it does not have that seat, Parliament has no reason to meddle in this matter.
Â Â  .
I share the environmental concerns of those tabling the motion for a resolution.
I feel that the EUâs relevant institutions should launch an environmental impact study on civil aviation and look into ways in which it can be reduced.
Nonetheless, I had to abstain.
The hasty manner in which the resolution has been tabled removes objectivity from an issue that, in view of its seriousness and its importance to the ordinary citizen, requires close scrutiny by, among others, the transport and environment committees.
Â Â  . â In the run-up to the elections and the referendum, the European Parliament is passing a resolution which is a continuation of the pressure on and coercion of the Government of Belarus and which, unfortunately, is endorsed by all the political groups.
What touches the selective sensibilities of the ÎU, which interprets existent and non-existent infringements of human rights as it pleases, is that Belarus has not come running on bended knee to ÎÎÎ€Î, the ÎU or the other imperialist organisations and refuses to sell off its wealth-producing resources to European and American monopolies.
Why has the European Parliament not turned its attention to rising fascism in the Baltic States, as Belarus did when it tabled a resolution on the subject before the UN?
Why does it maintain absolute silence and not denounce the governments of Member States of the ÎU, the USA, Australia, Japan and so on who voted against it?
The people of Belarus alone have the authority to decide on their future.
Resolutions such as this are underhand and are designed to mislead and confuse the workers and interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus in order to alter the political will of its people.
That is why we are voting against the resolution.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Parliamentâs resolution on the situation in Belarus, although I feel that in resolutions such as these there is always a thin line between, on the one hand, the need â the legitimate need â to put international pressure on States and governments that violate democratic principles and the rule of law, and, on the other, interference in a countryâs internal affairs, which is a much more delicate issue.
In view of the fact that Belarus is covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is aimed at increased cooperation with the EU and that serious breaches have taken place of the rights, freedoms and safeguards that are an integral part of the democratic rule of law, the EU and, more specifically, Parliament â in conjunction with the United Nations Committee on Human Rights â must take initiatives such as this one that are geared towards encouraging democratic progress in Belarus and free and fair elections on 17Â October.
Â Â  .
As the date of parliamentary elections in Belarus approaches, indications are growing that there has been an alarming rise in the illegal repression and restriction of rights, freedoms and safeguards in that country.
The referendum on the Constitution scheduled for the same date, which seeks to repeal the article limiting the number of consecutive presidential terms, has taken on worrying plebiscite characteristics.
Since Parliament naturally advocates strengthening stability, freedom and security in the country, it has been paying careful attention to political developments in Belarus.
The EU must not let this attention waver and must keep up the pressure on the Belarus authorities to encourage real change that goes beyond mere legal formality and that real changes are made that improve peopleâs standard of living, effectively promote democracy and enable the citizens to enjoy full political self-determination.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution further to the Council and Commission statements pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure on behalf of the Committee on Development on the Darfur region in the Sudan, and the reports presented to us by the Members of this House who were in Parliamentâs delegation to the region between 2 and 7Â September.
Accordingly, whatever the reasons behind the genuine ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Darfur, we have an obligation to condemn acts against civilians that have already led to over 30Â 000 dead, 1Â million persons displaced in Sudan and more than 200Â 000 refugees in Chad.
We must also condemn the Sudanese Government politically, not only for supporting attacks on civilians and violating the ceasefire agreement, but also for pursuing a policy of underdevelopment and economic marginalisation in the areas affected by the conflict.
This is what I wished to express through my vote.
Â Â  .
I have followed the news from Darfur with great concern.
I feel that this is an opportunity for Parliament to set an example and to demand that the EUâs other institutions follow suit by keeping up their condemnation of the atrocities and seeking solutions to the conflict.
We must be unequivocal in our condemnation of these outrages and must ensure that the mobilisation of peacekeeping resources goes beyond mere rhetoric.
We must not let up in the efforts already under way, which have already begun to achieve such good results.
As in Bosnia, Rwanda and Burundi, and many others, it is difficult to conceive of the whole drama of yet more mass deaths, not to mention genocide, which we invariably say will be the last.
The EU must, in my view, maintain the pressure on the Sudanese Government and on those responsible for the conflict, to ensure that the ceasefire, signed as a result of that pressure, is strictly observed.
The EU, which claims to be a global player, has a golden opportunity to ensure that people do not forget what is happening in Darfur and that those responsible do not go unpunished.
Apart from Amendment No 12, I voted in favour of the amendments, which have improved upon the Committee on Developmentâs initial proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, last night I fell asleep thinking about the explanation of vote on Iraq and I found myself in the midst of the damned in hell, among whom I spotted Bin Laden, with his beard burning constantly, as in Danteâs inferno.
In the dream I asked him: âWhy did you hate us Europeans and Americans so much?â
Bin Laden, his beard still burning, replied: âI was very ill and I asked the social security authorities in Saudi Arabia for an invalidity pension, but they didnât give it to me.
That is why I was so angry with the whole world.â
Well then, let us give this invalidity pension to Bin Laden, so at least he will leave us all in peace and tranquillity!
Â Â  Mr President, the Lega Nord delegationâs abstention on the motion for a resolution on Iraq is clearly connected to its wish to express, as we already have done at every stage, our complete solidarity with the two peace and voluntary humanitarian workers, so sadly caught up in the tragedy in Iraq.
We would, however, like to distance ourselves from the underestimation of the risks run by the free world in taking as true the false and hypocritical humanitarian declarations of support from spurious moderate Islam.
It is pitiful to see Europe and the West believe the words of those who arm terrorists, who finance terrorist networks and who today say they support the release of the hostages.
Europe and the West must maintain a clear and firm policy of condemnation and refusal to collaborate with those who encourage terrorist networks.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats have decided to abstain from voting on a number of amendments.
The purpose of this is to ensure that there is a common and vigorous resolution by the European Parliament.
Â Â  . I support this resolution on Iraq, the primary purpose of which is to voice our concerns for the welfare of hostages and to demand that everything possible be done to secure their early release.
I deplore the fact that the resolution does not reflect the concerns of our citizens at the unlawful killing of Iraqis by the occupation forces.
It does not address the question of how the current situation in Iraq evolved over the last two years and therefore fails to criticise the Bush Administration's defiance of the UN in its rush to invade Iraq.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has correctly described that invasion as an illegal act contravening the UN Charter.
That question cannot be shelved.
Therefore, it is particularly important that the Committee on Foreign Affairs urgently draw up, as recommended, a comprehensive report on the situation in Iraq, taking into account the consequences of the war and all problems relating to the withdrawal of the illegally occupying forces, rehabilitation, reconstruction and stabilisation in that country.
Â Â  . I totally support the European Parliament in condemning in the strongest terms the abductions of hostages in Iraq and in demanding their immediate release.
I support paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution to this effect.
However, I cannot vote for this joint resolution as a whole as it seeks to justify the illegal and unjust war and the occupation of Iraq.
Â Â  . The destruction of the Baath regime, the only secular political force in Iraq, was a criminal mistake.
Today Iraq is in the hands of small and uncontrolled Islamic groups.
Since Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot were taken hostage, France has also been dragged into the quagmire in Iraq.
The kidnappers of the French hostages are not demanding the withdrawal of troops, because the French Government refused to take part in the war.
The terrorists, who belong to the âIslamic Army in Iraqâ, want more.
By ordering France to reconsider one of its laws, they are demanding that our country relinquish the free exercise of its sovereignty.
This demand has been made because they believe that our country, which is home to six million Muslims, should subjugate its laws to those of the Sharia.
This is the result of 40 years of massive and uncontrolled immigration.
The negotiations conducted by members of the French Council for the Muslim Faith with Iraqi Islamic leaders, which have been given extensive media coverage, are further proof of this process of dhimmitude.
Mr Chirac and Mr Raffarin, who refuse to recognise Franceâs Christian roots under the pretext of secularism, have sent members of Islamic associations to act as ambassadors.
Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot are victims of a different hostage taking; that of France by its immigration policy.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this resolution, in particular its emphasis on maximising the European Union's involvement and in seeking the unconditional, safe return of French, Italian and other hostages.
We accept the gravity of the security situation in Iraq but believe it unhelpful to use the wording 'a majority of the Iraqi population' in Amendment 1.
A transfer of coalition troops or, indeed, a complete withdrawal is unrealistic and risks worsening an already bad situation.
Whilst we accept that the House is divided on the legal questions, we appeal for unity in looking forward, not back, working together for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction in a democratic Iraq.
Â Â  .
At the beginning of 2003, a majority in this Parliament was opposed to the plan for a pre-emptive war in Iraq.
Meanwhile, it has been proven that the argument for this war, the possession of weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Husseinâs regime, was unfounded.
Thanks to the intervention by the United States and its allies in Europe, Iraq has been turned into a breeding ground for fundamentalist Islamic resistance.
There is now an overriding fear among politicians in Europe of the effects of the occupying forces withdrawing their troops.
With or without immediate withdrawal, it is becoming urgent for Europe to disassociate from the American positions in Iraq.
The United States is looking for oil, orders for US companies and the replacement of the euro by dollars for international contracts.
It is failing to restore power stations, water purification plants, schools and hospitals.
Europe can take over this civil task and contribute to free elections by giving others, other than the conservative-religious forces and US satellites, a fair chance, such as the communists and the Kurdish parties in the north.
As long as there are European forces, it should be clear that they limit their mandate to this, and will leave as soon as the Iraqi population asks them to.
Whilst I object to a resolution which does not call for this, I obviously support the release of hostages, even if the chance of this happening is slim for as long as we cannot offer the Iraqi people any prospect for improvement.
Â Â  . â We denounce this joint motion, which is a provocation to people the world over who are against the unjust imperialist war in Iraq and are fighting for peace.
The political powers which endorse the resolution accept and support the occupying forces of Iraq, fighting and are cooperating with the occupying government and call the resistance of the Iraqi people to the occupying forces and the collaborationist government terrorism.
The European Parliament is turning into a 'crime laundry', confirming the imperialist nature of the ÎU and its identification with the USA.
On the pretext of freeing hostages, with references to a so-called democratic, independent Iraq, it is helping to create the conditions needed in order for the EU to qualify for a share of the imperialist spoils and in order to secure the interests of big business in the wider area, control wealth-producing resources and oil routes and exploit the people.
The only people with the authority to resolve the political problem are the Iraqis themselves.
The people, and the people of Europe, are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all the occupying forces, which must compensate the Iraqi people for their crimes and for the destruction which they have caused.
The powers which endorse the resolution have opposed the general demand by voting down the amendment calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces and again supporting the war.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of Parliamentâs resolution on Iraq, because I feel that Europe should set a firm example in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians, the police, soldiers from the multinational force and civilian hostages.
Parliament must use all of its political influence and weight to obtain the hostagesâ immediate release.
We must also support the interim governmentâs plans to press ahead with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005, which will enable Iraqis to proceed along the road towards democracy and towards dismantling the terrorist networks operating in their country.
Parliament must, therefore, not waver in the face of the complex nature of these times.
We must remain firm within our societies, our alliances must remain solid and loyal and, most importantly, our actions must form part of a concerted struggle for the peace, stability and prosperity to which Iraq and the Iraqi people are unquestionably entitled.
Â Â  .
This is an enormously significant resolution, which has marked out clear boundaries.
The joint motion demonstrates a consensus between the right and the social democrats, which cannot go unmentioned.
On what is this consensus based?
It is based on acknowledging the Iraqi peopleâs resistance to terrorism (which exists, which we condemn, but which is not exclusive ... of others).
It is based on transforming the dramatic situation of the victims and the journalists and volunteers who have lost their lives or have been taken hostage and not as a consequence of the invasion and the occupation.
It is based on attempting to bring under the UN umbrella, in the near future, something that was done on the margins and against the UN and international law.
The amendments tabled by the Green Group would widen the consensus to the point where we would be the only ones on the outside, and the fact that amendments tabled by our group were not approved appear to provide further evidence that we would be isolated on this crucial question.
We do not feel that we are so isolated.
We know that we are with those who reject the illegal and unjust nature of the war, the invasion and the occupation that were perpetrated.
We are with those who resist and with those who demand the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces.
Similarly, it is the people who are against war and in favour of peace that are with us.
Â Â  .
I have been following the developments in Iraq with alarm and, specifically, the difficulties experienced in stabilising the country democratically following the fall of Saddam Husseinâs dictatorial regime.
The frequent hostage taking and murder of Iraqis and foreigners, which presents a challenge to the international community and to the Iraqi Interim Government, cruelly reflects how much remains to be done in the country.
The European Union must bring to bear its experience in helping transitional situations and humanitarian emergencies, and must continue to support efforts towards transition, which will hopefully bring to a conclusion the ongoing process of returning self-determination to the Iraqi people and of the emergence of democracy in Iraq.
The additional contribution proposed by the Commission, which I welcome, is a sign of this commitment.
I regret that the UN has not yet managed to take on all of its functions in Iraq and I hope that the Security Council continues to support the Interim Government, which it has already underlined by formally recognising its sovereign status.
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution, which I feel is well balanced.
I regret the amendments tabled by the Communists and by the Greens, which are tantamount to demagogy and to a lack of understanding of the situation.
Fortunately they were rejected.
Â Â  . I fully support this resolution, which calls for the use of the precautionary principle as the leading principle for decisions on CITES working documents and listing proposals.
History has shown that large-scale commercial hunting and sale of wild animals frequently pushes species to the brink of extinction.
The trade in wild animal meat for human consumption is just one part of a wildlife trade which includes ivory, fur and the trade in certain animal body parts â a trade which threatens biodiversity and the ecological balance of areas such as Central and West Africa.
It is clear that there is a close link between poverty, economic and social development, and bush meat consumption.
That is why the issue must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviation.
At a national level, EU governments must ensure that their development aid policies are âconservation-auditedâ to support biodiversity and habitat retention.
Â Â  .
Wildlife preservation has been attracting the attention of the EU and, more specifically, Parliament.
The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the main legal instrument in the world for defending and protecting wild fauna and flora.
There is a greater need today for Member States to work together and exchange information, in order, among other things, to confront the international crime that feeds this trade.
Externally, I feel that the EU could have an important role to play in establishing means of stable cooperation with third countries, by seeking to develop initiatives aimed at protecting endangered species and encouraging biodiversity.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . â We are voting against the resolution on the situation in Vojvodina, which we see as an attempt to create particularly dangerous conditions in order to pave the way for further gratuitous imperialist intervention in the long-suffering area of the Balkans.
The increase in the number of clashes and the grave-robbing and racist graffiti, which we denounce whatever their origin, are becoming the pretext for launching accusations and open threats in Serbia-Montenegro and for creating a climate of escalation.
The decisions about EU peace missions in the area are the climax so far of interventionist action by the EU in Vojvodina and constitute a direct threat of possible military intervention due to the presence of EU military forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FYROM and the presence of occupying forces in Kosovo.
We cannot tolerate and we denounce both the efforts to mislead public opinion, as some would wish, and the EU's blatant intention to confirm the threatening and aggressive role of the European army once again in Vojvodina.
Â Â  .Â âÂ That concludes the explanations of vote.
(4)
Â Â  The next item is the topical and urgent debate.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions presented by:
â Glenys Kinnock, Mauro Zani and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/ASEM (B6-0046/2004);
â Vittorio Emanuele Agnoletto, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Myanmar and the forthcoming ASEM Summit (B6-0048/2004);
â Nirj Deva, Bernd Posselt, Charles Tannock and Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the ASEM Summit (Asia-Europe Meeting) (B6-0056/2004);
â Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on Myanmar (ASEM Summit) (B6-0059/2004);
â Frithjof Schmidt, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Myanmar and the ASEM Summit (B6-0061/2004).
Â Â  Mr President, we in the PSE Group attach great importance to relations between the European Union and the countries of Asia.
There are economic and commercial reasons for this, but there is also the essential need for political cooperation in order to create a world order of peace and stability.
It is essential that our Asian partners see us as an economic, industrial, scientific and cultural power, but also that they appreciate our process of continental integration and the democratic values and solidarity on which this process is based.
We are concerned about the announcement that the Government of Myanmar has been invited to the Asia-Europe Summit to be held in Hanoi.
We do not believe this invitation to be appropriate.
The European Union must continue to isolate the Rangoon regime, making clear to its neighbours that we condemn it as one of the most horrendous regimes in Asia and in the whole world.
The military dictatorship established by General Ne Win has been perpetuated by his successors, suffocating the libertarian efforts of Burmese democrats through suffering and terror.
For those of us who know and love Burma, the sadness and indignation is all the greater since we know that it was once, with social democratic inspired governments, an example of openness, freedom and democracy, tolerance, co-existence and integration of numerous ethnic groups and, what is more, of social progress.
All of this was destroyed by the perpetrators of the military coup, the creators of a totalitarian and corrupt regime which has left its country in ruins, its leaders growing rich while its citizens live in misery and turning Myanmar into a significant player in the international drugs trade.
The European Union must contribute to marginalising that regime, demanding freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and other prisoners of conscience, and the participation of political parties in any democratically oriented process.
However much Rangoon tries to cover it up, that is the situation in Myanmar, where totalitarianism, corruption and the abuse of those people we could once trust to promote openness continue to reign.
By excluding that regime from the Hanoi Summit, the European Union will be doing what is right, but furthermore our determination and consistency will consolidate our credibility in the eyes of our Asian partners and certainly in the eyes of the people of Myanmar.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to ask whether we were going to benefit from the presence of the presidency of the Council this afternoon, because the remarks that I want to make â and which I am sure many of my colleagues will be making â are in fact directed at the Council.
It is a great shame that the Council is not here.
