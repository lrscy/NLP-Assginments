Ozone in ambient air
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0187/2001) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on relating to ozone in ambient air [13114/1/2000 - C5Â­0090/2001 - 1999/0068(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Davies).
Mr President, a friend who used to work for a leading wildlife conservation NGO tells me that it was a depressing experience each morning to read her e-mails detailing the loss of habitats and new threats to the survival of species across the world.
I can understand that.
So it is a pleasure to acknowledge that not every environmental problem is beyond resolution and that, in some instances as least, we are capable of turning the tide.
Such is the case with air pollution.
The evidence is that now, at least in some cities and towns across Europe, the air we breathe is perhaps purer than at any time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Problems remain.
It is claimed that air pollution still contributes to more premature deaths than traffic accidents, but progress is being made.
Ground-level ozone is a pollutant which still severely affects the health of many of our citizens.
It contributes to problems of asthma in children - now said to affect as many as one in ten children in the United Kingdom alone - and to breathing difficulties in the elderly.
In severe circumstances people die.
Government studies in my country suggest that ozone may lead to the premature death of 12 500 people each year.
We are all well aware of the problems experienced in some cities in Europe, such as Athens, where the problem is intensified by particular climatic conditions.
Pollution has further economic consequences, by reducing crop yields and damaging trees.
European legislation plays an increasing role in setting tighter standards and curbing pollution.
Nothing better illustrates this than the need for concerted action on ozone.
It is created by a chemical reaction between sunlight and oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds derived mostly from vehicle emissions and petrol distribution.
It is often formed miles from the source of the problem.
So it is a classic trans-boundary pollutant requiring trans-boundary action at European level.
The national emissions ceiling directive will provide the framework for reductions in key air pollutants.
This directive concerns the action which Member States should take locally to deal with the particular problem of ozone.
At first reading I welcomed the Commission's proposals to set a target value encouraging Member States not to permit ozone to exceed the World Health Organisation's guidelines of more than 20 days a year; to alert the public if local health risks are high; and to compare the performance of different countries.
But I argued that the proposals were not demanding enough.
Parliament has made a number of changes and, of the 19 amendments we agreed on, the Council has accepted ten of the minor ones in full and another four in part.
The Council has also decided that it wants the target for the maximum number of exceedances to be 25 rather than 20 days.
This does not sound too bad a compromise.
Perhaps I am just a bit cynical in suggesting that it is too easy for ministers to agree tough targets which are not legally binding.
Parliament should be taking steps now to ensure that the final shape of the legislation places firm obligations on Member States to achieve the objectives they claim they want to achieve.
I want Member States to be required to meet the target, save where it is physically impossible for them to do so.
I want them to work towards a date by which the long-term objective of never having ozone levels exceeding WHO guidelines will be achieved.
I want them quickly to implement short-term action plans if ozone levels exceed double the WHO recommendations, and I want them to provide the Commission with information of a standard which enables comparison to be made between the performance of different Member States, so that the public can determine which countries are making a real effort and which are not.
In saying this, I recognise the need to take into account the fact that one country may not be responsible for the pollution which affects it.
I also understand that meteorological conditions vary.
The north west of England, for example, may generate more traffic fumes than many places elsewhere in Europe but, because we are not blessed with too much sunlight, ozone is less of a problem to us than it may be in Spain.
I do not wish, in particular, to place too onerous a burden upon Mediterranean countries.
But Parliament needs to adopt a strong position now, in order that the final agreement we reach with the Council reflects the need for Member States to take some real action.
I thank colleagues in other parties for working with me to try and ensure that Parliament's position commands a large majority.
I thank Parliament's staff and, in particular, my assistant, Vikki Phillips, who has made a very considerable contribution to this process over the past year.
We have an opportunity to make a contribution to the process of reducing pollution and cleaning the air we breathe.
I hope Parliament will give its support to the proposals in this report and the compromises agreed between the political parties, and that we play our part in achieving what could be another success story for the European environment.
Commissioner, the concentrations of ozone in the atmosphere are a serious problem, not only in terms of the environment, but also in terms of public health, since they affect that health of the citizens, especially amongst risk populations such as children and old people, causing allergies and cardio-respiratory difficulties, amongst other things.
Concentrations of ozone are very unevenly distributed amongst the Member States.
And, owing to their cross-border nature, they affect places which are often far from their source of production.
Until now, the Member States have neither studied nor dealt with this phenomenon sufficiently, neither have they assessed it in a systematic and coordinated way.
The result has been an absence of reliable and comparable data, as well as insufficiency in short- and long-term action plans.
It is therefore very necessary that we adopt the present Directive and I take a very positive view of Mr Davies' s work, especially his approach to the problem, since he stresses the aspects of study and control and is prepared to incorporate the suggestions of other groups, which means the House is able to vote on a proposal with significant compromise amendments, which enrich the Commission' s proposal and maintain the sense of reality and viability of the measures proposed.
The first important result of this Directive is that it is finally going to persuade Member States to pay more attention to the problem of tropospheric ozone, strengthening its study and control; secondly, it makes it obligatory to create short- and long-term action plans and improve rapid alert systems and public information.
In this respect, its seems to me important that these plans strengthen, in each case, the study of the local conditions in which the concentrations are produced, in order thereby to combat them more effectively.
I also believe it is necessary to set target dates in order to stimulate progress on the control of the problem.
Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the current difficulties in guaranteeing the complete control of the concentrations of tropospheric ozone and strict compliance at all times with the values and timescales laid down.
Our Group has therefore insisted on the need to seek formulae which, while strengthening the Member States' obligations, set realistic objectives and timescales, which allow a certain flexibility in those cases where its has been physically impossible to reach the objectives and which take account, in the comparative reports, of the meteorological and local circumstances of the places where the target values have been exceeded.
We have logically opposed the amendments which do not take account of the scientific possibilities of controlling the problem.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Davies for the splendid and very expert job he has done on the report.
Together with Mrs Myller' s report on national emissions ceilings, which is before the Conciliation Committee at the moment, this report will make an important contribution to securing better air quality, especially in the big cities of Europe.
It will be an important contribution to preventing and reducing ozone' s harmful effects on the environment and public health.
I should like to point out the most important features of Mr Davies's report.
First and foremost, it is important that we stick to the WHO's health targets in this area and that those exceedances of these targets that are to be accepted for a number of years are limited as far as possible, in this case to 20 days per year.
By means of the report, we shall thus also reject the Council' s wish to be given the option of longer exceedance periods.
Secondly, I would draw your attention to the long-term targets for the concentration of ozone in the air.
We now have a deadline for when the long-term targets are to be achieved, namely before 2020, except in cases where it is physically impossible to achieve the targets.
It will be an important task for both the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the compromise made here concerning what is physically impossible does not in reality become a pretext for doing nothing and to ensure that there is not too much elasticity in the compromise.
I would also point out how important it is for information to be given both to the general population and, in particular, to the especially vulnerable population groups too, namely children and the elderly.
The report requires that information be provided and that action plans be devised so that rapid intervention is possible if the concentration of ozone is too high.
Allow me, finally, also to indicate two other areas included by Mr Davies.
The first is the relationship with the applicant countries.
I think it is right that we should try to involve the applicant countries as early as possible in this process, as recommended also by those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Ozone pollution is, of course, clearly transboundary in character, a fact which justifies our including as many neighbouring countries as we possibly can from the beginning.
Finally, the reporting, which Mr Davies also emphasised in his speech here today, is important if we are to have comparisons not only of initiatives taken in the Member States but also of exceedances which, as a matter of actual fact, occur in the Member States.
I believe that, with the adoption of this report, we shall be taking a considerable step forward and acquiring a sound basis for the further negotiations with the Commission and the Council in the Conciliation Committee.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Davies has drafted a sterling report on summer smog.
My group is able to support all the amendments.
We should also like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo for supporting the compromise amendments.
The Council of Environment Ministers only wishes to provide an interim solution to the problem of summer smog by 2010.
It refuses to go any further.
We do want to go further. My group and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy propose to consign summer smog to the past by 2020.
That can be done by completely eliminating the polluting substance NOx, firstly by introducing the second generation of catalytic converters, which will be compulsory in new cars in 2005 and in new lorries in 2007, then by introducing fuel cells for buildings, homes and vehicles.
Finally, I should like to ask the Commission once again where the proposal is for a directive on volatile organic substances for paints.
After all, the level of volatile organic substances has to come down as well in order to eliminate summer smog altogether.
We shall adjourn the debate here and resume it at 3 p.m.
Mr von Wogau, we will take good note of your comments.
However, according to my current information, which I will verify, the committee on conflict of competences - which is the body you are referring to, made up of three Vice-Presidents - adopted a proposed decision which was ratified by the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups in its meeting last Thursday.
This is the procedure contained in our Rules of Procedure.
Without getting into the argument of whether or not this proposed decision is the most desirable one, it is the one which has allowed us to resolve it in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
But we will verify whether the information I have been given is up to date.

(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0183/2001) by Mrs Klamt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings [COM(2000) 854 - C5-0042/2001 - 2001/0024(CNS)]
Before the vote:President.
Mr Pirker has the floor for a point of order.
Pirker (PPE-DE).
(DE) Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to point out that the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence on a day when very important subjects are on the agenda for debate and votes are scheduled on important documents such as the Klamt report which is before us now and which relates to a framework decision on the elimination of trafficking in human beings.
The reason I requested the floor is that the opinion of Parliament has been sought on this framework decision.
The rapporteur had also received a personal assurance that the Council would not act until Parliament had delivered its opinion.
It has no option in any case, because Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union states that the Council shall consult the European Parliament before adopting any measure.
The Council, however, has already discussed this matter and took its decision on 28 May, reaching agreement on all but one point.
So to all intents and purposes, the Council has already decided on this matter, even though we were unable to debate this issue until yesterday and although we are not yet in a position to present the Council with our decision in the form of a corrigendum.
This means that it is the duty of our Parliament to protest in the strongest possible terms, which I wish to do herewith, firstly because the Council went back on its word and secondly because it infringed Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which it has done repeatedly.
We in the European People' s Party reserve the right to take further action, but we expect the Council to answer our charge and explain its absolutely unacceptable behaviour, informing the European Parliament why it not only violated the Treaty but also showed contempt for the work of Parliament.
Mr President, it is clear why our Group is going to vote in favour of the Klamt report and is not going to support its withdrawal.
Yesterday I had a dream in this chamber: in the European Union there was a single executive, which was the Commission, and a single legislative body, which was Parliament, and Mr Vitorino woke me up from this dream during his last speech, by reminding me that the absent party did in fact exist.
And not only did it exist, but it had also already adopted the majority of what we were discussing.
Since I do not want them to have the excuse that they have not received Parliament' s opinion, we are going to vote in favour of the Klamt report, but I would ask the Council at least to show the minimum of loyalty.
Thank you, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
With regard to the absence of the Council, you already know - I do not know if it is coincidental that it happens under my Presidency - that the Council is profoundly allergic to debates and votes on issues relating to freedoms.
It is an illness that recurs on a regular basis.
With regard to Mr Pirker' s comment, I believe that his protest is absolutely justifiable and the Presidency will pass it on to the Council in the correct manner.

Report (A5-0191/2001) by Mrs DybkjÃŠr, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on information and communication technologies (ICT) and the developing countries (2000/2327(INI)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0122/2001) by Mr Aparicio SÃ¡nchez, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 on the export of cultural goods and Council Directive 93/7/EEC on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State [COM(2000) 325 - C5-0509/2000 - 2000/2246(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Whitehead report (A5-0198/2001)
Mr President, I would like to welcome my mother, my sister and my wife who are sitting in the public gallery. They have, at last, visited me in Strasbourg and they supplied the cue for my first explanation of vote when they told me it was lunchtime.
'We can smell Italian food,' they said, 'we can smell Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, Parma ham and steaming spaghetti.
So you are talking about a European Food Authority? Well, where else to locate the European Food Authority but Parma?'
I was therefore delighted to vote in favour.
Mr President, I actually wanted to express my regret today that the House did not pronounce itself in favour of any provision for the needs of small businesses from the domains of primary production, processing and marketing in the general principles and requirements of food safety.
The traceability of primary products at the processing and marketing stages is of extreme importance to consumers and farmers, and I can only keep re-emphasising this point.
Let me suggest, however, that consideration of the relative size of businesses is indispensable and that small businesses cannot be treated in the same way as multinational food corporations.
Moreover, I also find it regrettable, Mr President, that there are no derogations from these provisions for farming businesses which produce their own livestock feed.
I very much welcome the extended application of the precautionary principle to food and feed imports into the EU as a contribution to better consumer protection.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of our own food authority is an essential signal to consumers, whose confidence in food products has been badly shaken in recent times.
Not only the Commission but every Member State too must have the legal power to appeal directly to the new authority.
That is logical.
The European Food Authority must operate independently of the Commission, so that it can intervene as quickly as possible in any crisis.
We have great expectations of this authority, and we want it to be staffed by independent experts who can offer the politicians a scientific basis that will enable them to make the right decisions and fully restore consumer confidence.
The official objective of the Commission' s proposal on the European Food Authority is to improve the prevention of crises such as mad cow disease.
In reality, however, we are watching the creation of a perfectly deliberate system intended to hinder those Member States who would like to use their own powers of national safeguard in the case of a public-health crisis (as France did at the end of 1999, when, to the chagrin of the Commission, it continued to maintain its unilateral embargo on British beef), and in so doing to preserve as much as possible the sacrosanct free circulation of products.
Although the only objective of the new European body is to give scientific opinions to the Community institutions and to Member States, it is obvious that it will circumvent or neutralise the opinions of national food-safety agencies, such as the AFSSA in France, so as to prevent governments from having a legitimate reason to base their decisions on those agencies.
The new body is to be governed by a management board composed of 16 members, four of whom will be appointed by the European Parliament, four by the Council, four by the Commission and the other four acting as representatives of consumers and the industry, and appointed by the Commission (Article 24).
Half of the members are thus appointed by the Commission, and all of them are appointed by the European institutions.
None of them are appointed by the national food-safety agencies, which would have been essential if everyone was supposed to be working together as a network, but obviously that was never the intention.
In order to sew things up even more securely, the executive director will be appointed by the management board, following a proposal by the Commission (Article 25) and the members of the scientific groups will be appointed by that same board, following a proposal by the executive director (Article 27).
Who is going to believe that such a structure will not support the Commission' s views?
Article 22 explains that the new system will provide 'the best possible scientific opinions' , thereby devaluing all others.
The central body is called 'the European Food Authority' (or 'the Authority' for short, with a capital 'A' ).
The name should have been 'Agency' because in theory this body will be simply issuing opinions, but the Commission insists absolutely on the word 'Authority' , and it is easy to see why.
Moreover, it is a 'Food Authority' rather than a 'Food Safety Authority' , so as to expand its scope to cover the vast areas listed in Article 21.
Among the areas listed, we also find, placed modestly at the end, genetically modified organisms.
Who could be in any doubt that one of the first 'opinions' of the 'Authority' will advise that the issuing of authorisations for GMOs should be resumed?
We are dismayed, yet again, to see national states allowing themselves to be caught in such crude traps, which will mean that in future they will no longer be able to protect their citizens.
Yet when all is said and done, perhaps that is what they really want.
. (PT) We must not imagine that the creation of a European Food Authority will provide a panacea for all the problems of food safety.
What is needed is a change in the EU' s current policies affecting the safety of food, namely, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy.
Highly intensive production and the quest for greater profits have had damaging consequences on the overall safety of food, with high costs for both human and animal health, as we have seen in the cases of BSE, dioxins and, more recently, with foot-and-mouth disease.
The European Food Safety Authority must not be a smokescreen for public opinion.
Furthermore, an authority that guarantees risk assessment for food safety, underpinned by solid scientific opinion, must not take responsibility from or replace the Commission or the competent authorities in each Member State in managing the risks of Community food policy.
The whole food chain must be involved, with the spotlight on the role of the agri-foodstuff industry in food safety.
We agreed that the underlying principle of any legislation on food is to protect human health and it is this very reason that makes it crucial to apply the precautionary principle to risk management, when scientific data are insufficient or inconclusive.
Food traceability, with an integrated 'from farm to fork' approach is the right principle, although questions have rightly been raised about its immediate implementation in Portugal with no transitional period, which would enable account to be taken of the specific characteristics of our agricultural production and of the sectors involved.
The question must nevertheless be asked whether a structure that is so cumbersome from the administrative and budgetary point of view is really necessary and this also applies to appointing the members of the management board, in which the authorities of each Member State should have a greater role.
Despite all of this, we consider the amendments tabled by Parliament on the need for imported produce to respect Community legislation to be crucial, as is extending the legislation' s coverage to encompass animal feedingstuffs too.
. (SV) We have voted for the report which in many areas improves the Commission' s proposal and makes the regulatory framework more stringent.
However, we would have preferred to have seen a more restrictive attitude concerning meat and bone meal in animal feed.
We therefore voted for Amendment No 100, which unfortunately was rejected.
This amendment demanded that Member States ensure that meat and bone meal, with the exception of fish meal, not be released on the market for animal feed.
I voted in favour of this report.
In principle, I am not in favour of the creation of an agency.
Just lately, there has been a proliferation of these new agencies: a European Maritime Safety Agency, a European Aviation Safety Agency etc.
A new Community bureaucracy is being created, and I deplore it.
However, certain circumstances may lead us to consider whether we need to create a special authority, and this is the case here.
The existence of this report is in fact the result of a sad admission - that the European Commission has shown itself to be incapable of reacting effectively to various food crises.
In order to make up for the shortcomings of the Commission, therefore, to respond to consumers' and farmers' expectations and to restore their confidence, the setting up of a special authority for food safety may be an effective alternative.
There are two essential principles that should guide the actions of the Food Authority: it is essential to give it a clear mission, and to make a distinction between what can be classified as scientific responsibility on the one hand, and what can be classified as political responsibility on the other.
The authority must focus on identifying and assessing risks, coordinating its activities with those of the national agencies and supplying all the information that is needed.
Under no circumstances can the Food Authority have the task of managing the rapid alert system.
That is an instrument for the consumer' s use, and the decision on the measures to be taken belongs entirely and exclusively in the political sphere.
Finally, on the question of where this authority should be situated, I voted in favour of Amendment No 188 in its entirety.
France is one of the great founding countries of the Union.
It should demonstrate to its partners its commitment to Europe by transposing the European directives into its national legislation as quickly as possible.
So far, however, my country has remained one of the worst offenders in this respect.
By voting as I have done, I simply wish to send a strong signal to political leaders in France, to tell them that this situation must be remedied.
That is how France will enhance its prestige and its voice will carry greater weight during the forthcoming negotiations.
The European Food Safety Authority was announced in September 1999.
The White Paper on Food Safety is dated January 2000.
We are halfway through 2001 and we are not yet in a position to say when this Authority is likely to come into operation.
There are multiple practical problems to be resolved, but the proposals have arrived late and we will not know when the measures intended to prevent the outbreak and spread of contamination will be implemented.
I deplore this irresponsible delay, because I refuse to make consumers and producers run the risks and face the real damage produced, for example, by the spread of mad cow disease.
While waiting for the procedures to take their course, and for the governments and the Commission to reach agreement on the proposals from Parliament on responsibility for assessment and notification of risk and its management - the latter should be the exclusive responsibility of the Commission - we again propose the establishment of a provisional committee to reassure European citizens about the quality of food on the market.
As regards the location of the Authority, I would stress once again that it is appropriate to locate it in an agricultural area with strong traditions, which is also a crossroads between Mediterranean and Continental Europe, which has a great and established agri-food tradition, and is the seat of a university and a centre of specialised agri-food research.
We consider it out of the question, however, for the location of the Authority to become an object of barter between the Commission and any government, an affront to the citizens and to good sense.
Certain that, despite the delay, the report maps out the road to travel, I am voting for the resolution.
. I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts of my Labour colleague, Mr Whitehead, to put forward measures to establish a European Food Authority to deal with food safety and the concerns of consumers.
With such a host of alarming reports on food safety, it is imperative to protect Europe's people and our safety standards in food.
With this in mind, I support Mr Whitehead's proposal to include the word "safety" in the title of the body to read European Food Safety Authority.
We must put safety first and make sure that harmful substances do not enter the food chain unseen by the back door.
Furthermore, the remit of the Authority should be extended to include animal health and welfare, plant health, GMOs and food labelling.
Of course, the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance.
We are calling for an Authority that has a clear and targeted remit to examine issues of food safety and is founded on the principles of transparency and meritocracy.
Labour MEPs have been at the forefront of protecting consumers across Europe.
We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that food safety is strictly controlled within the EU.
Mr Whitehead's report is yet further proof of Europe cleaning up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first.
Only with clear principles and a specific mission will the EFSA win the confidence of EU consumers and the entire EU food industry.
Paulsen reports (A5-0185/2001 and A5-0200/2001)
Mr President, as agreed by all the pensioners in my party, I have voted for these health rules Mrs Paulsen has presented so well.
I also want to tell you that my daughter, Cristina - one of the few members of my family who is not here with me in this Chamber today -was passing a hot dog and hamburger restaurant the other week, and feeling hungry, tried to drag me inside, saying: 'That smells delicious.
I feel hungry.
Come on, let' s go and eat some delicious hot dogs!'
I have to say, though, that as we were about to go in, I found Mrs Paulsen blocking our way and forcing me to listen to her.
She told me to make quite sure there was a label on every hot dog I ate, to check that they had been produced according to health rules and to find out what these animals, which seem so appetising to us, have themselves eaten!
Of course, I insisted on going in - I never refuse my daughter Cristina anything - but once inside I remembered to check that all the European Union' s health rules had been applied, and that everything was labelled.
I have to say that this had been done even before the directives were passed.
And I ate some excellent hot dogs!
When I asked the Commission, five years ago, if it knew whether Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had appeared in Germany, and whether it was not afraid that, without adequate controls, the disease would affect cattle, I was told that the institution was aware of the reports, but that everything was under control and there was nothing to fear.
We know the rest.
BSE spread in Britain and has also appeared in other European countries, although to a lesser degree, claiming human victims and leading to the slaughter of a large but still unspecified number of cattle, with enormous damage to breeders and the livestock economy of the whole area.
It is generally held that fodder based on animal meal has encouraged the spread of the livestock disease.
The Commission' s proposal on the treatment of by-products of animal origin is a step in the right direction, but I agree with the rapporteur that we should strengthen the regulation by asking for strict separation, and hence visibility in the food chain, of the three categories of materials: extremely dangerous, for example contaminated by dioxins and transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE); carrying risk of diseases other than TSE; and produced from healthy animals.
By-products in the first and second categories should be traceable through the use of dyes or odorants and should be prohibited.
Only those in the third category are to be permitted as ingredients in animal fodder.
The stricter the controls, the better it will be for the health of consumers.
Notwithstanding the laudable amendments tabled by the rapporteur, whose efforts to strengthen the Commission' s proposals we appreciate, many points still remain unresolved in terms of decisions on urgent action in the event of crises.
For this reason, I abstained in the vote.
Karamanou report (A5-0206/2001)
Mr President, the GUE/NGL Group could not support Mrs Karamanou' s report on child pornography.
We strongly condemn child pornography.
We consider this to be a very severe and very serious crime.
For this reason we consider that the proposals submitted by the Commission are better than the report submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
It is important that legislation defines child pornography as distinctly as possible.
Definitions must not be allowed to become so broad as to make police work and the work of authorities more difficult.
If a parent or guardian admits serious abuse of a child, their own child or someone else' s child, they must be treated as the criminals they are and not afforded special treatment in any way.
If there is no obligation to report knowledge of actual crime in this respect in Member States, we hope that the Commission will encourage the implementation of such legislation.
However, we do not wish to encourage moral panic by encouraging citizens to report anyone without relevant suspicions.
Finally, we turn to the proposal submitted by the Commission and the committee on age limits.
In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, a person is to be seen as a child until he or she has reached the age of 18.
Whatever the age of the child, vulnerability, the degree of abuse and the nature of abuse must be the guiding factors when setting penalties - irrespective of age.
Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report whereby the European Union sets about combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
I should add that I associate with many older people as national secretary of the Italian Pensioners Party, and my mother is also one of them. She looks and moves as if she were much younger but she passed 65 some time ago.
Well, she told me she has lots of spare time and could accompany her grandchildren to school - and even her great-grandchildren, if she had any.
Many older people have told me the same: they are willing to keep an eye on children wherever they go.
I hope Mrs Karamanou and Parliament will propose facilitating the use of older people to take care of children in the next report.
The Alleanza Nazionale group has voted for the Karamanou report because the European institutions are at last decisively committed to combating phenomena like child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children, which is worsening and spreading all the time, striking down the weakest and most defenceless citizens of the European Union: our children.
This is the first perceptible step to remind the Member States of their responsibility to introduce more appropriate legislation to deal with the specific nature of this odious crime.
The Alleanza Nazionale group has frequently denounced the urgent need to intervene and impose strict controls and prohibitions on the Internet, which represents one of the main channels of communication and distribution of both audio and video child pornography, making the service provider criminally responsible for the content of the services provided.
Finally, we particularly appreciated the proposal to confiscate the proceeds of this sexual exploitation and devote them to victims and children' s rights NGOs.
The European Union will then be playing a decisive role in resisting a phenomenon which knows no frontiers because it is often run by large criminal associations at international level.
. (SV) The Swedish Moderate Party delegation in the PPE-DE Group considers that the articles on criminalisation in the report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are vague in places, which makes it difficult to gain an overview of the criminal area.
We have voted in favour of the report as we assume that no constitutional change needs to be made.
Our abstention on this report in no way signifies a lack of interest, nor does it mean that we are neutral in our attitude towards the problem of paedophiles, whom we firmly condemn.
It simply means that the text is inadequate on some points and ambiguous on others.
, in writing.
(SV) Mr President, the GUE/NGL Group could not support Mrs Karamanou' s report on child pornography.
We strongly condemn child pornography.
We consider this to be a very grave and very serious crime.
For this reason we consider that the proposals submitted by the Commission are better than the report submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
It is important that legislation define child pornography as distinctly as possible.
Definitions must not be allowed to become so broad as to make police work and the work of authorities more difficult.
If a parent or guardian admits serious abuse of a child, their own child or someone else' s child, they must be treated as the criminals they are and not given special treatment in any way.
If there is no obligation to report knowledge of actual crime in this respect in Member States, we hope that the Commission will encourage the implementation of such legislation.
However, we do not wish to encourage moral panic by encouraging citizens to report anyone without relevant suspicions.
Finally, we turn to the proposal submitted by the Commission and the committee on age limits.
In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, a person is to be seen as a child until he or she has reached the age of 18.
Whatever the age of the child, vulnerability, the degree of abuse and the nature of abuse must be the guiding factors when setting penalties - irrespective of age.
. (PT) As the report acknowledges, important international agreements already exist to protect children, specifically the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the European Council Convention on Cyber-Crime.
The European Union has the task of complementing and extending this work, bearing in mind the gravity of the situation that still exists in this field.
It is not enough, however, to establish legal frameworks.
We must also adopt fundamental political measures, which address the causes.
The European Commission' s proposal offers very little analysis of the causes of the sexual exploitation of children and the consequences of such behaviour and back-pedals significantly on the measures that are proposed and an actual definition of child pornography.
During the debate on the proposal in the Committee on Women' s Rights, we tabled various amendments, thereby making a positive contribution to improving the initial positions.
Not all of our amendments were adopted, but the report makes a significant improvement on the Commission' s proposals in various ways. It falls short, however, of what we would like to see in this field, specifically with regard to the concept of child pornography and to the penalties that could be imposed for such activity.
We are in favour of this step, which confirms the need for a framework decision defending the need for strong and concerted action against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the latter having developed greatly as a result of the Internet and new technologies.
This battle must be fought on all fronts, because the consequences for children are disastrous, and from this point of view we support the argument that the possession of child-pornography material in itself constitutes an offence.
The main problem is to avoid a situation in which this vital battle against the sexual exploitation of children and against child pornography is used by supporters of a reactionary morality, resulting in excesses tending to abolish freedoms, in particular in relation to certain material containing sexual information, or certain types of fiction.
Therefore one cannot state than any representation of children showing 'sexual behaviour' is reprehensible.
What concerns us is the ambiguity of a certain number of amendments dealing with virtual products.
Perhaps this is a justifiable area for concern, but there is a real risk of going off the rails here.
We are therefore in favour of a no-holds-barred campaign against the sexual exploitation of children and against child pornography, but a certain number of amendments involve a very real risk that this just campaign will be used for reactionary purposes.
This is why we are abstaining from the vote.
. (NL) The crimes of Marc Dutroux in Belgium and similar atrocities elsewhere have been waiting for a response for years.
People who put their personal pleasure, or earning money from the pleasure of others, before the protection of children are a danger to society as a whole.
Society must be protected against people who force children into sexual acts and who are even capable of killing those children if they can no longer be used for that purpose.
I give my unqualified support to that part of the proposals in the Karamanou report.
Unfortunately, in certain other proposals and in the debate in this connection, I have detected a nineteenth-century, Victorian undertone.
I get the impression that a number of people who advocate tough measures would, in fact, ideally ban same-sex marriages, nudist beaches, pornographic images and text, sex outside marriage and Manneken Pis.
I also get the feeling that they want to criminalise parents who, they believe, do not raise their children in a sufficiently prudish manner.
You are already committing an offence if you give your children sex education, if other people can see your children naked or if the children can see their parents naked.
That is not how you deal with the irresponsible, the profiteers and the criminals; instead you take away newly acquired freedom from ordinary well-meaning people.
That part of their objectives will not receive my support.
For over seven years, with speeches in the House, questions, motions for resolutions, press conferences, round tables and meetings, the Alleanza Nazionale in the European Parliament has been calling for action to combat the odious crime of paedophilia and the exploitation of minors through child pornography.
We have even resorted to a people' s petition to try to speed up the involvement of the Commission, governments and political forces in the defence of the thousands and thousands of children who are double victims of crime: first because of the violence suffered; and then because of the length of proceedings and the indifference of institutions.
The Council and Parliament are finally promoting new initiatives, but these will not have sufficient impact unless a culture of respect for children and strict and swift legislation against their enslavers are speedily developed throughout the world, and especially in the West.
As long as the West allows child pornography and paedophile pictures and propaganda, with extremely shady connections, to be distributed over the Internet, it cannot effectively protect minors.
The Commission must take responsibility for dealing with this unspeakable situation and negotiate with international organisations and governments to block the use of the Internet for illicit purposes.
. I congratulate my Socialist colleague, Mrs Karamanou, on her report on combating the sexual exploitation of children.
Europe must introduce stronger measures to tackle this disturbing subject and ensure that offenders are punished in a similar way across the European Union.
We have all heard of awful and tragic cases of child pornography and child exploitation across Europe.
We must seek to ensure that history is not repeated.
Our children must never again suffer such terrible afflictions and we must do all we can to prevent this.
Cooperation should be increased between Member States in the European Union through common penalties for offenders and police services working together across the Member States.
Tougher penalties must be dealt out to those participating in the sexual exploitation of children and offenders must not be allowed to get away scot free.
Hard measures should be taken against those guilty of exploiting children, as well as those who gain financially or are members of a criminal organisation.
Parents who have agreed for a child to engage in prostitution or pornography should also be regarded as criminal offenders.
I fully agree with Mrs Karamanou that victims and witnesses should be given better protection and assistance.
Financial compensation for rehabilitation is important, but we should remember that you can never buy back innocence.
Our children are our most vulnerable citizens and we should make every effort possible to protect them.
I merely wish to ask whether the written explanations of vote should not be taken first.
As I understand it, one must be present in the chamber even when submitting a written explanation of vote.
Or have these rules been changed again?
My delegation has remained as we wish to submit a written explanation.
We would like this to be registered and then we would like to be able to leave.
It would therefore be easier if we took the written explanations first.
I would like some clarification: Does one need to remain in the chamber if one wishes to submit a written explanation and have it approved, or not?
I am not sure if I have understood you properly, Mrs Carlsson, but for many years the practice has been that anybody who has taken part in the vote simply has to give the written explanation of vote to the Bureau or indicate that they will deliver it within two hours, and do not have to wait to be called.
If you have taken part in the vote and do not wish to wait and wish to make a written explanation of vote, you simply have to say so and deliver your written text to us before 3.00 p.m.
Is that clear?
Thank you for your answer.
I was of the opinion that one had to remain also for written explanations of vote.
That is excellent, now I know and will be able to save time in the future.
Klamt report (A5-0183/2001)
Mr President, I do not know why, perhaps it is the fact that it is always close to lunchtime, but I always find myself starting my explanations of vote by saying I was in a restaurant.
To explain why I have voted for this report on combating trafficking in human beings, I have to tell you that I was in a Chinese restaurant in 2010.
It should not surprise you, Mr President, that with me the future can become the past.
Well, in 2010 I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had a very good meal.
It was so good that I got friendly with the owner and asked him about his life.
'So you were a Member of the European Parliament?' he said.
'You did well to vote for the report against trafficking in human beings!
Because, you see, I would have had to work with no social security, no wages, no pension, because I would have come to Strasbourg the wrong way.
As it is, I have been able to earn a good salary. I also have a pension, and now I devote myself to this restaurant.
I owe that to the European Parliament and its Members who voted in favour of that report ten years ago.'
And he thanked me.
Today the Commission has put before us regulations against trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation which we cannot but approve of, though at the same time noting that they hide a less praiseworthy objective concerning the issue of illegal immigration.
In effect, the Commission, which is frequently accused of using its new powers of initiative, which it derives from the Treaty of Amsterdam, in a way that is too favourable towards immigration (in particular the proposals on reuniting families and on temporary protection), is seeking to clear its name by including, under the heading of trafficking in human beings, trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation.
It claims that this is a contribution to the campaign to halt illegal immigration.
In reality, however, this is an alibi.
If we examine the text more closely, we can see that the approach favoured by the Commission is to defuse the repressive measures.
The offence of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation, as described in Article 1, does not require the illegal crossing of a border, and yet that is precisely the primary criterion in a case of illegal immigration.
The result is that this offence is defined in a vague manner, so that it can cover very different types of cases, and not just illegal immigration.
Under the pretext of this broad definition, the person who is the object of the trafficking is presented, in the Commission' s explanatory statement, as a 'victim' .
Therefore, in order for an offence to have been committed, that victim must have suffered a constraint, which does not correspond to the case of illegal immigrants, who generally come voluntarily.
In these circumstances, these supposed provisions against illegal immigration, buried as they are in the campaign against exploitation of all kinds, including child pornography, cannot possibly be effective.
They serve merely to provide a trompe-l' oeil counterpart to other texts on immigration which are extremely lax.
Fortunately, Member States, and in particular France, have used the powers of initiative which they still posses, until 1 May 2004, to put forward other proposals which are more precise, better targeted, and therefore more effective. There is a proposed framework decision aimed at reinforcing the penal code to stop the facilitation of unauthorised entry into and residence in the Union, a draft directive which seeks to improve the definition of 'facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence' , and a draft directive on hauliers' liability if they carry illegal immigrants.
If Member States had not taken these initiatives in order to restore the balance, the texts currently being proposed by the Commission would be more or less pointless, at least as far as illegal immigration is concerned.
- (DA) We have some reservations regarding the legal bases of both reports.
Trafficking in human beings, and emigration which is claimed to be voluntary but which is in fact forced on people by destitution, have one thing in common: they are both the result of the poverty which afflicts most of the world.
Without a deep-seated social change which puts an end to a system which, in order to concentrate wealth in the hands of the privileged classes of the rich countries, impoverishes the labouring classes of the world, it will not be possible to halt either so-called voluntary emigration or trafficking in human beings.
We voted in favour of the text in order to express our condemnation of those who profit from this type of traffic or from the sex trade.
Nevertheless, it has to be said that this most irresolute of resolutions does not finish what it sets out to do, since it could only achieve its objective by granting the victims of this trafficking not a temporary residence permit but the full right to remain, if they wish to, in the countries of the European Union.
. I welcome the adoption of two reports calling for closer co-operation between Member States on the twin evils of sexual exploitation of children and the trafficking of human beings.
The Klamt and Karamanou reports are related in that they seek to harmonise definitions of sexual exploitation.
They call for a common definition and application of penalties relating to pornography in an age where the Internet has enabled sexual exploitation to transcend all frontiers.
It is horrific that slavery and exploitation can take place on the European continent where we like to think of ourselves as socially enlightened.
It is imperative that proposals for severe penalties for those convicted of sexual exploitation and trafficking should be followed through.
I call on the Irish Government to state clearly what position it will take on these issues before decisions are taken at Council.
.
(PT) The basis for this report is the Commission' s proposal linking the trafficking of people for purposes of sexual exploitation - prostitution - and the trafficking of human beings for purposes of work - migrant workers. This is not the best way in which to study and address these two serious problems.
As a matter of fact, the UN treats them quite separately and rightly so, taking account of their quite different realities and of the different and separate approaches that they require.
Nevertheless, the report improves the Commission' s proposal considerably, and tables around fifty amendments, specifically indicating that trafficking in human beings must not just be punished, but that it must be expressly classified as a criminal activity.
The report also proposes increasing prison sentences and takes the view that the instigation of, aiding or abetting such activity must also be punished.
Another important proposal is to set up a compensation fund for victims of trafficking in human beings, which would be funded from the confiscation ofcriminals' proceeds from crime.
I think it is also positive that the report reiterates the need to give adequate protection to victims and witnesses, to grant the victims of trafficking temporary rights of residence for the entire period of criminal investigation or trial, including providing adequate accommodation and other support, specifically for reintegration, and the creation of a database of missing persons.
These are the reasons why we are voting in favour of the report, although we are sorry that Commissioner Vitorino was not able to accept all of the proposals tabled by the European Parliament.
Those recitals in the draft which state that there is a need to take strong measures to halt trafficking in human beings, and the references to the UN texts, appear to us to be broadly correct.
Of course, the concept of labour exploitation could be expanded (the references are those of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which are too restrictive).
The main danger lies in confusing trafficking in human beings with immigration and attempting to treat the two as one and the same thing.
This is why we supported the amendments which point out that the campaign to stop trafficking in human beings must not be used to repress unauthorised immigrants, and those which refer to the right to reside for all victims.
We also voted in favour of those amendments which seek to classify as an offence what was originally called an infringement, in view of what trafficking in human beings means in terms of exploitation, humiliation, and physical and mental violence.
Finally, we should like to make it clear that our positive vote on this proposed framework decision in no way means that we believe that the various European systems of cooperation between police forces and judicial systems currently in use are acceptable or legitimate.
- (NL) The division of poverty and welfare among countries and among groups within one country is becoming increasingly unfair.
A growing number of people in the richest countries attaches more importance to earning as much money as possible than to the well-being of their fellow men and the protection of the environment.
This brings out the worst in people.
Although colonial slavery was abolished 140 years ago, new forms of slavery are now emerging rapidly.
Many women and children from Eastern Europe and the Third World, in search of a better life, fall into the hands of new slave drivers during their journey to richer countries.
These seek to make money by forcing others into providing involuntary sexual services.
Tough measures are needed, not to punish the victims, but to make it impossible for the profiteers to continue in their criminal activities.
I welcome the fact that the proposal draws a distinction between the granting of humanitarian aid to people without the required paperwork and trafficking in human beings, that a compensation fund will be set up for victims, which is to be financed from confiscated, illegal profits, and that victims and witnesses are to be protected.
I can therefore support the basic ideas of the Klamt report, although I share Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s concern that, with this proposal too, the Mafiosi, which have a genuine vested interest in this kind of activity, will continue to remain too much out of range.
.
(SV) We Swedish Christian Democrats welcome the initiative to combat human trafficking.
We consider that there is a natural difference between the concepts of human trafficking and human smuggling.
Consequently it is beneficial to address these issues in separate legal instruments, an opinion reflected in our vote.
Furthermore, we consider that as the framework decision concerns combating human trafficking and the punishment of those guilty of this, questions such as the treatment of victims of human trafficking should not be regulated in this instrument.
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on these points.
. I support this report against the trafficking in human beings.
Europe needs to crack down on the trade in trafficking human beings.
Human trafficking involves force, violence, deceit and abuse of its victims and is totally unacceptable.
Over 120,000 women and children are abducted from Eastern Europe each year to be brought into the EU for exploitation.
Not only should this type of activity be punishable, but it should be classed as a criminal offence.
I strongly believe there should be common rules for penalties with those guilty facing a minimum prison sentence of six years rising to ten years for more severe cases.
All those involved in circles of human trafficking should certainly face stiff penalties, whether they are police officers, customs officials or civil servants.
We must not forget the victims' needs and their suffering in all this.
They should be given better support, including financial compensation from the confiscated proceeds of crime.
The European single market allows borders to be crossed, but we must do all we can to prevent such exploitation of our borders.
If we are truly a people's Europe, we must put the people first and protect them from abuses such as these.
Karamanou and Klamt reports (A5-0256/2001) and (A5-0183/2001)
DybkjÃŠr report (A5-0191/2001)
Mr President, my wife Graziella is at last with me in Strasbourg, and when we went back to the hotel last night I read her part of the Dybkjaer report, about the two billion people in the world, in developing countries, who have never made a telephone call, never watched television, never gone to the cinema, never been in an aeroplane or a car.
'Ah!' she exclaimed. 'They are the lucky ones then, they are fine without telephones, televisions and cars!'
'No' I explained. 'I cannot do what you want and vote against this report.
I must vote in favour because they must progress, they must have their televisions, cinemas and telephones too' .
In fact I have voted in favour.
But she got angry and we argued and for the second time in my life I spent a sleepless night.
But I have voted for the report and I am very happy to have done so.
We can only vote against this heap of rubbish, which in its very first recital states that poor countries have 'possibilities to improve their economic situation, fight poverty...' , however little they know how to use this 'ICT revolution' .
In many of the poorer countries, the majority of the population not only do not have electricity, they are not even fed properly.
It is easier to draw up and adopt resolutions of this kind, and even to grant a few subsidies allowing computer manufacturers to dispose of unsaleable stocks, than to feed the people of these countries or, even better, to give them the opportunity to feed themselves, instead of exploiting them and forcing them to abandon even their own food crops in order to produce for western markets.
It takes a great lack of awareness or a high degree of cynicism to state that 'information and communication technologies afford possibilities of making a major contribution to direct democracy' .
In some of the poorer countries, particularly in Africa, the people would be happy if the major European powers would make a 'contribution' to democracy by ceasing to support, finance and arm their dictators.
However, it would be asking too much to expect the governments of Europe to abandon the long-standing dictatorships which protect the interests of their trusts.
The people are demanding democracy, are they?
Let them make do with the Internet!
Aparicio SÃ¡nchez report (A5-0122/2001)
Mr President, I hope you and all the interpreters and officials who have had the patience to stay in the Chamber with me have a very good lunch.
I have voted for this report and it was my sister who suggested this explanation of vote to me.
She said: 'Listen, when will we finally see the Mona Lisa in Italy?
When will we see Michelangelo' s Moses in Strasbourg?
And when will we see Van Gogh and Renoir in Spain? They have never been shown in our museums.'
'Very soon,' I replied, 'because, as well as legislating on the theft of works of art, the European Union will surely also ensure that these works can circulate freely and easily throughout Europe.'
And that is the end of my explanations of vote for today.
We voted against this report in order to condemn the hypocrisy of a text which claims to oppose the renewed outbreak of thefts of cultural objects in the European Union and the illicit trade in such objects.
The author of this text forgets to point out that not only the national museums of the countries of Europe but also private collections are filled with cultural objects pillaged over centuries from the countries of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America or Africa
While the British Museum, the Louvre, and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin are filled with the wonders of ancient art, in Greece there are mostly only plaster copies now.
In museums, these cultural objects are at least exhibited to the public.
The same is not true, however, of private collections.
If this text is claiming to prevent illicit trade, it should first of all define as illicit all purchases which enable extremely rich individuals to appropriate and keep for their own private use cultural goods which ought to be the heritage of the whole of humanity and accessible to everyone.
Mr Fatuzzo, before suspending the sitting, I would like to tell you something which I am sure will delight you: every second of every speech costs the European tax-payer EUR 9.65.
That concludes the vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Ozone in ambient air (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5Â­0187/2001) by Mr Davies, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air [13114/1/2000 - C5Â­0090/2001 - 1999/0068(COD)].
Mr President, as I see it, Mr Davies' report deals fundamentally with the credibility of the EU' s environment policy and whether we really are to attempt to achieve the targets created by the Union.
Ground level ozone is a serious air pollutant which creates considerable problems for public health and the environment.
The targets we are setting to reduce the extent of pollution must be binding, otherwise we risk the decisions becoming mere castles in the air.
It is therefore not good to have legislation which only talks about targets being reached as far as possible, as expressed by the Council of Ministers.
In this respect we naturally support the committee' s proposal for clearer wording.
Our group also supports Amendments Nos 5 and 23 which state that the targets must be entirely attained by 2020 at the latest and that they may not be exceeded by more than 20 days a year until 2010.
Without these changes the legislation will be toothless.
Another important aspect of Mr Davies' report is the more stringent requirements in terms of information to the public.
This type of air pollution has a considerable effect on public health. It is therefore important that all available information is made public to the general public and voluntary organisations.
There must be consistency between the EU' s environmental policy in different areas.
We have common targets for air quality and are currently negotiating with the Council to approximate the rules on national ceilings for emissions and large incineration plants.
If this policy is to hold together, we also require binding rules on ozone emissions.
With these words I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work which we will vote for in every respect.
Mr President, the main thrust of this directive is to set targets for the levels of ozone which will be permitted in ambient air within the European Union.
This directive is part of an overall package which is being implemented by the European Union at this time to comply with the obligations under the Kyoto Accord.
We can all recall that the Kyoto Accord sets down a timetable for the reduction in the level of the use of greenhouse gases.
The US President, Mr Bush, has already stated that he wants to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord.
This is highly regrettable because, in the eyes of many, it is felt that the targets set by the Kyoto Accord will not even achieve the goal of substantially reducing the use of greenhouse gases.
The clear scientific evidence is that climate change is real, is happening now, and will get worse.
Emissions from the developed world are the primary reason for global warming.
Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps in reducing emissions.
The European Union is determined to play its part in reaching our targeted 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels over this decade.
We are all aware that President Bush is due to meet the European Union leaders in GÃ¶teborg this week.
I hope that the US President will come up with a firm proposal to outline how his administration intends to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the immediate future.
There is unequivocal scientific evidence about the damage which has been done to many communities as the ozone layer is being depleted.
Extensive production of greenhouse gases is resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer which, in turn, is resulting in higher sea levels, contributing to greater coastal erosion, greater flooding and the elimination of many of our island communities.
We have a moral obligation to ensure not only that the quality of life of present communities is protected, but that the quality of life of future communities is protected also.
That is why it is so important that we all guarantee that we reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, the United States of America and elsewhere so as to achieve our objective in this regard.
I congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report.
Mr President, since this morning, we have been talking specifically about ozone and the serious effects which it has on human health, but also, more generally, about ecosystems and the environment as a whole.
I myself, in my dÃ©partement in France, chair an air-quality monitoring network, and whenever the weather is very good, when it is sunny and there is no wind, I dread the effects of road traffic, because I know that the maximum levels will inevitably be exceeded, and there will be what we normally call an ozone peak.
In such conditions, what can we do?
What can we do to comply with the Kyoto Accord and solve the problem of climatic change?
We know that it is human activity, in the form of industry and road traffic, which causes the maximum ozone limits to be exceeded in our urban areas, but afterwards this ozone, depending on wind and topography, spreads to regions which ought to be protected.
It is therefore vitally important to set objectives which are precise, to have real, effective air-quality monitoring networks.
The rapid alert system which comes into play when ozone limits are exceeded to an extent which is likely to be harmful to the health of susceptible people such as children, the elderly, or people with heart or respiratory problems, must be effective.
The network must cover the whole of Europe, so that everybody can be properly informed.
However, we should be aware that it is difficult to reduce excessive levels in Spain, Greece and Italy, and that it is much more difficult in the countries of southern Europe than in those further north.
Those who are responsible at local level should take effective town-planning measures, in the context of sustainable development, without, however, harming the competitiveness of our businesses.
We should aim our awareness campaign above all at those who are in a position to change their behaviour but, more than anything else, in order to succeed we must make sure that all countries are aware of their responsibilities, so that our decisions are not merely European, but international as well.
President Bush has arrived in Europe, and we should do all we can to make him aware of the responsibility which the United States also bears in this area.
Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate Mr Davies for the work that he has done on this report.
He brings something to us which will hopefully provide some interesting issues to be debated and discussed and then resolved in consultation.
This report excellently demonstrates why environment policy has to be achieved at a European level.
Ozone is a European problem and the best example I can think of a problem that has to be addressed at the European level.
For example, within the United Kingdom, where in many ways the circumstances are amongst the most favourable within the European Union, 50% of the ozone is created by emissions outside the UK.
That is very much the pattern for the rest of Europe.
Indeed, in many parts of Europe, a great many of the problems about ozone are not necessarily a consequence of activities by that individual Member State.
Ozone is a collective problem which has to be dealt with collectively.
I have one concern, namely that we are trying to set too strict values.
We are setting target values that, by their very nature, will be almost impossible for many Member States to meet in certain given circumstances during the year.
They are going to be, through no fault of their own, in breach of European legislation.
It is not sensible that we should create a piece of legislation that puts Member States in this position.
There are many Member States, particularly in southern and eastern-central Europe who are going to find themselves constantly in breach of this legislation, no matter what they do.
Some of the things they are going to have to do, where physically possible, as indicated in the compromise amendments, is to close factories, perhaps shut down whole parts of industry, and create car-free zones inside their cities.
And still they will not solve the problem of ozone.
Still they will find themselves breaching this regulation we are creating.
When we go into conciliation - as I expect we will because we will have the votes for many of these amendments in the House - we are going to have to think very carefully about whether we continue to adopt this type of approach and this type of legislation.
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing today, together with the directives on large combustion plants and national emission ceilings, forms an important part of the Community's ongoing efforts to clean up air over Europe.
First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Davies, for his hard and dedicated work on this important and complex issue.
The proposal sets target values and long-term objectives for ozone in ambient air.
While the long-term objectives are based on the latest advice from the World Health Organization, the target values have been set with regard to the best attainable air quality.
In doing so, the transboundary nature of ozone and cost-efficiency aspects have been taken into account.
As I mentioned earlier, this proposal is closely related to the proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings where conciliation negotiations are currently under way and we have to recognise the difficulty of finding a solution for linked issues, for example the target values for ozone, in the absence of a definitive outcome.
At its first reading in March last year, Parliament presented a well-considered report including 18 amendments.
Council's common position adopted in March 2001 takes due account of most of Parliament's concerns.
Now 32 amendments have been tabled to the text of the common position.
Amendments Nos 4, 15 and the first part of Amendment No 23 all seek to turn the target values into binding limit values.
In light of the insufficient scientific knowledge on ozone formation, the Commission cannot accept any of those amendments.
On the other hand we can accept in principle Amendments Nos 30 and 31 requiring binding target values, save where physically impossible.
However, we would also have to bear in mind that target values would not be attained where it is not efficient from an economic viewpoint.
With regard to the target values, it is not acceptable for the Commission to keep 20 days as the target value for the protection of human health.
The Commission agreed on Council's common position on national emission ceilings, which result in 25 days as an attainable target.
Therefore the Commission cannot accept the second part of Amendment No 23.
Moreover, Amendment No 23 would set 2020 as a binding target year to attain the long-term objectives.
Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 15 follow the same intention.
As there is there is no scientific evidence yet to prove this aim to be feasible, the Commission cannot accept those amendments.
However, the Commission agrees on the general aim fully to close the gap between long-term objectives and current ozone levels and could accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6.
Amendments Nos 26 to 31 would require attainment of the long-term objectives, save where physically impossible.
Again, this would have to be complemented by taking account of economic efficiency as well.
Therefore, those amendments could only be accepted in principle.
Several amendments would enforce the obligations of Member States to report to the public and the Commission.
The Commission welcomes these amendments if the requirements are considered feasible and useful.
The Commission therefore could accept Amendments Nos 8, the second part of 10 and 16.
Amendment No 11 would be acceptable in part. Amendment No 17, in principle.
Amendment 32 would complement Amendment No 17 in a way that is acceptable.
The first part of Amendment No 10 and Amendments Nos 18 to 20 and 25 are not acceptable.
Amendments Nos 12 and 14 both clarify responsibilities in setting up short-term action plans and are acceptable in part and in principle.
The last part of Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 13 are acceptable in stressing the role of guidance on examples for short-term actions.
The Commission accepts Amendment No 24, which supports a more effective trigger value to initiate short-term actions.
There are four amendments on other issues.
Among those the Commission cannot accept is Amendment No 1, as it is directed towards candidate countries, which is not appropriate for an EU directive.
We can accept Amendment No 7 on tightening requirements to maintain air quality.
Amendment No 21 would require a direct comparison between the performance of Member States in improving air quality and the Commission could not accept this amendment as the proposed comparison is not considered appropriate, in particular, with regard to the transboundary nature of ozone.
As Amendment No 33 incorporates those aspects, it could be accepted in principle.
However, no direct comparison of Member States should be required.
Finally, Amendment No 22 requires special attention to the effects of ozone on human health and the environment and the Commission accepts this amendment.
I consider it essential to put this legislation in place soon, so that appropriate monitoring can start.
Member States need to be able to identify problem areas, so that they can make sure that the public's health is properly protected in the future throughout the Union.
Hopefully a valid compromise will soon be found, having regard to the outcome of the conciliation negotiations on the directive on national emission ceilings.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WTO Panel/Section 211
The next item is the oral question (B5Â­0326/2001) by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the WTO Panel Section 211.
Mr President, I should like to say a few introductrory words and then perhaps go on to explain our oral question.
We have tabled an oral question on behalf of our group.
The main reason for this is our group' s criticism of the way in which the Council used the procedure laid down in Article 133 as the basis for its decision to apply for the appointment of a panel to examine whether section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act is incompatible with the TRIPS Agreement.
We did not deal to any great extent with the substance of the Council' s case, although the substantive argument did meet with some opposition and engendered lively discussion in committee; we chiefly focused on the expression of our desire to be fully informed in future and to be included in the decision-making structures used by the Council and the special committee established under Article 133.
We believe this is especially necessary in the realm of trade policy.
As all of you here - honourable Members, Commissioner and representative of the Council - are aware, when it comes to trade issues, we in Parliament are only involved to a limited extent.
For many years we have been crossing swords on this issue - mainly with the Council and only to a lesser degree with the Commission.
In the case in question, it is a matter of initiating proceedings to examine whether, in a dispute between Pernod/Ricard and Bacardi, a primarily Euro-Cuban holding and a primarily U.S.-European corporation, the EU is entitled to lend support as it sees fit.
The Council has come down clearly on the side of Pernod/Ricard in this dispute, and the Commission supports this position too.
We in the committee did not pronounce ourselves on this dispute.
All we said is that we should have wished to be informed before the institution of proceedings and before the appointment of the panel, so that we as a Parliament could have adopted a substantiated and well-founded position on the decision taken by the Council and the Commission.
Let me add that the Commission, especially Commissioner Lamy, has kept us regularly briefed.
Accordingly, none of our criticism in this case has been directed at the Commission.
Perhaps the main point, and the reason why we attach so much importance to this issue, is that section 211 of the Trademark Act is one of those cases that relates to our long-running dispute with the United States over the Helms-Burton Act.
It is about the extraterritorial application of domestic legislation.
To that extent, we support the action taken by the Commission and the Council from a political point of view, but - as I have already mentioned - we do not condone the inadequate briefing of Parliament and its competent committee.
Why is this so important?
You will have noticed that legislators on both sides of the Atlantic have been coming under increasing pressure to support the decisions of their respective governments.
It is very, very important to us to make it clear to the other institutions that they will only be able to secure our support in future if they provide Parliament and the responsible parliamentary committee with comprehensive information.
You will see how necessary this is from the letter written by many Members of this House - I believe there were more than a hundred of us - and addressed to both the U.S. Government and the Council.
The letter not only criticised the procedure adopted by the Council but also the substance of its decision.
That is why I wish to make this urgent appeal to the Council to do everything possible in future to keep Parliament fully informed and to extend this obligation to cover any application for the institution of dispute-settlement proceedings, which means coming to the committee or the plenary chamber on such occasions and briefing Parliament in order to establish total transparency.
Mr President, on behalf of the Council I would like to remind you that, according to Article 133 of the Treaty, the Council makes decisions on the common trade policy on the basis of the Commission' s proposals.
We in the Council are well aware of the desires regarding the procedure for decisions on the common trade policy which Parliament has formulated on several occasions.
These desires have been examined and assessed very carefully.
As we all know, they have also been the object of discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference which concluded its work in Nice on 7 - 9 December 2000.
The changes to the text of the Treaty which this Intergovernmental Conference agreed on do not address this aspect of Article 133.
It should also be noted that the vast majority of Member States did not consider it necessary to amend the article in this respect.
Besides the obligations laid down in the Treaty, the Council requires openness.
At meetings with the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in particular, the Council regularly informs Parliament of issues which are of importance to Community trade policy and in accordance with the Westerterp Procedure of 1973 the Council informs Parliament of negotiations concerning trade agreements with third countries before they are initiated, while they are underway and once negotiations have been concluded.
I also wish to note that Swedish Minister for Trade Leif Pagrotsky will hold two meetings with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy during the Swedish Presidency.
Furthermore, representatives of the European Parliament were invited to the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Meeting on Trade on 29 May 2001.
What is more, the chairman of the Article 133 Committee invited all members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to an informal meeting on 31 May 2001.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO dispute between the European Union and the United States in the Havana Club case, in other words the dispute regarding section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act, highlights the need for our Parliament to be informed and involved by the Council at crucial junctures in the pursuit of our common trade policy.
Unlike the Commission, the Council failed to take steps to inform Parliament fully and promptly of the formulation of a common position, as it ought to have done.
The Council would normally apply Article 300(2) and the last sentence of Article 300(3), mutatis mutandis, and brief us on such important matters.
The point is that the Council, by persisting with its current practice, is evading its parliamentary accountability to the Member States and to ourselves.
This situation cannot be tolerated indefinitely, and we demand changes.
In the present case, as Erika Mann has said, the absence of information from the Council has prompted a host of individual expressions of opinion in the European Parliament. Most of these, I believe, have been inconsistent with the prevailing view in the Committee on External Trade, and their cumulative effect has been to undermine seriously the Council position in Parliament.
In other words, by failing to provide information, the Council has sown the seeds of uncertainty and has given our trading partners - in this case the United States - an opportunity, if not to weaken the position adopted by the Commission then certainly to present it as rather less clear-cut than it actually is.
I therefore believe that there is ultimately no alternative to a judicious change of procedure.
In calling for change, we are merely exercising our parliamentary power of scrutiny.
We are responsible as a Parliament for scrutinising the implementation of the common trade policy, and we should be better equipped in future to perform that function.
Although the Commission keeps us informed, it is not enough for the Council, as it did through the Swedish Minister of Industry and Commerce, for example, to come to us and hold general discussions with us without involving us in consultation mechanisms such as the EU Trade Ministers' informal talks.
Under the Portuguese Presidency, for instance, we were invited to take part in these talks.
I believe the Swedish Presidency still has a pledge to honour in this respect.
As spokesman for the PPE Group, I should like to reaffirm emphatically that we do approve of the way in which the Commission has acted on the provision of information as well as in defending the interests of the European Union against the United States in the dispute-settlement procedure, as has now been shown.
The Council, however - as I have already said - failed to inform us about this common position, contrary to the undertaking given by Mr Pagrotsky.
I therefore believe that the practical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council should show, through its actions as well as its words, that it accepts Parliament as an equal partner on issues of common trade policy, particularly by using the proper legal basis for all the measures with which it implements the common trade policy, in other words Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which is now applicable in conjunction with Article 3, as well as Article 300(2) and (3) - new numbering - the latter being applicable by analogy, given the necessary will to cooperate.
Secondly, the Council should enable the Commission to seek the opinion of Parliament prior to the conferment of a negotiating mandate, as in this Havana Club case, for example.
We could then begin a dialogue and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.
We also believe there is a need for an interinstitutional agreement on this matter, like the one we concluded with the Commission, until such times as the Treaty is finally amended too.
Lastly, I must urge the Council, when it next revises the Treaty of Nice, which I hope it will do at the forthcoming Laeken summit, to reword Article 133 so as to involve the European Parliament in the framing of policy and the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on important trade issues.
This proposal is contained in paragraph 28 of the MendÃ©z de Vigo and Seguro report on the conclusions to be drawn from the Treaty of Nice, and we shall insist on the earliest possible introduction of this amendment to the EC Treaty.
Mr President, may I pick up on a point that Konrad Schwaiger has just made.
I too believe - and I am speaking here on behalf of my group - that there is a need to redefine the obligations of the Council in terms of its accountability.
We all know, of course, that the Council acted correctly in the purely formal sense - this was the honourable Member' s line of argument too - and that the Council is not under any formal obligation to consult Parliament.
However, I do not believe we are talking about formal procedures here, but rather about proper substantive political cooperation.
As far as proper cooperation is concerned, the Council is still falling far short of its duty to Parliament.
My wish for the future is that the Council, instead of constantly invoking the formal position, will find an interinstitutional procedure that enables us to engage in some decent cooperation in future in the field of trade policy.
What you have seen this time will be seen more often in the future.
But let us not be under any illusions: trade policy is becoming an ever wider field, and many issues go beyond trade policy and into the domain of international politics.
These numerous trade disputes with the United States are a prime example.
If you want Parliament to stand by you - and Parliament is with the Commission on the substantive issue, as Konrad Schwaiger said - you must ensure that we can cooperate properly on matters of substance.
You must look on us as an adult partner, even if the Treaty does not yet formally recognise our adulthood.
I believe that the institutions have always found ways and means of cooperating in the past.
I wish the Council would do likewise and find a new procedure.
It may be that a discussion or briefing session would be held after each meeting of the special committee referred to in Article 133(3).
Or, if the Council initiates official procedures, it could come to the parliamentary committee and explain the situation.
I believe these would be ways of cooperating, and they would remove much of what I believe to be utterly unnecessary bitterness from the present debate.
We largely agree on the substance of this issue.
I also hope that many of the honourable Members who signed the letter have come to see that this was not the right course of action.
May I therefore urge the Council most earnestly to venture forward, perhaps even today, and make the case for a new form of cooperation.
Mr President, during the formal and informal debate on this issue over the last few weeks and months, both the Commission and the Council have indicated that it is not the business of the European Parliament to stick its nose into the substance of WTO cases.
I broadly agree.
The Council and the Commission have also indicated that they think it is none of the European Parliament's business to issue awkward declarations on issues which are basically sub judice.
Again, under normal circumstances, I would agree. But I would ask the Council and the Commission to tell me what we are supposed to do when we ask both of them in committee several times for justifications of how and why the decision was taken to launch this highly sensitive case and we get no more than a mere technocratic response.
What are we supposed to do when we are told the decision was taken over lunch, not even by ministers, but over lunch in some obscure Council working group without any minutes to justify to the public or, indeed, to politicians such as ourselves, why the EU is launching yet another politically sensitive trade dispute?
What strikes me is the sheer naivety of both the Commission and the Council in tackling such a highly political issue as if it were nothing more than a technical decision.
It is simply inconceivable that the US Administration in Washington would rush headlong into yet another trade dispute with the EU without first ensuring there is a minimum of political backing in Congress.
I find it very striking that both the Commission and the Council have failed to do that this time.
It has been suggested that those who have signed this hotly worded declaration were behaving irresponsibly.
Some Members of this Parliament feel it was irresponsible.
It is surely much more irresponsible to launch such a politically and commercially sensitive trade dispute without even a ritual nod towards the normal standards of transparency and political probity.
It is not an issue of reforming Article 133.
It is simply expecting both the Commission and the Council to conduct trade policy, particularly on politically sensitive issues, in a more transparent and politically intelligent manner.
Mr President, others have talked about the issue of dispute settlement specifically.
I would like to focus on the wider issue of democracy and accountability more generally.
This specific case demonstrates precisely the absence of democratic accountability in EU trade policy.
That is a huge indictment of the largest trading block in the world which prides itself on standing up for those very values.
The Nice Treaty could have been an opportunity to begin to improve the democracy and transparency of EU trade policy but in fact the Treaty makes these matters worse by increasing the powers of the Commission but not balancing that by increasing the powers of Parliament via the codecision procedure.
Meanwhile at Council level the 133 Committee meets behind closed doors.
As parliamentarians we are not even allowed as observers much less as participants.
We receive no minutes of these meetings.
There is no formal dialogue between us.
We thank you for the informal receptions which are very nice but they are no real substitute for a formal dialogue.
Furthermore in spite of all the rhetoric about trade policy supporting sustainable development, when you look at who attends the 133 meetings, it is usually simply the representatives from the trade and finance ministries alone.
But if we are serious about integrating international trade and sustainable development, then the very minimum we need to do is to ensure that representatives from social affairs, from environment, from development ministries have their voices heard at 133 meetings as well.
If sustainability really is a key issue for the EU and if the Swedish Presidency is really serious about openness, could the Presidency tell us if first of all it envisages a formalised dialogue between Parliament and the 133 Committee, and secondly if it is ready to propose revisions to the composition of that committee.
Ultimately, in order to make it more likely that trade policy enjoys the support of both parliamentarians and the wider public, Parliament should in the longer term have codecision powers, not only on the final outcome of any new trade agreement but also crucially on the Commission's mandate for negotiations.
The EU says it is committed to reforming the World Trade Organisation but a first place to start would be to reform the decision-making machinery of the EU itself.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Seattle we learned that the world is changing.
I believe we have to accept that certain decisions of the past require revision.
The European Parliament is responsible for monitoring the common trade policy.
We have co-decision rights on matters relating to the single market.
But on important international trade issues, the Union is not such a model of democratic transparency.
I believe that Sweden, which is itself a model of transparency, is called upon as the present incumbent of the presidency to take us another step along this road.
It is quite simply imperative to guarantee an open and transparent decision-making process on the basis of Article 133.
We know that the European Union, after enlargement and the forthcoming final stage of the switch to the euro, will be the world' s foremost trading bloc by a considerable margin.
In the United States, it is apparent that cooperation between the Government, the President and Congress actually works very well and that information flows freely between them.
Cooperation between the Council and the Commission is very good at the present time; Mr Lamy must be complimented for this.
I do wish, however, that the Council would also take joint initiatives with the European Parliament on the international stage, because these issues are of the utmost importance to our future.
One day, when our membership has risen from 15 to a greater number of States, our clout will increase, and I believe that the link with the roots of the Union' s legitimacy in its Member States is an essential democratic requirement.
If we want to develop a global market for our goods, such an effort will ultimately affect all of us.
In other words, we must stand shoulder to shoulder as equal partners and strive for success.
Mr President, let me say that the Council values this opportunity to discuss with the honourable Members the important issue of how we are to design the Union' s trade policy in an effective but also an open and transparent manner.
In the discussion here in the Chamber, I have identified two distinct trends.
The first trend, represented by Mr Schwaiger among others, would require us to change the procedure.
I assume that Mr Schwaiger considers that we must change the rules.
Mr Clegg, on the other hand, who represents the second trend, says that the issue is not primarily about Article 133 but about the Council' s desire for openness in general.
However, I can see no other way of addressing this issue than actually working on the basis of what is laid down in the Treaty and Article 133.
As we live in a society based on the rule of law, we can do nothing other than proceed on the basis of what is said in the Treaty.
Of course, some might think that this should possibly have been changed.
I therefore reported on a little of the discussion surrounding the amendments to the text of the Treaty which took place in Nice, and there will of course be an opportunity to return to this question.
We have an Intergovernmental Conference coming up in 2004.
Mr Schwaiger hopes to see changes as early as in Laeken.
This might be a little optimistic but, as I have stated, there will be an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
Let us return to the discussion then.
So what opportunities do we have if we cannot achieve progress along formal lines?
Has the Council done enough to proceed along informal paths, keep Parliament up to date and give Parliament an opportunity to take part in the discussion?
Naturally, openness and consultation can always be improved, but it is with a certain amount of regret that I note that, on two occasions during the Swedish Presidency when we invited dialogue on the issues I mentioned earlier, no-one attended from Parliament.
There is an English expression "it takes two to tango" , and this also applies in this context.
The Council has demonstrated that we want dialogue.
Unfortunately, it appears that there was insufficient interest on the part of Parliament and on the part of the representatives of the committees concerned in taking part in such a dialogue.
I can only regret this.
It only gives us cause to maintain this dialogue to ensure that we obtain a consultation procedure which respects what is set out in the Treaty.
Otherwise, we will seek the informal paths which are open to us in order to obtain the democratic support we all desire on these important issues of trade policy.
Mr President, I would very willingly have let the debate proceed between Parliament and the Council, without any intervention by the Commission in this affair, an affair in which the Commission has a completely clear conscience, but Mr Clegg' s speech, and the slightly abrasive tone in which he made his remarks, make it necessary for me to provide a few explanations.
As far as procedure is concerned, I would remind you that the decision to launch a procedure of this type at the WTO forms part of the executive responsibility of the Commission.
We took this decision while fully complying with the rules set out in the Treaty, which are what they are unless and until they are changed.
The Commission, as you know, would like to change them, but the Council has decided otherwise and up to now, when it comes to amending the Treaty, it is the governments of the Member States who take the decision.
We therefore observed the procedures entirely correctly.
The 133 Committee, the consultative body of the Council, gave its support to the launching of this procedure in March, and it confirmed its position in June 2000.
As Mrs Mann and Mr Schwaiger have said, numerous discussions have taken place between the Commission and its staff and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the question of this WTO case.
I myself have responded to oral and written questions which have been raised by the Members of this House.
I have also met some Members in person in order to discuss the subject with them.
In order to make things quite clear and to add my own opinion to this debate, I would remind you, in case anyone needs reminding, that it was not a question of taking sides in favour of such and such a business, or in somebody' s individual interests, whether that would have been legitimate or not, but rather of assessing, from the point of view of the interests of the Union in general, the compliance of the American law on trade marks with the WTO Code.
That is why I believed, and I said so at the time before the Committee on Industry, that a parallel intervention by Members of Parliament in a WTO procedure seemed to me to be rather strange, even inappropriate, and I said at the time, and I shall say it to you again now, that I believe that a proper exchange of information between us should have the effect of avoiding any repetition of this type of incident in future.
Mr President, since Mr Danielsson addressed me directly, I should like to reply to two points.
Firstly, let me express my thanks to the Swedish Presidency for the recent invitation from the Swedish Ambassador in Brussels to informal talks with the members of the 'Article 133' Committee.
This, however, was a cocktail party, not a meeting, and I pointed out to several people, including the chairman of the ambassadors' group, that it was perhaps not an ideal arrangement to hold the event on a Thursday evening, when the Members of Parliament were returning to their constituencies at the end of a plenary week.
But these things can be rectified, and another weekday could be chosen next time.
That is the first point.
Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats.
Secondly, you said that things will have to be changed - not now but in 2004.
But please remember, Mr Danielsson, that we now have a round of international trade negotiations in Qatar, and we have a ministerial meeting at which the U.S. Congress will be represented.
The U.S. Congress, however, has not yet approved the 'fast track' proposal.
This means that the U.S. Congress currently has direct participatory powers in Qatar.
We in the European Parliament are no longer receiving sufficient information from you.
Compare your conduct, the conduct of the Swedish Presidency, with that of the members of the U.S. Administration, who now speak to the Members of Congress virtually on a daily basis, week in, week out.
You no longer have any national control; you no longer have any European control ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I am grateful for the fact that we are having this debate, but I should just like to make two points.
I am in the same boat as my fellow Members, in that I was only informed of one of the meetings to which the Council presidency invited us. We were, of course, delighted to receive the invitation.
But it was indeed a cocktail party on Thursday afternoon, with all the attendant difficulties.
When I arrived, the door was already closed.
There was something I had to discuss beforehand and could not make it for the start of the gathering.
It would be very good of you, Mr Danielsson, to make a proposal next time for a better arrangement that would enable all of us to be present.
As for the second meeting you mentioned, I should be grateful if you would remind us which meeting that was.
I know nothing about any other meeting.
Konrad Schwaiger did not refer to it, presumably because he knows nothing about it either.
Would you perhaps be so kind as to tell us which meeting it was that you invited our committee to attend?
There is another point on which I am at one with my fellow Members, and I know that this is not a question but a brief comment: I wish you would truly regard this Parliament as a heavyweight in the political ring and treat it accordingly.
We fully understand that we do not yet have the means or the right to demand such treatment, but I believe you can regard us from a political point of view as an equal partner.
Mr President, in my initial speech I mentioned the two informal meetings concerned.
The first took place on 29 May and the second on 31 May.
I am sorry that one of the dates was unsuitable.
At the same time I would like to point out that when it comes to the presence of the Council here in plenary session there is never any question of whether the date is suitable. The Council is expected to attend all the time, whatever the date.
Naturally, it is in the interest of the Council that we have a functioning informal dialogue with Parliament on these issues.
I have attempted to describe some of the measures taken by the Swedish Presidency.
I am convinced that the coming presidency will work in the same spirit.
Thank you very much, Mr Danielsson.
The debate is closed.
ASEM process
The next item is the report (A5Â­0207/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission Working Document: Perspectives and Priorities for the ASEM Process (Asia Europe Meeting) into the new decade [COM(2000) 241 - C5Â­0505/2000 - 2000/2243(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soon I will be joining the ranks of the trade politicians and then at least I will get an invitation to a cocktail party.
For the rest, however, I have no trouble at all in joining in this debate because in this very area which we are now called on to discuss, that is ASEM, we also have to ensure that we have increased parliamentary participation.
That is why we also propose in our report that there should be a second ASEP parliamentary conference before the ASEM IV Summit.
Clever executives always get parliaments involved when foreign policy or trade are at issue.
That is why we ask in this connection in the report - and this is one of the most important requests that we make - that the Council and in particular also the Commission should keep the European Parliament informed of developments in this area.
In particular, they should also report on the implementation of the decisions made at each meeting: this information could then be fed into a process of parliamentary supervision which could be used to speed up progress.
I believe that this is in the common interest because this particular initiative, ASEM, is of such exceptional importance.
If both groups - the European Union in Europe and ASEAN in Asia -, which are after all stable, work together with other states in Asia and manage to cooperate closely in such important areas as the three pillars identified within this process, namely political, economic and cultural dialogue, this can have undreamt-of implications for stability in these regions and throughout the world.
That is why I believe that we should take this ASEAN process as seriously as possible, place greater emphasis on it and make it a higher priority.
With your permission, I will illustrate this by way of a few examples.
If we manage to table a number of political proposals at the ASEM III Summit, which we are reporting on here, and then also in the run-up to ASEM IV - for example in the area of conflict prevention - then I believe that a considerable amount can be achieved here.
You only have to think of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan or North and South Korea.
I believe that together in a multilateral process of this kind we can make an important contribution to the situation developing peacefully and decisions being made which benefit the people in the region concerned, but also foster peaceful development in the world as a whole.
At this point, I should simply like to recall the issue of the proliferation of weapons, because we do actually have political contacts and relations with one or two of the ASEM members, or we have developed mutually dependent relationships with them, and through this it is possible to exert considerable influence to prevent the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and carrier weapons.
In this way we can make a contribution to world peace.
If we also succeed in internalising this political process and implementing the commitments made in respect of the rule of law, democracy and human rights there, then this is very significant, not only for human rights and the rule of law, but also for the stability of the whole region.
In the economic area, these two groups, which are working together in Asia, should also see to it that they use their combined weight to foster positive global economic development, by preparing for WTO negotiations together and by cooperating fruitfully in international fora and the UN.
They should ensure that there is greater stability in the field of financial services and, where trade agreements are concerned, they should ensure that social standards are gradually raised across the board so as to contribute to there being greater justice in this world.
If, in addition, we manage to be active in the third pillar, in the area of cultural relations, by involving people, groups and those working in the cultural sector, and in this way bring people together, because cultural relations do after all lead to ties being formed, then this would seem to be a further important starting point for making a decisive contribution to greater stability in our world.
We call on the Commission to table specific proposals for the next ASEM conference in its working document on the development plan for the ASEM process in the next decade and to discuss these with us.
Commissioner Patten, I am sure that we will do this in a joint dialogue drawing on your experience in this region, so that we will be able to make a contribution to creating a better world.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with what the committee chairman has just said: the ASEM process is an important framework for dialogue between EU states and Asian states.
But, quite honestly, we should also admit that the results of the ASEM III Summit in Seoul last year were not so terribly significant.
Many assertions remained very vague and if you look at how many of them have been put into practice you will see that we actually still have work to do on many of them.
In this respect I fully share the views of our committee chairman.
Commissioner, I think that we are acting as allies when we ask you to table a report on the preparations for ASEM IV, so that both of us - the Commission and Parliament - as we say in Hamburg, have a bit of butter with our fish, that is, actually introduce some substance into the preparations for ASEM IV in Copenhagen next year.
We would ask you to provide us with a very substantial report as soon as possible so that we can debate with you, but also with the Council, which areas further negotiations should really focus on.
Allow me to make one additional comment.
I should like to take up once more what Mr Brok said about conflict prevention, but also about conflict resolution.
We are in the business of helping each other.
I need only recall that the Japanese donate a considerable amount of development aid to south-eastern Europe - our area - so as to express their solidarity with us on matters of security policy, and we should not therefore shy away from taking part in discussions about conflict resolution or providing assistance in this respect either, whether it be in China, Taiwan, North Korea or South Korea.
There is one further comment which is on the tip of my tongue, Commissioner. Consider the following: this initiative involves ten Asian countries and fifteen European countries.
There will soon be eighteen or twenty countries on the European side.
We should maintain a balance. That is why I think it is important for us to consider to what extent it might be possible for the Asian side also to admit more members.
I believe, for example, that a country like India, which is significant on the one hand because of its abundant population but on the other because of its democratic structure and experience, could be a good partner.
Perhaps you could discuss this briefly with your Asian colleagues even in the run-up to ASEM IV, so that we have balanced coverage of both geographical areas.
I think that we agree here: we need to make it clear in the political discussion that Asia's relations with Europe are of decisive importance, and we should help each other in this respect.
In conclusion, I should once again like to refer to Mr Brok's opening comments.
Relations between states are of course negotiated formally by their governments.
But I would say to the Heads of State and Government: civil servants and ministers need the support of members of parliament.
That is why the committee's idea...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating Mr Brok warmly on his excellent report.
Along with the just focus on Europe and surrounding areas, and on the transatlantic dialogue, Asian relations should form the third pillar of the EU' s foreign policy.
We cannot afford to leave Asia in the care of the Americans, despite the fact that their military presence is far more conspicuous.
We have not reached that stage yet.
Irrespective of the geographical distance and cultural differences, there are major political points of discussion.
Fortunately, these are high on the agenda in the ASEM process.
The EU does well to continue to underline the human rights issue, even in cases of social abuse.
We do not believe in the universality of "Asian values" , and these are increasingly consigned to the background in the region itself, which is evident from the democratic breakthroughs of the past decade.
However, that does not eliminate the causes of conflicts, such as poverty and ethnic and religious conflicts.
I would refer to Indonesia, but also to the need for permanent intervention in the Korea issue.
We welcome the fact that the European Union is committed.
Alongside the US, Europe must claim a more global role. At the same time, we should not punch above our weight, for then we will remain bogged down in fine words.
Asia is large, and Asians will mainly need to solve their problems themselves.
The ASEM process, preferably enlarged to include a country such as India, must be more than a discussion forum.
We must strengthen the mutual interests on the basis of equality. That will bring Asia and Europe closer together.
Those interests are mainly in the economic field. That is where Europe can be of most significance, and there is great potential, given the interconnectedness of the world economy.
We would also call for a far more intensive cultural exchange to prevent the ASEM process from remaining an elitist affair.
If we draw in the reins more tightly, Europe will be able to better embed its expectations in permanent political dialogue.
The emphasis in this connection is on democracy and human rights.
However, we should not neglect the safety aspects.
Preventing the proliferation or spread of nuclear weapons also springs to mind, for example.
However, the ASEM process is not an alternative to sound bilateral relations with Asia' s major countries.
Asia cannot be compared to the European Union.
It is unclear which country will in time be at the helm in that region.
There are major paradoxes.
China is developing fast, but is not a democracy.
India is large, but vulnerable, and the Japanese engine is misfiring.
Europe can help improve regional perspectives, but that should not be at the expense of the direct involvement of the countries in that region.
Direct criticism pertaining to special situations should not get lost in multilateral declarations.
The region is not served by organised silence.
Mr President, we already talked last year about ASEM' s Summit in Seoul and, on behalf of my group, I then expressed my disappointment at the outcome, not about ASEM as such, and certainly not about the Commission' s attitude or about that of our Commissioner, which bore witness to a vision and was very intelligent.
We were disappointed about the attitude of our Council: the EU ministers had to be dragged to this Summit kicking and screaming.
One could be forgiven for thinking it was a Parliament meeting: that was the level of unwillingness that was displayed about going!
Their presence did not reveal any sense of involvement.
I therefore believe that the meeting was quite a bit weaker than it could otherwise have been.
It is, of course, understandable.
Ministers have to attend so many summit meetings: every other week, they have to attend some summit or other.
But if they started by handing over EU matters to the European Commission and the European Parliament, that would free up a considerable amount of time in their diaries and might well lead to decisions which the public could back more.
But that is another matter.
This resolution is not terribly exciting, except maybe for the point about issuing visas for authorities from Taiwan.
This is an important point, in our view.
It is odd, to say the least, that a President such as Mr Chen, who has, after all, been democratically elected, cannot enter the European Union, even in a private capacity.
The United States has been issuing visas in this connection for much longer.
We will no doubt be backing some amendments by the GUE Group.
But some of their other amendments seem to emanate from the Chinese friendship association, and we will not be supporting those.
We did find Mr Dupuis' original report exciting.
That report is truly radical in its appeal for a coherent strategy aimed at more democracy and the development of the rule of law, which is also important for the development of the economy.
We need no longer place the main focus of policy on China.
There is an entire region which is of importance to us, and expansion to include a country such as India, for example, would be crucial.
Finally, the ASEM process is of major importance to us.
We would also like to see MEPs become more involved.
We are looking forward to the talks on ASEM IV.
We hope and trust that the European Commission will be closely involving us in that process.
Mr President, this report has a somewhat turbulent history.
Initially it was a report which I in the committee saw as a diplomatic declaration of war on the People' s Republic of China, which was naturally not the intention.
Thanks to the combined efforts of the committee, the report has been radically amended and is now more to do with what its title indicated it was intended to be about.
It is largely acceptable to us in the Green Group but some problems still remain.
The first is point 21, which attacks the Chinese demographic policy which naturally has many different aspects.
The fact is, however, that it is in the process of being changed quite radically.
As recently as just a month or so ago the New York Times - of all papers - contained reportage which described in very positive terms how the one-child policy was being changed quite thoroughly and radically.
In this situation I think it is quite unnecessary of us in the European Parliament to attack the Chinese population policy as one-sidedly as in point 21.
The second problem is about visas for Taiwan' s top leaders.
I have to admit that I think this is quite difficult.
In Swedish debates I have criticised visas not being given to these top Taiwanese leaders.
On the other hand I have understood that the People' s Republic of China sees this as us attempting to change practice and more or less indirectly begin to recognise the State of Taiwan, which is no-one' s intention.
This is clearly problematic.
For my part I will abstain from the vote on this point.
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that the Committee on External Affairs has made an extraordinary effort to present a coherent report in accordance with the European Union' s objectives within the perspective of the ASEM process. It has done this, on the other one hand, by transforming the unfortunate and aggressive initial draft and, on the other, by taking on board that the agreements of the Third ASEM Conference in Seoul have replaced the initial proposals contained in the European Commission' s original document.
We cannot ignore the enormous importance for the world, globally, and for the European Union specifically, of the improvement in relations between these two regions of the world - the European Union and Asia. And this is the case in all respects: economic, social, cultural, scientific and political.
Despite the current conflicts and problems, Asia is the most dynamic region in the world.
It contains three giants: Japan, China and India, which are going to be increasingly important on the international stage.
Relations between the European Union and this region must therefore be particularly prudent and positive and at the same time help towards a negotiated and peaceful solution to the problems which are the result of an immediate past originating in the Cold War, as well as the colonial past.
The objective should be to contribute to the world enjoying a multipolar situation in which international law, peace and economic and social development - which is just and balanced - should have increasing importance, and human, union and social rights and democracy should flourish as an everyday reality.
China' s access to the World Trade Organisation has been important and the European Union must therefore maintain a special relationship with China in this respect.
We therefore believe that, at the Fourth Summit in Copenhagen, parliaments, both European and Asian, must play an ever more important role as representatives of popular sovereignty.
Mr President, the ASEM process has a twin role, politically speaking.
It offers the Asian and European government leaders the opportunity of consulting each other every two years on truly strategic problems.
And it is precisely this fixed regular forum that can have an inhibiting effect on aggressive, unilateral action taken by one of the ASEM participants.
That brings us to the real fear which various Asian States experience within the ASEM process: that of the Chinese pursuit of regional supremacy, including territorial demands.
A case in point is the on-going controversy regarding Beijing' s claim of sovereignty over the South China Sea.
Via multilateral forums, such as the ASEM process, those Asian countries hope to enhance, and mainly stabilise, existing bilateral relations with China.
It is therefore no wonder that these smaller Asian States advocate a higher level of commitment by the 15 EU Member States to the ASEM process.
I should like to add two minor observations regarding this resolution.
The first one concerns recital K, in which democratic Japan receives the very dubious honour of being blamed for an unprecedented, post-war political crisis and in which a very harsh judgment is passed on the country' s political establishment.
On account of Asian pride, and not just that of the Japanese, such an arrogant Western judgment is nothing short of a slap in the face.
From this angle, the European Parliament makes anything but a constructive contribution to the ASEM process.
In addition, various other Asian ASEM Members probably deal with much more serious domestic problems than that in this day and age.
The ever more strife-torn Indonesian archipelago is a case in point.
All in all, due to political imbalance and careless use of language, recital K is completely inappropriate.
Finally, I welcome Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the draft resolution, in which an appeal is made to the European Council and Commission, as well as to the other ASEM Members, for an Asian expansion of ASEM parallel to the approaching European enlargement, namely the forthcoming accession of the candidate countries to the Union.
Three countries are mentioned in this connection: India, Australia and New Zealand.
However, honourable European intentions collide here with Asian realities, or rather national sensitivities.
In Asian eyes, Australia and New Zealand are still seen as foreign bodies.
In short, their ASEM membership will require the necessary time and, probably, Europe' s power of persuasion.
As far as India is concerned, the People' s Republic of China is not what one would call hospitable.
From that point of view, national barriers still need to be lifted. Not only - as is currently so evident - in the EU' s enlargement process, but also in ASEM.
However, when good intentions are coupled with political action to match, we are certain to make headway in Europe and Asia, even jointly, in fact.
Mr President, Commissioner, in October 2000, in Seoul ASEM leaders gave a commitment to support human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as a cornerstone of future Asia/Europe cooperation.
However, our own actions rarely live up to our promises.
In the past, too many Member States have paid lip-service to the idea, but where there is a choice between trade and defence of human rights, economic self-interest has always taken precedence.
Furthermore, where a small country is involved, we have been quick to criticise, but when the offender is a large country, such as China, our response has been much more muted and I very much welcome Commissioner Patten's recent remarks in this regard.
Therefore, I support the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report which calls for any state to be excluded which clearly fails to respect human rights, democracy and the rule of law from ASEM activities.
I also welcome the proposal for the political pillar of ASEM to encourage political dialogue in several areas, including between China and Taiwan.
If we want to play a role in this and want to be seen as honest brokers, then all Member States should follow the recommendation of this report and grant visas to the Taiwanese President and members of the government for private visits to the EU.
I welcome the reference to resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka given my recent involvement in this area as head of the EU electoral observation mission.
Over 70 000 Sri Lankans have died in this conflict since 1973 and any initiative to prevent further loss of life would be very worthwhile.
To conclude these brief remarks, I commend the Brok report to the House.
Mr President, this report makes it possible for the European Parliament to debate the ASEM process and comment on its results.
This new partnership between Europe and Asia gives both sides a golden opportunity to deepen and strengthen relations, in respect not only of the economy, but also political, social and cultural matters.
As early as the third ASEM Summit in Seoul political aspects such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law were successfully promoted from being the subject of a fruitful dialogue between the partners in the ASEM process to prompting relevant undertakings from leading ASEM politicians.
It will come as no surprise to anyone to learn that our Parliament, which has made these values the focus of its work for years, attaches quite particular importance to these same values being respected by the Council and the Commission and to the Council and the Commission doing all they can to make these values part and parcel of the ongoing political dialogue with our Asian partners in the ASEM process.
At a time when the European Union is almost talking about nothing else but enlargement, it is, I believe, very appropriate to say that this ASEM process and the circle of partners within it should also be extended to include states like India, which might also be deemed to have earned a place in this dialogue.
I should like to address two points which, in my view, have wrongly become the subject of talks with and occasional protests on the part of the Chinese Embassy.
Our requiring Taiwan's politicians to have visas for private visits to Europe does not amount to recognition of the Republic of Taiwan or in fact anything at all; it is the pursuance of a consistent policy which Europe has on the freedom of movement of people, consistent in particular if in the future Taiwan were also to follow in China's footsteps and become a member of the World Trade Organisation.
Finally, Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to an old demand of the European Parliament: we have always said that with a region such as Taiwan, with which we in Europe have very intensive economic relations, our relations are such as to warrant a representation, that is an information office, being set up there.
Mr President, rapprochement and cooperation will only be successful if we strive for mutual respect and partnership in the Asia process.
We know how much effort Parliament has put into producing this report.
I should like to point out a number of facts.
Firstly, the history of the 20th Century has left deep wounds in Asia which have not yet healed.
The bloody suppression of the Boxer Uprising in China, the occupation of Manchuria, the Korean War and the aggression against Vietnam are all inextricably linked with the names of states which belong to the exclusive club of the great countries of this world: the USA, Germany and Japan.
The EU has a peculiar way of perceiving the role and responsibility of states if, given this historical background, it wishes for example to assign Japan a kind of policeman's role in Asia.
It is equally disconcerting that the EU is not distancing itself more decisively from the confrontation course which the USA is adopting, for example with its spy planes, against China.
I should like to make a second point. In Asia, the future depends largely on there being harmonious relations and a balance of interests between China, India and also Russia.
Any attempts to play these countries off against each other would seem to me to be very dangerous, including and even in particular for Europe!
A sustainable Asian policy must be directed at partnership and constructive dialogue, and not least with the People's Republic of China.
Anyone who relies now on short-term interests and gaining a quick advantage will not in the long term be able to make a decisive political contribution to establishing peace, cooperation and partnership between Europe and Asia.
Mr President, the two superpower system fell apart when one of the superpowers broke up.
At the start of this new decade, a new multipower system is gradually taking shape before our very eyes and, as the European Union, we should make this our strategic choice.
In this sense, this proposal for the coming decade is clearly a political proposal with strategic overtones.
The single superpower system has entered its next stage and is being replaced by a multipower system and it is precisely at this stage that we, the European Union, should strengthen all the regional initiatives which bring about the rule of law, which bring about economic growth, which bring about social justice and which allow any differences to be resolved peacefully and without conflict.
Ãsia, which is the subject of today's debate, is an area in which numerous regions - Pakistan, India, Indonesia and others - are in conflict.
These conflicts have complicated root causes.
And we, whose job is to send a message not just to the nations of Europe with ideological and political problems, but to the entire world, must act as a force for peace, as a force for cooperation, as a force for progress and as a force for democracy by strengthening the procedures which civilise the world without creating conflict, without there being any cause for conflict and without starting by using military conflict or considerations in order to bring about democratic results.
In this sense, the committee report presented by Mr Brok is a serious text, far more serious than the Commission proposal, which will, I think, adhere closely to it, within the bounds of what is viable, in order to bring about the anticipated political results.
Mr President, no-one can object to equal relations being developed between all countries.
That is not the point.
Despite the amendments made to the original Dupuis report, the guiding spirit behind the Brok report is still crass intervention in the internal affairs of the ASEM countries in the name of the so-called rule of law, human rights etc. etc.
And just what human rights can anyone who proposes such things as respect for the world trade order be talking about?
Crass intervention in purely internal affairs in the countries in the area up to and including condemnation of the democratic policy of the People's Republic of China, a country which the European Union has obviously set its sights on.
Conspicuous by its absence is any reference whatsoever to the fact that peace in the area is in jeopardy now that the United States has stepped up its aggression towards China, as seen in the NMD, the new US defence philosophy, flights on spying missions, the visits by the Dalai Lama and the President of Taiwan.
But the report does not omit to call - twice - for visas to be granted to members of the government of Taiwan, thereby mimicking the American tactic on this issue.
I need hardly add that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this report.
Mr President, both of these regions of the world, the European Union - or Europe - and Asia have opened up channels between each other and moved closer together.
As sensational as the first ASEM Summit was, relations in very many areas are in fact now perceived as normal.
It is particularly when I think of cultural relations and of the very fruitful work of the Asia-Europe Foundation in Singapore that I sometimes realise that there are more encounters involving schools, students, scientists and also managers than involving politicians.
That is why I should like to recall once more here that this European Parliament once said - and on one occasion it also made this a reality - that in the same way that there was a summit between governments there should be a summit between parliaments.
I believe that it is absolutely essential for contacts between parliaments in Europe and Asia to be intensified and that, before the next ASEM Summit in Copenhagen at the latest, we should put in place a stringent process to monitor these important joint political initiatives, even if some of them are based on conflicting principles.
I really believe that this is essential because both regions are playing an important part in reforming the United Nations and also the World Trade Organisation.
It is also in both regions' interests for progress to be made on security for their people and mankind in general.
I am thinking here both of food safety and the fight against organised crime.
There really is no limit to the forms which cooperation might take here, and in this respect Europe really needs to move forward.
We are fortunate to have been able to initiate a process of reflection on security policy in ASEAN and throughout the Asian area.
A further matter which is of concern to me is that we should help to combat trafficking in human beings.
We are now faced with a situation where millions of people have been abducted, and they are no longer only women and children but also men.
I think that both regions of the world have a responsibility here to put an end to this form of freedom of movement on this earth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate draws to a close allow me to point out that there are considerable expectations of the way in which the European Union acts in this important part of the world.
It is not the case that we are free to decide with no adverse consequences whether to become involved there or whether to opt out; no, the countries in this part of Asia have very particular and well-founded expectations that the Europeans will become engaged in their part of the world.
These expectations exist because there the power of the United States of America in terms of both the economy and security is an established fact and because China is next door and is gaining increasing influence.
In this power play, the expectations of many states in South-East Asia are focused on the Europeans considering establishing what the Asians call a strategic partnership, obviously with the aim of producing greater stability and creating a balance between the major powers there in the interests of the Asian states.
These have had their first experiences of rapid economic growth which was then slowed by the crisis, and now they see that they have an opportunity to leave this crisis behind.
At the same time they realise how essential it is for them to find their way out of the crisis in partnership with others, and not least with the European Union.
That is why, as I have said, it is not simply a question of our own interests, how and on what conditions we get involved there; instead we are in a situation where expectations are pinned on us.
That is why we are not free either to say, no we will do that or we will leave that; we are obliged to become involved in this part of the world.
This opens up huge possibilities.
If we behave there, not as colonialists as we did in the past, but as partners who are prepared to contribute their own experiences alongside those of another continent, we will be listened to.
Under no circumstances must we Europeans let this opportunity pass us by!
First of all may I thank the House for the attention that honourable Members are paying, not only to relations between the European Union and Asia, but also to the ASEM process in particular.
The significant interest that this report has triggered also demonstrates how important Asia is for our Union, a point very well made by a number of speakers.
As I am sure the House will understand, this is a subject on which I have certain views myself.
The Commission shares to a very large extent the evaluation and concerns expressed in the report, in particular those regarding the importance of further strengthening our dialogue with Asian-ASEM partners on political, as well as on economic and social issues.
We also think that ASEM should be concentrating upon issues of global concern.
One issue that we keep coming back to is the importance that we attach to the three pillars, political, economic and cultural-social, developing at the same pace.
Some of our Asian partners are more interested in having a predominantly economic dialogue, letting the political dialogue lag behind.
The Asian partners fear interference in their internal affairs and see the different levels of development as an obstacle to the advocated partnership of equals.
The Commission does not share this view and nor do other European partners.
Development cooperation itself is, of course, dealt with in other fora, but ASEM is and should remain a forum for dialogue among equal partners.
A few weeks ago I attended the third ASEM foreign ministers meeting in Beijing.
We addressed a multitude of issues.
We did not agree on all of them, but there would be no point in having a dialogue if we saw everything identically.
At the same time, the need to improve the management of the ASEM process is extremely clear.
These very broad agendas - there were 19 items on our agenda for the foreign ministers' meeting - lead to a lack of focus.
That is why we have proposed to cluster activities.
That is why we have suggested informal, retreat-style meetings for the highest level of participants to allow them to concentrate upon a few key issues.
These issues should have some ASEM added value; in other words it must make sense to deal with them on a bi-regional level.
There seems to be a high degree of consensus on the need for reform.
We agreed on the need to cut down on pre-prepared speeches and pre-cooked and usually over-boiled chairmen's statements, which no one ever reads.
I become profoundly suspicious of the added value of meetings where most of the real dialogue takes place beforehand in discussions on the joint statement to be issued, and at which as many people are present as at a less important football match in my own country.
We need more focus, more dialogue, and more concentration on the principal participants and on fewer subjects.
There should be more scope for free discussion and bilateral meetings.
For example, I had a very useful first exchange with the new Thai foreign minister and we also held European Union troika meetings with Indonesia and with China.
Another positive step forward is that our Asian partners seem more inclined to increase the involvement of civil society.
We have also discussed the importance of involving parliamentarians in the process.
Young parliamentarians have met under the auspices of ASEF, the Asia-Europe foundation.
Perhaps it is time to go further and revive exchanges between parliamentarians from the ASEM countries, so I warmly welcome the intention to call a second Asia-Europe parliamentary meeting before the Copenhagen Summit in 2002.
I was delighted by the calls for greater involvement of Parliament in the ASEM process.
This is the third time that I have had the opportunity to discuss ASEM in Parliament.
The first occasion was a very intimate one, there were two other Members of the House present that evening with me.
We shared a sort of post-candlelight supper together.
The second occasion we discussed ASEM, there were three other Members of Parliament in the Chamber with me. Today we have seen what can only be seen as an exponential growth in the interest in ASEM and I hope that before my five years are up on 22 January 2005 the Chamber will be packed when we discuss the relationship with ASEM and with Asia as a whole.
I note the request for a new working document in advance of the Copenhagen ASEM meeting and I hope we will be able to have something further to say on EU-Asia relations generally.
I expect to return to Parliament shortly to discuss a new communication intended to update the 1994 Asia strategy.
This is scheduled for adoption by the Commission in July and it will provide us with an occasion for a wider debate on EU-Asia relations.
It will need to cover the sort of points raised by a number of Members in this debate, including the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Mr Marset Campos.
Our recent visit to the Korean peninsula demonstrated that the European Union has considerable interests well beyond the arc of instability which surrounds the Union from Kaliningrad in the north to the southern Caucasus in the south.
My own recent visit to China demonstrated the importance of the European Union there too.
It is worth recalling that today China has a 45 billion euro trade surplus with the European Union.
When I was in China I was delighted that I was able to meet members of the Chinese Parliament who, like me, expressed wonder at some of the continuing evidence of Chinese economic development.
But, as Mr Cushnahan said, we have to talk about other issues as well as trade and commercial relations.
We cannot have a frank political dialogue with China without having an equally frank exchange about human rights.
That is not meant to sound superior and we are not asserting that Europe somehow has a monopoly of wisdom on human rights. But it is our unshakeable view that human rights have universal validity and that a dialogue about human rights is appropriate in all our relationships.
I noted what the honourable Member said about the development of our external services in Asia.
I hope that is a point we will be able to be more open about in a few weeks' time in the communication we are about to discuss.
I could have talked about Japan. I could have talked about South-East Asia.
There are a number of subjects which we need to discuss in more detail.
There are many reasons for arguing, as the honourable Member did a few moments ago, that the relationship we have with Asia is an exceptionally important part of our external relations overall.
I very much hope that in the coming weeks and months we will have many further opportunities of discussing it in this House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Development of the external service
The next item is the report (A5-0199/2001) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on the development of the external service (COM(2000) 456 - C5-0629/2000 - 2000/2292(COS)).
Mr President, despite the changes, or perhaps because of them, we in the Community institutions must reaffirm our political commitment to strengthening integration.
The European Parliament has often reiterated the need for the European Union to play a solid role on the international stage and to be able to speak consistently in that context.
To this end, the Maastricht reform drew up the CFSP and for the same purpose various proposals are currently being considered with a view to 2004.
Nevertheless, for the European Union to consolidate its external role, it is necessary, firstly, to organise and strengthen the external policy instruments which the Union already has and, in particular, its external service.
We must accept that the external service, which currently has such important functions, suffers from numerous shortcomings which have not been surmounted, despite the reforms promoted by the European Commission itself, and, therefore, this Parliament last September approved the own-initiative report 'Common European Diplomacy' , with a view to greater efficiency in the exercise of the Union' s external policy.
At that time we proposed moving ahead decisively on three fronts: firstly, improving the training of Community officials destined to be involved in external activity through the creation, eventually, of a Community diplomatic school and the linking of national diplomatic corps through a system of 'walkways' which would be created for that purpose. Secondly, we proposed the clarification and development of the legal status of delegations, their role and their relationship with the institutions; and, lastly, we proposed the improvement of the coordination between the delegations and the external services of the Member States, for which we suggested, amongst other things, promoting the grouping together of the missions of Member States who so desire with the Commission' s delegation whenever, wherever and however possible.
At that time, Commissioner Patten told this House that he would consider those recommendations very carefully and would prepare a communication on the external services during the first half of 2001, which we are eagerly awaiting.
However, while waiting for more ambitious initiatives, Parliament must now give its opinion on the latest communication from the Commission on the development of the external service, which clearly has a much more limited objective, since it basically focuses on the network of delegations and their staff.
It is a welcome communication nevertheless, since it allows us to open a debate on that important issue.
In this communication the Commission confirms its will to make progress on decentralisation and on the deconcentration of external aid.
This can only be seen as positive even though it requires greater human resources and therefore an increase in costs, which, I believe, we must contribute to.
We indicate, however, that not all the difficulties in the operation of the delegations and the management of external aid are caused by the lack of resources.
The Commission must also adopt additional measures, such as contracting policies, training plans and a review of procedures.
With regard to the network of delegations, the Commission' s proposal to move ahead with regionalisation seems appropriate, although we must consider opening up new delegations in certain countries of South-East Asia, the Gulf region and Latin America, as well as Switzerland.
In this context, we must express our concern at the recent rumour that the Commission is considering the possibility of closing its delegation in Costa Rica.
I therefore take a positive view of this communication from the Commission.
I believe that it takes us in the right direction, but it clearly does not fully deal with the issue.
We hope that in the coming weeks the Commission will approve a new communication, a more ambitious one, which takes account of the opinions of Parliament and finally allows us to rationalise, organise and improve the external service, so that it may become an effective instrument for a solid European Union external policy.
Mr President, I would like to make it quite clear that we are in favour of both the general lines of the policy proposed by the Commission and the general lines of the report which Mr Galeote Quecedo has just mentioned.
When I say 'we' , I mean, of course, the Committee on Budgets.
The Committee on Budgets simply wishes to draw the attention of all those involved to two basic problems.
Firstly, there is the need to move quickly.
We believe that the reform should be carried out rapidly and ambitiously.
Reform means increasing deconcentration and grouping together a certain number of delegations which are fewer in number but better equipped administratively and extended by branch offices with minimum representation.
