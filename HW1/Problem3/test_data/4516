The Portuguese Presidency appreciates this opportunity to exchange thoughts on the possibility of an operation being conducted in the framework of the ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) in eastern Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic.
The Darfur conflict remains one of the main priorities of the EU's foreign policy.
We are pleased with the recent progress made and, in particular, and firstly, the announcement that discussions will begin on 27 October, under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union Special Envoy, to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that will increase the prospects for peace in Darfur.
Secondly, we also regard as positive the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1769 creating the UNAMID (AU/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur), which will add a new dynamic to the efforts made to resolve the conflict in Darfur.
However, in order for these efforts to produce results, the Darfur conflict must be tackled within a wider regional perspective.
The conflict's negative impact on the humanitarian and security situation in neighbouring countries, in particular Chad and the Central African Republic, is cause for very particular concern.
In our opinion, a lasting solution to the conflict in Darfur cannot be found without stabilising the situation in these neighbouring countries.
As you know, in its conclusions of 23 July the Council emphasised the urgent need to address the destabilising impact of the Darfur crisis on the humanitarian and security situation in neighbouring countries and reiterated its support for the deployment of a multidimensional UN presence in eastern Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic.
The Council also decided to continue working on a possible decision on a bridging operation, in the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy, to support this multidimensional UN presence with a view to improving security in those areas.
Preparations for such an operation have been ongoing throughout the summer.
On 12 September the Council adopted the crisis management concept that defines the main planning parameters of this bridging operation.
Particular emphasis is placed on the objective of protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, and of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid by increasing security in the region.
With regard to the internal political situation in these two countries, the Council considers that the mission should maintain its independence, impartiality and neutrality.
Planning based on this concept is in hand, in accordance with the EU's crisis management procedures.
The next steps to be taken will be the approval of a common action on the concept of the operation and the operational plan, including determining the composition of the force.
The operation will last one year and it is expected that it will be replaced by a multinational UN mission.
Any ESDP operation in Chad and the Central African Republic must be based on a UN Security Council resolution and will be conducted in strict consultation with the UN and our African partners.
We in the EU welcome the statement made by the President of the UN Security Council on 27 August in which he indicated the readiness of the Security Council to authorise the establishment of a multidimensional presence in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic.
Any EU operation to Chad and the Central African Republic must be complemented by political initiatives to tackle the regional dimension of the Darfur conflict.
In particular, any efforts aimed at normalising relations between Chad and Sudan should be supported, in accordance with the Tripoli and Riyadh Agreements.
Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic should also be encouraged to respect the commitments they made in terms of not supporting the rebel movements operating from their territories against any of the other countries.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with yesterday's adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1778/2007 on the deployment of an international force in the eastern part of Chad and in the north-east of the Central African Republic the door is now open for the Council of the European Union to give its approval, within the next few days, to an ESDP operation in these countries.
This is clearly a major development and I believe it is to be welcomed.
The regions targeted by the operation are currently in a state of general instability and insecurity that is affecting hundreds of thousands of civilians, who are forced to live in conditions of extreme vulnerability.
As you know, this situation cannot solely be explained by the knock-on effect that the Darfur crisis is having on Chad and the Central African Republic.
There are also endogenous reasons, peculiar to these two countries, especially in the case of Chad.
Stability in these areas of Chad and the Central African Republic can only be assured if international action, and especially that taken by the European Union, incorporates a number of factors.
These include, firstly, the quality of the military and police presence in Chad and in the CAR, secondly the adoption of an approach that is not exclusively based on security but also includes the provision of aid and the establishment of political structures, and finally the capacity to confine and contain any interference by Sudan and the Darfur region in Chad and the Central African Republic.
Let me deal with the first point: this is an area that comes under the second pillar.
Members of the Council have expressed their views on this matter and doubtless will have more to say in the days ahead.
One important element that has to be taken into account in the deployment of such a European protection force is obviously the need to protect the humanitarian zone.
This is why my staff at ECHO have been working closely with the Council's military planners with a view to ensuring that the relevant mandates are respected and that there is a high level of cooperation between the military and the humanitarian agencies.
We have in particular insisted that the liaison officers of the European protection force should be present on the ground in order to ensure close links and a permanent exchange of information with the humanitarian organisations.
I will now move on to the second point.
The aid measures provided by the Commission cover three aspects.
The first comprises a security backup for the Chadian police operation, under the direction of the United Nations.
This essentially constitutes funding for the training of 800 Chadian police officers who will be responsible for maintaining order in the camps that have been set up for refugees and displaced persons.
It is crucial that this police action is exemplary.
It is also very important that it is well received by the local people.
For this purpose, funding to the amount of some EUR 10 million is to be provided by the stability instrument before the end of 2007.
Now I will turn to the humanitarian measures.
In 2007 the Commission allocated EUR 30.5 million for emergency humanitarian aid and for multisectoral aid programmes designed to help the refugees and internally displaced populations as well as the host communities in Chad.
The Central African Republic received EUR 8 million in aid and similar amounts have been allocated for 2008.
The third element concerns reintegration and rehabilitation.
Additional funding from the 9th European Development Fund of about EUR 13.1 million are to be mobilised in the short term for Chad and the Central African Republic.
The programme is intended as a continuation of ECHO's activities in pursuing a strategy for rehabilitation and the transition to development.
Ladies and gentlemen, these aid measures are necessary but must at the same time be linked to actions involving the political process.
If lasting stability is to be assured, the actions being taken at international and European level need to be supplemented by various other activities associated with the restoration of the rule of law, the revival of economic governance, the reform of the legal and security systems, and the pursuit of political dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
It goes without saying that this is an important element, especially in view of the 2009 elections.
The Commission will continue to promote this global approach in Chad and in the Central African Republic.
By the same token the Commission is fully active in trying to resolve the Darfur conflict, not only by providing humanitarian aid and help for reconstruction but also by lending support to the process of negotiation and mediation, in which we are obviously very much involved.
In this regard I recently informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, and the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr KonarÃ©, that the Commission would be contributing to the Darfur Trust Fund in support of the negotiations.
Moreover, the Commission is also financing initiatives aimed at ensuring that Darfurian society is involved in and committed to the process of conflict resolution.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian situation in Chad, especially along the country's 1 360 km border with Sudan but also in the area bordering the Central African Republic, in my view makes intervention by the international community necessary.
I myself was in Chad a few days ago and was able to form an impression of the situation there.
More than 400 000 refugees and displaced persons are hosted in camps in this border area.
These camps are permanently under threat from bandits and marauding gangs but also from the Janjaweed militia from Sudan.
The situation in the open country is even more difficult.
Due to the lack of security there, more and more people are seeking refuge in the camps.
To help alleviate the plight of these people, the security situation in the region must be improved so that they can return to their homes.
This is a difficult challenge, and in order to manage it, burden-sharing is essential.
The United Nations has committed to helping to develop the police force, which can then partner the security forces.
The European Union, on the other hand, was asked to provide troops with the capability to ward off the Janjaweed and the bandits and prevent attacks on the refugees, displaced persons and the civilian population.
With this draft resolution, the European Parliament endorses this operation, albeit subject to the following conditions: firstly, as you have pointed out, Mr President, Commissioner, political negotiations must continue, for ultimately we need a political solution.
If we send troops, however, they must have a robust mandate which genuinely enables them to deter the Janjaweed and the bandits.
A very large area needs to be secured.
The force must therefore also be large enough to achieve a genuine improvement in the security situation.
It must be clear that this is a European force involving several European nations.
EUFOR must also be adequately equipped to fulfil its mandate.
In view of the relatively low troop strength and the size of the border area, this means that outstanding intelligence and transport capabilities are required, for the force must be able to determine quickly where there is a threat and must be able to reach the relevant location swiftly.
Under no circumstances should a situation arise in which, due to the mandate itself or to equipment deficits, a European force in Chad could only protect itself without being able to fulfil its real mandate.
A further condition imposed by the European Parliament is that a clear exit strategy must be defined which should foresee how and by whom EUFOR is replaced after its intended operational duration of one year.
In the present draft resolution the European Parliament also emphasises that in the light of the complex political situation in the region, this European force in Chad should act as a neutral force for security and the protection of the civilian population.
The deployment of EUFOR last year in Congo made it clear how important credible impartiality and independence can be for the success of an operation.
In the present situation, by deploying a force for a limited period of one year, the European Union can make an important contribution to improving the humanitarian situation and supporting the African Union as it takes on more responsibility in the region.
Both these aspects are necessary, and so I ask you to vote in favour of the present resolution.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Security Council Resolution 1778, which was adopted yesterday, determines that the situation in the region of the border between Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
This Parliament's motion for a resolution recognises the urgency of the situation and the European Union's responsibility to provide protection.
An overwhelming majority of Members in this House agree with the humanitarian NGOs on the ground, with the refugees in the region who are living in miserable conditions and in a climate of permanent fear, and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
All cite the urgent need for an international presence in that region, which must include a strong military component.
There is no country or multilateral organisation that is better suited than the European Union to effectively fulfil the mandate given by Resolution 1778.
The ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) has come of age and exists for these very emergencies.
In this context, as regards sending an EU military force to the region, the Council and the Portuguese Presidency can count on the support in principle of Parliament.
However, the European Parliament must express its concern about certain aspects of this mission.
Firstly, we fear that the reluctance of Member States to provide the force with the minimum personnel and military equipment needed will greatly reduce its effectiveness.
We would add that the smaller the contributions of the other Member States, the more noticeable the French component of the force will be.
However, the perception of this mission's impartiality is fundamental to its success and France is not regarded as a neutral player in the region.
Secondly, Parliament asks that this force be accompanied by a diplomatic offensive in the region in order to move forward the national reconciliation processes within Chad and the Central African Republic.
The roots of the instability, although linked to the drama in Darfur, are also domestic and can only be overcome through internal political processes.
As stated by Parliament's motion for a resolution, without a genuine political reconciliation process in the region, the European Union operation, planned to last only 12 months, cannot sustainably contribute to peace in the region.
Finally, this Parliament welcomes the mandate of the force which will act under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
It is essential that this mandate is correctly interpreted on the ground and that the European troops are proactive in protecting civilians in danger, creating a humanitarian area for the international organisations and protecting the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).
Recent history is full of tragic examples, from Kigali to Srebrenica, of defenceless civilian populations paying the ultimate price for the timidity and overscrupulousness of international troops.
We hope that one day this operation will be used as a model example of the ESDP and effective multilateralism in action and as due evidence of the European Union's desire to strengthen the United Nations and contribute to conflict resolution in accordance with international law and the responsibility to protect enshrined therein.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have already said several times, the UN Security Council yesterday voted unanimously to develop a multidimensional presence in east Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic for one year.
This will consist of a civil and police UN mission that we will call MINURCAT following the UN and a military mission of the European Union, EUFOR, which will support and protect it.
This European security and defence mission will operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and that is extremely important because it means that it will be able to use all means to fulfil its task and it means that it will have a robust mandate, which is what Parliament expressly wanted.
That increases the chance of the mission succeeding but it also substantially increases its and our responsibility.
We have repeatedly expressed our concern in Parliament about the situation in Darfur and our alarm at the expansion of the lack of security and instability into neighbouring territories and the whole region.
More than 1 million people have been forced to flee, either inside their own country or across the borders.
They are exposed to all manner of hardship and acts of violence, with women and children usually suffering the most.
In addition, this situation is threatening the fragile peace agreements reached both in Chad and in the Central African Republic, because as well as the political rebels, ordinary bandits see it as their opportunity to rob, abuse and murder the civilian population.
EUFOR's task will, therefore, be anything but simple.
However, before we can talk about that, we have to think about assembling those troops, as Mrs Gomes has said, and not only putting the force together but equipping it too.
The moment of truth is dawning for every Member State, including my own: the moment when, as well as fine words and noble statements, we have to deliver the goods in terms of soldiers and material.
That also holds good for Parliament.
We insisted, rightly, on thorough information and we have used our powers to give documented and substantiated advice.
We were able to do that partly because we had a lengthy exchange of views last week with General Leaky.
Our advice is positive.
It will be our job and our responsibility to ensure that the mission can get underway as soon as possible and in the best of circumstances.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Madam President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I would like to stress that we support the ESDP military mission within the largest peace-keeping mission in the world, in Chad and the Central African Republic.
We are talking about the most serious cross-border humanitarian crisis in the world.
In fact, the UN Security Council ought to have taken action much earlier.
The four-year delay has cost the lives of 200 000 people, 2.5 million people have been driven from their homes, and brutal attacks are being carried out on providers of humanitarian aid.
We can predict that the scale of the crisis triggered by the Darfur conflict will make it possible to test the European Union's political will, as well as its military capacity.
A few days ago General D. Leakey assured Members that, regardless of funding problems and the difficulties in anticipating all possible threats and risks that could arise during the operation, in military terms the European Union was capable of carrying out this operation no worse than in Bosnia, and from a military viewpoint the operation would be less intense.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here are some more figures relating to what we are talking about: 230 000 refugees, plus a further 170 000 internally displaced persons and an estimated 700 000 people who are indirectly at risk from attacks.
We are here to close this gap, this vacuum, in the protection.
That must be the focus of the European mission.
Since yesterday, the condition of a robust mandate has been in place.
The issue of neutrality is not resolved.
At the moment, it looks as if the French troops already deployed in Chad will merely be boosted by a few countries. This puts both the neutrality and the success of the mission at risk.
What I want particularly from the Foreign Ministers who have to decide on Friday, however, is for them to ensure that the operational area of the EUFOR mission is clearly defined.
This is still not the case at present.
It would be a disaster if this mission were not permitted to operate where the help is most urgently needed, namely in the border area.
I expect the European Union to negotiate with the regime in Chad and ensure that it has the right to operate along the 35 km border as well.
Otherwise, this is a fig-leaf operation which could even put more people at risk.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, to clarify, this is an ESDP mission in Chad and the Central African Republic under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; in other words, it is a military operation.
It is not about Sudan and Darfur.
The French Government wants this EU mission at all costs.
It wants to provide the Force Headquarters and the Operation Headquarters itself.
The German and the British Governments are very sceptical.
French troops are already deployed in Chad.
It is quite clear that France is acting as a protection force for the governments in Chad and the Central African Republic and now simply wants to embellish its engagement there with the EU logo.
The French troops are not neutral; on the contrary, they are obviously biased.
For example, they have bombed rebels operating in the country.
The rebel leaders have announced that if the EU force is not neutral, they will wage a war against these troops.
I have now heard that the Nordic Battle Group is not available, and the UN resolution calls for open cooperation with the military and the police in Chad.
It is obviously the case that Chad and the Central African Republic are not democracies.
Refugee return is not part of the mandate of this EU force and this mission is - to be frank - extremely dangerous.
As a group, we will be voting against the resolution tabled, because we believe that the situation will not improve but will deteriorate further as a result of this operation.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, let me clarify for the benefit of Mr PflÃŒger and the others: the mandate of the EU force is humanitarian in nature and consists of ensuring the safety of refugees from Chad and Darfur, also by military means.
The UN Security Council has endorsed the deployment of a UN-mandated European force and the consequence is that the European Union is immediately under international scrutiny to determine what it is actually capable of achieving in foreign policy and military terms.
This operation entails both a risk and an opportunity: it is a risk due to the extremely difficult political parameters in this conflict-laden region, but on the other hand, it also offers the opportunity to show that the European Union has developed foreign policy and military capabilities and can genuinely act to protect refugees in this region.
At present, however, and this view is shared by many, the risk is greater than the opportunity.
That is why the European Parliament has drawn up a list of conditions, which have already been outlined: from the time-limited mandate to precise definitions of targets and tasks, the proper preparation and technical equipment for EUFOR troops, and the granting of an operational mandate including an exit strategy.
Naturally, we must expect this operation not only to be approved but also supported by the local governments so that it is successful.
However, and I believe we all agree on this point, if all these conditions which the European Parliament has set are fulfilled, the prospects of success are greater than the risk, and we can approve the mission.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am satisfied with this draft resolution and with the decision that it upholds and I would also like to say something else: when man's brutality leads to tragedy and suffering on the scale that we have seen in Darfur, then our conscience demands solidarity.
I am profoundly pleased that the European Union is responding to the appeal made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Many Members and diplomats, including my friend and colleague Mrs Gomes just now, have stressed that this operation must under no circumstances be allowed to look like an opportunity to support French interests or to extend France's military presence in the region.
I hope that I am surprising no one when I too give my vigorous support to this view.
Speaking as a former Prime Minister, may I say with some conviction that if France is still present in this region it is simply because of her significant historical heritage, where the burden of colonialism has been such that a policy of solidarity with the people is needed to try to help them regain peace and stability and to herald the start of effective governance.
France no longer has any strategic or economic interests in these regions and I am one of those who would have preferred to see us withdraw a long time ago: that would have saved a lot of money and would really have been in our own interest.
Even the uranium resources of the Niger do not constitute a strategic interest of kingly proportions, but simply require sufficient peace and stability so that these deposits can be made accessible to everyone and a competitive market can be established.
This then is essentially a European peacekeeping operation, not a French one, and that is the way it should be.
I would add a word of warning, however: this vision will only be made reality if a large number of European Member States agree to send troops.
It would be damaging if the spirit of solidarity, which for historical reasons has placed greater demands on France than on others to the extent that we have the largest contingent, were to be turned by your absence into a climate of post-colonial suspicion. That would be senseless and I would take great exception to it.
Let me end with the following remark.
The oral amendment tabled this morning by our fellow Member Mr Gahler is for once - sadly for him - not relevant.
The Republic of Chad, by way of its Foreign Minister, gave its agreement in principle to this operation in a written communication that was sent to the Security Council several days ago.
I have a photocopy of this document here and I will be happy to make it available to Mr Gahler.
Madam President, I too support the decision to send 4 000 EU troops to Chad in the form of a peacekeeping force.
The reality is that there is a wholesale political instability in Chad and in the Central African Republic.
We know that genocide is taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan.
If peacekeepers are not sent to Chad, we run the risk of an even greater level of instability and violence breaking out in this region of Africa.
It is estimated that there are as many as 400 000 refugees from the Central African Republic and from Darfur in refugee camps in Chad, but there are only 250 guards from the army of Chad manning these camps.
Refugee camps in Chad are an enormous humanitarian crisis and the international community, including the European Union, must help the Government of Chad to deal with what is an escalating and growing problem.
The stories that we hear from people who have visited the area recently are really awful and, as I said, we have to do what we can to try and relieve the human misery that is going on there at the moment.
I very much support the decision to deploy 26 000 UN peacekeepers in Sudan.
The European Union must be at the forefront in participating in this peacekeeping force.
I also welcome the decision taken by my own Government today to carry out an immediate and in-depth assessment of the future role that Irish peacekeepers could play in the UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Sudan, the Central African Republic and Chad.
(DE) Madam President, the situation in Chad and the Central African Republic is difficult for the people affected, and I therefore support, in principle, engagement by the EU to stabilise the situation and improve the real conditions of life for the people concerned.
In his statement of 27 August the President of the UN Security Council described the international community's intentions to deploy an EU operation for 12 months with the goal of bridging the time gap until the deployment of a UN-led mission.
That is why the EU has also clearly limited the operation to a period of one year.
I am convinced that we need a robust mandate here; that means not limiting ourselves purely to self-defence, but being able to pursue our objectives, if necessary, in the face of opposition from those who wish to stop us doing so.
The text of yesterday's Security Council resolution points in this direction: it refers to a 'multidimensional presence intended to help create the security conditions conducive to a voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons'.
We are authorised 'to take all necessary measures'.
I urge the Council to ensure that this force is not simply a cosmetically enhanced French force.
In terms of the nationality of the commander, too, local sensitivities should be respected.
Unfortunately, France has not been neutral so far in the conflicts in Chad and the Central African Republic, but has traditionally supported the government.
For that reason, the language chosen for the command and operation at local level should be English, so that the people at least understand that these Europeans are obviously different from the ones they are accustomed to seeing.
Indeed, while I am on the subject of Britain, the UK has prevented the EU's Command Headquarters in Brussels from leading the operation, and in my view, this warrants considerable criticism.
Not participating yourself but denying others the use of joint structures: that is something that we should not accept from those who drop out in future!
As regards the achievability of the goals, I still have doubts.
Have we set ourselves clear objectives?
How many of the internally displaced persons should be back home by the end of the year?
How many refugees from Darfur should have returned to Darfur?
We would not have achieved enough if we handed on the baton after a year with the same number of people still in the camps.
The costs are also considerable: I hear that it will cost EUR 100 million just to build a suitable runway and headquarters.
Then there are the ongoing costs of the troops.
Can the Council give us any specific details of the overall financial framework?
I have one final, but to my mind crucial, point: before deploying the force we must have an explicit assurance from the Government of Chad that it will subsequently endorse the deployment of a UN-led force, whatever the composition may be.
I have heard what our colleague has said.
I would like to have that confirmed in writing, in the form of an official document from the Government of Chad, not verbally from the Minister in the UN Security Council.
When I have this assurance, I can vote for the project.
Otherwise, we really will face the alternative, after a year, of either having to extend the operation or withdrawing and leaving a military vacuum in which an identical situation to the present one could very quickly arise.
In that event, we would literally have allowed hundreds of millions to run into the sand.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted that we are today able to discuss and vote for a resolution on an issue that in my view does not get enough attention, for the situation facing the border communities of Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic is quite simply intolerable and it is something that must never be forgotten in this House.
I for my part do not forget and I have no intention of passing over in silence the fact that this whole affair is one of the many consequences of the Darfur genocide, an event that has been masquerading as something else.
Since 2003 the Darfur crisis has created two and a half million refugees, including 125 000 in Chad.
There have also been several hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Moreover, to date the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations and the NGOs have had to move their camps 31 times in order to escape the violence, though this has not prevented the arrest of a number of their officials by the Sudanese police, the massacre of 12 humanitarian workers and the disappearance of five others.
The resolution that we are tabling today is clearly intended as an effective contribution to the objective of ending the situation that exists in the border areas.
This situation is unacceptable, but it is of relative magnitude when we see the scale of the disaster currently unfolding in that part of the world.
In this respect, I would like to point out that our responsibilities should not be limited to supporting or heading isolated and narrowly-defined operations as an emergency reaction to conflict situations.
This responsibility calls for action to be taken in the wider context to which such conflicts belong.
It also requires measures to be taken ahead of events, in other words making every possible effort to ensure that such conflicts do not happen in the first place.
The second part of my speech concerns the situation of the humanitarian organisations operating in the region.
The manner in which methods have evolved for the intervention of armed forces and for the role played by humanitarian agencies in conflict situations has meant that the boundary separating these two parties is becoming increasingly blurred.
As the confusion that exists between military and humanitarian personnel tends to act to the detriment of those missions traditionally assigned to the humanitarian agencies, we now find that the very survival of the humanitarian aid workers is being put at risk and, with it, the safety of all those people who are supposed to be benefiting from these services.
It is therefore absolutely vital that our protection force is not implicated in any way in the operations being undertaken by the various humanitarian groups that are working in the region.
I am pleased to see that the document before us today includes this point, which is so important for the future of our development policies both in this region and everywhere else in the world.
Madam President, I strongly support the sending of an ESDP mission to the Chad/Darfur border and I welcome the opportunity today to debate this proposition.
The conflict in Darfur has had dire cross-border consequences on neighbouring Chad and the Central African Republic, with a huge refugee spillover and the creation of thousands of internally displaced persons.
According to high level expert advice, this mission is doable despite some considerable operational and security challenges.
The infrastructure in this area is poor, water shortages subsist and logistic lines are difficult.
Such a mission will also face threats from rebel groups holding out against the government, but it appears based on a thorough assessment recently carried out in this region that all these challenges are surmountable.
So there is no reason to further delay deployment.
We have the military capacity; what is now required is the political will.
I call for Irish troops to form part of this ESDP mission.
There is a sincere sense of urgency in this crisis region of the world, and Ireland could be part of a noble European effort to stabilise this border area.
Troops could be pulled from the Nordic battle groups for this operation.
Like these battle groups, this present ESDP mission is also intended to be a bridging operation.
Alternatively, Irish troops currently in the Lebanon could also join this mission.
This force has many worthy objectives.
It would improve the security situation in this region prior to further deployment of the United Nations/African Union mission in Darfur.
It would also be of assistance to relief organisations as it would open up previously impeded humanitarian corridors.
Thirdly, it would eventually facilitate the return of Sudanese refugees.
I believe this mission should have a robust use-of-force mandate with reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter enabling it to have a deterrent effect when necessary, especially in the case of attacks against civilians, camps, villages, humanitarian workers, UN police officers and for self-defence.
The rainy season is abating.
The frequency of attacks on refugee camps is likely to increase as the militia and rebel groups become more mobile now that the rains have subsided.
The time for the UN to act is now.
Inaction is costing lives.
The EU is the most acceptable organisation to carry out this mission, and it is, based on several accounts, well-set to undertake this task.
I urge the Council to adopt a joint action immediately and to set the final stages in motion so that we do not miss the boat on getting EU troops in where they are urgently required.
Madam President, well, we do seem to have a lot of armchair generals in the House this afternoon!
The desperate humanitarian and security situation in Darfur and neighbouring regions of Chad and the Central African Republic certainly cry out for international action, but I have to say that is a separate matter from the issue before us today, which is really about ESDP, as we have heard from so many speakers.
I have long argued against the waste of resources, the duplication, the divisions, indeed the sheer duplicity involved in the EU's attempts to develop a military capability.
There are no EU troops, Mr Ryan.
Our nations have troops and there are already well-tried structures for organising international military intervention by that small number of states that have capable armed forces and an expeditionary capability.
This is primarily through NATO and the UN.
The EU institutions have little to contribute to military matters.
It is clear that the motives of the ESDP enthusiasts are essentially political.
Indeed, one has said that Chad should be seen as a political opportunity.
The EU offered itself to the UN; it was not the UN that invited the EU.
The EU is desperately keen to pin its institutional label on another military operation but, not surprisingly, national military staffs do not share the enthusiasm of the Eurocrats.
With extended lines of communication, over a thousand miles to the nearest seaport, lack of water resources and infrastructure, and a reluctance to take on rebel groups with offensive military operations, the Chad mission is precarious from every point of view.
Britain, Germany and Italy have already said that they will not be sending any troops.
What is this force going to do?
Certainly not take on the armed hostile elements that have created the mayhem in this vast area of Africa.
Undoubtedly, therefore, most of its effort will go into protecting and sustaining itself in a very difficult logistical situation.
We really must stop playing around and using human tragedy as a political opportunity.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I must very briefly highlight that this proposal to send a force under the ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) to Chad and the Central African Republic is supported by a vast majority of the Members who have spoken on this issue.
As you will know, and as already mentioned here today, in the meantime - I believe just yesterday - the Security Council authorised the European Union to deploy this operation.
As mentioned, this authorisation was essential for the European Union so that the operation could go ahead.
All the military preparations and planning, in fact the whole exercise, can now go ahead and at a later date the Council will of course give an opinion on this issue through a joint action.
I consider that, by committing to this process, the European Union can now, as should be the case, move on from mere statements of intent and mere promises to practical steps and action.
This corresponds to what the European Union always says is, and what must be, its commitment to Africa and the African people.
We must help Africa and the African people in a close and complete partnership so that they can achieve peace where there is conflict, progress where there is poverty, health and education where there is disease, and something where there is nothing or very little.
In this way we will ensure respect for our values and our principles in our foreign policy as well.
The Portuguese Presidency therefore welcomes these latest developments and naturally also takes due note of the great support of many Members for this operation which has become clear in this debate.
To conclude the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure().
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
Situation in Burma (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Burma.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and our discussions are highly topical and, of course, the Council and the Portuguese Presidency are monitoring events in Burma (Myanmar) with extreme concern.
It has been almost 20 years, in fact since the events of 1988, since Burma has witnessed the kind of demonstrations that are occurring at the moment.
There is no doubt that what many commentators are saying about these latest events is true: namely that the country is at a crossroads which we regard as critical.
From the start the situation has proved to be highly volatile and, although we have made every effort to prevent the Burmese authorities from resorting to violence, today's events demonstrate that, very unfortunately, the military junta in Rangoon is still deaf to the appeals of the international community, as it has been for many years to the constant and repeated international appeals.
If well managed, the situation in recent days could have presented an unprecedented opportunity for the first steps to be taken along the road to urgent political reform and national re-evaluation of the country.
We hoped that the junta would listen to the unequivocal message being sent by the demonstrators that its policies have failed.
What was in the beginning an ad hoc protest against the disproportionate rise in the price of fuel has become a vast public protest movement against the general policies of a highly dictatorial government.
Aware of the growing tension in the country, the European Union has not just stood back and watched the situation.
Immediately in August it vehemently condemned the detention of various opposition leaders, in particular the so-called '88 Generation' group, which was protesting against the almost 500% rise in fuel prices.
It called for the release of all political prisoners and highlighted the need to start a process of opening up, reconciliation and political reform.
Just yesterday we sent a clear message of solidarity and support to the Burmese population through the Joint US-EU Statement adopted by the 27 Foreign Affairs Ministers who are meeting in New York.
We call on the authorities to respect the right of the monks, nuns and ordinary citizens to demonstrate peacefully and we stress that this situation represents a new opportunity to try and solve Burma's highly complex problems.
In another statement, also issued yesterday, the High Representative, Mr Solana, called on the Burmese authorities to continue exercising restraint and stressed that genuine peace, stability and development can only be achieved through political reform, the granting of fundamental rights and freedoms, and full inclusion of all stakeholders.
We have also discussed the situation with some of our partners in bilateral conversations on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
In our continuing dialogue on Burma with partners in the region, including China, India and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries, we are encouraging the latter to talk regularly to the regime, placing particular emphasis on the following points: first, the long-term stability of Burma requires a genuine transformation, especially political; second, the opening-up of the country is crucial to the development of Burma and is also in the interests of its neighbours and the international community as a whole.
We have also noted that Singapore, the current Chair of the ASEAN, has at least responded with a national statement in which it hopes that the current protests can be resolved peacefully.
The EU Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed the developing situation in Burma during the Gymnich meeting held at the beginning of September, and yesterday in New York, when all 27 met, they again tackled this issue, as I have mentioned.
In addition, this issue has been discussed by the Political and Security Committee in Brussels and was debated in more detail this morning within the Asia-Oceania Working Group.
We are obviously assessing all possible options for another European Union reaction and, although we hope that the situation will not deteriorate even further, we must be prepared for all eventualities.
We are also preparing for additional action through diplomatic channels and will remain in contact with the United Nations, in particular with Ibrahim Gambari, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, who met with the presidency and institutions of the European Union in July, in other words immediately before the summer recess.
We also remain in close contact with our colleagues in Geneva where an incisive statement was made yesterday in the Human Rights Council.
Last night, due to the worrying news reaching us from Rangoon, we felt obliged to make another appeal to the Burmese authorities, asking them not to react violently to the people's peaceful demonstrations.
We clearly mentioned the possibility of increasing the existing sanctions so that the message was precise and direct.
Finally, Coreper (Permanent Representatives Committee) will discuss this issue of Burma in more detail tomorrow.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like the other European institutions the Commission is obviously very concerned about the situation in Burma/Myanmar.
We are keeping a very close watch on the dramatic events of recent weeks, and even of the last few hours, following the movement for resistance and peaceful protest that has been launched by the Buddhist monks.
As you know, Mrs Reding presented the Commission's analysis of the general situation on 6 September: repeated human rights violations, political repression and a general deterioration in economic conditions.
I should also add to this the violations of international humanitarian law committed by the government of Burma/Myanmar against civilians and prisoners, together with the increasingly severe restrictions imposed on the ICRC as it goes about its work.
In recent weeks the regime has been reaping the bitter fruits of the explosive social and political situation that it has to some extent created itself.
What should be done in the face of such events?
We are entitled to think either that the situation has an air of dÃ©jÃ  vu about it, heralding a repetition of the violent repression of 1988, or that we have reached a historic turning point.
Whatever the case, events in Burma/Myanmar seem to be taking an unpredictable turn.
The fact that the massive protest movement - with some 100 000 people taking to the streets of Rangoon last Monday - does not have a political agenda or any declared demands, obviously renders the situation more unstable and more precarious.
We clearly cannot rule out the possibility of the regime losing control of events as it takes action against the demonstrations.
There is no doubt that the intimidation, arrests and roadblocks that we are now seeing all point to the fact that a much harder line is being taken.
The arrests carried out this morning, the brutal manner in which the authorities have intervened and the fact that victims have been reported only serve to heighten our concerns.
Under such circumstances our primary objective must be to prevent any violent reaction on the part of the government and to urge those in charge to show the utmost restraint.
The safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi is obviously one of our main considerations.
However, the protests have, to some extent, also provided an opportunity.
They show the regime, or at least those members of it who still have some perception of reality, that poor political and economic management has meant that people are no longer frightened of taking to the streets to express anger born out of despair that has existed for far too long.
The Commission's second concern is therefore to urge the international community to persuade the government to make the gestures that are needed to restore a minimum of confidence and in this way to create the conditions under which the way can be paved towards national reconciliation.
The regime has to listen to the people's aspirations for openness and democracy.
Any solution to the current crisis must of course involve a participative and transparent process that will allow all the parties that are interested in national reconciliation for Burma/Myanmar to contribute fully to the country's political and economic future.
This is the message that my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner gave to our partner countries in meetings held alongside the United Nations General Assembly.
It is also vital that the states bordering Burma/Myanmar are made aware of their particular responsibilities.
I believe that China has already realised that its own long-term interests will not be served by such an explosive situation and it for one can exert a decisive influence.
However, we must also persuade India, Japan and South Korea, countries that have contributed significantly to the economic needs of the Burmese regime, to do more to help resolve the present crisis.
The ASEAN member states also have to be firmer in expressing their views.
Any deterioration in the situation in Burma/Myanmar can only have dire consequences for the entire region.
Finally, the Commission welcomes the special role being played by the United Nations, and more specifically the good offices of its special envoy Ibrahim Gambari, whose forthcoming visit to Rangoon will be of the utmost importance.
If the authorities in Burma/Myanmar again choose the road of repression, this will inevitably plunge the country into even greater international isolation, with further intolerable suffering for its people.
If, on the other hand, the authorities opt for open and democratic dialogue, they will then have to clarify their future roadmap for the country, give firm commitments as to a definite date for free elections and begin a sincere dialogue with their partners.
Under such circumstances the authorities in Burma/Myanmar will then be able to count on the support of the European Union and other partner nations.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the European Union prides itself on its attention to human rights and yet it seems incapable of acting effectively against tyrannical regimes across the globe that continue to oppress and abuse their people year after year.
There is a mindset that seems to think that a statement and a common position are all that is needed.
The President-in-Office said in the previous debate that we should live up to what we say.
I agree with him.
Throughout my time in this Parliament I have fought against two particular odious regimes: Mugabe in Zimbabwe and the military junta in Burma.
Both have been the object of EU attention, but nothing has happened.
We should be ashamed.
Today our attention is focused on Burma where, for the past week, the Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks has courageously led massive street protests in Rangoon and many other parts of Burma.
We are all shocked to see that a desperate situation has now turned to tragedy.
Pictures have been flashed around the world of injured monks, smoke-filled pagodas and battered civilians as the security forces begin their crackdown.
There are reports of at least five deaths, and hundreds more have been injured.
We were warned almost a week ago by the radio station Burma Democratic Voice that the Government had authorised the use of firearms, and prepared for a violent conclusion to the peaceful demonstrations.
It is high time that we stopped wringing our hands and got serious.
I am under no illusions.
As with Zimbabwe, the key to change in Burma lies with her neighbours, China in particular.
China is Burma's biggest investor, trading partner and arms supplier.
There is a high-level Chinese parliamentary delegation in Parliament today, led by Mr Wang Yingfan, an influential member of the National People's Congress.
I made a strong plea to him this morning for China to take action against the Burmese regime.
He reiterated China's commitment to non-interference in the internal policies of other countries, but, at the same time, he assured me that China would continue to play a quiet but serious role and urge flexibility and a more positive approach on the Burmese regime.
We shall see what effect this has.
Yesterday, the Presidency of the European Union announced that tougher sanctions would be imposed in the event of a violent reaction.
That violence has come and those tougher sanctions must now follow if the EU is to retain any credibility on the world stage.
We must also make it clear that this time we will keep our word and stick to our sanctions.
There must be no repeat of the disgraceful episode in May when the Burmese Foreign Minister was allowed to attend an ASEM summit meeting in Germany in flagrant violation of the EU's own travel ban.
We cannot ignore the fact, when considering sanctions, that TOTAL Oil is one of Burma's few remaining foreign investors.
TOTAL is directly helping to prop up the military junta, supplying hundreds of millions of dollars every year for the regime to maintain one of the largest armies in the world.
The Burma crisis is one that we have discussed for so long, and it is now upon us.
We should remember that the men who were instrumental in the massacre of protestors in Burma 20 years ago now hold key positions in the regime.
It is a pity that the Council and the Commission did not listen more closely to Parliament on these matters over the years.
Today, once more, we are tabling a strong resolution; it is short and very clear.
We say to the Burmese authorities: release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately, leave the protestors alone and convene a fully representative National Convention to include the National League for Democracy.
We say to the UN Security Council: meet now to address the situation in Burma and then immediately despatch your special envoy to that country.
We say to the Council and the Commission: talk to the US and to ASEAN to prepare a coordinated series of measures against the Burmese regime, including economic sanctions, if it responds violently and does not respond in the way that we are saying.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, indeed the whole world, is looking at Burma.
Today, for the first time, blood has been shed, as my colleague from the UK has already mentioned, for nothing else can be covered up and that is a new situation in the debate.
The Socialist Group is appalled by the brutal methods deployed by the military junta against the peaceful demonstrators.
We expect the UN Security Council, which is now meeting in parallel, to take immediate measures and bring its influence to bear, and that means its influence over and with China.
The second message to be sent out today must be the European Parliament's solidarity with the people of Burma: our solidarity, support and, yes, our admiration for the courage of its citizens.
The Buddhist monks are not a small elite minority.
They are part of the citizenry and are supported by thousands of people.
Clearly, the demonstrations were triggered by the arbitrary price increases, but violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifically of International Labour Organisation standards, torture and forced labour have been practised by the junta for years.
In the age of globalisation, isolationism is no longer an option, and that is a good thing.
Democratic basic rights and the universal value system apply on the Asian continent as well.
We expect the long-planned constitution in Burma to be put on the agenda straight away, and that Burma - like Thailand, interestingly, relatively soon - will hold democratic elections.
It is possible to establish and implement democratic regimes in these regions.
Besides the UN and Europe, the ASEAN countries must of course also play a more active role, especially since they aspire to be something akin to an EU.
The demonstrations in the Philippines today are a positive sign of solidarity in the region.
There is no turning back on the road to democracy, even in Burma.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by humbly bowing my head before the incredible courage of the Burmese population who are peacefully protesting en masse against the military dictatorship in their country.
Today that regime embarked upon violent repression and our hearts go out to the fate of the Burmese people.
The European Union must protest against this more forcefully, not only in words, but also in deeds.
If the regime persists with the repression, sanctions must be stepped up and all European companies still operating in Burma called upon, if not forced, to cease their activities there.
The ASEAN countries should also tighten up their position with respect to Burma, and India and China should use their influence over the regime to urge it to enter into serious dialogue with the Burmese democratic opposition.
The Burmese regime does not only repress the population in the political sphere, it has also plunged the people into abject poverty and destitution, while it is a country that has everything necessary to be prosperous.
The mass demonstrations of the Burmese people provide abundant evidence that Aung San Suu Kyi certainly does not stand alone, but that she carries the hopes of the vast majority of Burmese.
The Burmese regime should give her back full freedom of movement immediately and release all political prisoners, including those rounded up today.
Finally, I want to call upon the European Union to make maximum use of the instrument to promote democracy and human rights that is now at our disposal.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, as well as my colleagues, for their comments so far.
The national movement for democracy in Burma said 18 years ago: What will it take to make the international community persuade the authorities in Burma to take on board democracy?
Do we have to be gunned down in the streets and this to appear on television cameras before the international community will respond?
Unfortunately, that prediction is now coming true.
We can see that one section of Burmese society, the Buddhist monks and nuns who live a life of non-violence and of pacifism, who give to others of their time, are now being slaughtered in the streets and intimidated by the military regime.
It is incorrect for people to think that any words that we speak here will achieve the ends we want to see.
However, likewise it is incorrect that the world has stayed silent for so long; we can no longer remain silent.
And, as colleagues have said, it is up to us to use our influence, not just against the Burma regime but also our influence with China, India and Bangladesh to ensure that there is coherence and adherence to the sanctions that are in place and the demands for democracy.
Let us act to condemn the violence against peaceful protest but let us also ensure that we can give support to those protesters.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, it is obvious that recent events in Burma are increasingly leading us to a point of no return.
I feel that the large-scale demonstrations, not only by monks and nuns, but by thousands upon thousands of people who have supported and continue to support these protests, are sending a clear message to the military junta in Burma, but also a clear message to the world, stating that the Burmese people have had enough, that they are weary of the situation and that they want change.
It is exactly that desire for change that we in the EU and the international community in general ought to support.
It is obvious that after 30 years of sanctions with negligible results, the policy applied must take on a radical tack, and thus international policy must involve the countries in the same region: not just China and India, as has already been said, but also Japan and Singapore, which currently holds the ASEAN Chair.
This is why we ought to welcome not just the gestures made by the Council and the Commission, but also those being made in the UN to send a firm message of freedom for political opponents, particularly Aung San Suu Kyi, and in particular, a move towards democracy.
I trust that at this time we cannot and must not abandon this aspiration.
Madam President, the State Peace and Development Council: that is the official name of the military regime in Burma.
Now in the present crisis in which the country finds itself, more than even before, that rings out as a cruel lie.
The junta has stood for the abuse of power and misrule for decades.
It makes sense that it is extremely economical with statistics.
Incidentally, the vast majority of the Burmese population are victims of two-fold exploitation.
Yes, indeed, two-fold exploitation: internally by the country's military rulers - anyone doing business in Burma has to operate almost exclusively through the army - and externally by the People's Republic of China, which is engaged in an extreme form of exploitation of the natural and rich agricultural resources of this south-east Asian state.
Diplomats in Rangoon even go so far these days as to say: 'Burma has become a quasi-Chinese province'.
In schools in the north, built by China, Mandarin is the first language and Beijing time is the official local time.
Madam President, all in all the Burmese and Chinese rulers are almost indistinguishable.
I therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to be among the first to tackle robustly the Burmese rulers and Beijing about their shared responsibility for the suffering of the Burmese people.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when our resolutions and statements do not remain a dead letter or a feeble voice in the great ear of the Council, they are caught up in the flurry of events which certainly do not coincide with or await our plenary schedule.
A few days ago we voted almost unanimously in favour of a resolution on Burma.
Its recitals detail the numerous human rights violations being perpetrated in that country today, but they omit to recall that a Marxist-inspired and then military regime has been oppressing its people for decades, with support from China as is well known.
Not only is there oppression; it is worth recalling that the Burmese regime is a system that bases a large part of its power and its budget on drug trafficking.
Concerning the repression, censorship and widespread harassment that have characterised the Burmese regime for years, I would point out that there is not only the much-acclaimed Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, not only journalists such as U Win Tin and actors such as Mr Zaganar or the well-known civil rights activist Win Naing.
Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that there are also the Buddhist monks, as you know, but above all else there are many sizeable minorities. These include one cultural and ethnic group in particular that was not mentioned in the resolution approved two weeks ago: the Karen people.
This people has for decades refused to fall into line with a system where subsistence depends on child prostitution and the cultivation of drugs.
Merely deploring the repression with which the State Peace and Development Council crushes popular protest, while simultaneously calling for democracy in Burma, is of no more use than the forceful condemnations, the requests for immediate and unconditional release of detainees - which, I emphasise, is crucial - and everything else that we do our utmost to write, beg or threaten without much practical effect.
Even US President Bush, despite his many vacuous remarks before the UN Assembly, has one point in his favour.
He has gone so far as to call for UN intervention and spoken of a country which has imposed a reign of fear, where basic freedoms are severely restricted, where ethnic minorities are persecuted, and where forced child labour, human trafficking and rape are commonplace. Mr Bush went on to announce a tightening of sanctions, as has the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
Well, let us hope they serve some purpose, because if they do not we will certainly not hear any threats of bombing, neither of Burma's military bases nor - still less - those of its partner, China.
The situation for the Burmese opposition is like that of the decades-old struggle of the Karen people: a lot of noise in Europe and the United States, but let that country sort out its own affairs.
For the time being there are no transnational interests at stake there; for the time being the usual empty words are enough for the European Union.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I tried very briefly in my speech to give this House detailed and comprehensive information on all the political and diplomatic measures being taken and contacts being made in relation to the Burma (Myanmar) issue, on how we have been monitoring the situation and on what we have done.
I should now like to reaffirm the Portuguese Presidency's absolute determination to continue monitoring closely the events developing in Burma and also to assure you that the Presidency will of course propose any measures which, in its opinion, prove our unequivocal solidarity with the people of Burma and which, at the same time, also unequivocally demonstrate to the Burmese authorities that there will be a price to pay for any further deterioration in the country's situation.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Lobo Antunes, I would like to thank you, on behalf of the European Parliament, for having spent the entire day with us.
I want you to know that we have taken note of this.
To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 6.00 p.m.)
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Burma is one of the worst and longest-lasting military dictatorships in the world.
It has kept its people in abject poverty, in stark contrast to the economic success of many of its neighbours.
Repression has been brutal.
Contact with the outside world is severely restricted, and the situation would have been forgotten were it not for the heroism of Aung San Suu Kyi in providing a focal point for the hopes and democratic aspirations of the people of Burma.
I hope that the next few days will see the end of the military regime without further bloodshed and I call on the Council and the High Representative to bring whatever pressure they can to secure that outcome.
in writing. - As Parliament's rapporteur on the free trade agreement between the EU and ASEAN, I have made it clear in all my meetings with ASEAN trade ministers and officials that Parliament would strongly resist any concessions to the current Burmese military dictatorship.
The events of the last few days, where peaceful protest led by Buddhist monks has been met with teargas and bullets, have made an awful situation worse.
I had the privilege of visiting Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon almost a decade ago, when her house arrest was sufficiently relaxed for her to receive rare visitors.
She made it absolutely clear that she, as the representative and leader of the democratically elected National League for Democracy, overthrown by the military regime, wanted the EU to impose the strongest possible sanctions.
Now the EU and Member States should lead the demand for global UN sanctions through the Security Council.
Neither we, nor the people of Burma, can wait any longer.
in writing. - (NL) A new drama is playing out in Burma.
The junta has chosen confrontation with thousands of peaceful demonstrators.
This is extremely regrettable, because it is wonderful that the population has had the courage to come out in resistance without help from outside.
I support the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi, U Khun Htun Oo, Ko Min Ko Naing and all other political prisoners and I support rapid democratic reforms.
The European Commission should make optimum use of the emergency funds, provided for in objective 1 of the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights budget, so that sufficient support can be given to independent media, human rights activists and NGOs in Burma.
Further tightening of all the existing economic sanctions also seems unavoidable.
I am in favour of joining with the British and American measures and imposing strict restrictions on trading activities and financial transactions with Burma.
Parliament should send a delegation to Burma to assess the situation for itself.
in writing. - The situation in Burma is extremely worrying.
Those demonstrating against the military regime (including the monks) are showing immense courage.
The regime has brutally repressed previous demonstrations and shown scant regard for the welfare of its people.
International pressure must be maximised on the regime, including a commitment to hold those responsible for any atrocities in the coming days responsible before the International Criminal Court.
The EU must speak to China and India, who are in a better place to pressurise the regime, asking them to intervene to protect the demonstrators and help return Burma to democracy.
Council Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0316/2007).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Question No 1 is inadmissible (Annex II, Part A, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure).
Subject: Prospects for the Galileo project
The Galileo project is an extremely important project for the European Union, as it is the result of space-related research and cooperation between the Member States and can be applied to numerous areas, including that of transport.
Given the current deadlock in the financing of this project, I should like to ask the Council of the European Union what measures it intends to take to resolve this situation and what kind of cooperation with third countries, such as India, does the European Union have in mind for this project?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member knows, during its meeting from 6 to 8 June 2007 the Council analysed in depth the situation of the Galileo project and adopted a resolution.
In this resolution, the Council invited the Commission to submit proposals on various aspects of the Galileo project.
The Commission has since then adopted these proposals (on 19 November) and we now hope that the competent Council bodies will analyse these with a view to taking an integrated decision on the implementation of the Galileo project, including the public funding and modalities of public participation, before the end of this year.
As regards cooperation with third countries, it should be recalled that the Council attributes the greatest importance to cooperation with countries that do not belong to the European Union.
Since 2001, as you know, various cooperation agreements in relation to Galileo have been signed with non-EU countries such as China, Israel and Ukraine.
These countries are making contributions to the Galileo programme in terms of system definition, research and industrial cooperation.
In the specific case of India, a cooperation agreement was signed by the Commission and Indian negotiators in New Delhi on 7 September 2005.
However, the Commission has decided to continue consultations with the Indian authorities in order to bring that agreement into line with the standard EC cooperation agreements on Galileo and to take account of the latest developments in this project.
In terms of the applicable rules, the Council must wait for a Commission proposal before making a decision on this issue.
In order to better define the position of third countries, on 22 March of this year the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate with non-EU countries with a view to signing agreements on their associated membership for participation in the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Supervisory Authority (GSA).
The main objective of this decision is to provide for a harmonised approach concerning all non-EU countries by clearly defining the modalities of their participation within the GSA.
(RO) Mr. President, I would like to thank Mr. Secretary of State for the information provided.
However, I would like to come back to the first part of my question, namely the financing of the GALILEO project.
I would like Mr. Secretary of State to tell us more about the actual manner of financing this project and about the way in which the Commission's proposal was examined and what will the actual decision of the Council be in the next period.
(PT) I cannot predict what the Council's decision will be on the issues that are on the table, in particular with regard to funding.
This issue must of course be discussed by the Council, together with the other issues set out in the Commission's most recent proposals.
I can assure the honourable Member of two things: first, that the presidency understands that the Galileo project is a strategic project for the European Union and that it will therefore deal with this issue in that light, in other words as a project of strategic interest to the European Union; second, that the presidency will do everything possible to reach a conclusion on the main aspects of the Galileo project during the Portuguese Presidency.
- (ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree that Galileo is an urgent priority project for the EU, but farmers are extremely concerned because the Commission has come up with the idea of using surplus CAP funds to finance the Galileo project.
Since 2007 did apparently produce a surplus, they are worried about their future.
My question for the Council is this: do the various governments, the 27 EU governments, agree that this ought to be a priority project and that funds should be applied either by means of extraordinary contributions or by using funds left over every year from the Community budget?
(PT) Thank you, Mr President.
I believe that I have already answered this question in my previous answer.
The issue of funding is still on the table.
The Council must discuss this as no decision has yet been made on this matter.
It is of course expected that the Member States will have differing points of view on this issue as well.
However, I consider that there is in fact a consensus among us on the strategic nature of this project.
Subject: Constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina
What is the Council's opinion of the current state of the reforms, in particular the constitutional reform and the reform of the Dayton Agreement, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and what action is it planning to take to further the renewal and integration of this country?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will assess the current reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the annual report on the progress made, which is scheduled for November as usual.
The Council has reiterated on numerous occasions the importance of the rapid implementation of the four essential conditions for the conclusion of the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as set out in the Council conclusions of 12 December 2005, in particular the implementation of police reform.
However, as you know, the political situation has remained tense in recent months due to the radicalisation of the positions assumed by the main Bosnian political leaders.
At the moment it seems as if it will be extremely difficult to reach a consensus on the reform agenda, particularly with regard to restructuring the police force.
The High Representative, Mr Solana, met with Miroslav LajÄÃ¡k, EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 10 September.
During this meeting, which took place in Brussels, Mr Solana expressed his full support for the work of the EU Special Representative and his efforts to find a compromise on police reform with the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Secretary-General and High Representative, Mr Solana, urged the Bosnian leaders to engage constructively in the latest initiative presented by the Special Representative so as to remove the last obstacle preventing Bosnia and Herzegovina from concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.
He also called on the authorities of that country to act responsibly in order to finally deliver for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Council, too, has expressed its support for the efforts that have been made in Bosnia and Herzegovina on constitutional reform, with a view to creating more functional State structures that are more capable of reaching European standards.
Further effort is needed to continue improving the efficiency of the executive and legislative bodies and we must also reinforce the capacity for administration and coordination between the State and its bodies.
In terms of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, the European Union has reserved EUR 1 million for constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As you will know, the Council also adopted on 7 February 2007 a joint action amending and extending the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Under this amended mandate, the EU Special Representative will provide political advice and offer his services in the process of constitutional reform.
(DE) Bosnia and Herzegovina will only have a future if it is transformed into a federation comprising all three of its nations on an equal basis, which must include not only the Herzegovinian but also the Central Bosnian Croats.
My question is quite specific: what can be done when an entity such as Republika Srpska blocks police reform and refugee return from within, but the EU only brings external pressure to bear on the state as a whole?
Do you also speak to the individual entities and exert pressure on them, or can this only be done via the central state?
If so, it becomes very difficult.
(PT) Very well, Mr President, honourable Member, what I can say in this respect is that the European Union will do everything possible, through the diplomatic instruments available and particularly through the actions of its Special Representative, to ensure that the current deadlock in the constitutional reforms, particularly in the police reform, can be successfully overcome and to ensure that the obstacles encountered can be removed.
That is our commitment.
The Council will of course take account of the proposals and suggestions that may be made by the Special Representative as a result of his presence on the ground.
As the honourable Member may imagine, the Council is aware of the complexity of the situation and in particular of the urgent need to overcome the deadlock that we are currently encountering.
(DE) As the Secretary of State knows, potential EU membership is a powerful driving force for political and economic reform in all the Balkan countries.
Very intensive negotiations are under way with Croatia, after all.
Can the Council offer an overview of the precise state of negotiations with Croatia, and above all, how the association agreements with the other countries are being implemented and whether they are working well?
(PT) Mr Seeber, as you know, the Council has repeatedly and systematically presented its point of view and opinion on the accession processes and on the European prospects of various countries, in particular the Balkans.
The Council has clearly stated that there is a European prospect for the Balkans.
In fact, for one of these, namely Croatia, we are already in the process of negotiating this country's accession to the European Union.
As I have already stated, in November, as usual, the Commission will submit a communication to the Council reporting on the state of the negotiations, in particular the state of the negotiations with Croatia, and will make its proposals.
That will be the right moment for us to carry out a detailed and up-to-the-minute review of the state of the accession negotiations.
However, even though there may be certain difficulties, problems or delays here and there, it seems to me, according to my personal assessment of the state of the negotiations, that these are progressing at a good rate.
Subject: Measures to increase innovation
What specific proposals does the Portuguese Presidency intend to put forward to achieve 3% investment in innovation?
In what way will SMEs participate, particularly those in mountainous, island and very remote regions, in action that will be funded to promote innovation and research?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member knows, the European Union has not at present agreed any quantified target for investment in innovation.
Such a target would be virtually impossible to define and put into practice as innovation covers a wide range of activities which are very difficult to define and measure.
The European Union therefore opted in 2002 to adopt a guideline quantitative target for spending on research and development, otherwise known as R&D. This is the well-known Barcelona target of 3%.
It was possible to set this target as R&D actions, which are internationally defined in the OECD's Frascati Manual, are easier to measure and quantify.
It should be noted that this objective has recently been used as the preferred reference indicator, given the difficulties encountered in recent years in increasing the private R&D effort in significant segments of the business sector.
However, action to promote innovation and research is a very high priority in the European Union's policy.
It is being carried out through various instruments such as the Framework Programme and the CIP, otherwise known as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and also by using the Structural Funds.
The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the CIP were conceived bearing in mind the needs of SMEs, which are the main beneficiaries of the CIP.
A minimum quota of 15% has been introduced in the Seventh Framework Programme for the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in research activities covered by the thematic priorities set out in the Specific Programme on 'Cooperation'.
It should be noted that the support in the Seventh Framework Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises may help to increase their competitiveness and innovation potential.
Mountainous, island and very remote regions receive support from the Structural Funds.
They are also supported through the relevant thematic priorities of the Specific Programme on 'Cooperation' in FP7, particularly with regard to improving their transport, information, communications and energy supply situation.
Under the Specific Programme on 'Capacities', the research potential of the EU's convergence and outermost regions must be unlocked.
In addition to the current programmes and incentives, innovation will also be promoted through a series of initiatives which are currently being negotiated within the European Parliament and the Council.
These include the proposal to create the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, the EUROSTARS initiative, which will actively involve innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, other initiatives under Article 169 of the EC Treaty and joint technological initiatives provided for in Article 171 of the EC Treaty.
It should be added that the Commission is currently preparing its proposal for a strategic action plan for the SETs or strategic energy technologies, based on a wide-ranging public consultation.
It is aiming to present this proposal by the end of 2007.
Along the same lines, I should also like to highlight the new industrial policy approach, which, in the context of sustainable development, is focusing on climate change in which innovation and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the European economy are fundamental aspects.
In all these initiatives, small and medium-sized enterprises will play a very important role.
Some of these initiatives will also be targeted at particular interests in the regions mentioned by the honourable Member, such as the 'bonus' initiative which is already planned and through which marine research in the Baltic Sea area will be coordinated.
The Portuguese Presidency has borne in mind the pursuit of the 3% target for R&D spending and must highlight the discussions held within the informal Competitiveness Council in Lisbon in July, when the role of public and private investment in R&D was analysed, together with public policy measures capable of contributing to the achievement of that target.
The informal Council to which I refer also considered the policy on small and medium-sized enterprises with particular impact on innovation and financing, internationalisation and energy efficiency.
Furthermore, by highlighting the need for specific measures in the area of human resources in science and technology and the reinforcement of measures in the area of the information society, the Portuguese Presidency also hopes to bolster the favourable conditions for an increased research, development and innovation effort across the European Union.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to ask the Council representative, whom I thank for his reply, whether the infrastructure of the Member States and the state of preparation of good governance enable this ambitious programme for innovation to be developed.
Are the Member States subject to controls when they implement any support scheme within the programme for innovation?
(PT) I hope that I have correctly understood the honourable Member's question.
If not, I should of course like to be corrected or enlightened as to the exact meaning of her question.
I would say as follows: as the honourable Member knows, all these issues very directly relate to the Lisbon Strategy and in particular the Lisbon Strategy in its 'economy' aspect.
At the moment we are obviously assessing various aspects in relation to the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy.
One of the issues that we must assess and debate is precisely the role of the Member States in achieving the targets or objectives proposed in this area.
In particular, this concerns measures relating to innovation and development in small and medium-sized enterprises and also, of course, in the chapter on their governance, the way in which they can achieve these objectives.
We believe that governments and Member States have a fundamental role to play in this and it is also of course useful for the Commission to closely monitor how the Member States are developing and adopting their policies in order to meet the objectives set.
President-in-Office, in answering that question you mentioned energy efficiency, and I believe it is the right approach.
Yesterday Commissioner PotoÄnik also stressed that priority number one is energy efficiency and fighting climate change.
I would like to ask you, what additional measures can the Council take in order to mobilise all their resources and attention to solving this vital problem of efficiency and climate change?
(PT) As the honourable Member knows, in March the Council adopted a programme which is regarded as world leading on both energy issues and climate change issues.
We in the European Union will have an almost historic responsibility, I would say, at the Bali Conference, which will hopefully set new targets for CO2 emissions for post-Kyoto 2012.
The European Union will clearly have a responsibility to support and/or encourage the international community to set itself as ambitious targets as we have proposed for ourselves.
We therefore already have, Mr Paleckis, a highly ambitious programme to implement across the European Union.
Among the specific energy issues, the issue of energy saving is on the agenda at both EU level and within the individual Member States.
I can tell you that in Portugal - and I have direct experience of this - this is an extremely important issue to which we have dedicated a great deal of effort.
However, the issue of investment in new energy technologies and in sciences relating to alternative energy sources has also been mentioned.
We have much to do.
We hope that what we have to do can be done quickly and well.
We must of course now concentrate on the ambitious programme for energy and climate change that we have agreed.
(DE) We have voted on the EIT here in the European Parliament today and we agree de facto that it must have absolute priority.
When do you expect the Portuguese Presidency to be able to put forward a funding proposal which will then be implemented, in conjunction with Parliament, as swiftly as possible?
Do you think that the EIT will play a role in the mid-term review and the Health Check as well?
(PT) Mr RÃŒbig, I must tell you - Mr President, with your permission - I must tell you that the European Institute of Technology, its effective launch and its effective entry into operation are a priority for the Portuguese Presidency.
We will therefore strive to ensure that this Institute is set up before the end of the Portuguese Presidency.
Of course, while it is the Presidency that is taking action and making proposals, it is up to the EU institutions to adopt the Presidency's proposals in this respect.
I can guarantee that the Presidency will try to act as quickly as possible.
There are other subjects and other issues which are of course the responsibility of the Council as a whole and of the institutions and we cannot ignore this fact.
Subject: Developments in Kosovo
The Secretary-General of the Council, Javier Solana, at a meeting with the UN Secretary-General on 10 July 2007 said, with regard to Kosovo: '... any further delay of this issue will not be beneficial'.
In addition the French news agency, quoting diplomatic sources, said that Brussels was considering very seriously the possibility of recognising Kosovo but 'in the most organised way possible'.
What are the Council's comments on these developments?
Can it categorically deny the possibility of unilateral recognition, particularly if it anticipates UN procedures in this regard?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 18 June 2007 the Council reiterated its position that the comprehensive proposal drawn up by President Martti Ahtissari, UN Special Envoy, provides the basis for the settlement of the Kosovo issue by a new resolution of the United Nations Security Council.
The European Council expressed its support for intensified efforts to ensure that the UN Security Council can adopt such a resolution in a timely manner.
As you are aware, the UN Security Council consultations on a new resolution are currently suspended, but the UN Security Council is very alert to this issue.
In a statement in August the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, highlighted the initiative of the Contact Group for new negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade to be led by a Troika comprising representatives of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States.
The UN Secretary-General asked the Contact Group to report back to him by 10 December.
The intention behind this new period of negotiations is that the Troika will play a facilitating role, with the parties being responsible for proposing new ideas.
As you know, on 29 July 2007 the Secretary-General and High Representative, Mr Solana, appointed Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger as the EU's representative in the Troika.
So far the Troika has met separately with the parties on 10 and 11 August in Belgrade and Pristina, on 30 August in Vienna, and on 18 and 19 September in London.
At the ministerial-level Contact Group meeting, which will take place on 27 September in New York alongside the UN General Assembly, ministers will discuss the state of the negotiations and must issue a statement aimed at giving significant impetus to this process.
On 28 September, also in New York, further separate meetings will be held between the Troika and the parties, possibly followed by an initial direct meeting between the parties on the same day.
As Mr Solana has highlighted, it is now essential that the parties cooperate constructively in this process and conduct substantial negotiations.
On the conclusion of the Troika process, the UN Secretary-General must present a report to the UN Security Council on this issue.
As you must realise, at this stage it is still too early to predict the results of these processes.
(EL) Mr President, only yesterday Condoleezza Rice said that Kosovo will become independent.
The US scenario is clear: a unilateral proclamation of independence by December and immediate recognition by the USA.
What position is the Council adopting with regard to this method of operation?
Are you concerned by the worsening destabilisation of the wider region by Albanian nationalism?
Does the Council finally intend to act in a unified, perceptive and uniform way?
I have read in the New York Times that European diplomats are hastening to pre-empt the Council's position, which will slavishly follow that of the United States.
Why do you not tell us what the diplomats at the Council are saying?
We would like a clear answer.
(PT) I have not read or heard the statements by Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen and I would not therefore like to comment on them directly.
However, I would say the following: we now have a process to follow, a process which is being led by a Troika comprising representatives of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States.
We should leave the Troika to carry out its work, which should properly occur in a climate of tranquillity and confidentiality.
As far as the European Union is concerned, the work of this Troika naturally has our full support.
In addition, this Troika has a very clear mandate to present a report in December which will form the conclusion, which will contain the conclusions and in all likelihood recommendations resulting from its work over the next few months.
We therefore hope, as I have said, that this work will be concluded, that the report will be published and that any recommendations made by this Troika will also be made known to us.
In particular, it is fundamental for the European Union that, whatever these conclusions or recommendations may be and whatever the prospects for the future of Kosovo are, as indicated in the Troika's report, in any decisions that may have to be taken, the European Union remains united and cohesive.
This has been the constant call of the Portuguese Presidency and we are confident that this call will be heard.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, do you know that Mr Papadimoulis is completely isolated here?
Are you familiar with the resolution adopted by this House in which a 75% majority of Members said that we were in favour of the Ahtisaari-Rohan plan and that we were clearly in favour of sovereignty under international monitoring?
Do you know that we unequivocally ruled out the option of a division of Kosovo?
I would also like to ask you what you think of these rumours and the talk of a division of Kosovo, which was actually ruled out by both the Contact Group and this Parliament.
(PT) The issue of the division or partition of Kosovo is not in any way on the agenda, nor does it form part of the Troika's work.
Subject: Kazakhstan's candidacy for the OSCE Chairmanship
It is reported that Kazakhstan is putting itself forward as a candidate to hold the Chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009.
The Foreign Affairs Minister of the country holding the Chairmanship represents the organisation and coordinates all the activities of the OSCE.
Kazakhstan is well known to be a country which has never held an election meeting international standards, and where human rights are in a very poor state.
The EU Member States very often act together as a block in the OSCE.
Unanimity is particularly to be expected on an issue as fundamental as this, in which an undemocratic country is pushing itself forward to be Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.
This difficult decision is to be taken in November.
Is there a consensus within the General Affairs Council that the candidacy of Kazakhstan is unacceptable?
Will the Member States present a united front?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you, Mr President, honourable Member.
The European Union has not yet made any decision on the candidacy of Kazakhstan for the OSCE Chair in 2009.
As the EU sees it, this candidacy will underline the need for Kazakhstan to pursue reforms and respect the OSCE rules and obligations in all their dimensions.
The Council has repeatedly affirmed that any country holding the OSCE Chair must set an example of respect for the principles of that organisation.
In meetings with the political authorities of Kazakhstan, the European Union, the Council and the Commission have emphasised that Kazakhstan must show that it is ready and able to commit to full compliance with the OSCE's rules and obligations in all their three dimensions, namely the human dimension, the political and military dimension, and the economic and environmental dimension.
deputising for the author. - (NL) Thank for your reply, Minister.
May I assume that you imply that Kazakhstan does not meet those conditions at the present time?
(PT) I must comment because the honourable Member has inferred something from what I said that was not exactly what I said.
What I said was that no decision has been made on Kazakhstan's candidacy and that a decision on Kazakhstan's candidacy will take into account, at the appropriate time, Kazakhstan's compliance with the conditions I mentioned.
This analysis and debate will take place at the appropriate time and in the appropriate place.
As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses.
Subject: Bluefin tuna fishing in the Mediterranean
On 11 June 2007 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 643/2007amending Regulation (EC) No 41/2006 as concerns the recovery plan for bluefin tuna recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
However, the text does not respect the principle of equal treatment for bluefin tuna fishermen in the European Union.
The rules governing the minimum weight of fish caught and the fishing periods differ according to the geographical areas of the catches.
What are the reasons for such disparities in the way Mediterranean and East Atlantic fishermen are treated?
The restrictions imposed on French bluefin tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean could seriously disrupt the sector's socioeconomic balance.
Above the 30 kg limit imposed by the new Regulation, tuna are hard to sell.
A two-week reduction in the fishing season means a significant drop in turnover for fishermen.
Around one thousand fishermen and their families are directly affected by these measures.
In what way is bluefin tuna fishing more harmful in the Mediterranean than in the East Atlantic?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you, Mr President, Mr Navarro.
On behalf of the Council, I should like to thank the honourable Member for his question on the bluefin tuna recovery plan.
This plan was drawn up following an opinion from scientists at ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), which recommended immediate and extensive action to prevent the current collapse of bluefin tuna populations in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic.
ICCAT adopted the recommendation aimed at implementing a 15-year recovery plan at its annual meeting in November 2006 held in Dubrovnik.
As a result, the European Community, as a member of ICCAT, accepted the international obligation to transpose said recovery plan into Community law.
In commercial terms, the consequences of total non-compliance with this obligation would be seriously prejudicial to the European Community's position in the Asian markets.
This obligation was met for 2007 through the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 643/2007 amending the Regulation on TACs (total allowable catches) and quotas.
Based on a Commission proposal, the Council is currently assessing the regulations needed so that the plan can be permanently applied for a further 14 years as from 1 January 2008.
Different rules apply to the various areas in order to reflect the respective differences in terms of types of fishing, levels of activity and situation of the population units.
It should be recalled that these fisheries range between high-technology industrial fishing and non-industrial traditional fishing.
The ICCAT groups decided on the plan based on scientific opinions which made certain distinctions between the Mediterranean and the East Atlantic.
The Council is therefore of the opinion that ICCAT tried to follow this scientific advice while differentiating the elements of the recovery plan in order to attenuate its socioeconomic consequences.
The Council is fully aware that this important recovery plan has socioeconomic consequences for the fishing communities in question.
These consequences would also be felt if the bluefin tuna populations were to collapse again.
During the negotiations with a view to adopting Council Regulation (EC) No 643/2007, the Council and the Commission agreed to introduce a provision ensuring that the recovery plan would be recognised as such by the European Fisheries Fund.
This will enable Member States to use part of their resources from the Fund to mitigate the economic effects on the fishing communities affected.
It is planned that this provision will remain in force until 31 December 2014.
deputising for the author. - (ES) Mr President, I now wish to speak on behalf of Mr Navarro, and then ask a question of my own, or rather repeat a question.
My question on behalf of Mr Navarro is as follows: Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, which provide for the establishment of a bluefin tuna recovery plan, allows any surpluses produced by a Member State with respect to the yearly quota to be deducted from future fishing possibilities.
What I wish to ask the Council is: what will happen to those who have caught less than their quota this year, since the Commission closed the fishing grounds last week?
Mr Ortuondo, I cannot give you the floor as I already have two speakers listed.
However, I will give you a further 15 seconds if you wish to ask your question immediately because, under the Rules of Procedure, I cannot allow three supplementary questions.
As an exception, and with the forbearance of all those present, I therefore allow you to continue for a further 15 seconds.
(ES) Mr President, I also wish to beg your indulgence to ask the Presidency of the Council how Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 can be applied if the Member States have failed to cooperate with the Commission by not sending it the compulsory documentation on catches during this fishing year.
(PT) The honourable Member has asked me certain questions, one of which is very specific and detailed.
I will try to answer as best I can but I very sincerely believe that the first question directly relates, and would be better put, to the Commission.
I feel that the Commission is certainly in a better position than the Council to give you the clarification you want.
With regard to your second question on the alleged lack of cooperation by Member States with the Commission, of course if this is true then it is up to the Commission itself to analyse the situation and find the best way of, shall we say, forcing the Member States to comply with what they themselves may have laid down.
This is clearly why I consider that the question would be better put to the Commission than to the Council.
(DE) I would like to ask the Presidency how it is dealing with the phenomenon of climate change in relation to fishing quotas.
We all know that climate change is currently buffered by the strong heat absorption of the oceans; 80% of the energy is still being absorbed here.
However, it must of course be assumed that in future there will be massive warming of the marine environment as well.
How is the Presidency ensuring that appropriate account is taken of these new scientific findings and that consideration is given to the aquatic environment when setting fishing quotas?
(PT) I feel that this is another question that would be better put to the Commission, rather than the Council, as the Commission naturally has a leading and fundamental role in this respect.
I can tell the honourable Member, as I have already said, that the environmental issues, particularly those relating to climate change, are on the Presidency's agenda and on the Council's agenda as a priority item.
We will be facing a major challenge after the Bali Conference at the end of this year and, following this whole process, we hope to be able to decide in 2009 on new targets for CO2 emissions.
(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also wish to make some remarks on the bluefin tuna issue, and more specifically on the closure of fishing grounds decreed by the Commission recently since the quota allocated to the European Union had been exceeded.
From the information supplied to us by the Commission, it may be inferred that when the fishing grounds were closed certain Member States, including Spain and Portugal, had not yet caught their quota, although others such as France and Italy had exceeded theirs, and had in fact doubled it, thus placing the European Union in, at the very least, an embarrassing situation of having infringed the international rules.
My question, which is directed at the Council, is as follows: what measures can the Council take to compensate states that have not exhausted their catches through deductions from those that have used up more than their quota?
Can the Council do that?
I also have another question: what does the Council intend to do?
What measures will it take to ensure that this kind of situation does not happen again?
(PT) Mr President, Mrs MiguÃ©lez, once again I must say that you will have to put these questions to the Commission.
It is the Commission which is naturally in a position to properly answer the questions that you have just asked me.
Subject: Making EU laws in public
Is the Council aware of any negative consequences resulting from its decision in June 2006 to transmit on the Council website the proceedings of its meetings at which legislation is debated by ministers?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) In answer to the honourable Member's question, the Presidency would refer you to the report on the implementation of the overall policy on transparency presented by the previous Finnish Presidency to the Council on 11 December 2006.
This report contained the Council's latest review of the impact of the new transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council's work.
According to the preliminary conclusions of this report, which is also preliminary, a more thorough evaluation should be made, before the end of 2007, of the effects of the new transparency measures when more practical experience has been gained of their implementation and impact on the Council's work.
I can tell you that in the first half of 2006 a total of 98 deliberations and debates were open to the public, in accordance with the European Council Conclusions of 15 and 16 June 2006 and Article 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure.
I welcome the President-in-Office's response and I am very pleased that the Council took the decision to arrange for the transmission of these proceedings in advance of any provisions that may be found in the Reform Treaty.
I note the President-in-Office's response that, before the end of 2007, a review will be undertaken and published, which, I hope; will indicate how the principles of openness and transparency in this area may be extended.
Can the President-in-Office confirm that, before the end of his presidency, such a review will indeed be published?
(PT) What I can confirm and assure you of is that this is a subject dear to the Portuguese Presidency and we will do everything possible to take this process forward.
I cannot, at this moment in time, guarantee specific dates for this review, but I can guarantee that the Portuguese Presidency is keen to take forward this issue of transparency and is committed to this.
Subject: Situation in Afghanistan
What role does the Council see for the EU in stabilising the situation in Afghanistan, where troops from a number of EU Member States are stationed?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The European Union's approach is essentially based on strict coordination.
Internally, particular attention has been paid to ensuring complementarity and mutual reinforcement of the actions of the European Community, Council and Member States.
Externally, the European Union has been one of the main members of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board set up under the 2006 Afghanistan Compact.
The Council Decision of 12 February 2007 to move forward with the ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) mission to Afghanistan must be understood in the context of this wider strategy.
The EU Police mission (EUPOL) is currently in the planning stage.
Through this mission, the European Union is indicating its intention to play a more active role in the field of policing with linkages to the wider rule of law.
This mission will of course dovetail with the Commission's commitment to reform the justice sector.
All these efforts have the common objective of reinforcing the sovereignty of the Afghan institutions.
Since 2001 Afghanistan has made very significant progress in terms of setting up representative political institutions, freeing the press, creating institutions in the security sector, making improvements in health and education and in human rights and the status of women, appointing a functional supreme court and setting up a consultative panel for the appointment of senior officials.
The European Union has played a fundamental role in this process and has already contributed EUR 3.7 billion since 2002.
The European Union is continuing to intensify efforts to ensure that its development aid reaches Afghans in all parts of the country.
The greater emphasis now being placed on governance and the rule of law is intended to reinforce the action in other areas.
The Commission has been developing programmes in the areas of rural development, health and governance, and will financially support any civilian activities carried out by Member States through provincial reconstruction teams.
The European Union firmly believes that, as stated by the European Council of 14 December 2006, the security and development of Afghanistan are interdependent.
That is why the European Union has always been committed on a long-term basis to Afghanistan through a strong and balanced strategy.
(PL) Thank you very much, Mr Antunes, for this clarification.
I simply wished to refer to one key issue that also relates to the statements by representatives of the European Commission active in Afghanistan before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I wanted to enquire whether the Council intends to increase humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and intensify efforts to rebuild civil society there.
In my view, much more than military presence is needed in Afghanistan.
My country is, however, committed on the ground in Afghanistan, which is indicative of a certain desire to achieve stability in that region.
(PT) I agree with the honourable Member: promoting security and stability in military terms in Afghanistan is fundamental, but that is only one part of what we have to do in that country.
We also have to work on strengthening the democratic institutions in Afghanistan and we must also concentrate on the 'Afghan civil society' component.
We must invest in health, education and training.
We must also of course continue to win the hearts of the Afghan people.
That is why we have a strategy with two aspects to it, one of which is the military aspect involving security and stability on the ground.
Without security, without stability on the ground, there can be no peace and there can certainly be no economic and social development.
We therefore need to guarantee this aspect and, at the same time, work on, and invest in, Afghan civil society and the Afghan democratic institutions, which we refer to as rebuilding the administrative capacity of the Afghan State.
(DE) Economic stability in Afghanistan is the key prerequisite for a functioning democracy and peace in that country.
In the European Union, we have the Oslo Agenda for Entrepreneurship Education for SMEs to promote business start-ups, foster entrepreneurial mindsets and promote exports and imports.
Can you envisage this Oslo Agenda being implemented in Afghanistan as well?
(PT) Mr RÃŒbig, I believe that we have to invest in all areas of Afghan society, as I have just mentioned.
Clearly, in a country such as Afghanistan, with its current security difficulties, economic difficulties and its particular social structure, I believe that a very important role can be played by small and medium-sized enterprises.
It therefore seems to me that this is truly a sector in which, in terms of forming the economic and social fabric of Afghanistan, we can and must invest.
Of course we can discuss how to specifically use the financial instrument, but clearly no one is currently expecting, at least not at the moment, large enterprises to set up in Afghanistan.
It is not the time for that.
In order to revitalise the Afghan economic fabric, I believe that we must, in particular, concentrate our efforts on qualification, on training and, at the same time, on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Subject: EU response to stop organised crime in Europe
Can the European Council make a statement as to the level of organised crime within Europe at this time and what coordinated initiatives are being put in place at EU level to combat the growing threat of organised criminal activity?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Council refers the honourable Member to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), which is annually produced by Europol for the Council's attention and a version of which is published and submitted annually to the European Parliament.
On 13 June this year, in its conclusions on the OCTA 2007, the Council restated its conviction that the fight against organised crime should focus on reducing the threat and the harm caused by it and, in particular, on tackling the following problems: the obstacles to dismantling organised crime groups stemming from their international dimension or influence, the level of infiltration of organised crime into society and the economy, especially the misuse of legitimate business structures and the transport sector in particular, and, finally, the misuse of technology by organised crime groups.
The Council also stressed that the European Union's priorities for 2007 should be the following criminal markets: drug trafficking, especially in synthetic drugs; smuggling and trafficking in human beings, especially in relation to illegal immigration; fraud, especially in the area of highly taxed goods and Value Added Tax carousels; euro counterfeiting, commodity counterfeiting and intellectual property theft, and money laundering.
As was the case with the OCTA 2006, these conclusions highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary intelligence-led approach in order not only to disrupt criminal activities but also to dismantle criminal organisations, bring the offenders to justice and deprive them of the proceeds of crime.
This implies drawing on dedicated (specialised) resources and organising structures with a view to using all information that is available to law enforcement and thus identifying and tackling the most threatening criminal groups.
The Council also calls in its conclusions for the further development of a new, intelligence-led control strategy covering the entire national - and possibly EU - territory, complementing external border controls with checks, en route or at destination, monitoring financial movements and expanding the analytical capabilities of national and EU law enforcement agencies.
There are two parts to my question.
The first you have answered in the sense that you have given me the initiatives that have been put in place, but you have not answered the part about the level of organised crime.
Many people would feel that is grossly underestimated at the moment and organised criminal gangs are infiltrating huge numbers of countries, if not all countries, in the European Union.
This is a problem that is not going away and many people feel that it needs to be tackled in a far more coordinated manner than it is at the movement.
I suppose what I am asking you is about the levels of organised crime within Europe.
(PT) Mr Ryan, as I have already mentioned, I feel that it would be, or rather that it is useful and in fact essential, to review or consult the Organised Crime Threat Assessment for Europe.
I am not disputing whether or not there is more or less crime as I do not at the moment have any information to give you on this, but it is often the case that there is a psychological perception of an increase in crime when the facts do not actually support this.
However, there is one thing that cannot be disputed: we do need a greater concerted effort by, and more cooperation between, the Member States, especially cooperation between the European institutions and the Member States, in order to eliminate the threats posed by organised crime, which are wide-ranging and varied.
As I indicated, due to the new technologies that are available, organised crime groups have extraordinarily sophisticated means of operation that are extremely difficult to combat.
I believe that all our Member States are aware of these new technologies and the new opportunities offered to criminals by these technological developments, which are definitely causing specific problems in the fight against organised crime.
Of course the Portuguese Presidency, as it should, will consider all proposals and suggestions made by the institutions in order to more effectively fight the threats posed by these criminal groups which, due to the type of crime perpetrated, cannot fail to have a major impact on our societies.
I expect the President-in-Office would be appalled by any link between organised crime and any government within the EU.
Yet, sadly, that is exactly the situation in Northern Ireland, where Sinn FÃ©in, a lead party in government, is inextricably linked to the IRA, whose illegal Army Council controls a portfolio of hundreds of millions of euros accumulated from the IRA's organised crime activities.
This is one of the reasons why its Army Council has not been disbanded.
Will the Council join in condemning this obscenity and call upon IRA/Sinn FÃ©in to disband its illegal Army Council forthwith?
(PT) My response to the issue of fighting organised crime and the Council's assessment and response are contained in my initial speech.
I have nothing further to add on this issue.
Subject: Road safety
Can the European Council outline what measures it is pursuing so that a greater level of road safety takes place within the territories of the European Union?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Ã Neachtain, as the honourable Member is certainly aware, following the presentation by the Commission of the Mid-Term Review of the European Road Safety Action Programme in March 2006, the Council adopted conclusions at its meeting on 8 and 9 June 2006.
In these conclusions the Transport Ministers of the European Union and the European Commission agreed on the need to strengthen road safety measures and initiatives at Community or Member State level.
As a result, in October 2006 the European Commission adopted two legislative proposals on the issue of reinforcing road safety and, thanks to excellent cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, the two co-legislators quickly reached agreement on a proposal for a directive on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles.
This entered into force in August 2007 and will be implemented by 31 March 2009.
The Commission estimates that this new legislative measure could save up to 1 200 lives on the Community's roads between now and 2020.
The Council is currently assessing the proposal for a directive on road infrastructure safety management on which, pending the opinion of the European Parliament, it hopes to adopt a general approach at the Council meeting on 1 and 2 October.
The Commission estimates that around 7 000 injuries and 600 lives could be saved every year if the measures proposed in this draft legislative instrument were applied.
I must also say to the honourable Member that he can be assured of the Council's intention to positively assess all road safety measures and initiatives proposed by the European Commission in the context of its current efforts to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the Community's roads.
I thank you for the reply but I just want to ask you if, in your opinion, a more coordinated approach is needed now in view of the number of Member State nationals who travel from one country to the other, especially as is the case in my own country, Ireland, where many people from Eastern Europe come in and bring their cars.
I do not think that the Council, or indeed the Commission, has made adequate provision for this type of travel at the present moment.
(PT) Being Portuguese, I too have noticed very dramatic developments in my country in terms of road safety.
Portugal has a problem, or has had a problem, in this area and so we have made very significant efforts.
These have, in recent years, resulted in a very significant reduction in what was a plague of deaths on Portuguese roads, particularly in road accidents.
This reduction has been due to systematic and persistent action by the government.
This is a problem of which we are well aware, which affects us very directly and to which we are alert and highly sensitive.
I said at the end of my speech that the Council, in this case the Portuguese Presidency, will pay close attention to, and will be totally ready to assess and take on board, any proposal that the Commission may make to the Council aimed at further improving the current efforts being made to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the Community's roads.
As I have said, the Presidency, in other words the Member State holding the Presidency, is particularly sensitive to this issue because it, too, has to deal with this problem in Portugal.
As a result, as I have said, it is therefore willing to pay particular attention to any proposals made by the Commission to the Council in this respect.
Subject: The accession of Croatia into the European Union
Can the European Council make a comprehensive statement outlining how Croatia's efforts to join the European Union are proceeding at present?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Crowley, I have already had the opportunity here today to briefly mention the process of Croatia's accession.
I will now go into slightly more detail while still being as brief as possible given the time constraints.
I can tell you, Mr Crowley, that the accession negotiations with Croatia are well on the way and significant progress has made been this year.
Overall we have opened and provisionally closed two chapters: Chapter 25 - Science and Research and Chapter 26 - Education and Culture.
In the meantime, another 10 chapters have been opened.
These are: Chapter 3 - Freedom to Provide Services; Chapter 6 - Company Law; Chapter 7 - Intellectual Property Law; Chapter 9 - Financial Services; Chapter 10 - Information Society and Media; Chapter 17 - Economic and Monetary Policy; Chapter 18 - Statistics; Chapter 20 - Enterprise and Industrial Policy; Chapter 29 - Customs Union and, finally, Chapter 32 - Financial Control.
In addition, the Council intends to hold the fifth meeting of the Accession Conference with Croatia at ministerial level on 15 October in order to open Chapter 28 - Consumer and Health Protection.
Other chapters will follow at the end of the year.
There is still a lot of work to do, particularly in areas critical to the success of any candidate country, such as reform of the judicial system and public administration, the fight against corruption and economic reforms.
The Council is also continuing to urge Croatia to improve its administrative capacity and to effectively transpose and implement the acquis so that it can meet its membership obligations in due time.
In order to maintain this dynamic and ensure a quality process, we must point out that further efforts are needed to meet the requirements of the Negotiating Framework, including Croatia's obligations in respect of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and also the implementation of the Accession Partnership.
Could I just say before I ask my question that I think it is wonderful that the President-in-Office has spent so much time in the Chamber today and participated so well in so many debates.
Thank you on behalf of the House.
With regard to the time-frame for Croatia, we know the difficulties that there have been in a number of chapters in getting agreement with the Croatian Government, but could the President-in-Office give a time-frame for when he sees these negotiations being concluded?
Are we talking about a two-year time-frame or a three-year time-frame?
Is there an exact time-frame that can be given, taking into account the difficulties that may arise?
Secondly, with regard to the areas that still have to be opened - the whole area of judicial independence and the police services in Croatia - what specific actions have been taken on those areas?
(PT) Mr Crowley, many thanks for your kind words.
I must tell you that it has been my great satisfaction and honour to be here with you today, discussing, debating and not always agreeing on such important issues for the European agenda and the European Union.
However, the honourable Member is asking me to do the impossible: to give him a date for Croatia's accession.
I cannot do this because this accession, or this date, will in all likelihood depend more on Croatia than on the European Union itself.
In fact, Croatia would probably be better placed than the European Union to determine this for the simple reason that, as you of course know, becoming part of the Union, entering the Union, depends on or corresponds to the progress made in complying with the criteria and conditions.
What I can say absolutely unequivocally is that Croatia has a solid European prospect and a solid prospect of entering the European Union and that the Portuguese Presidency is committed to taking this process forward during its Presidency and is naturally also committed, together with the Commission, to overcoming any obstacles that may arise.
In November, as I have just said in answer to another question, there will be a review of the state of negotiations with Croatia.
This review and a proposal will be submitted to us by the Commission.
These, as I am sure you will realise, will have a fundamental role to play in reporting on, and monitoring, the work being carried out.
They will be produced under the competence, and with the detail to be expected of, the Commission and what the Commission will say and what it will propose and recommend in its review will be very important in terms of what the Council will decide for the future and for the continued negotiation process with Croatia.
It is true that very often it is the administrative and judicial issues that are more difficult to resolve, in essence those issues relating to the specific internal organisation of Member States.
It is those areas in which Member States, in terms of their specific organisation, must make greater investment and possibly also more extensive and, shall we say, more painful and more difficult reforms.
We are confident that Croatia will be able to overcome any such difficulties and that, in line with its own desires and also those of the European Union, in the not too distant future it will become a member of our Union.
Subject: Climate change
Can the European Council make a comprehensive statement outlining what structures are being put in place at EU level so that a greater level of coordination can take place between Europe and America in our efforts to ensure that the target to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by the year 2020 can be achieved?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Aylward, there can be no doubt that climate change is a global challenge requiring global solutions.
For their part, the European leaders have decided to send the international community a clear signal of their determination to combat climate change by making the following commitments with a view to launching negotiations on a global post-2012 agreement.
Until such an agreement is reached, the European Union makes the independent and firm commitment to achieve, by 2020, a reduction of at least 20% in greenhouse gas emissions in relation to 1990 levels.
Secondly, the Union intends to commit to up to a 30% reduction if other developed countries make comparable reductions and if those developing countries that are more economically advanced make an appropriate contribution.
The European Union considers that it is time to assess the steps to be taken post-2012 and to establish a global approach involving the participation of a large number of countries.
Pursuing a more permanent dialogue with the United States will be essential in preparing for the post-2012 negotiations which must begin at the Climate Conference to be held in Bali at the end of this year and to which I have already referred in my answer to a previous question.
Within this framework, two important meetings are planned before the Conference, the results of which will certainly give very positive added value to the Bali negotiations.
The first is the high-level meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations on climate change, which actually took place in New York on 24 September.
The second is the meeting of the main economies on 27 and 28 September in Washington, at which the European Union expects to make an important contribution to moving forward the international process within the United Nations.
In addition, the European Union and the United States agreed at the Vienna Summit in June 2006 to set up a high-level dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development.
The aim is to move forward based on existing bilateral and multilateral initiatives and to pursue the implementation of the Vienna Summit Statement and the Gleneagles Plan of Action on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development adopted by the G8 leaders.
deputising for the author. - I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
However, the purpose of the question was that the difference of outlook between the US Administration and the European Union, with regard to finding solutions and building partnerships around the world, seems to have got greater; the distance between the two seems to have got greater in the last number of years.
Obviously, no matter how good we are in the European Union, we need other people to follow what we are doing and, in particular, we can see now, with China and India and other concerns that they have, that America may lag further behind again.
So what we are really looking for is specific action on behalf of the European Union to encourage our cousins across the water in America to join with us, so we can stand up to the power of India and China in these negotiations.
(PT) Mr Crowley, I totally agree with you.
We must convince our cousins and, as they are our cousins, we expect them to be convinced or at least to be open to being convinced.
I must tell you that the road to Bali and the road after Bali will be complicated and fraught with difficulty.
No one can have any doubt about this, but it is clear that, through persistent and concerted action, we can, I hope, be successful.
In any event, I consider that, thanks to the permanent dialogue that has been established specifically with our cousins on the other side of the Atlantic, despite everything, any differences, any different views of this climate issue can be overcome.
In this respect, I feel that the conclusions on climate change reached at the G8 meeting in Germany and the possibility created there or the agreement reached there on the fundamental role of the United Nations in the issue of climate change were positive evidence of the possibility of further progress and further agreements on this issue of climate change.
As I have already said, it is essential that the European Union maintains, shall we say, its role as a leader and as an instigator paving the way for others in order to protect the environment and our planet.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed that the next three questions all relate to Pakistan.
Unfortunately, I cannot use the Rules of Procedure to invite the Council to answer all these questions together as the Council has structured its work otherwise.
I must draw your attention to the need for the reform of Parliament and, in particular, to what you, ladies and gentlemen, need to do in relation to the essential reform of Question Time, on which I believe we are all unanimous.
However, unfortunately, we cannot apply more flexible rules as we have Rules of Procedure by which we must abide.
I therefore have to put these questions one by one, which probably means that not all three will be answered.
Depending on how our work goes, we will see whether we are more or less productive.
I will start with Question No 15 on Pakistani military assets.
This question is by Mr Rutowicz and I urge the Council to answer this question directly.
Subject: Pakistani military assets
It is widely known that Pakistan's army dominates the country's economy and administration.
Does the Council intend to draw up an analysis to assess the total assets built up through military-related business while Pakistani society has suffered impoverishment?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The multiple instances of dialogue between the European Union and Pakistan on that country and the role played by the armed forces form part of the comprehensive analysis on which the Council's policy with regard to Pakistan is based.
The general situation of the Pakistani economy and its level of development are another two parts of this same analysis.
Of course both are taken into account in the general definition of our policy towards Pakistan and this will continue to be the case in the future.
(PL) I should like to thank the President and Mr Antunes for this response.
As I understand it, the purpose of the question was essentially to enquire whether some kind of humanitarian support will be offered to these poor people in Pakistan.
I would be grateful if Mr Antunes could provide some information in that regard.
(PT) Mr Rutowicz, as you know, the issues of humanitarian aid, cooperation aid and development aid are priority issues for the European Union.
Wherever people are suffering or in poverty, the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament do everything in their power to try and help resolve these situations.
The European Union is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, donor of international aid and this fact cannot be forgotten.
As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 16 and 17 lapse.
Subject: European Union Solidarity Fund
Could the Council make a statement on the effectiveness of the European Union Solidarity Fund?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs McGuinness, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission is responsible for applying the Regulation on the Solidarity Fund and the effectiveness of this Regulation must be assessed in terms of the criteria laid down therein.
As far as the Council knows, in cases of disasters provided for by the Regulation, its application has been effective.
The European Commission periodically produces reports that set out in detail the use of the Solidarity Fund.
Thank you for your brief answer.
I presume the Council has a view, because the Member States would have a view of how it is being impacted upon their own countries.
Do you think that the budget of one billion is sufficient and that the Fund reacts quickly enough to the various crises that it has to deal with?
(PT) Mrs McGuinness, as I said, the Council's assessment is that the application of this Regulation, in other words the use of the Solidarity Fund, has been effective.
It was certainly an excellent suggestion to set up a fund to help Member States deal with any natural or other disasters as this was something that did not exist before.
This fund is certainly helpful as such disasters put Member States in a very particular situation of difficulty and need.
There should always ideally be the possibility of asking and applying for more.
We must of course look at this issue realistically, but also ambitiously.
I am sure that the Council, at the appropriate time and if proposed by the Commission, will not fail to assess this possibility.
However, for the time being we have the legislative framework that we have and, by using this, we can work realistically, welcoming the creation of this fund and the effective role that it has played, which in fact proves that this initiative is justified.
Subject: Making peace in the Middle East
Is the Council making enough use of the eponymous talents of the British Consul General in Jerusalem, Mr Makepeace?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I will answer the oral question although I am sure it has been asked previously by Mr Newton Dunn.
Very well, I should like to say that the diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States and the Commission delegations in third countries cooperate to ensure that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council in the context of the common foreign and security policy are observed and implemented as specified in the Treaty on European Union.
This naturally also includes the British Consul General in Jerusalem to whom the honourable Member refers in his question.
In the interests of my colleague, who wants to ask Question No 20, I will waive my right to a supplementary.
Subject: Member State seat allocations in the European Parliament
Will the Council be proposing changes to the allocation of seats in the European Parliament to each Member State?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Mitchell, I am delighted to answer your question, all the more so as questions relating to the Reform Treaty are, in my personal opinion, starting with the question of a new Treaty for the Union many years ago, particularly interesting and important.
I am therefore delighted to try to answer your question.
I would remind you that, in accordance with the mandate of 22 June given to the 2007 Intergovernmental Conference, the provisions on this issue to be included in the Reform Treaty provide for a decision establishing the composition of the European Parliament to be adopted by the European Council on the initiative and with the agreement of the European Parliament.
As the honourable Member is certainly aware and so as not to waste time, the European Council in June asked the European Parliament to put forward a draft of this initiative by October 2007.
We are aware that a report is going to be presented on the future composition of the European Parliament at the part-session in October, i.e. on 10 October of this year, for which the rapporteurs are Mrs Lamassoure and Mrs Severin.
I would like to thank my colleague for waiving his supplementary and thank the President-in-Office for taking the question.
The reason I am raising this is that in Ireland we have already gone down from 15 to 13 seats.
It is an island off the west coast of Europe.
It is the furthest point before you go to the United States.
There is a proposal now to reduce us further from 13 to 12, at a time when our population has gone up by 12% and is due to increase again dramatically.
All I would say to the President-in-Office is this: since there are 16 additional seats to be allocated, would you please bear in mind Ireland's case for retaining the 13 seats?
I think if you look at the figures you will see that we do have a very good case, and I would ask that this should be taken into account.
(PT) Mr President, I should like to point out that the westernmost point of Europe is in Portugal, at Cabo da Roca or Cape Roca.
Perhaps, as a result of this assertion, I will be challenging the honourable Member's statement as to the geographical location of his country but, in truth, the westernmost point of Europe is in my country.
With regard to the question raised, specifically the second part, the honourable Member will of course primarily obtain the answer to this from the European Parliament and his fellow members.
However, I of course take note of his point.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
Question No 31 is inadmissible (Annex II, Part A, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes
Obligations of cross-border service providers (debate)
The next item is the report by Lasse Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the obligations of cross-border service providers.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to express my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their encouragement and excellent cooperation: to Mrs Wallis, who is here today, and especially to Mr Hatzidakis.
He was so competent that he was immediately chosen to join my own country's Cabinet.
I am grateful and glad that both Mr Harbour and Mrs Kauppi are also here today.
The internal market, as we know, is based on the four freedoms, one of which, however, the cross-border movement of services, is not working very well.
The Services Directive, which was decided on in this House a year ago, will improve the situation, when the Member States have to implement it in two years' time, but that will probably not be enough either.
Services, of course, cannot be compared to products in all respects, but services will one day be more important than they are now.
High-quality and cross-border services in particular are this continent's future.
The problem is that the acquis communautaire does not protect consumers who purchase services as well as consumers who purchase goods.
European consumer confidence in cross-border consumption is low because the standard of services and level of protection varies from one Member State to the next.
The Union has Community legislation in given areas, but has no common rules for services.
Consumers, like service providers, are not always able to say which Member State's legal regime is applicable when there is a dispute.
It is partly because of this that consumers are afraid to use foreign service providers.
In my view, the Union should agree common rules and obligations which should be binding on service providers.
These would benefit not only consumers but also the service providers themselves.
If the Commission should at any time look into the matter of the service providers' obligations, it should not distinguish between private and public services.
Both should equally come under the scope of application of directives on consumer protection.
In 1990 the Commission made a proposal on the obligations of cross-border service providers.
It had to withdraw it, however, for lack of political will.
There is, however, political will once again.
The Commission should, if this report is adopted, submit, within 12 months, at least a work programme which reassesses the need for a horizontal instrument.
We need to settle on basic general rules enabling the consumer to obtain, if he or she so desires, relevant information on pricing, contract terms and remedies in the case of defective or delayed services.
The Commission should also take into account the impact of any initiative on operating conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Not all these matters were raised in the Green paper on consumer protection but they are in this report.
I hope I will receive the greatest possible support for this report.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to be here tonight to represent the Commission in this very important discussion on consumer confidence in the internal market.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehtinen, and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their very ambitious work in drafting this report.
I should stress at the outset that the Commission agrees with the report regarding the need to increase consumer confidence in the internal market; in particular, the consumer internal market for services demands our attention.
So, one of the Commission's priorities is to bring the benefits of the internal market closer to our European consumers and I am grateful for the support of the Parliament in this endeavour.
The Commission has already undertaken a number of initiatives in order to boost consumer confidence in the internal market.
I would like to mention two: European consumer protection legislation and the Services Directive.
Now, the consumer acquis already sets out a number of obligations for cross-border service providers.
For instance, it regulates the information obligations for traders who sell services long distance or on the consumers' doorstep.
It also provides consumers with protection against unfair terms in services contracts.
And, with the ongoing review of this acquis, the Commission will elaborate if there is further need to address the obligations of service providers and the rights of consumers in these areas.
Then, the Services Directive: you know it very well, you discussed it not long ago.
It improves the position of consumers within the internal market for services.
And it ensures that consumers will be better informed by businesses, better assisted by public authorities, and it establishes a number of clear and substantive obligations on service providers.
The Commission of course is very keen to ensure proper implementation of this Directive in all Member States and we believe that those two initiatives are very far-reaching because we can, from both of those initiatives, expect a real change in the consumer internal market for services once the implementation of the Services Directive is complete and the review of the consumer acquis delivers its results.
Having said that, I have also to underline that the Commission takes a different view to Mr Lehtinen's report on the need for a separate horizontal instrument to cover obligations of cross-border service providers at this stage for the simple reason that we believe that we should first accomplish our ongoing initiatives before coming, if necessary, to a separate horizontal instrument.
That is why I would like to thank you for your commitment towards helping us implement these two instruments; in also helping European citizens to enjoy the full benefits of the internal market for services.
And I know that my colleagues, Commissioner Kuneva and Commissioner McCreevy, look forward to discussing with you, working with you, to establish this internal market together with Parliament, which is the real representative of the European citizens.
So, thank you for your collaboration, thanks for this openness and I am sure that my two colleagues - and, indeed, the whole Commission - will, in a very deep way, continue to work together with Parliament.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I would just remind you that all remarks should be addressed through the Chair.
It is late at night and there are few of us but it is a small point of protocol.
But I am sure Mr Lehtinen took on board your remarks.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who seems to be losing his voice like I am.
It seems to be the case that most colleagues have sore throats in Strasbourg this week.
I represent the Committee on Legal Affairs, for which I was draftsman of the opinion.
I would like to say that, first of all, we fully agree with the assessment of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the importance of the services sector for the development of the European Union.
It would be an absolute kamikaze mission for the European Union and the competitiveness targets if we do not let the services sector flourish and allow the internal market to be completed in this respect.
I really think, out of these 11.7 million jobs created over the last eight years in the European Union, almost 100% of the net growth of new jobs in Europe has come from the services sector, and everyday statistics prove this.
But I have to be - in Finnish, a fakkijuristi - a 'dull lawyer', and bring the Legal Affairs Committee's point of view to this debate.
First of all, we really share the Commission view that at this point it is maybe too early to have a far-reaching new horizontal tool to solve the liability issues.
We have already pending several legislative initiatives, which are all aimed at ensuring legal certainty, such as Rome I, Rome II and also the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis.
Also, I would like to say that Article 5 of the contractual obligations (Rome I) proposal is essential in order to determine whether the consumer protection legislation of the country of origin or of the country of the client applies.
This is especially important for smaller Member States, where we might lack a supply of new services if Article 5 is not correctly solved.
We also regret the present mix of legislative instruments.
Sometimes it is not very clear which legal regime is applicable to each aspect of the activities of the services sector: whether they have to obey the civil law of the host or home country or the regulatory regime of the host or home country.
It is necessary that we also get some case-law from the European Court of Justice on these issues.
Also I would like to stress that cross-border services are provided in many different ways.
Some of them sell online, some travel to another country for services, and sometimes the service provider visits the customer's home country.
I think that the internal market for services, the legal framework which is based on the country of origin principle, depends on the relevant measures being clear both from the legal and practical perspective, and maybe it is too early now to really do something.
As the Commissioner rightly said, now it is time to implement all the good work we have done during recent years.
If colleagues want to place something on the record, they can always do so in writing during the course of the voting procedure.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of my friend and former colleague in this Parliament, Mr Konstantinos Hatzidakis, who, as Mr Lehtinen says, has been elevated swiftly to the position of Minister of Transport in the Greek Government.
I want to pay tribute to him for the work he has done on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I am essentially picking up the work where he left off, right at the conclusion.
I want to thank Mr Lehtinen because it has not been recorded so far that this is his first report, I think, as a rapporteur.
Some of you may know that he is a distinguished author in his own right, though I think this is probably not his best work.
I do not think he will mind me saying that.
I have a copy of his book Blood, Sweat and Bears, which he gave me to read, and I think he has put a bit of blood and sweat into this.
It is an important report, but I have to say, from our side, we agree very much with the line that Ms Kauppi and Commissioner Reding have taken.
There is some useful material in here but I just want to reassure the Commissioner that, if she reads Article 22, which in my view is a masterpiece of compromise drafting, where it calls upon the Commission to continue work and to submit a work programme for an assessment, you will be pleased to hear it does not actually ask you to produce a horizontal instrument but to do a work programme to assess whether we need one.
You already confirmed, I think, what many of us feel - that with all the work that is currently going on to implement the Services Directive, the Green Paper on the consumer acquis, which we have just considered and which will result in a horizontal instrument in that area plus the other work that is going on - which my colleague from the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ms Kauppi, and I know Ms Wallis will cover later - I think it is much too early to contemplate any further detailed provisions at this stage.
It is absolutely clear that we do need to monitor this, but of course within the Services Directive itself, with all the work we put in it, there are a very substantial number of provisions.
One of the amendments that we hope the House will agree to delete tomorrow does actually call upon the Commission to draw up voluntary codes of conduct.
In my view that is not the Commission's role.
I think we will have support to delete that.
But in fact, if you look at the Services Directive, in Article 37 it actually says quite clearly that Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take measures to encourage codes of conduct to be drawn up at Community level.
It is not as if we did not already have that.
So I think that we will take that out, so my summary of it is this: I think that this is a very useful contribution to the debate.
I think it will add to the corpus of information that we are building up to ensure, above all, that the Services Directive is fully implemented and is implemented on time, with all the accompanying provisions - particularly the issues like the single point of contact for service providers, which will give them the sort of requirements and information that they need to provide services plus, we hope, the sort of work on codes of conduct.
With those, I think we can look forward to a really effective and thriving services market that works to the benefit of consumers.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, let me first thank my colleague Mr Lehtinen for a very good piece of work.
With the adoption of the Services Directive, the internal market for services has clearer rules on the way freedom to provide services can be used.
On the other hand, there is a lack of clear rules on the obligations of service providers.
This means that, even after the Services Directive has been implemented in all Member States by 2009, we may be left with an open market in which consumers do not have confidence.
Only 6% of consumers made cross-border purchases on the internet in 2006.
The rules for goods purchases are much better established.
Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, also need clearer rules since they often choose not to provide a service or make a sale across borders, which leads to reduced competition and higher prices for the consumer.
Clear rules will encourage both businesses and consumers to venture across a border and provide or purchase services in another country with peace of mind.
We must ensure that consumers have a well-founded sense of security when shopping on the internal market and that, even when they end up in dispute, they can easily get help and redress.
For this to be achieved, many different measures must come together.
Some examples which are mentioned in the report are voluntary codes of conduct for service providers and the possibility of collective action on a cross-border basis against fraudsters or businesses which do not honour their commitments to consumers.
It is not reasonable for consumers to get less protection when they purchase a service across a border than when they buy goods from another Member State.
Hence the broad horizontal instrument which the report proposes is another important element in the consumer protection we want to develop in the provision of cross-border services.
Consumers must know their rights when a service is provided too late or in an incorrect manner.
If freedoms are complemented by clear obligations on suppliers and strong consumer protection, we can strengthen consumer confidence.
Once again, our consumers must be given priority.
