The definition of working time and the length of the working day are matters which have been the subject of class-based conflict between the working class and big business for many years.
The consequences for the working class are painful: more unpaid work, whenever and however the needs of capitalist production dictate, thereby undermining collective labour agreements, the intensification of slavery, more accidents at work, worsening insurance and pension terms, drastic reductions in free time for social activity and the breakdown of family life.
The Communist Party of Greece is helping to reconfigure and reinforce the class-based orientation of the working-class movement, in order to bring about radical changes and satisfy the contemporary needs of the working and grass-roots classes.
Â Â  The issue of regulating working time is complicated.
The main thrust of my thinking in connection with this directive is that issues of this type should in the first place be dealt with at Member State level.
When, therefore, the proposal concerning the opt-out â a rule, moreover, that is not applied in Sweden - was voted down and the proposal to calculate average working time over a period longer than four months was rejected, I thought it right to vote against the proposal as a whole.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
The sitting will resume at 3 p.m. with the statements on the future of Europe sixty years after the Second World War.
Â Â  The next item is the statements on the future of Europe sixty years after the Second World War.
You will recall that I made a statement on the end of World War II in Europe last Monday, a day that coincided with Europe Day, in a month of May in which, furthermore, a year has passed since the accession of ten new countries.
In view of this triple coincidence, the Conference of Presidents decided to hold a debate today on the future of Europe 60 years after World War II, which would be more than a mere commemoration, more than a look backwards: it would be a look at our future on the basis of the memory of our past.
Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso are here to introduce it ...
who have recently been in Moscow attending the events held there to commemorate the end of the war and who are now joining us for this debate which, as I have said â and I would like to insist on this â will try to look forward to our future and not just remember the past.
We are grateful for the efforts both of you have made to be here amongst us.
Your presence here undoubtedly enhances our debate.
I shall firstly give them the floor, as is customary.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 60 years have passed since the end of the Second World War.
Remembering 8 May 1945, the date that marked the surrender of the Third Reich, is a profound duty, and I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on not failing to remember 8 May 1945 here today.
The duty of remembrance is a profound duty, and I believe that it is particularly profound for those who were born after the Second World War, the men and women of my generation.
When we set about remembering 8 May 1945, the surrender of German democracy in 1933 and the dreadful period separating those two dates, as the younger generation, we must remember with a great deal of restraint, at least as regards the generation of men and women involved.
People who, like me, were born after the Second World War â in 1954, 1955 and later â must remember with restraint because we were not witness first-hand to the tragedy that descended upon the European continent.
We did not see, as those before us saw, the concentration camps and the prisons where people were killed, tortured and humiliated, to the point of complete debasement.
Unlike them, we did not see the battlefields, because we did not have to cross them with our souls, and very often our bodies, carrying the weight of death.
We could not, nor had to, observe, like those who could and had to do so, the long processions of prisoners who crossed Europe from every country, in fact forming a single European funeral cortege.
Those of us who were born after the Second World War have not been confronted with tragic choices, whether individual or collective.
We did not have to say either yes or no; we were able to bask in the glow of the post-war, having been spared such tragic choices.
Remembering 8 May 1945 is an act that stimulates our collective memory.
It is extremely significant when first-hand memories and first-hand experience of the war and its immediate aftermath â real-life knowledge with a host of personal experiences and noble feelings â are about to become part of history, with all that history entails in terms of distance and supposedly objective interpretations with regard to memories.
Today, the first-hand witnesses of this dreadful period of European history are leaving this world behind.
It is moving to witness Russian war veterans on their lorries in Red Square and the long procession of people who went to war for themselves and for us, and whom today can no longer walk. We, on the other hand, all know what they are walking towards.
The duty of remembrance is a profound duty.
For the men and women of my generation, the act of remembering not only means remembering with restraint but also with a great deal of gratitude.
Above all, gratitude must be shown to our fathersâ and grandfathersâ generation who, upon returning from the battlefields and concentration camps, and once freed from the prisons, had every reason to give in and do nothing but bemoan their fate.
Instead, they rebuilt Europe and made Europe the finest continent in existence.
Let us show our gratitude for the extraordinary achievements of a generation of men and women who had no choice but to go to war, and who wanted to make peace!
In remembering and in feeling this profound duty of remembrance, we must also speak the truth.
For Europe, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation.
8Â MayÂ 1945 was also a day of defeat.
By this, though, I mean the defeat of fascism and of National Socialism, as well as the end of democratic capitulation in the face of the terrible events that had taken place since 1933.
Above all, however, it was also a day of liberation for Germany.
I should like to tell the elected representatives of the German people present in this Chamber that the Germans are better neighbours to us now than they have ever been.
In truth, in remembering 8 May, 9 May and 10 May we are also showing our gratitude to the people who combined their strength and energy with that of Europe to liberate the European continent.
With 60 years having passed, rather than 60 years late, I should like to state the extent to which we, as Europeans, must show our gratitude to the young US and Canadian soldiers who came from the other side of the ocean to Europe in order to liberate it, and we do not even know the number of other countries they helped to liberate.
We ought never to forget.
I am also thinking of the soldiers of the Red Army.
What losses!
What an excessive number of interrupted life stories amongst the Russians, who contributed 27Â million lives to the liberation of Europe!
No one needs to harbour a great love â although I do â for the profound and eternal Russian State to acknowledge the fact that Russia deserves well of Europe.
I should like to pay particular tribute to the people of Europe who were able to say no whilst others were all too often tempted to give a faint yes.
I should like to pay tribute here today to the people of Great Britain who were able to say no, and without whose contribution nothing would have been possible.
The restored freedom at the start of May 1945, however, was not enjoyed in equal measure throughout Europe.
Comfortably installed in our old democracies, we were able to live in freedom in Western Europe after the Second World War, and in a state of restored freedom whose price we well know.
Those who lived in Central and Eastern Europe, however, did not experience the same level of freedom that we have experienced for 50 years.
They were subjected to the law of someone else.
The Baltic States, whose arrival into Europe I should like to welcome and to whom I should like to point out how proud we are to have them amongst us, were forcibly integrated into a group that was not their own.
They were subjected not to the but to the that was not their own.
Those people and nations that underwent one misfortune after another suffered more than any other European.
The other countries of Central and Eastern Europe did not experience that extraordinary capacity for self-determination that we were able to experience in our part of Europe.
They were not liberated.
They had to evolve under the regime of principle imposed on them.
It is with great sadness in my heart that I mention the harsh words said today on the subject of enlargement.
With the Second World War finally coming to an end, however, I say today, long live enlargement!
This post-war Europe which, without the War, would never have become the Europe that we know today; this Europe, risen from the ashes of the War, would never have come into existence if it had not been for the so-called founding fathers of Europe â people such as Schuman, Bech, Adenauer, de Gasperi and others â who, from the post-war phrase âwar, never againâ gave birth to hope, prayer and a programme for the first time in the history of the continent.
Today, we must remember with emotion and gratitude those people who had the courage to say yes after having first said no.
They could not have done so if they had not felt overjoyed by the noble and profound feelings of their people.
We say nothing against the will of the people.
We have been able to build Europe as we have done after the Second World War because the people of Europe wished never again to relive the tragedy experienced by the European continent twice over during the 20th century.
There are the founding fathers of Europe who are well-known; there are the peoples who evolved in the shadows and who shared these noble feelings, and then there are the philosophers, the thinkers and the politicians whom we all too often forget: Leon Blum, who dreamt of Europe from inside a French prison, the great Spinelli who was incarcerated on an Italian island by the Italian Fascists, and others who are nameless but to whom we owe a great deal.
I should like to pay tribute to those people, whether forgotten or anonymous, who made it possible to create what was created after the Second World War.
There was the free part of Europe and the part of Europe that was paralysed by the disastrous historical decree, the Yalta Agreement, which sought to divide Europe into two forever. It sought to divide it into two parts which very often stood glaring at each other and between which we have all too often been unable to build bridges.
The Cold War â the term lovingly used to describe the other tragic period of European history â paralysed Europeâs greatest powers and prevented its foremost talents from expressing anything of benefit that they might have expressed if given the opportunity.
Personally speaking, I was born in December 1954, but I prefer to say that I was born in 1955.
First and foremost â if I may digress â I grew up respecting the achievements of my fatherâs generation, which experienced an awful two-fold fate. Firstly, because the people of Luxembourg born between 1920 and 1927 were forcibly enlisted into the German Wehrmacht, and secondly, because they wore a uniform that was not their own, and which served ambitions other than theirs.
It is an awful fate to have to wear the uniform of your enemy.
The same comments apply, moreover, to the people of Alsace and Lorraine, to whom I pay homage.
I grew up in the Cold War environment in which the world, it seems, was easier to understand.
There were those who were with us and those who were against us.
We did not know why we liked those who were with us, but we knew that we had to bear hatred towards the others.
We knew that the threat was coming from the other side, and those on the other side believed that the threat was coming from our side.
How many lost opportunities!
How much time was lost in Europe as a result of those foolish analyses during the immediate post-war era.
Let us rejoice, today, at no longer having to refer to the uncompromising logic of the Cold War and at being able to make peace between the two halves of Europe.
I often think about the wise men of Europe, such as Churchill â doubtless because I myself am not one of them.
In 1947, when the first congress of the European Movement met at the Hague, giving birth to the idea of creating the Council of Europe in the face of the refusal by the Soviet Union to allow the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe to take part either in the Marshall Plan or in the creation of the Council of Europe, the great Churchill declared with his own prophetic offering: âWe are beginning in the West a job which we will complete in the East.â
Ladies and gentlemen, let us take pride in having achieved that.
I recall the words of Victor Hugo who, in 1949, wrote: âA day will come in Europe when the only field of battle will be minds opening up to ideas; a day will come in Europe when the bullets and the bombs will be replaced by votes.â
Let us take pride in having achieved that today.
Let us take pride in being able to say this to the European Parliament, the elected representative of the people of Europe, whose Members are the heirs of those who were able to say no when no needed to be said, and of those who were able to say yes when yes was the only remaining option.
Let us show our gratitude towards those who said no when no needed to be said and let us take pride in all those who, today, are saying yes to a great Europe, and to a Europe that has seen its history and its geography reconciled.
Let us take pride in those who do not wish for Europe to become a free trade area, and let us take pride in those who, like us and like millions of others, believe that Europe is a complex continent that deserves more than a free trade area.
Let us take pride in the Europe built by those who were there before us, and let us conduct ourselves in a manner becoming of their heirs.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, dear friends, it is a great honour for me to represent the Commission in this ceremony in this Parliament that represents Europeans.
Today we are looking back at the past and looking forward to the future.
We are here to remember, to acknowledge and to build.
Let us first look at the past.
The greatest worldwide conflict was the source of mixed feelings among all those who survived it; a source of relief for many, a source of emptiness, for sure, and often a source of fear of the future, fear that the post-war world might not be better â and might in fact be worse â than what went before.
We therefore remember.
We remember the scale of destruction that particularly ravaged Europe.
Hardly any country emerged unscathed.
What some have referred to as the âEuropean civil warâ was witness to the inhumanity that man is capable of visiting on man.
We Europeans often feel proud of the great achievements of our civilisation and our culture, of the great triumphs of the European spirit, yet we must humbly acknowledge that some of the worst horrors that the human race has ever perpetrated took place in Europe during the 20th century.
However, we should also remember the great stories of triumph over adversity, the personal journeys which so many Europeans made to find a better life, some crossing mountains and seas to reach their goal of a happy, peaceful existence.
Some found it simply by returning home.
We remember those who did not have that chance, those for whom the light of freedom went out almost as soon as they saw it; those for whom one nightmare was replaced by another.
Let us recognise that something remarkable came out of the ruins of Europe in 1945.
Let me give you a quote from one of the visionaries of that time, speaking in Zurich in 1946.
He said: âI am now going to say something that will astonish you.
The first step in the recreation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany.
In this way only can France recover the moral and cultural leadership of Europe.
There can be no revival of Europe without [...] a spiritually great Germanyâ.
Churchill was right.
It is easy to forget now the courage it took to say those words at that time.
What he said was astonishing.
Even more astonishing were the deeds that turned those words into reality.
We should remember the extraordinary determination shown by Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and others and what they achieved, reconstructing rather than retreating into retribution.
We should also remember and recognise the vision of transatlantic leaders who helped shoulder the burden of reconstruction rather than turning their backs on it.
Before we get too carried away, let us pause, because what the founding fathers started was remarkable but incomplete.
As the Commission said in its declaration of 9 May: for millions, true freedom was only to come with the fall of the Berlin Wall, not the end of the Second World War.
After 1945 they lost their liberties and opportunities almost as soon as they had regained them.
In some cases they lost political control of their countries; in others, they lost their independence.
For many people in Europe the end of the war meant peace and freedom; but for some it meant only peace, not yet freedom.
We should not forget what Europe was.
Sixty years ago here on this continent we experienced the Holocaust.
About 30 years ago several countries in southern Europe, including my own, were still living under dictatorships.
Until about 15 years ago half of Europe did not enjoy freedom and democracy.
That is why I have difficulty in understanding how we can fail to be optimistic about the future of Europe when we see where Europe is now compared to where it was only a few years ago.
However, that, luckily, was not the end of the story.
What European leaders of the 1940s and 1950s constructed was a light and a magnet: a light through dark years for those who had no prospect of the peace, prosperity and stability that other Europeans enjoyed, and an extraordinary, powerful force of attraction for those peoples and countries that were breaking free and saw the European Community â as it was called then â as a catalyst for the transformation of their countries.
For my generation, Europe was always synonymous with democracy.
As an 18-year-old, I, with others, was determined to set my own country free from a deadening, authoritarian, backward regime.
That is why I and many people of my generation especially admire the extraordinary efforts of the peoples of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria to fight for democracy, and how they relate the very idea of Europe to that of democracy.
It should be, and is, with enormous pride that the European Union and its institutions embrace those new Members and peoples, as well as those of Malta and Cyprus.
So this transformation is worthy of recognition and commemoration.
Why?
Because it appears at times to be almost forgotten.
Today it is too easy to take for granted the firm foundations of the new Europe in which we live, a Europe of freedom and shared values.
That is why we must state: the European Union cannot be the victim of its own success.
Integrating such a variety of Members, which are united by a common project, is a truly extraordinary achievement.
The challenge that we are all facing is an extraordinary one.
I am convinced that implementing this tremendous project, which will soon incorporate 27 countries and 500 million people, will take place in spite of the stormy periods that will inevitably occur from time to time.
This implementation sometimes takes place so peacefully, however, that we run the risk of forgetting what preceded it.
From now on, the accounts of murderous conflicts ravaging Europe appear to be confined to the history books.
They were making the headlines as recently as 10 years ago, however, when massacres were taking place in certain Balkan countries.
We can say ânever again!â on our continent.
It is easy to say, but the history of Europe proves that we have to work towards peace and not take it for granted.
This is without doubt hardly a cheerful outlook, as today in Europe, problems and fears exist.
In Berlin, in the large building that once housed what the Democratic Republic of Germany called its Parliament, is inscribed the word , which means doubts.
Doubts and fears exist, particularly amongst young people.
Their fears are serious: the fear of finding or not finding a job, and the fear of a more competitive world that is sometimes perceived as a challenge.
The fear, however, is that of finding or not finding a job, and not the fear of finding or not finding oneâs own country.
At present, it is sensible to find an effective means of solving the difficulties linked to the integration of markets, whether the difficulties are real or only perceived as such.
It is not a question of armed conflicts between competitors who become adversaries or enemies.
That is why in confronting these fears, we have to follow the example of the generations before us; we have to show the same imagination and the same courage.
Let us recall that the ambitious partnership that we concluded in Europe has been the source of peaceful revolutions, which have brought freedom and democracy to millions of Europeans!
The European example â the Europe of the Six, of the Ten, of the Twelve, of the Fifteen and now of the Twenty-five â has been the true driving force behind democratisation in Southern Europe, in Latin America and later in Central and Eastern Europe.
Let us remember that liberty is the driving force which stimulates growth, employment and investment, and which offers a greater number of Europeans the chance of a better life.
The spirit of democracy and modernity in our societies is testament to our capacity to reinvent our continent.
From its internal market to its external borders, from the promotion of internal cohesion to the protection of sustainable development and the environment, from the solidarity dimension to that of justice in all four corners of the globe â as we are not seeking a Europe that is closed in on itself â the European Union is constantly building Europe.
It does so in concrete stages that improve the everyday lives of our people.
Ratifying the Constitution will strengthen these undertakings and will lay the foundations for ever more significant advances in the future.
Let us therefore remember today that appalling war and its consequences.
In our work focused on the future, let us take our inspiration from the visionary ambition and the determination of the leaders and the citizens who preceded us, from reconciliation to cooperation and from cooperation to the European Union!
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in 1945 â 60Â years ago â Europe was a ruined battlefield.
A barbaric war had claimed the lives of over 55 million people, millions more â untold millions â were uprooted, millions were made refugees or driven away from their homes; parents lost sons, wives lost husbands, children lost fathers.
By the end of March 1945, my own father, a private in the Army, was missing.
It was only a very long time later that we learned that he was among the dead.
I never saw him.
In 1945, many of Europeâs cities were laid waste; its economy was in ruins.
In the world at large, the mention of the name of Europe brought fear and dread.
Where responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War lay is not a matter of doubt: the illicit National Socialist regime in Germany whipped up its racial delusions and claims to power into an inferno of aggression against all the other peoples of Europe.
The attempted extermination of the Jews was to be the worst of its crimes.
National Socialist totalitarianism led the whole of Europe into ruination.
When the end came in 1945, the German people themselves were among its victims, at a time when victors were thin on the ground.
Instead of victors, there were survivors, some fortunate, some unfortunate; the former in the West, the latter in Central and Eastern Europe.
Far-sighted American support made it possible for new life to resume in the west of the continent, enjoying freedom, respect for human dignity, democracy and a market economy founded upon the law.
It was Winston Churchill, as we have just been reminded, who sketched out the vision of a United States of Europe â and let me add that Europe could never be complete without Great Britain.
After 1945, starting with its Atlantic coast, Europe was resurrected; its peoples, exhausted but rejoicing that they could start again in freedom, drew together.
Robert Schuman will always be remembered and honoured for reaching out to the Germans and inviting them to join in this new beginning.
Without French magnanimity, Europe would again have remained no more than an insubstantial idea â and let me add that, now that the European Union is making another new beginning with a single constitution, Europe in future, too, will need France, more than ever, to be constructively involved.
In 1945 the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, too, were filled with the hope of a new beginning, of having, as those who belonged to the same European culture in which we all share, a new chance of life in freedom and peace.
They had to learn from bitter experience that peace without freedom amounts to only partial liberation from the yoke of totalitarian injustice.
Their hopes were crushed by the Soviet seizure of power.
Although National Socialist totalitarianism was vanquished in 1945, Stalinist totalitarianism divided Europe and imposed its unjust rule on the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.
Hope, though, did not desert the less happy survivors of the Second World War â the hope of a shared Europe, intellectually, morally and politically renewed, with the prospect of prosperity for all its citizens.
To this hope they eventually gave shape in a peaceful revolution, the watchword for which was .
It would take decades for the wall to be broken down.
Having been a member of this House ever since the first direct elections to it in 1979, I see our debate today â a debate that we are holding together in a dignified fashion, and with the gravity it deserves â as a time to rejoice that Europe is now united, a time of rejoicing, too, in the presence among us of Members from eight Central European countries, who enjoy the same rights as we do.
It was in 1989 that the double burden of totalitarianism was lifted from Europe.
What 1989 taught us was what power Europeâs values have for all of us and how much, if we want to retain our freedom, we rely upon the example of courageous men and women.
After 1989, Europe could again begin to breathe with both lungs, to quote the words used by that great Pope of immortal memory, John Paul II.
The peoples of Western Europe had done valuable, indispensable, work in preparation for that day, and what they did will last.
The establishment of the European Union with common values centred upon human dignity, the supranational union in a free community with its own binding laws were the consequent response to the opportunity presented by the end of the war.
European unification is a project of peace and freedom.
All Europeans now have the chance, and the duty, to go down the road presented by a reunited Europe.
We are now, together, engaged in building a Europe that defends its values for the sake of all its citizens.
Europe can now give one single response to warfare and totalitarianism, by pressing on along the road of the one European Union of peoples and states, with perseverance, inner conviction and an acceptance of the diversity that is Europeâs strength and splendour.
The current debate on the European Constitution is a great opportunity for us to remind ourselves of these fundamental things, because, for the first time in European history, our values and ideals are set down in a constitution.
Europa is not merely a political construction, but an intellectual living space.
It is for that reason that the response to the terrible war, whose end we today commemorate with gratitude, had to be a moral one, a ânever againâ to the unfreedom that leads to war, a ânever againâ to the war that robs men of their freedom.
That sums up the motivation behind building a new Europe, a Europe that repudiates totalitarianism, nationalist arrogance, and egalitarian inhumanity, a Europe that refuses to allow any one of its state to dominate the others, a Europe that affirms the unmistakeable dignity of every individual human being, the balancing of the interests of social groups and peoples, a Europe of respect and diversity, from which diversity, indeed, it derives its strength, a Europe of democracy and law.
A great deal of progress has been made in terms of internal reconciliation â reconciling the peoples and states of Europe with one another.
We want â as we must â to complete this work of internal reconciliation, as we also wish to be reconciled with the people of Russia and the peoples in the Russian Federation.
In the period of our history that is now beginning, Europe, though, will have to seek reconciliation in the world and with the world around us to a greater extent than ever before.
Europeâs wars became world wars.
Europeâs unification must benefit the world.
We can be grateful to the Members of this House â and I wish to thank my colleague Elmar Brok in particular â who have drafted a resolution that will, tomorrow, express our values.
In this hour, we remember all the victims of the Second World War, and all the suffering and destruction.
We recall how much peace and freedom belong together and the need for our work to serve mankind, not least in promoting dialogue between cultures.
Where this dialogue with the world bears fruit, we will defend the values that sustain us on our way into the future.
It is thus that this day of remembrance can give us a new mission, bidding us work together to build a better world â a world more at peace, and a freer world.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when thinking of 8 May 1945, and remembering what happened on it, we think of the period that preceded it, and also of the period thereafter.
It is impossible for any German Member of this House to think of that date without at the same time recalling his or her own nationality.
The group on whose behalf I speak includes MEPs from Germany, representing the country that wanted this war, that prepared for this war, that waged it and was merciless in organising it.
I also speak, though, on behalf of Members from Poland, the country that was the first to be overrun by the German army, as well as of Members from the countries â the United Kingdom and France â that were foremost among the Allies, without whose combined might Hitler could not have been brought down.
Next to me sits Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, for many years Prime Minister of Denmark, a country that Hitlerâs Germany overran and occupied overnight â one of the occupying soldiers being my own father.
I also speak on behalf of Members from countries that suffered under dictatorship long after the Second World War was over.
My group includes a lawyer who defended victims of the Franco regime, and another Member who was a victim himself, having been tortured in the dungeons of the secret police.
Some of my group colleagues are from Portugal and Greece, men and women who â like you, Mr President of the Commission â in their younger days rejoiced to see the dictators driven from their countries.
My group includes my friend JÃ³zef Pinior, who will be the next to speak for the group, and who spent time being tortured in Communist jails for being a trade unionist and a social democrat.
For me to be able to speak on behalf of all these people is a privilege, a privilege I owe to the European Union.
It is something for which we can all be grateful to the men and women who had to take on responsibility, after 8 May 1945, for the work of unification that they achieved.
As the President-in-Office of the Council said, on that day, 8 May 1945, lessons had to be learned, and the right ones were.
The history of the European Union, the post-8 May 1945 history of Europe, is a success story.
It is the history of the firm determination that grew out of the ruins, the history of a ânever again!â
This ânever again!â was not said to the empty air.
It took on shape and form, forms in which we work today, from which we benefit today, forms that enable me to represent Members of the Jewish faith, that make it possible for my group to include Muslim MEPs, for there to be in my group Members who have suffered, and those who have learned from those who suffered.
They make it possible for us to find common ground by affirming one thing: the lesson of 8 May must be that, if this ânever again!â is to be permanent, it must be fought for anew every day.
For our democracy, for our Europe, our fight goes on day by day.
Let us, today, remember the causes, the period that went before, marked as it was by one insight.
It is unique in the history of the human race for a state to define itself and its purpose in terms of the extermination of other peoples and races.
Neither before nor since has there been a state that justified its own existence by saying that it existed as a state in order that the Jews, the Slavs, the Roma, the Sinti and the handicapped might be wiped out.
Such a thing is unique in the history of the human race.
That is the extraordinary thing about the Third Reich; the Nazis wanted not a trace to remain behind of the Jews of Europe.
A few weeks ago, I was at Yad Vashem, the memorial site in Jerusalem.
I descended into the corridors and hallways below ground in which the fates of the millions of victims are depicted.
The Director of Yad Vashem, who guided me around, said to me: âEvery day, I descend into this hell and see them â the pictures, them alone.
It is a hell.â
Then I went up the steps and through a corridor into the new museum, which has a wide glass frontage, and there, in the sunlight, is the city of Jerusalem.
âEvery day,â said the director of Yad Vashem, âwhen I come out of that hell and see that sight, I know that they did not succeed.
We are alive.
We made it; the Nazis did not.â
Every memory, every day of remembrance, every name that we read out, is a victory over the criminals who wanted nothing to remain.
If we remember them, the Jewish people remain, as do the Roma and the Sinti, as do those who were murdered for political reasons, as do also the people with disabilities.
They remain in our recollection, and hence they live.
So many victims, so many names!
Anne Frank was a little Jewish girl, whose only crime was to be a little Jewish girl in Amsterdam.
On such a day, let us remember Anne Frank.
Sophie Scholl was a young German student, whose only crime was to be an upright person, and who was beheaded at the age of 18 for distributing leaflets denouncing the Nazi regime.
I also think of Krzysztof Baczynski, a young Polish poet, shot dead in Warsaw by a German marksman.
Three names out of 55 million victims!
Three names, yet enumerated to represent all the other victims.
Let me repeat: three names which we call to mind, and which stand as representing all those whom we should remember.
Over past weeks, we have often asked about the point of this European Union of ours, and we have been asked what it is for.
What this Union is for is described in our speeches today.
The continuance to this very day of this work of unification, which is still overcoming division, still holding racism in contempt, still excluding from the community of democrats all anti-Semites, racists and Nazis, still holding these criminals up to scorn, still enumerating their deeds, and still remembering them â that is the basis, the moral and intellectual foundation of our European Union, the Union built up by our fathers and our fathersâ fathers.
In the meantime, Europe has a heritage; the EU is no longer a novelty.
It is now 60 years old, having, in principle, been born on 8 May 1945.
Right now, we have a heritage to manage if we are to pass it on.
If we care for this heritage, knowing ourselves duty bound to remember that the Third Reich represented the moral nadir of the human race, from which we have drawn the right conclusions by creating this Union, then we European politicians will enable the young men and women who sit in this Chamberâs galleries to have a brighter future to look forward to than did their fathers and grandfathers in the past.
Â Â  . Mr President, the British poet John Donne observed: âNo man is an island, entire of itself, but a piece of the continent, a part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the lessâ.
That was in 1624, yet for over 300 years peoples and states continued to wage war across our continent.
Tribalism and hatred are Europeâs ugly legacy.
If we had not learned it earlier, the âwar to end all warsâ should have shown us the futility and the trauma of organised warfare.
Our awakening from that nightmare led to the League of Nations, yet we continued to distil the fruits of scientific advance into the firewater of the weapons of mass destruction.
By the time World War II ended in Europe, on 8Â MayÂ 1945, more than 40Â million people had lost their lives.
A cynic might say that 20th century Europeans were slow learners.
It took two bloody wars and a continent in ruins to teach us that a united Europe is worth more than the sum of its parts.
Not all of us were able even then to realise our aspirations for peace and freedom.
While for most Europeans MayÂ 1945 marked the liberation of their countries from Nazi tyranny and the beginning of a new path to freedom and reconstruction, for those who found themselves on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, one tyranny was quickly replaced by another.
A further two generations were denied the liberty we now enjoy.
As a student at the KarlÂ Marx University in Leipzig in 1976, I saw this at first hand.
Our historical perspectives are inevitably different. But this must be a debate about the future, not the past.
Let us rejoice that Europe is united in peace and that we can sit together in the same debating chamber with a set of common supranational institutions of government deciding on matters of mutual concern.
It was the imperative of dependence that brought the European Union into being and saw the Soviet bloc finally crumble.
We started with coal and steel, the building blocks of post-war Europe; we built the common market, the basis of prosperity undreamt of by my parents; we made the single currency a reality for 300Â million Europeans at the dawn of this new century.
As we mark the 60th anniversary of a lasting peace, we see that Europe has come a long way, through gradual steps to build solidarity between our peoples.
There is no doubt that the European Union has been a success: have become part of our common legislative and social fabric.
But there is no guarantee it will always be that way, and we stand now at a watershed, represented by the constitutional treaty.
Can we move forward and consolidate this unprecedented era of peace, stability and prosperity, or will it melt before our eyes and be replaced by a new national rivalry and brinkmanship?
A columnist reminded us last week how thin is the veneer of civilisation, how weak the voice of human conscience when tempted away from the rule of law and respect for our fellow human beings.
This is the challenge before our Member States as they are called upon to ratify the Constitution.
A peaceful and prosperous Europe was always based on the premise that strength lay in convergence and shared mandates.
Cooperation has grown from trade to encompass social policy, employment, immigration, justice, policing and foreign policy.
The revolutions in central and eastern Europe have lifted from our shoulders the yoke of Yalta, but we are confronted with new challenges.
The challenge, for example, of feeding, clothing and housing a growing world population, while more and more are pushed into migration by war or hunger or sheer desperation.
The challenge of dealing with a hole in the ozone layer, melting ice caps, rising sea levels and climate change.
Or the threat of internationally organised crime, where some criminal gangs are now more powerful than some national governments, bringing misery to many though the trade in drugs and small arms and the trafficking of people, and working hand-in-hand with terrorists.
None of these challenges can be faced by our countries acting alone.
To provide the security, prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver, we have to work together.
And work together, too, with the United States and Canada, to whose people we owe so much and whose values by and large we share, not only to confront with them common challenges but to make them feel more comfortable with a new and more powerful Europe.
Europe has the potential to be a beacon of hope, a model of tolerance, diversity and stability, in a world where these attributes are still rare.
We can insist on a bill of rights, or we can see our rights eroded.
We can ratify the European Constitution and put our faith in democracy and accountable government, or we can continue to leave too much power in unelected hands.
We can hold out the hand of friendship to the dispossessed, or cocoon ourselves in an illusory haven of prosperity.
We can welcome Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and the western Balkans and accept that Europe should be plural and diverse, or continue to treat each other with hostility and suspicion.
Convergence is not just an ideal, it is an economic and political necessity.
It is time to move beyond national self-interest towards greater convergence.
Cooperation is the way forward, enabling us to face global challenges together.
Europe has a leading role to play in the era of global governance.
It is a stabilising force and a benchmark for other countries and peoples.
Trade and cooperation can bring to others the fruits it has brought to us, and for that reason my Group welcomes greater contact with Russia and the Peopleâs Republic of China.
But history should teach us not to be an instrument in supporting authoritarian regimes.
Liberals and Democrats view with concern the direction of some of the Councilâs policies: to undercut the Americans in some downward Dutch auction of human rights standards would be an affront to the dignity for which Europeâs people have fought so hard.
Just as no man is an island, no country is an island either.
We are joined together in our custody of a fragile world and our stewardship of its inhabitants.
Let Europe exemplify the dignity of difference and grasp the challenge.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I was born one month before 1945.
My parents left Germany 72 years ago.
In 1933, my father was a lawyer; he defended the Red Assistance and he should have been arrested.
I was born exactly nine months after the allied landings in Normandy.
I am a child of the liberation, of a military invasion that liberated European soil and allowed my parents to have a child, a âchild of libertyâ.
That is why our remembrance â my remembrance â is paved with horrors.
The horror of Auschwitz, the that demonstrated the worst that mankind is capable of.
Kolima, the that demonstrated what the most barbaric political ideology is capable of doing.
Oradour-sur-Glane, which demonstrated what a military occupation can give rise to.
Katyn, which demonstrated that liberation and destruction can take place at the same time.
The entire Polish elite was massacred by the Red Army in order to prevent the Polish people from joining together and creating their own independent State.
We then continued to commit massacres which were beyond compare, but which were nonetheless comparably lethal and cruel.
There were the massacres of the colonial wars, and Srebrenica, which took place 10 years ago now, to the very day.
It is as a result of these massacres that men and women, who do not belong to my political party, but whose importance I acknowledge for having succeeded â because they did succeed â in building this Europe, be they De Gaulle or Adenauer, Willy Brandt or Helmut Kohl, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand â little does it matter â did something extraordinary.
For our part, those of us born after 1945 are the children of Europe, but we are also the children of anti-totalitarianism.
This Europe was created to prevent totalitarianism from ever resurging, whether from the left or the right.
To quote a song familiar to some: there is no supreme saviour, neither god nor king nor leader nor Communism nor Neo-liberalism.
There is no liberating ideology of mankind.
There is only one small and very fragile thing that many people mock and which is simply called âdemocracyâ.
My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, it is always either easy or difficult for a German to talk about âthe war, 60Â years onâ.
Germany, though, experienced both National Socialism, with all its barbarity, and Communist totalitarianism.
Germany, then, is also a symbol of Europe, and if there is any obligation incumbent on our generation, then it is the obligation to speak the truth.
My concern is not to set out to the House what Europeâs political tasks are, for we can do that day in and day out.
My concern is solely with how seriously we take this anti-totalitarian obligation.
If we really do act upon it, we may not, we cannot, disregard human rights and respect for human dignity for the sake of of any kind.
We have to talk to the Russians, but we also have to talk about Chechnya.
We have to talk about crimes.
We have to talk to the Chinese, but we have to talk about the way in which the Chinese people are oppressed.
We cannot simply say âso letâs just lift the embargoâ, and pass on to the next item on the agenda.
So the Chinese get a few weapons.
So they are sold a few Transrapids.
With a history like Europeâs behind us, we simply cannot do that!
It is because we are obligated to truth, because we believe in Europe, that we all, when shaping and organising the Europe of the future, have to remember what Europe once was and what it must not be allowed to be again.
It is in times such as these that I â as one of those who think of Europeâs history in those terms â am proud to campaign for a constitution that embodies the heritage of the anti-totalitarian Europe.
I am convinced that we will win; this constitution will become real in Europe.
That is what I believe; it is an obligation upon us for the sake of our children, who will inherit what our parents gave us for safe keeping.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the fine speech delivered by MrÂ Junker together with the particular emphasis of subsequent speeches are in stark contrast to the extremely disappointing and worrying content of the draft resolution submitted to us on behalf of the majority of groups on the 60th anniversary of the Nazi surrender.
I am convinced that in the majority of political groups represented within our Assembly, men and women will feel a sense of unease when faced with this text, which is more or less a revision of history.
When an institution such as ours evokes that founding event of Europe and the world today that was the victory of all the allies â US, British and Soviet of the anti-Hitler coalition, every word counts.
Let us wager that in a declaration of this type, many men and women expected to read lines such as the following: â8 May 1945 was a day of liberation for Europeâ.
Why not, since it is the truth; it was a day when the Soviet army contributed in a decisive manner.
Without choosing to overlook Stalinist oppression in any way, a number of Europeans, when confronted with various demonstrations of nostalgia for the Third Reich, would without doubt have also hoped to hear us say that excusing the Nazi atrocities by pointing the finger at Stalinist crimes is unacceptable from an intellectual and moral viewpoint, and indeed that â in view of the war of remembrance that is currently bringing the Baltic republics and Russia into conflict â we should keep in mind Nazi Germanyâs share of the responsibility in the tragedy of the Baltic States.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will clarify a point: all the arguments that I have just put forward were in fact taken from an article published the day before yesterday in the French daily , under the name of Michael Mertes, a former adviser to the ex-Chancellor, Helmut Kohl.
That is your political family, members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats!
Thank God!
We lost that war, it concludes, adding a line which I suggest you contemplate: the way we envisage the past teaches us more about our current attitudes than about the past itself.
At a time when the European Union is consulting its citizens on a draft Constitution, how will these citizens interpret the concept of an enlarged Europe that starts by questioning the cornerstone of the vision of Europe and the world, born on 8 May 1945, namely that Nazism was neither a dictatorship nor a tyranny like any other, but rather the complete break with society as a whole?
As far as we are concerned, we are ready for a debate that leaves no stone unturned, whether it focuses on the crimes of Stalinism, on the German-Soviet Pact of bleak memory, or further still on the history of the Baltic States.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, however, should allow us to trivialise Nazism, the intended aim of which â should we need reminding â was to exterminate sub-humans and to enlarge the essential space of the superior race through mass warfare.
That is the reason why we had a right to expect a text on 8 May 1945 from the European Parliament with a completely different focus.
Might it not even have been too much, furthermore, to pay tribute to the anonymous soldiers on this occasion, who, with no other ambition but to live and act as upstanding men and women, became involved in the resistance at risk of their lives, which so many of them sacrificed for our freedom.
One word â just one word â on the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their tens of thousands of dead in a defeated country would likewise not have been too much.
The European Parliament has truly failed to reconcile itself with history on this occasion.
In addition, my group unanimously refuses to back this resolution, which is far removed from our concept of the Europe of 25, 27 or 30.
I shall leave the final word to a European leader who, 20 years ago, found the appropriate words to speak about 8 May 1945, and in a country where it was most difficult to speak them openly.
I am talking about the former German President, Richard von Weizsaecker.
If I may quote him.
âWe have the strength to look the truth in the face as best we can, without embellishment and without distortion.
With every day, something became clearer, and this must be stated today on behalf of us all: 8Â May was a day of liberation.
It liberated us all from the inhumanity and tyranny of the Nazis.â
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Second World War began in September 1939 when my country, Poland, was invaded and occupied by Germany and the Soviet Union.
This partition of Poland came about as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which had been signed a week earlier in Moscow.
Poland was not conquered by the fighting squads of the Nazi or Communist parties, but by the regular armed forces of its neighbours, or in other words by the German , and and by the Red Army.
It should be added that the National Socialist Party, with ChancellorÂ Hitler at its head, ruled over Germany at the time, having come to power on the basis of a democratic decision by the German electorate.
Stalin and the Communist Party governed Russia, having been swept to power by the revolution.
We are currently celebrating the 60th anniversary of Germanyâs capitulation, which took place on 8Â MayÂ 1945 and has come to symbolise the end of the wrongful acts committed by Nazi Germany in the occupied countries.
Yet it did not mean the end of the wrongdoing that began with the Soviet Unionâs invasion of Poland in 1939.
We won the war against Germany, but we lost the war against Russia. This meant that a foreign power, a foreign economic system and a foreign ideology were forced upon us.
We fought on all fronts in the Second World War, and we were there when the first and last shots were fired.
As of 1941, our allies in the war against Germany included the Soviet Union.
We acknowledge the role played by Russia in defeating Nazi Germany and the huge loss of life the country suffered in the process.
Yet this does not alter the fact that Russia acted as though it had conquered Poland.
What is more, our Western allies in the fight against Germany were also allies of the Soviet Union, and gave their consent to our enslavement in Yalta.
We were forced to liberate ourselves little by little, firstly by decollectivising agriculture, then by setting free the Church, then by gaining acceptance for small and private businesses and finally by achieving the freedom to form trade unions, as well as freedom of speech and political freedom.
The only help we received from the rest of the world in this process came by way of the arms race, which was won over time by the USA, and, in particular, through the success of Reaganâs âStar Warsâ programme, which weakened the Soviet Union.
The presence of American troops in Europe and the existence of NATO meant that Western Europe has been able to enjoy peace for the past 60Â years.
Now the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are either members of NATO or have formed partnerships for peace, are also reaping the benefits.
Each and every one of us shares a desire for peace and freedom, and for a future shaped according to our wishes.
The members of my generation, who experienced the Second World War at first hand, will not be with us for much longer, and we must ensure that future generations remember the truth about this war.
We Poles find it a source of great distress that so many Western media outlets continue to use phrases that we find insulting, such as âPolish concentration campsâ, or even âPolish gas chambers and crematoriaâ, which was how the British had the temerity to refer to them in print.
It is the case that some of these factories of death were located on Polish territory, but the fact remains that they were German, not Polish.
Not all Germans bear the responsibility for such things, and we acknowledge that the German nation has distanced itself from its shameful Nazi legacy, but we are keen to ensure that future generations do not associate Poland with the crimes committed by the Nazis, as Poland was not responsible for them.
Similarly, the Russian people are not responsible for the crimes committed during the Stalin era, or in other words for the deportations, the gulags, the genocide that was committed in Katyn and the subjugation of Central and Eastern Europe.
It was the Communist leaders of the Soviet state that were responsible for these crimes, and the Russians themselves also suffered enslavement.
We wish to be reconciled with the Russian people and state, but we expect them to distance themselves unequivocally from their Communist legacy.
The current leaders of Germany and Russia, or in other words the countries that started the Second World War, however, have given a joint interview to the German newspaper in which they attempt to divert attention away from anything other than their mutual relations and the losses they suffered.
We are currently seeking to establish neighbourly relations with both Germany and Russia.
As long ago as 1961, the Polish bishops sent a famous letter to the German bishops, which included the phrase; âwe forgive and ask forgivenessâ.
We take the same approach to our current relations with Russia, yet forgiveness and reconciliation do not mean that we should forget.
We would therefore call for there never again to be a repeat of such things as genocide, the subjugation of one nation by another, aggression and war.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, individual nations had very different experiences of the Second World War, and so the debate we are holding today is perhaps the most important debate on European identity that has been held for years.
If we genuinely wish to join together to form a single European spiritual community, we must all endeavour to gain a full understanding of the historical experiences of Europeâs nations.
In order to do so, there are certain issues about which we must speak quite frankly.
The resolution to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war has come about as a result of a hard-won compromise, and on the whole it is an accurate portrayal of the consequences of the war.
What is missing, however, is any reference to the link that exists between the start and the end of the war, or to the views on the war that are currently being touted in Russia.
Munich and the partition of Czechoslovakia were Hitlerâs first acts of aggression, but there is no denying that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the real call to war.
Poland fell victim to the cooperation between the Third Reich and the USSR in September 1939, and this was followed by Germanyâs invasions of Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia and Greece, as well as by the Soviet invasions of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
Stalin did not join the Allies in their fight against Germany of his own free will.
In fact, quite the opposite is true, as he refused to cooperate with France and Great Britain.
It was only after Hitlerâs attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 that he secured the assistance of the British and the Americans by entering into a new coalition, which was ultimately to defeat the Third Reich.
Yet even though it was the Red Army which bore the main brunt of the war, no changes were made to the Soviet system.
The Gulag Archipelago continued to expand, and the number of lives it claimed can be compared to the number of Soviet citizens that fell in the war.
The cooperation between the Big Three was therefore based on a mere semblance of common values, which was why it proved impossible to maintain after the end of the war.
Just before his death, Roosevelt admitted that America could not do business with Stalin, as the latter had broken every one of the promises he had made.
Yet this admission came too late.
Europe was divided, and Eastern Europe was driven into the arms of Stalinist totalitarianism.
The countries affected included Poland, which was the first to put up any resistance to Hitler, even at a time when his ally was Stalin.
The Polish armed forces constituted a quarter of the Allied forces, and in relative terms the country suffered the greatest loss of lives during the war.
Unfortunately, Russia is reluctant nowadays to acknowledge the ambiguous role played by the USSR during the war.
President Putin has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of the Second World War and its aftermath, and claimed that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a normal international treaty.
Russia has officially denied that Stalin attacked Poland in 1939, that genocide was committed in Katyn and that the USSR occupied the Baltic states.
It has even said that the Yalta Conference brought democracy to Poland.
Viktor Yerofeyev, a well-known Russian writer, recently wrote that Russia is enlightened enough to make no distinction between Stalinâs totalitarianism and Hitlerâs regime.
If Russia were indeed enlightened, there would be every reason to hope that it could be reconciled with Europe.
Any signs of a rehabilitation of Stalin should serve as a warning to all of us, however.
Why is this so important right now?
PresidentÂ Putin has said that reconciliation between Russia and Germany could set an example to Europe.
Unfortunately, any reconciliation that is based on a Stalinist interpretation of history sets the warning bells ringing, and they are ringing particularly loudly in Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn.
Both the Polish people and the other nations of Central Europe believe that it will be impossible to achieve peace and reconciliation in Europe if the nations situated between Germany and Russia are left out of the equation in this fashion.
What the House needs to understand is that we in Poland and Central Europe feel too cramped for comfort whenever the superpowers of Western Europe and Russia shake hands over our heads.
Â Â  Mr President, it is of great importance that we should at this moment commemorate the end of the Second World War 60 years ago.
It is also a good thing that on this occasion, it is underlined once again that freedom and democracy should not be taken for granted, and have to be actively upheld.
The atrocities of National Socialism are a black page in Europeâs history and the previous speakers were right to point out that there is little, if anything, that can be added to that.
It is regrettable, though, that Western Europe is devoting so little attention to the historical fact that 60 years ago, the official go-ahead was given for handing over the Eastern European peoples to Soviet occupation, to dictatorial Communist regimes that were certainly a match for the Nazis in terms of horror and crime.
The Red Army was already at Warsaw in 1944, simply waiting until the Nazis had suppressed the uprising.
Sixty years ago, there was praise and honour everywhere in the West for Joseph Stalin, a tyrant who had by then already killed millions of people and who, with the connivance of the liberated West, would go on to kill many more millions, in and outside of Russia.
It is, in fact, high time that Russia should follow Germany in putting the past to rights.
Officially, countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were liberated by the Red Army.
Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Latviaâs President, pointed out that 1945 did not bring the Baltic States liberation of any kind, quite the contrary.
Let me quote her: âIt meant slavery, it meant occupation, it meant submission and Stalinist terrorâ.
The European leaders who were in Moscow a few days ago hardly took the trouble to broach that reality, and what meant liberation for the Western Europeans 60 years ago, was another calvary for Eastern Europe, the difference being that the new dictatorships could count on the active support and sympathy of so many Western European politicians, media, intellectuals and many others, some of whom, in fact, appeared to be on the payroll of the Soviet secret services.
It is perhaps apt, 60 years down the line, to look at those issues.
Maybe Europe will not be able to fully put the past to rest unless a kind of Nuremberg Trial of Communism is held, not in an attempt to open up old wounds but with the intention never to forget, with the future of our children and grandchildren in mind.
I am shocked when a European Commissioner includes photos on his website on which he demonstrates his admiration for one such as Fidel Castro.
I am shocked when intellectuals and policy-makers continue to deny or play down the advent of Islamic extremism.
Jean-FranÃ§ois Revel already spoke of â the totalitarian temptation.
If there is one lesson to be learnt from the atrocities of the Second World War, it is that totalitarianism should not be given another chance, wherever it may appear.
Â Â  The great Hungarian poet born a century ago, Attila JÃ³zsef, reminds us that we, the European nations, who have fought many wars between ourselves, have a lot of common matters to put in order.
In his letter to Vytautas Landsbergis and me, Mr Frattini has written recently that your history is our history too.
When we celebrate the end of the World War in Europe, we must not forget that the end of the war brought something different for each of the European nations.
In the case of more fortunate nations, it marked the end of long suffering and immeasurable destruction sixty years ago.
We bow our head before all who made a sacrifice for peace.
Another evil dictatorship, however, awaited the other half of Europe with no less suffering and destruction.
Night after night without daylight, occupation after occupation without independence, inhumane dictatorship after inhumane dictatorship without freedom.
Slovakian representative, Zita PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡, sits here behind me among us, whose Hungarian father, IstvÃ¡n KÃ¡nyai, was equally hunted by Nazis and Fascists, and then later suffered nine years in the hells of Soviet concentration camps.
The one, who frees the innocent captive from one prison and locks him up in another, is a prison guard, not a liberator.
And the prisoner will not see him as someone who granted his freedom, but one who took it.
For many European nations, their much-coveted freedom came fifty years after May 8, 1945.
And the last step was taken May 1, 2004, marking the ending of the Yalta world order.
In reality, the Second World War ended on May 1, 2004.
Therefore, the end of the war should more appropriately be celebrated here, in the capital of reunified Europe instead of Moscow.
The nations of Europe looked at two sides of the same wall: the barbed wire divided us in two for half a century.
We bore the unbearable, endured the system established by the Soviet Red Army, who stayed after the liberation, genocide, class and ethnic-based cleansing, the killing, torturing, deportation and disenfranchisement of innocent people committed in the name of the progressive socialist idea.
The system forced upon Central European nations by Soviet Communism was a direct consequence of the plan that Stalin spoke about on August 19, 1939 before the PolitbÃŒro, when giving an explanation for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
I quote:
Our nations rose up against such dictatorship from the Bolshevik Parties many times: 1956 in Berlin, October 1956 in Hungary and PoznaÃ±, 1968 in Czechoslovakia and 1980 in Poland.
The West welcomed our revolutions, sympathised with us, then tolerated it when the Soviet Union quashed and bloodily stamped out these expressions of desire for freedom.
Dear colleagues, our history is your history too.
Nevertheless, we, the nations freed from Soviet occupation a decade ago, find no compassion when it comes to our recent history.
After the war, Western Europe proudly straightened itself up and started to prosper in peace.
Although it was not our fault, we got left out of this process. This gives ground to the current situation, in which there are people on the luckier side of Europe and even here in Parliament, who want to generate capital for themselves by frightening their own population with the cheap citizens of the new Member States, with people, whose country fell into an economic crisis because of the ineffectual socialist economy forced on them.
But many people in Western Europe do not understand either why the five-pointed red star, like the swastika, has become the symbol for hatred and oppression.
Our history is your history too.
Sixty years ago, Nazi powers were jointly defeated by nations of Europe.
The discredited political class disappeared.
There are no squares named after Hitler, and no statues erected to commemorate Nazi killers.
Half a century later, the Soviet Union and the Communist regime also collapsed.
Similarly, Yugoslavian Communism that went on its separate way without Soviet occupation suffered a disgraceful defeat.
The successors of the fallen Communist system are eloquent business people demanding respect, responsible politicians, so to say.
In Russia, statues of Stalin have been erected again, and the Soviet occupation, once again, is referred to as liberation.
It seems that they wanted to hear less and less about the atrocities of the Communist dictatorship.
Dear Parliament, we must not think with a double standard.
Auschwitz, the Katyn forest massacre, the Nazi and the two-time Soviet occupation of the Baltic States, unjust dictatorships dismembering Europeâs spheres of interest, borders drawn by force and pacts, deportation of whole nations, murdering, torturing, crippling of people, disenfranchising population exchanges, walls dividing nations, trampling on human and minority rights, these are all gross injustices, regardless of who committed them.
Sixty years after the military end of the war, it is time to face these issues.
The enormous sacrifice of the Soviet army demands respect and honour.
The occupying army, however, does not deserve our respect; it forced its own oppressing dictatorship on one part of the European nations.
As long as we are unable to call an atrocity an atrocity, adjudge murder as murder, as long as we measure one sin with another, war will continue to rage in our head and wounds will not heal.
Jesus says that the truth makes us free.
The reuniting of Europe gives opportunity for a new beginning.
Once winners and losers, oppressors and oppressed, we can build a joint, democratic Europe together based on the virtue of human dignity rooted in the Christian tradition, with hope for a brighter future and happier generations to come.
Let us listen to Attila JÃ³zsef, let us listen to the poet, and create order in our common matters!
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, today this House is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which was the most terrible war in history.
It claimed the lives of millions of people and led to the annihilation of the Jews, as well as plunging Europe into the depths of savagery, economic devastation and moral decay.
We should bow our heads in memory of this time and commemorate the victims of this war.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though there are certain key moments in our collective memory that allow us to join together in building a political community, each of the European nations remembers the 20th century in its own way. The reason for this is that our states and our peoples have experienced different historical and political events.
There is, however, one thing that unites us, as we all remember the victims claimed by the war and the struggle for freedom and democracy.
It is the memory of these things that provides a basis for our common European identity.
Today we are commemorating the victims of the Nazi terror in the countries occupied by the Third Reich.
We are also honouring the victims of the Holocaust, or in other words the genocide committed against the Jews in Europe during the Second World War, which was a crime that has no parallel in human history.
We are commemorating the victory of the Allied nations over the Third Reich, and in particular the part played by the United States of America in liberating Europe.
We are remembering all the soldiers who died in order to rid the world of Nazism, and the 14Â million soldiers who fought in the Red Army.
We are commemorating the losses suffered by all sides in the Second World War, as well as those who fell victim to Stalin during the war.
The massacre of around 22Â 000Â Polish citizens and prisoners of war in Katyn, and in other camps and prisons in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1940, has become a symbol of the latter.
We are paying homage to those who fought for freedom, democracy and human rights, and we are particularly remembering the heroic resistance movement, which fought against fascism and occupation in the various countries.
The ideals of this movement, and the willingness of its members to sacrifice themselves in a one-sided war, are now a true legacy to us, as well as something of which we can all be proud and a fine example for Europeâs young people.
Today I should like to commemorate the resistance movement in the Warsaw ghetto, and those who belonged to the Jewish Military Organisation and who took up arms on 19Â AprilÂ 1943 to defend the Jewish ghetto that had been created in Warsaw by the occupying powers.
Although in military terms they had no chance of winning, fighting as they did in the midst of the war and in the heart of a Europe ruled by the Nazis, their fight did in fact have a deeper meaning.
Nowadays we regard their heroism as the most powerful testimony to human spirit ever seen, and one of the moral foundations of the Europe that we have built.
To echo the sentiments found in a manifesto of the Jewish Military Organisation, we are fightingÂ for your and our freedom, and for your and our human, social and national honour and dignity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are remembering that the end of the war did not bring true liberation, independence and democracy to all the nations of Europe.
The end of the war meant new forms of oppression and a lack of sovereignty and democracy for Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.
It also meant violations of fundamental human rights under the totalitarian that was imposed on this part of Europe by the Soviet Union, the loss of independence for Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and their incorporation into the Soviet Union.
Throughout the 20th century, the Socialists, the Social Democrats and the Democratic Left adopted a stance of opposition to all forms of dictatorship and to all non-democratic regimes.
We are a political movement that has always been on the side of democracy and human rights, whether in the Baltic states, in Central and Eastern Europe or in the countries of Southern Europe in which dictators came to power after the Second World War, namely Portugal, Spain and Greece.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on ground that bears the scars of wars and the downfall of Europe.
Our forefathers met on this ground as soldiers on opposing sides.
We now meet each other as citizens and as MEPs representing a uniting Europe.
Since the 1950s, European integration and the construction of a European Community have been our response to the war.
The conflicts between Europeâs nations were overcome in the process of setting up the European institutions, and this continues to be the case today.
The European Union we have today is the product of three major democratic processes, namely the defeat of fascism in the war, the fall of the dictatorships in Southern Europe in the late 1970s and the victory of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.
A model of international order is being establishedÂ in Europe on the basis of peace and cooperation, and a community is being set up in accordance with the principle of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities.
The various peoples that go to make up the European Union, which now has 25Â Member States, have a variety of historical experiences behind them.
Ratification of the Constitution for Europe will mean that a united Europe can be established, the goals of which are peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world.
This Europe can also become a special area of human hope, to borrow the phrase used in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty.
Together we have travelled a long road, from a Europe overwhelmed by war, totalitarian regimes and human misery, to a democratic Europe in which free nations within the EU are jointly creating a European future.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 60Â years after the end of the Second World War, Europeâs future depends to a great extent on whether two basic conditions are met.
The first of these is that the history of the events that occurred during the Second World War be generally acknowledged, and the second is that a common vision of European integration be brought about on the basis of this history.
The way in which people remember history can differ according to whether or not the end of the war amounted to genuine liberation for them.
Poles remember a number of key dates thatÂ sealed the fate of the Second World War as a tragic event.
The first of these is 1Â SeptemberÂ 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland.
This date marked the beginning ofÂ a nightmarish time of occupation, repression and concentration camps, when the occupying forces did their best to annihilate the Polish nation and people.
It was, however, also a time of heroic deeds by the underground state and society.
Another date Poles remember is 17Â SeptemberÂ 1939.
Although this date unfortunately has less resonance in Western Europe, we find it both distressing and highly significant, as it is the date when the Soviet Union attacked Poland.
This attack took place following the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Hitler and Stalin, which provided for another partition of Poland.
Other dates include 1943, when the crimes committed in Katyn in 1940 were uncovered, or in other words the slaughter of tens of thousands of Polish officers and officials on Stalinâs orders, merely because they served the Polish state, and 1943 and 1944, when two heroic uprisings took place.
The first of these was Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which ended in bloody defeat, or rather extermination, and the second was the Warsaw Uprising, which Soviet troops watched from the right bank of the Vistula without taking any action.
The final date that Poles remember is 1945, as this is when the Yalta Conference took place.
The latter led to the creation of the Iron Curtain, which divided Europe for 44Â years, cutting off my country, Poland, from European democracy and integration.
That is all I wish to say about how we remember history.
Turning to the matter of a common vision of European integration, I should like to highlight a fundamental point.
What we remember are the crimes that were committed by systems, and the victims these systems claimed.
These memories should not and must not under any circumstances divide nations and peoples.
This is the message behind Solidarity, the Polish social movement which triggered the liberation of Eastern Europe and which is also celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.
This movement was the driving force behind the resumption of relations between the two parts of Europe that had been divided by the decisions made in Yalta.
Taking my cue from it, I should like to state quite categorically that solidarity must be the guiding principle of our common future.
I should like to finish by calling upon all Members to vote in favour of this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that a peaceful and prosperous Europe must be based on the respect for human rights.
For this reason, I cannot vote for Mr Brokâs resolution.
A number of its assertions would create a legal basis for the violation of human rights and lead to huge injustices in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia.
The motion for a resolution states that the countries of Eastern Europe were under Soviet occupation for many decades.
In the case of Latvia and Estonia, such an approach would have dangerous consequences for the more than half a million people who settled there during those decades.
Mr Toomas Ilves from Estonia recently explained in the what this assertion would mean: âhence, the protection of minorities in the Baltic states will become senselessâ.
Moreover, two weeks ago, the Latvian Parliament approved further consideration of the declaration asking the European Parliament for exemption from the obligation to accept foreign citizens and their descendants who were moved to Latvia during the time of occupation.
My father was a naval officer in the Soviet army and participated in the defeat of Hitlerâs army and of his local allies, ArÄjs, Cukurs and others, responsible for the liquidation of 80Â 000 Latvian Jews, including my fatherâs grandparents.
Moreover, my father was thrown out of the army, in accordance with Stalinâs orders, for being Jewish.
I will never accept that my father was an occupier, nor will I ever agree that my mother, a Russian Orthodox, who came to Riga from St Petersburg in 1950, should be subject to repatriation, as the draft Latvian declaration says.
The assertion made in this European Parliament resolution will encourage Latvian law-makers to accept this declaration in the very near future.
I do not want the Baltic states to become a second Balkans.
We parliamentarians are fully responsible for the words we are saying.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 8 May 1945 was the date that heralded the end of the Second World War, but it was also the date that sealed the end of the Fascist and Nazi dictatorships in Europe.
On that day, Europe liberated itself from the spectre of authoritarianism, and that date also heralded the beginning of a Europe aspiring towards peace and social justice.
Europe was liberated by the resistance of men and women, partisans who built the institutional and moral foundations of this Europe.
Europe was liberated by those who fought at Stalingrad; it was liberated by American and Canadian Allied troops, and equally by the Soviet army.
That date can be regarded as the foundation stone upon which a new Europe was built.
That page of history is, unfortunately, all too often subjected to revisionist plunder and attacks, and even this debate is marred by an unmistakeable revisionist impetus.
By indistinctly muddling 8 May 1945 with the crimes of Stalinism, we do a disservice to the commemoration of the Liberation of Europe.
I should like to be clear on that point: in terms of political beliefs, personal data and cultural development,myself and my group have no problem in firmly condemning the horrors of Stalinism; however, in this debate, people are seeking to surreptitiously bring to life the theories of Nolte, which equate Nazism with Communism, and not only with Stalinism.
In truth, the values of peace and social justice were, in that short century, threatened not only by Stalinism, but equally by colonialism, by imperialism, and by neo-liberalism: from Algeria to Vietnam, from the shelling of Belgrade to the massacres of Sabra and Shatila, up to the events of 11 September 1973 in Santiago del Chile.
We must do right by history: the memory of the past is a crucial gift in enabling us to contend with the future and to build the horizons of this Europe.
There is only one way to strengthen Europe: we must ban the term war from our vocabulary.
Europe must play an active role in building a peaceful world, stretching from Iraq to Afghanistan, and to Palestine.
To conclude, Europe has to be more courageous and authoritative; we must reverse the famous Latin saying and forcefully assert or âif you want peace, prepare for peaceâ.
That must be our guiding light.
Â Â  Mr President, I sometimes wonder what the arguments are for the European Union.
They certainly cannot be economic, because we do not live in a world of huge trade tariffs and certainly there is now a global economy.
They certainly cannot be democratic, because this Parliament is the only democratic element within the European Union and it is almost as good as useless.
However, if there were one argument for the European Union that would make me change my mind, it would be the argument that the European Union would give us, and would guarantee, peace.
However, all of this is based on a series of false assumptions.
It was not democratic nation-states that caused the First and Second World Wars.
If you look back through history, you find that mature democracies do not go to war with each other.
It is also wrong and quite false to claim that the EU has kept the peace in Europe for the last 50 years.
What war has it stopped?
Was Portugal going to fight Italy in the mid-1970s?
What possible war could it have stopped?
If there has been a guarantor of peace over the last 50 years, surely it must be NATO, an example of intergovernmental cooperation.
President Borrell goes on about the reunification of Europe.
I wonder sometimes what he is even talking about.
The important thing is: will the EU guarantee peace?
Does federation guarantee peace?
It did not in Yugoslavia or in the USSR and it did not in the United States of America, which, you remember, had one of the bitterest and bloodiest civil wars in the history of mankind.
If we go on selling this project to the peoples of Europe on a lie, we are more likely than not to stoke up and cause bitter resentments and extreme nationalism.
What we must do is tell the peoples of Europe the truth about our ambitions and give them free and fair referendums, otherwise we are heading for disaster.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, sixty years after the Second World War I can say with conviction that the European Union is the best model of cooperation between countries that has so far been experienced in the old continent.
In Europe, dialogue has replaced wars, and yet reconciliation, deep understanding of historical truth and the mutual intertwining of the interests of states and politicians has still not been achieved.
Yes, at this time we commemorate together one of humanityâs greatest victories over Nazi ideology.
We remember the victims of fascism and bow our heads in memory of the combatants who died.
Yes, it is satisfying that the whole political spectrum of the European Parliament has been able to unite on the resolution about the end of the Second World War and for the first time is simultaneously assessing and condemning the crimes of both the Nazi and the Communist regimes.
Ladies and gentlemen, our joint declaration stated unambiguously that there can be no reconciliation without historical truth; that only a strong Europe can provide solutions on how to overcome the legacy of the past, at the foundation of which lies injustice and the 50-year long social, political and economic degradation of nations that were kept imprisoned.
Unfortunately, our declaration did not say everything.
Neither is what Jean-Claude Juncker said in Moscow yesterday acceptable.
He said that the resolution of these problems is a question for future generations.
Only the powerful call things by their true names.
A few days ago in Riga, George Bush said, quite unmistakably: ââthe Yalta agreement followed in the unjust tradition of Munich and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Once again, when powerful governments negotiated, the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable.
Yet this attempt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability left a continent divided and unstable.â
The real cold war in Europe that lasted for nearly 50 years confirms what he said.
Everyone in the European Parliament knows that NATO, the North-Atlantic union, was created to promote European security in the climate of fear of an invasion by the totalitarian, cynical and aggressive Soviet regime.
This confirms the fact that for the West, following the Second World War, there was no trust in an ally such as Stalin.
The evil empire created by Stalin was unacceptable, even though before then the victory over Nazi ideology had been jointly celebrated.
Ladies and gentlemen, when we are thinking about Europeâs future, what I have just said should be borne closely in mind.
Sixty years have passed since the Second World War, and Europe together with its allies is shaping its future.
Unfortunately, Russia, inheritor of the mantle of the USSR, is still making statements denying its influence over the countries of eastern Europe, and the occupation of my country, Latvia, and of Lithuania and Estonia.
This disowning of historical truth, the deliberate upholding of the crimes of the Communist regime, is humiliating.
It amounts to contempt for the victims and casualties of the regime, yet it is happening today.
Russia is trying to hold on to opportunities to manipulate public opinion worldwide.
Russia is keeping the problem of non-citizens in Latvia in the public eye and exaggerating it, but at the same time it is continuing to violate the human rights of victims and casualties of the totalitarian Soviet regime, and their immediate families, by denying their suffering and losses.
Such an attitude by Russia does nothing to foster reconciliation between Russia and the states of eastern Europe and the Baltic which have regained their freedom.
Genuine condemnation of the crimes of Communism and a resolution of their consequences are needed in the name of Europeâs future stability.
I call upon you to vote for the resolution!
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the EU nations has very definitely not been an easy one.
It has seen these nations fight against each other, betray each other and commit atrocities against each other.
It was Europeans who came up with the idea of the supremacy of the Aryan race, the Final Solution for other races and the gas chambers.
What is more, the rest of Europe initially sat back and did nothing while this was going on.
I regret to say that a line has still not been drawn under this period.
Sixty years after the end of the Second World War, there are Members of this House whoÂ refuse to vote in favour of resolutions condemning the Holocaust, who persistently put the suffering of the victims of the Second World War on a par with that of its architects, and who distort the past and fail to differentiate properly between the causes and the effects of the most horrendous conflict of all time.
The recent speeches by a number of leading representatives of the Member States and of the European institutions to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war have revealed that they are infatuated with the idea that our golden age of prosperity and peace is a direct result of the European Unionâs history.
For the sake of future generations, we should not forget that this is very far from being the case.
Peace in Europe can just as well be attributed toÂ the presence of American troops on European soil, and prosperity can be explained by economic growth in Asia and the United States and the increase in global trade.
As far as freedom is concerned, revolutions took place in a number of European countries, including my own, without any help from Brussels.
It is a matter of some concern to me that the democracy and prosperity we have succeeded in achieving are now under threat.
Europeâs potential to act as a global player will be reduced by the incomprehensible and unjust European Constitution, which benefits certain countries at the expense of others.
The distance that exists between politicians and the real world is a further factor jeopardising Europeâs future, as the citizens of the individual Member States understand ever less of the language spoken by the European institutions and their representatives.
Where will Europe end up if its public does not understand its leaders?
Will it become easy prey for the worst kind of populism, simply because noÂ one can understand it?
It is my firm belief that no media campaign will ever succeed in boosting public confidence in the idea of a common Europe.
The only way this can be done is by implementing practical and easy-to-understand measures that provide solutions to real problems.
The inability of European leaders to promote growth and the cowardly, Euronationalist approach to economic matters are a far from adequate response to the hard facts of the global economy.
I represent the citizens of a country that suffered as a result of the Iron Curtain, which fell 15 years ago.
Today, however, we are seeing attempts to build new âcurtainsâ around Europe to keep out the United States, Chinese textiles, a cheap workforce and many asylum seekers.
Shutting ourselves off from the world will not solve the problems that Europe is facing.
In view of the lack of public interest and the economic slowdown, it is becoming apparent that the way in which the European Union is currently governed will be unsustainable if Europe is to be competitive.
I believe that EU leaders should have the courage to admit to themselves and to the public that the revitalised Lisbon Strategy and the unjust European Constitution are nothing but a dead end, and will not result in more justice, freedom or prosperity.
The only correct response to the current state of the global economy and global politics is to be open, to limit our interference in economic matters, to lower taxes, to enable the nation states to operate more flexibly and to coordinate matters at EU level in a sensible fashion, and only in instances where it proves necessary.
Â Â  I have received a motion for a resolution(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  â This commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Fascism has triggered a repellent exercise in revisionism and historical distortion, part of which is the unacceptable motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Far from being naÃ¯ve, this dreadful falsification of history sets out to meet some very specific objectives.
The aim is to wipe out the key contribution made by the Soviet Union and its peopleâs glorious struggle to destroy the brutal killing machine of the Nazi Fascist armies and regimes, along with its decisive role in reining in imperialist aggression during the post-war period.
This motion for a resolution seeks to silence and defame the glorious and heroic role played by the communists in the anti-fascist struggle.
It seeks to airbrush the Nazi horror, its millions of deaths in concentration camps, the millions of men, women and children killed, and the systematic destruction of entire countries.
It seeks to gloss over the fact that Hitlerâs rise to power was aided by German capital and by the complicity of the large capitalist interests, which fed the hope, right until the end, that the Nazi war machine would destroy the main enemy, the Soviet Union.
It seeks, just like 60 years ago, to defend the indefensible, namely imperialist and militarist aggressiveness and the aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty of peoples.
It will not succeed!
Â Â  The next item is a series of oral questions to the Council in accordance with Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure (B6-0236/2005).
Â Â  Question No 1 has been withdrawn.
Is the Council aware that the United States of America's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has stripped graduate teachers at American private universities of the protection of US labour law?
The right to organise collectively into a trade union is a human right.
Is the Council willing to put pressure on the Bush administration to allow academic unions to organise to protect the quality of jobs, academic freedoms and the intellectual standards of US universities?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, with regard to the situation of graduate teachers in the United States, I can answer MrÂ Evans by saying that the Council is not acquainted with the situation outlined in his question.
The type of professional relations mentioned by the Member falls within the jurisdiction of the individual Member States.
That is why, although human rights issues make up a significant part of the regular dialogue between the European Union and the United States, the Union is not able to debate this type of professional relations with the US authorities.
Â Â  Thank you for that response, even if it was not quite the one I wanted.
Surely, this is not a matter that needs 25 countries to act individually; it is a very serious issue.
Our relations with the United States are not just about trade and businesses making money and, equally, this is not just a United States issue, nor one solely concerning American citizens, as there are a good number of Europeans teaching at these American institutions.
Now I understand that the provost of Columbia University in NewÂ York has issued instructions on how he would like graduate teachers dealt with and punished.
I would say to the presidency, in solidarity and in defence of international labour law, that we should not remain silent on this and we should not just stand aside and allow a flagrant abuse of workersâ rights.
Although this is happening in the United States, it could also be affecting European citizens.
I would urge him to go back and see what more can be done.
Â Â  . I regret that I am unable to say anything other that what I have already said, but nevertheless I have taken full note of the Memberâs comments.
Every country must certainly respect international labour law, and I am in complete agreement with that point of view.
It is a point that I accept and one that could certainly be brought up in the context of relations with the United States, as I have pointed out.
Â Â  . The Council is closely monitoring the situation with regard to the rights of minorities in the Western Balkans.
The latest analysis of the rights of minorities in Serbia and Montenegro is that presented by the Commission in its feasibility report assessing the readiness of Serbia and Montenegro to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
For its part, the situation with regard to the rights of minorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been outlined in the latest annual Commission report, which has been drawn up in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association process.
Generally speaking, the situation regarding the rights of minorities in the Western Balkans has improved in recent years, although significant progress still remains to be made.
Instead of drawing a comparison between the provisions made with regard to minorities in Serbia and Montenegro and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Council intends to continue encouraging these countries taking into account their entirely specific circumstances to pursue a policy on minorities that is in full compliance with European standards.
Â Â  Mr President, as the Ohrid Agreement imposes very stringent conditions on Macedonia as regards the protection of minorities, I would ask that we avoid applying double standards, which I rather think we risk doing.
We are mainly concerned here with two areas: the Sandzak of Novi Pazar and Vojvodina, where the problems with minorities continue to be extremely serious, and it is these that I wish to bring to your attention.
Â Â  . I readily acknowledge the importance of drawing the Councilâs attention to the treatment of minorities in the regions that you have just mentioned, and of making a kind of comparison with the protection of minorities, in accordance with the Ohrid Agreement.
I believe, however, that we are talking about two different situations, which must be assessed accordingly.
In the context of the development of its relations with Serbia, the European Union will not fail to insist forcefully on the protection of minorities in the regions that you have mentioned.
Â Â  .
As has already been pointed out in response to similar questions, the Council has persisted in underlining its commitment to pursuing efforts aimed at the reunification of Cyprus. It hopes, furthermore, that all Cypriots may soon live together, as Cypriot and European citizens belonging to a reunified island within the European Union.
From this perspective, the European Union has undertaken to examine measures capable of ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and of facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community.
Certain measures have already been taken to this end, such as the âGreen Lineâ Regulation, which was adopted in 2004 and recently amended in order to broaden its scope and increase its effectiveness.
Important work has also been carried out focusing on other measures, namely Commission proposals concerning, on the one hand, the instrument of financial support aimed at promoting economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community and, on the other hand, exchanges with areas where the government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exert effective control.
Adopting those two proposals is not yet possible, as there remain problems to be overcome, particularly as regards direct exchanges.
It is to this last proposal that the Member makes particular reference in his question.
The hypothesis put forward by CommissionerÂ Rehn at the January meeting of Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, with regard to a possible reworking of the proposalâs legal basis, has not yet been presented to the Council.
In actual fact, the responsibility lies with the Commission to rework its proposal in this way, if it so desires.
Obviously, the Presidency cannot tell at this stage what the Councilâs decisions might be in this regard.
I must point out, however, that legal opinions exist which do not confirm the approach taken by the Commission regarding the legal basis that it initially adopted.
By means of the Presidency, the Council can once again assure the Member that it will pursue its efforts to promote the islandâs economic integration and improved relations between the two Cypriot communities and with the European Union.
Â Â  . I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that reply.
It seems to me that everybody is blaming everybody else.
It has been over a year since the Council pledged to end the isolation of Turkish Cypriots in the wake of their two-thirds âyesâ vote to the UNâs Annan Plan for a political settlement.
One has to ask what trust can anyone place in EU pledges if this is an example of non-delivery.
As the minister pointed out, direct trade and helping the economy of the north would assist in a political settlement.
It is of no help to anyone for the Turkish Cypriots to be so far behind the Greek Cypriots in income and economic development.
When will some serious pressure be exerted to actually deliver on that year-old pledge?
In the meantime, the Turkish Cypriots are dangling out there in isolation, losing trust in EU promises.
I must confess, I cannot blame them.
When can we expect these two regulations to be passed?
Â Â  . I can simply say to you, MrsÂ Ludford, that your question comes just at the right moment, since in an hour and a half, myself, as the representative of the Presidency, and CommissionerÂ Rehn, will travel to Cyprus to try to discuss the issues that you have just raised.
I believe that it is precisely the intention of the Presidency to resolve these issues as soon as possible, and to thus act in accordance with the political commitments undertaken by the Council in April.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses.
A joint report by Oxfam, ActionAid and the European Debt and Development Coalition was recently published, assessing EU Member States' performance in the area of development.
Rich countries of the world agreed in 1970 at the UN General Assembly to reach 0.7% of GNI as foreign aid, at the latest by 1980.
Twenty-five years after this deadline, only five countries have reached this target, four of which are EU Member States.
Many other countries have broken their promises in relation to eradicating poverty.
For example Ireland has abandoned its plans to reach the target of 0.7 per cent by 2007.
As the Luxembourg Presidency has stated that the fight against poverty will be the main objective of the Presidency programme, will it use its influence to renew Member States' aid commitments, and how does it plan to ensure fulfilment of EU development aid goals?
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs proposals, which identify the measures to be taken with a view to speeding up the process of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, have been under discussion by a Council working group since 14 April 2005. The Luxembourg Presidency intends to put every possible measure in place to ensure that during its meeting on 23 and 24 May, the Council will be in a position to outline the core elements of its renewed commitments.
Essentially, these commitments will aim to, firstly, lay down new intermediate objectives for increasing public aid budgets by the year 2010, whether individual or regarding the Union as a whole, in an effort to reach a global figure of 0.7% of GDP by 2015. Secondly, they will aim to speed up reforms to improve the quality of aid, and thirdly, to reconsider the way in which the European Union, through its own model of sustainable development â by its internal and external policies â can influence development conditions.
That requires coherent policies to promote development, which is a fundamental factor in our approach to cooperation and development. Fourthly, the commitments will aim to see Africa benefit from these new orientations as a priority issue, and seize the new opportunities offered by a partnership between the two continents.
The European Union is fully aware of the importance and urgency of the task.
In this context, during its meeting held on 22 and 23 March, the European Council called on the Commission and the Council to speed up their work, particularly with regard to the various components of the âdevelopmentâ strand, so as to finalise the positions on the various issues and to allow the European Union to play an active role during future discussions with a view to the United Nations Summit being held in September 2005.
I have already announced this morning that the ECOFIN Council, after having considered potential new funding methods at its last meeting, will return to the issue during its informal meeting taking place this weekend.
Â Â  I would like to point out to the President-in-Office that this target of 0.7% was agreed 35 years ago and to date only five states, four of them EU states â four out of 25 EU states â have met this target of 0.7%.
By 2025, 2Â billion more people will be on this planet, 90% of them born into the Third World.
What sort of world will we leave to the next generation?
We have just spoken about the Second World War.
What are we building up for our children and grandchildren?
What solid steps will the Council take to see to it that Member States meet their obligations?
Â Â  . I actually believe that there is a renewed desire to move clearly and resolutely towards the target of 0.7%.
I obviously agree with what the Member has just said: it is taking too long.
In actual fact, we have been discussing this target for more than 30 years.
It is now time to implement it, and it is true that the timescales that have been set are perhaps still excessively long.
Â Â  . Since my speech before Parliament in February, the Israeli Government has, to our great regret, taken the decision to extend the restrictions imposed on the release of Mordechai Vanunu last year by an additional 12 months.
A trial is taking place, moreover, in which MrÂ Vanunu is accused of having infringed these restrictions, and upon its conclusion he runs the risk of receiving another prison sentence.
It would appear that this is an extremely sensitive matter for the Israeli authorities.
It appears that they want to protect the security of the State of Israel in this way.
By taking the decision to extend the restrictions imposed on MrÂ Vanunu, the Israeli Government alleged that he still had information to disclose.
That said, nearly 20 years after the fact, it is also reasonable to acknowledge the fundamental rights of an individual who has spent 18 years in prison, such as the right to live in dignity, freely and peacefully.
We are therefore planning to pursue the dialogue with the Israeli authorities, in particular on the issue of respect for human rights, in the context of the political dialogue that we are conducting with them, and in implementing the Neighbourhood Policy in which the Israeli Government has pledged to cooperate, on security issues and issues of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and, precisely, on respect for human rights.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, which was as helpful as it could be in the circumstances.
However, it is clear to me that Israel has moved from protecting state security to persecuting this man.
I hope the Council really will keep up the pressure on Israel to release him.
Mordechai Vanunu has been elected rector of Glasgow University in my country, and we would very much like to see him able to come to the university and take up his role.
Therefore, I hope the Council will continue its pressure.
Â Â  . The Council has noted your point and will do what I have just said.
Â Â  . The Council would firstly like to thank the Member for the information he has communicated with regard to the violation of the fundamental rights of the Greek population of Georgia.
In its political dialogue with Georgia, the Council has expressed its concerns time and again about the need to improve human rights safeguards in this partner country.
The Council will continue to make good use of every opportunity to express its concerns regarding human rights in Georgia, particularly in the context of its cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the United Nations Commission for Human Rights.
On 17 January 2005, the Secretary General and High Representative for the CFSP appointed Michael Matthiessen as his Personal Representative on Human Rights.
The Special Representative for the Southern Caucasus, MrÂ Talvitie, also assists Georgia in carrying through its political and economic reforms, particularly as regards the rule of law, democratisation, human rights, good governance, development and poverty reduction.
The Council, in its conclusions of 25 April, highlighted the importance of these objectives and renewed its commitment to develop these various elements in the context of its relations and particularly of its European Neighbourhood Policy.
When the action plan on the European Neighbourhood Policy between the European Union and Georgia has been drafted and negotiated, the European Union will stress the need to improve human rights safeguards in that country.
The Council therefore intends to monitor very closely the situation of the Greek community as it unfolds, and to raise the issue amongst the Georgian authorities each time there are grounds to do so.
The European Parliament will perhaps also wish to address this issue itself during the next meeting of the EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which, according to my information, will take place on 13 and 14 June 2005.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply.
I absolutely agree with the framework of principles which he has set out for us.
However, the problem is not just the framework of principles: it is what we can do, in practical terms, in the European Union to protect human and minority rights in Georgia and throughout the world.
What levers and control mechanisms do we, as the European Union, have to persuade or pressure the Georgian authorities into respecting the rights of the Greek minority.
I say this because I have before me the report by the special representative â as you referred to him â of the European Union for human rights for Georgia dated 12Â April, which describes the human rights situation, and I must say it describes a very unpleasant situation for Greeks in Georgia.
What are we doing?
What tools do we have within the framework of our relations with Georgia?
I think this is what is important today.
Â Â  . Georgia has gone through a period of major upheaval but is now committed to the path to democracy.
It is, moreover, seeking to move closer to the European Union.
I believe that this reconciliation with the European Union, particularly in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy, should also allow pressure to be put on the Georgian authorities to lead them not only to respect human rights in general, but also, significantly, the rights of minorities.
I therefore believe that, in the context of the links between the European Union and Georgia, that issue will have to feature prominently.
It is also, moreover, as a result of Georgia wanting to move closer towards Europe, and the European Union in particular, that we will be better able to also defend the rights of the Greek minorities that you mention.
Â Â  . The Council welcomes the commitment made by several Heads of State or Government on 2 February 2005 in Sofia to eliminate all forms of discrimination towards the Roma by 2015.
I do not need to remind you about the debates that we have just held on the end of the Second World War and on the suffering incurred by the Roma people.
That commitment is a major step given that, since 1 May 2004, the Roma communities have become the largest ethnic minority within the European Union.
Due to the specific nature of their situation, their integration is a challenge of major proportions with regard to protecting fundamental rights and social inclusion.
As the Member is certainly aware, during accession negotiations with new Member States, as well as with Bulgaria and Romania, the European Union has brought up the Roma situation time and again as an area requiring political attention from the governments of those States, in particular in the light of the Copenhagen political criteria relating more specifically to the need to guarantee the respect and protection of minorities.
In confronting the challenge of integrating Roma communities, the major responsibility falls on national authorities, in addition to the regional and local authorities with the largest number of Roma inhabitants.
All members of civil society together with the Roma themselves also have a vital role to play.
For their part, the Member States can also implement, at Community level, various political programmes and relevant instruments relating to non-discrimination, equality of treatment and social integration.
In particular, they can use the Council Directive 2000/43 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.
This directive in fact covers a wide range of areas where discrimination towards the Roma can occur: employment, training, education, social protection, access to goods and services and access to housing.
Finally, Structural Funds, and particularly the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, can finance a number of initiatives to benefit the Roma community.
This is the case, in particular, with the Community initiative Equal, which is funded by the European Social Fund and is developing new approaches to fight against discrimination and inequalities, which, in the job market, specifically affect the Roma community.
Â Â  Thank you for that answer.
In it you reflected the seriousness of the challenge that we face, as the Roma are now the biggest homogeneous minority in the enlarged European Union.
Are we aware of the lack of activity by Member States, for example, their lack of implementation of the Equal Treatment Directive and of Article 13 of the Race Equality Directive, where the Commission is taking enforcement action?
Are we aware that Member States are lagging badly behind on the implementation of existing law that would protect the Roma community, particularly in employment?
This is a serious issue.
Can the Roma issue, given how immense it is, be reflected in final statements by the Luxembourg presidency, to ensure that the United Kingdom presidency that follows takes this issue equally seriously?
Â Â  I wish to press the President-in-Office on the final point my colleague made.
It would send a very positive signal, if this matter was raised at the level of heads of state and government, and the final communiquÃ© contained a reference to it.
The Roma feel they are a neglected body within this European Union.
This would send a good signal to them and would perhaps act as a lead, encouraging the Member States to take proper action.
Â Â  . Firstly, I will say that EU law must be fully enforced by all Member States.
I believe that it is a duty shared by all the States from the moment that they become members of the European Union.
I should like to add that the Community Action Programme against Discrimination aims to promote measures that combat discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.
One of the priority areas identified in the 2004 working programme specifically targeted the integration of the Roma into the labour market.
For all the Member States who have Roma minorities living in their country, this means including those minorities in national action programmes focusing on the labour market.
I believe that it is a question of using the Community instruments that I mentioned previously to encourage and to lead Member States to treat the social integration of Roma minorities in this way.
Â Â  . As the Council has already pointed out in its reply to Question No 1778 by MrÂ RÃŒbig, the process of examining the Commissionâs proposals has led the Council to adopt conclusions on 28 June on nuclear safety and on the safety of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management.
These conclusions reaffirm the commitment of the Community and its Member States to maintain a high level of nuclear safety.
At the same time, it is a question of â and I quote these conclusions â facilitating the choice of instrument(s), in the framework of the Euratom Treaty, that can contribute more effectively to achieving nuclear safety and the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, without excluding any instrument and in line with the principles of better law-making.
In accordance with these conclusions, an action plan was finalised in the second half of 2004.
It is based on three areas: the safety of nuclear installations; the safety of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management; the financing of the decommissioning of nuclear installations and of the safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.
In this context, the Luxembourg Presidency has drawn up a working programme that sets out tasks to be completed, and has appointed the three groups of experts responsible for the different areas of the action plan.
On the basis of this programme and considering the calendar of the various international authorities whose work has a bearing on the tasks to be completed, an overall report is planned for the end of 2006.
I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency attaches the greatest importance to this issue.
It must be observed, however, that there are blocking minorities who are preventing us from advancing more rapidly along this road.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Council for its answer to MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs question.
I have two follow-up questions.
The first concerns whether the Council believes that the terminal storage of radioactive waste is an issue of common interest to the extent that the EU should try to obtain common solutions for different Member States as to, for example, how and where their waste is ultimately to be stored.
My second question concerns the Euratom Treaty.
One of the discussion points in connection with the negotiations concerning the new Constitution related, of course, to whether the Euratom Treaty should be allowed to continue, as the Constitution allows it to.
Does the Council believe that it would have become more difficult to conduct a supranational policy in this area if the Euratom Treaty had not existed as a legal basis?
Â Â  . Let us begin with the Euratom Treaty.
In addition to the Convention, there have been initiatives calling precisely for a reform of the Euratom Treaty.
In actual fact, I believe that it might be time to carry out an in-depth reform of this Treaty.
We know that this reform is an extremely difficult undertaking, however, given that not all the Member States share the same approach as regards developing the nuclear sector.
Some of them believe, moreover, that the nuclear sector should simply not be developed.
It is partly for this reason that we remain in deadlock.
On the issue of storage, I have already told you that consultations are taking place between experts to find a better means of safeguarding the storage of nuclear waste.
I can assure you that in the context of the work currently being carried out, the Presidency will do all it can to move this issue forward, keeping in mind the safety, security and maximum protection of the environment, and also of the people.
Â Â  . The Penal Code is one of six specific legal texts mentioned by the Commission in its recommendation of October 2004, which, in accordance with the European Councilâs conclusions of 16 and 17 December 2004, must be enforced before the start of accession negotiations.
The Union is aware of the decision taken by the Turkish Government to postpone the date of the entry into force of the Code.
The Turkish authorities indicated that the entry into force of the new Penal Code was henceforth scheduled for 1 June 2005 instead of 1 April 2005.
Turkey announced its intention to take this opportunity to bring changes to the text with a particular view to improving provisions relating to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
In the recent meeting held between the Association Council and Turkey, the European Union made reference to this important issue and encouraged Turkey to review its provisions with a view to answering the concerns of the Union in this area and acting in compliance with the Copenhagen principles and criteria.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like, more specifically, to ask if you are monitoring progress in the reform of the Criminal Code, the directions in which it is going and the timetable for application.
What specific demands do you have?
Have you set a timetable?
Will it be an important issue for you, before 3 October, when examining Turkey's criteria and obligations?
Â Â  I truly believe that the Commission and the Council are very closely monitoring developments in relation to this crucial and important issue.
At this stage, I have no reason to doubt the firm intention of the Turkish authorities to adopt and to implement a penal code that has been rightly revised for the reasons I have outlined.
That is why I believe there is no reason to doubt the decisions that have been taken by the European Council.
Â Â  . The position of the European Union in favour of abolishing the death penalty is well known; it is actively defended by the European Union in its relations with third countries, and at multilateral level, in accordance with the European Unionâs position in respect of the death penalty.
In July 2004, when faced with the reintroduction of the death penalty in Iraq, the Council reacted by raising this issue with the Iraqi authorities on several occasions, and it will continue to do so in future.
Â Â  . â Thank you, Minister, for your reply to MrÂ Papadimoulis's question.
I have no comments to make.
Â Â  . Like the Commission and Parliament, the Council has, throughout the enlargement process, stressed the particular importance of protecting minorities and equal opportunities in the political representation of these minorities.
More specifically, during the last meeting of the EU-Romania Association Council, thus before the signing of the accession treaty, the Union pointed out that political pluralism was an essential principle of any democracy and that it was fundamentally linked to compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria.
The Union urged Romania to amend all of its restrictive legislative provisions affecting political parties and the planning of local elections, which had, in the past, prevented certain parties from taking part in the polls.
The Council is well aware of the problems faced by certain new political parties representing ethnic minorities in Romania in registering themselves to stand for election.
The development of these issues will continue to be monitored from the perspective of the Copenhagen political criteria in the strengthened monitoring of Romaniaâs pre-accession preparations.
Â Â  . The Council would like to point out to the Member that it considers that the Convention concerning Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children concluded at the Hague on 19 October 1996, is a valuable contribution to the protection of children at international level, and it is therefore to be hoped that these provisions will be applied without delay.
It was with this in mind that the Council took the decision, on 19 December 2002, to invite Member States to sign this Convention in the interests of the Community.
In respect of the ratification of this Convention, the Council should like to point out to the Member that there is general consensus on the expediency of ratifying it, and that another issue remains, which concerns Gibraltar.
The Council expects that every effort will be made by the two Member States in a position to find a solution on this issue, in order that the Convention may be ratified by Member States in the interests of the Community, if possible before the end of 2005.
Â Â  I am grateful to the President, but I believe this was meant to be ratified in March.
Letters from the Hague Conference have gone unanswered, and this sends a very poor message to parents and others who would wish to take advantage of this convention, both in the Community and in third countries.
It also sends an unfortunate message to the outside world.
I hope your assurance that it will enter into force before the end of the year proves correct.
Â Â  . In response to this question and to the suggestions that have been made, I can only repeat that the Luxembourg Presidency remains firmly resolved to reach a political agreement on the financial perspectives in June 2005.
It is, moreover, also the case for the great majority of Members of your Parliament.
No other scenario is therefore envisaged and the current Presidency has no doubt that, independently of the outcome, future Presidencies will earnestly assume the responsibilities that fall to them.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Council representative for having informed us that the Presidency is determined to reach an agreement.
I find this very heartening.
I am, however, somewhat alarmed at the latest reports that have reached us on this compromise, as its conditions would be extremely disadvantageous to the new Member States, such as Poland, and maybe most of all to the Czech Republic and Hungary.
In my opinion, it is absolutely crucial that a compromise be reached during the Luxembourg Presidency, or in other words in the first six months of this year.
I hope for the presidencyâs sake, and indeed for all our sakes, that such a compromise is achieved, but in my opinion it is essential for it to gain public favour in our countries.
Â Â  . The Luxembourg Presidency is relying on the firm and resolute support of your Parliament in order to reach an agreement.
I hope, moreover, that with the goodwill of all governments, we will be able to achieve it.
Â Â  . The European grouping of cross-border cooperation is the subject of a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council submitted by the Commission on 14 July 2004.
This proposal for a regulation is in the process of being examined by one of the Councilâs working groups, which primarily focuses on structural measures.
Following discussions held within this group from last summer onwards, on 19 April the Presidency presented a compromise text made accessible to the public that acts as a foundation for the work carried out by the group in charge of structural measures.
It is therefore impossible to say at this stage what the Councilâs position will be when the debate is closed.
Obviously, as it is a regulation adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure, Parliament is party to the procedure.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council.
I am of course familiar with this proposal for a regulation, but there are a number of questions I should like to put to the Council in order to learn its opinion.
Article 159(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for specific actions to be adopted outside the funds in order to implement the economic and social cohesion objectives set out in the Treaty.
I should therefore like to ask what kind of actions these are, outside what funds they are adopted, and whether any plans exist to set up new funds to this end?
Furthermore, references to trans-national, inter-regional and cross-border cooperation are primarily to be found in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a regulation.
In the later articles, only cross-border cooperation is highlighted.
I should like to know whether this implies that such cooperation will be restricted, or whether the opportunities for cooperation that have existed to date under INTERREG IIIA will continue to be available.
Â Â  . In actual fact, you are referring to the third subparagraph of Article 159 of the Treaty that allows for specific measures to be taken outside the funds that are the subject of the first subparagraph of this article, with a view to realising the treatyâs objective of economic and social cohesion.
It may refer to cross-border cooperation measures, or to other structural measures.
I am unable to provide you with any further information, since the task of the working group is precisely that of defining the other structural measures that may form the subject of these measures in the third subparagraph of Article 159.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses.
In a statement, the European Union has welcomed the satisfactory conduct of the referendum on a new Constitution in Burundi, but at the same time also urged Burundi to implement the remaining stages of the electoral process provided for in the peace accords as soon as possible.
What specific initiatives have the Council and the Member States already taken to support the electoral process in Burundi and to help maintain lasting stability in the country after the elections as well?
Â Â  The European Union is carefully monitoring and applying the peace process in Burundi.
In this context, it welcomes the smooth running of the referendum on adopting a new Constitution, which was held in Burundi on 28 February of this year.
Adopting the Constitution was an essential step on the road to restoring peace and stability in Burundi and in the Great Lakes regions as a whole.
Throughout the ceasefire negotiations and the three-year transition period, the Union has remained in close contact with all sides in Burundi, whether by means of the presence of MrÂ Ajello, the European Unionâs special envoy, or by means of a number of visits made by successive Presidencies of the European Union.
Our support was demonstrated by numerous declarations and steps carried out not only in Burundi itself, but also in adjacent states and in South Africa.
It was, moreover, South Africa that took the initiative on ceasefire negotiations, first under the aegis of PresidentÂ Mandela and then of Vice-PresidentÂ Zuma.
The European Union has contributed to financing the deployment of African troops in Burundi, before the African Union subsequently took over, and it is lending its support to the current United Nations mission in the country.
The European Union has pledged EURÂ 4.4Â million to organising elections and, in collaboration with the regional initiative, it is applying pressure with a view to introducing an electoral timetable before the recently extended transition period runs out on 26 August.
The European Unionâs contribution to the elections accounts for a third of the overall budget allocated to them. We are also preparing an observation mission that will be present in Burundi for the legislative elections taking place on 4 July.
The national indicative programme signed in August 2003 within the framework of the 9th EDF allocates EURÂ 172Â million to Burundi, primarily in the areas of rural development, budgetary assistance and good governance. These are all areas which, if they receive support, should contribute to maintaining long-term stability in the country after the elections have taken place.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would simply like to thank the Minister for his extremely clear response.
Â Â  . The issue of the Membersâ Statute that is referred to in the Memberâs question, and in particular the principles to be applied to the reimbursement of expenses of Members of the European Parliament is currently the subject of negotiations and discussions taking place between the European Parliament and the Council.
I am unable to say any more at present since these discussions are still ongoing, and it would therefore be premature to make more detailed comment on the matter today.
Â Â  Mr President, I am asking very specific questions, so please answer them.
What is the objection to making the position paper public?
It is positions that I am asking about, after all, and you refer back to the introduction to my question.
I have to say to the Council that this makes Question Time meaningless.
What is wrong with the position paper of 26 April 2005?
Why can we not see it?
It is of quite fundamental relevance to us.
I would read out my questions to you were it not for the fact that my 30 seconds are up.
Please give us an answer!
Â Â  We have been told that Coreper discussed this issue today and it will be dealt with in the Legal Services of the Council and Parliament and then adopted at the 23 May Council meeting.
Can you assure us that when that final decision of the Council is taken, we will have access to full documentation before Parliament has to make its final decision?
Can you promise that we will get all the information on this, and can you confirm that timetable?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to say that I agree with MrÂ Martin that there are many privileges that we MEPs could do without.
Where the travel allowance is concerned, I should like in any case to have a view from the Council.
I can state that we Social Democrats pay back everything apart from the actual travel costs.
In my case, that amounted to EURÂ 6Â 300 over just six months.
We could use that money to do much more in the EU.
Â Â  . Firstly, I must correct MrsÂ Kauppi, as there has been no meeting of Coreper today; Coreper has therefore not been able to discuss any proposal in respect of the Statute.
I can simply confirm that a discussion is taking place on a number of aspects of the Statute, primarily focusing, moreover, on the fundamentals of the proposals made by Parliament to the Council nearly two years ago.
I would point out, incidentally, that it is the responsibility of the European Parliament to lay down the Statute, after indeed receiving the approval of the Council.
I would add that the Council has a particular interest in seeing this Statute adopted, which is at least as significant as that of your Parliament.
As soon as an agreement is reached, I believe that the Statute will be able to enter into force, if Parliament so desires.
As regards all of these matters, they are decisions that must be taken, pursuant to the regulation, by Parliament itself. I can also assure you, MrÂ Martin, that the Council places much emphasis on transparency in respect of expenses.
You are not alone; the Council is as insistent on this point as you.
Â Â  . The issue raised in this question is the subject of the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission on 24 October 2004, which provides for specific measures in the field of agriculture for the most remote regions of the Union.
This proposal for a regulation has been discussed in a general manner by one of the working groups of the Council.
The Luxembourg Presidency is going to convene a new meeting of this group without delay, in order to speed up efforts â with a view to reaching an agreement at Council level - as soon as the Council receives the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation in question.
As regards the way in which the European Commission exercises its right of initiative laid down in the Treaties, it is not for the Council to express an opinion.
Â Â  â Mr President, firstly, I should like to offer you my congratulations and my best wishes, on this, the first time I have taken the floor since you took up your post.
I should also like, if I may, to thank the Presidency of the Council for its attention in addressing an issue that is no less important for the fact that it concerns an outlying minority of the EU.
I should like to ask you, Mr President, if the Luxembourg Presidency intends to continue, from now until the final decision, to devote the same amount of care and attention that it has thus far devoted to this issue, and, thus, if this level of commitment is to be kept up.
Â Â  . I should like to thank you for wishing us success.
I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency attaches particular importance to the problems of the most remote regions and, as it happens, to farming problems in the most remote regions.
We hope to be able to bring this matter to a successful conclusion, in line with your wishes.
Â Â  Question No 21 has been withdrawn.
As the authors are not present, Question Nos 22 and 23 lapse.
According to the Council, 'Assisting the Palestinian Authority on the crucial path to assuming responsibility for law and order and improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity is and will remain a priority for the EU'.
In this context the EU has recently set up the EU Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support in Ramallah.
Will the President-in-Office indicate what will be the exact remit of this 'Office', and indicate what financial means will be made available to allow it to carry out its functions in a meaningful way?
Â Â  . The European Union Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support is backing the European Union Special Representative to the Middle East Peace Process.
His remit is to coordinate assistance provided by Member States of the European Union and, if necessary, that given by international donors to the Palestinian Civil Police.
He is working in collaboration with the Palestinian Authority.
In so doing, he provides practical advice both to the Palestinian Civil Police and to those in charge of police matters within the Palestinian Authority.
At the strategic level, he is responsible for maintaining links with other stakeholders and oversees the reform of the police.
The unit comprises four senior EU police advisers and a local Head of Office.
The appointment of two additional advisers is ongoing.
On the basis of a memorandum of understanding between the European Union Special Representative, Marc Otte, and the Department of International Development of the United Kingdom Government, the development and running costs for the first year have been financed by the United Kingdom in the sum of EURÂ 390Â 000.
An additional sum of EURÂ 220Â 000 has been granted by the United Kingdom for an aid scheme in support of small investments, which is managed by the European Union Coordinating Office.
The duties of the European Union Coordinating Office include identifying, proposing and assisting in managing a number of specific bilateral assistance projects, some of which have already been launched.
These projects aim, in particular, to refurbish the police training centre in Jericho, to guarantee training and provide equipment for maintaining law and order, and to carry out an audit of the communication infrastructure and communications equipment.
These projects, which are financed and implemented by Member States of the European Union and other donors, form a major part of the significant sum of financial, material and technical assistance granted to the Palestinian Civil Police.
The appropriate and essential mechanism for their implementation, in addition to the strategic framework, is overseen by the European Union Coordinating Office.
The salaries and accommodation expenses of the senior police advisers are the responsibility of the Member States that second them and must be considered contributions of a supplementary nature.
Administrative support is also provided by the Police Unit located in Brussels.
The format initially adopted for the setting up of the European Union Coordinating Office offers the advantage of being light and flexible from an administrative perspective, which allows the European Union to react quickly and effectively, and in an appropriate context, to the needs of the Palestinian Civil police; needs which are identified in accordance with the policy guidelines provided by the Council and pointed out in the question.
Â Â  I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply.
This work is very encouraging.
Could he indicate whether this will continue, with additional collective responsibility, into the future?
This type of cooperation is vital at present.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question has to do with the Coordination Office in Ramallah, where one of the main problems is unemployment.
Do you think it possible that this Coordination Office might also coordinate economic activities involving Europe and the Palestinian state?
Â Â  . Firstly, in respect of the security issues, I can simply state that, given the progress that now appears to be taking shape, and in view of the elections that have been held in the Palestinian Territories, the European Union will have to make a more sturdy commitment to assisting in the implementation of all the security provisions which will enable the peace process to continue, and thus achieve the objective of creating a Palestinian State.
With regard to economic cooperation, a study must be carried out of the extent to which the European Union, through the significant economic assistance it grants to the Palestinian Territories, contributes to bolstering the Office in question.
You are by now aware that MrÂ Wolfensohn will represent the World Bank in the Palestinian Territories in terms of coordinating economic assistance measures: we spoke about the matter this morning.
We will have to work in close collaboration with MrÂ Wolfensohnâs Office, and we will have to examine whether the European Office offers the appropriate framework to enable this cooperation to actually materialise and to be as effective as possible.
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Question Nos 25 to 28 will be answered in writing(3).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  On a point of order, I apologise to the President-in-Office and to you, Mr President, that I was not here for my question.
I was at another meeting at the Winston Churchill Building and by the time I got back here, the question had lapsed.
Â Â  That is noted, Mr Crowley.
In any event, I reiterate what I said earlier: I deem Question Time to have finished.
Â Â  The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft general budget â 2006 financial year.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission would like to present the preliminary draft budget which we adopted on 27 April.
This is the last budget for this current financial perspective.
In our draft, we concentrate on the main political goals agreed by the Commission and Parliament, relating to four main policy areas: the relaunched Lisbon Agenda, security and solidarity, enlargement, and external relations.
I will discuss these four policy areas.
The core priority of this budget is the relaunched Lisbon Agenda, which aims to strengthen economic growth and create jobs.
The European budget contributes to this objective with three sets of policies: internal policies, agricultural development and structural policies.
Concerning internal policies, an increase of 2% is envisaged.
Contributing directly to the Lisbon goals, research and development will record an increase of 4.7%.
The common agricultural policy also shows a clear overlap with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
The year 2006 will be the first year when the funds from direct income will be transferred into rural development spending, which will be boosted to 13.6 %.
The European structural funds together will see an increase of 5% and reach EUR 44.6 billion.
Their core tasks are to enhance the growth potential of lagging regions and to increase employment opportunities.
Added up, all these actions contribute to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and account for at least one third of the budget.
To come back to the other main objectives of the budget, solidarity and security, the Commission proposal foresees measures to improve social and environmental security, ensure fundamental rights and promote active citizenship, especially for young people.
The fight against terrorism, improving food and transport safety, and security of energy supply are also among the priority measures, for which the preliminary draft budget proposes an increase of 5%.
To conclude on internal policies, I would like to stress that the Commissionâs proposal leaves enough margin for the budget authorities, and in particular Parliament, to increase the budget for those programmes which it considers necessary.
But these increases will have to be discussed with the Council.
The Commission is, of course, ready to help and support this initiative.
The next priority is to make enlargement a success.
The further phasing-in of the new Member States is reflected in all the internal headings, with particularly sharp increases in structural â up to 30% â and rural development policies â up to 9%.
On the administrative side, this phasing-in is also reflected in the request for 700 new posts.
For candidate countries, the Commission proposes to budget only the amounts that have already been endorsed for the respective pre-accession strategies.
To support these pre-accession strategies, the Commission is also requesting 100 new external personnel positions.
In the external relations field, accommodating the new 2006 priorities while at the same time ensuring the continuity of ongoing cooperation programmes is not possible within the predetermined ceiling.
That is why the Commission proposes recourse to the flexibility instrument for the major part of the reconstruction aid for Asia.
We would like to emphasise that, for the fifth time in seven years, the ceiling fixed in Berlin will not be sufficient.
I now turn to the global figures of the 2006 budget.
The Commissionâs proposal refers to amounts of EUR 112.6Â billion in payments and EUR 121.3 billion in commitments.
The respective increases are 6% and 4%.
That represents 1.02% of the European Unionâs GNI in payments and 1.09% of the European Unionâs GNI in commitments.
Bearing in mind the ongoing negotiations on the future financial perspective, I would like to point out that the Commission is asking for what is necessary and sufficient at this stage to finance the Unionâs policies in 2006.
It should be kept in mind that today we are talking about the annual budget.
This preliminary draft budget for 2006, which already represents 1.02 % of the EUâs GNI in payments, does not take account of the needs of future enlargement to Bulgaria and Romania, or of the complete integration of new Member States, in particular in relation to the agriculture and cohesion policies that have already been decided upon, nor, of course, does it take account of increased investment in growth and jobs, as required under the relaunched Lisbon Agenda.
I am sure that this is going to be an important year for all of us and I can assure you that the Commission will strive to help the budget authorities to reach a good agreement on the 2006 budget for the Union and its citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my hope is that the comparison that will follow from this eveningâs presentation may bring about a favourable outcome.
I hope that this year will be a positive one; however, in truth, the initial signs are only partially encouraging.
It is with pleasure that I acknowledge the work of MrsÂ GrybauskaitÃ©, in whose draft budget can be found positive solutions to certain issues that Parliament holds dear, and which appear in its guidelines.
I am referring to the modulation of agricultural expenditure in support of rural development, to the increase in heading 2 on regional policy, to the rise in spending on young people and on culture, and to the increase in spending on agencies.
I cannot say the same for heading 4 on external actions and assistance to SMEs.
MrsÂ GrybauskaitÃ© informed us that direct assistance in the Lisbon Strategy accounts for more than a third of the draft budget.
We will check it heading by heading, but on first examination it appears to me that the amounts are insufficient.
Even if that assessment were incorrect, however, the reference to the agreement reached on sustainable development during the Gothenburg European Council is without question unsatisfactory: there can be no competitive growth without sustainable growth.
The proposal on external actions, moreover, seems disappointing.
