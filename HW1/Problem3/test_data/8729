But the law will be applied exactly, and competition will prevail.
New technologies are definitely necessary.
The price of oil is actually stimulating development.
I recently received a very interesting proposal concerning super-grids that bring together many offshore wind farms.
When you meet representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises dealing with renewables and heating and you ask them what they would support, they claim that oil prices should stay where they are.
This gives more diversity and stimulates technological development among our researchers.
But, this again brings us back to the fact that we will only be as strong as our will.
If we are weak and do not believe in it, nobody else will help us â neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia.
We must help ourselves.
In this respect, I believe that such debates are necessary.
The strategic EU energy review will provide for a very competent debate and for the right decisions to be made.
But I still believe that the basic answer lies in our strengths as a Union: i.e. in democracy, our vision in international relations and the market.
But for the market to work, we should provide for stable and predictable investment conditions.
The market will then provide what is asked for.
Thank you very much for your debate.
I really believe we will come back for the debate and agree on the content of a European energy policy.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Council on criteria for peace-keeping operations, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can all agree that the European Union is based on values and that it is very involved in promoting those values throughout the world.
This includes concrete contributions to peace, sustainable development, respect for human rights and the development and strengthening of democracy throughout the world.
The European Union has a very broad array of instruments for taking action in these areas. These include a trade and development policy, diplomatic initiatives as part of the common foreign and security policy, and civilian and military crisis management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy.
The implementation of these diverse resources can be particularly well demonstrated in our Africa policy.
Today's debate on the European Union's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a particularly good example.
However, we must also not forget about other activities in this connection, such as the action to support the African Union's AMIS II peacekeeping forces in Darfur.
The comprehensive Africa strategy adopted by the European Council at the end of last year, the 'Common Position concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa' and the 'ESDP Action Plan supporting peace and security in Africa' provide the European Union with clear guidance: the commitment made in these documents to peace and security as an absolute necessity for the development of Africa logically leads to a commitment to help resolve the conflicts in Africa by strengthening African crisis management capabilities, including with funds from the 'Peace Facility for Africa' and by means of appropriate operations as part of the European security and defence policy.
The European Union's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects the comprehensive nature of these European ambitions: the main basis for relations between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and thus also for EU assistance to stabilise the country, is formed in the first instance by the Cotonou Agreement and the funds available from the European Development Fund in this connection.
The funds from the peace facility that I have already briefly mentioned, which are not directly connected with the Cotonou Agreement, are also worth some attention here.
Some of this money is being used to fund initiatives that make a very direct contribution to improving the security situation in Congo, for example by creating humane living spaces for soldiers and their families or by providing modern equipment.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, it has also become clear that the European security and defence policy can, with relatively meagre resources, make an important contribution to stabilising the country, by means of assistance in reforming its security sector in both the civilian and military sectors.
I would point to the civilian ESDP mission, EUPOL Kinshasa, which has recently been extended to the end of this year.
It provides training and advice to the 'Integrated Police Unit', and thus helps to ensure that policing in the capital city Kinshasa is not only efficient but also compatible with the basic concepts of a modern state under the rule of law.
The military ESDP mission, EUSEC Congo, in turn supports the Congolese military authorities in pushing forward the necessary reforms and modernisation of the armed forces.
I am sure I do not need to tell you that the work of the EU Special Representative for the African Great Lakes Region, Aldo Ajello, is extremely important for the stabilisation of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I would now like to emphasise a few points specifically about the mission in Congo.
First of all, there are four central points that characterise the Council's position regarding an operation to support the United Nations' mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC).
Firstly, the European Union is responding to a specific request from the United Nations.
On this matter we have confidence in the assessment of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan.
You are no doubt aware of the fact that the Council has, in the past, made considerable efforts to support the United Nations, and that, as part of the ESDP, the United Nations presence in the region has been strengthened.
I am sure you will agree with me that the European Union, being committed to multilateralism, is duty-bound to make an effective contribution here, as the Member States also wish.
Secondly, both the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo and both of its vice-presidents are in favour of such a supporting action.
The Supreme Defence Council has also specifically called for this mission, and this has also been included in a related press release.
This shows us that it is in the interests of the Democratic Republic of Congo to have credible additional deterrents available, in order to prevent a military option.
I would particularly like to emphasise that fact: this is a mission that should act to prevent the use of force, and we hope that the presence of this deterrent should prevent the actual deployment of military resources.
This deterrent effect is worthwhile, even if, in the estimation of the Congolese authorities, the forces provided would not need to be deployed.
But they should be available. We see no reason to question the Congolese assessment.
Thirdly, the DRC is the largest and most highly populated country in the region.
Not least for that reason, the European Union is, as you know, more closely involved in the process of transition to democracy in Congo than in any other African country.
The European Union has, in the past, already used its extensive range of tools to bring an end to the conflict and to make progress in the peace process.
We in the European Union have contributed EURÂ 700Â million to projects to support the transition, EURÂ 200Â million of which went to supporting the elections alone.
I have already mentioned the police mission.
As you are aware, we sent a military mission back in 2003 to prevent an escalation of the conflict in the East of the country, which was threatening the final negotiations in the peace process and thus the establishment of the transitional government.
In the opinion of the Member States, it is now sensible and necessary to secure this earlier investment in peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to ensure that the peaceful democratic development continues.
Fourthly, the political and military parameters of the mission must â as in the case of earlier missions, including those in the Democratic Republic of Congo â be established and laid down in cooperation between the competent Council configurations and the operational headquarters.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the United Nations have requested and called on the European Union to make a contribution to the elections in Congo by sending a military mission.
What should our answer be?
We need to bear in mind a number of things.
First, we need to ask ourselves whether, at this point in time, the European Union has the capabilities needed to carry out such an operation.
The second question is: do we not have other priorities in the immediate vicinity of the European Union, for example in the Balkans, where peace-keeping is our first and most important task?
Thirdly, is there not a risk here that we will become entangled in a conflict from which we will then not be able to extricate ourselves promptly?
These are questions that I, as an MEP, am repeatedly asked in this connection.
On the other hand, we must, as the President-in-Office said, recognise that the European Union has an interest in the stability of this country in the heart of Africa.
The fact that the European Union itself is also affected should be clear to anybody who has looked towards Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa and the terrible scenes played out at these borders with poverty.
Stability in Africa is in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens.
We must be conscious of our responsibility towards the UN.
We must be clear that the prevention of violence, which is the aim of this operation, is very much in line with the European Union's security strategy.
We should also not forget that a large number of election observers from the European Parliament and from other parliaments, under MrÂ Morillonâs leadership, are already working in Congo to secure the elections.
What are our conditions for intervention by the European Union in Congo?
First, there must be a clear time limit.
It cannot be the task of this kind of intervention to stabilise Congo as a whole â that is a long-term task, and the responsibility of the United Nations.
That is why there are 17Â 000 UN soldiers in Congo.
We must concentrate on helping to stabilise the elections on 18Â June.
Secondly, there must be a clear succession regulation, showing how the United Nations on the one hand, and the Congolese army on the other, will re-assume these activities after our intervention.
There must also be a geographical boundary, and it must be clear, for example, that Katanga and the eastern provinces of Congo must continue to be the responsibility of the United Nations and not of the European Union.
Furthermore, it must be quite clear that this operation is definitely European.
It must not be just one or two European nations getting involved, but more European nations must really be committed to the task.
We need a formal invitation from the interim government.
Here, too, there still seems to be some doubt as to what the government of Congo has actually formally said.
Above all, however, we need a convincing plan, a plan that is able to convince any troublemakers that it is better to accept the results of the election, and also to encourage the citizens of Congo to exercise their right to vote.
Those are the conditions under which the European Union and we in the European Parliament could agree to such a mission.
Now we need, and as soon as possible, to get answers to the questions that are still outstanding.
Â Â  . â The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo presents us â by which I mean those who in the EU take seriously the 'responsibility to protect' enshrined in the last high-level UN summit in September 2005 â with enormous challenges.
The conflict that has devastated the Democratic Republic of Congo and the whole of the Great Lakes region is the bloodiest since the Second World War. It has already caused 4 million deaths, the overwhelming majority civilians.
Real and lasting peace in the country is a vital prerequisite for peace in the Great Lakes and in Central Africa as a whole.
In this context, the UN, which has the largest peace-keeping mission in its history in Congo, has called on the EU to help the elections scheduled for 18Â June to pass off peacefully.
The election observation team will be led by Mr Morillon, and this is a mission supported by all of us in Parliament.
As far as we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are concerned, this election is something of a crunch moment for Congo.
Either the institutions born in a context of civil war are replaced by democratically elected institutions, or, more likely, Congo will remain at the mercy of bloody militias.
Yet these elections and the challenge laid down by the United Nations also constitute a moment of truth for the European Union.
Will European security and defence policy prove credible?
Can we count on the Member States to implement the European security strategy?
I should like to highlight three points from the joint resolution that we tabled.
This intervention should be viewed as one part of a temporary solution to the problem of the countryâs internal stability, which will only be resolved when the Congolese army becomes a stabilising factor.
It became clear during recent Congolese operations in the Katanga region that the population still has reason to doubt the ability of the authorities to protect them from the militias.
The international community must channel its efforts into strengthening the integrated military units already in place and speed up the creation of others.
Unless rapid improvements are made in the security sector, the EU and the UN may unfortunately be called on to intervene in Congo many more times in the future.
Secondly, the political legitimacy of this mission must be a decisive factor in its success.
Accordingly, it must be a genuinely European mission, and as such we welcome the news of the solid participation of various Member States led by Germany and including my country, Portugal.
It must also be fully backed by the United Nations Security Council.
All internal and external actors must be made aware that the current Congolese Government welcomes this mission.
As part of the concept of this mission, the EU must be genuinely prepared to support the election process, despite the inherent risks.
The primary objective of the presence of European forces is to make a visible and credible contribution to the stability of the Congolese election process.
This is what the people of Congo and Africa expect of us.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, what is currently taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the international community and, more specifically, of the European Union, is crucially important for the future of this vast country, which has been torn apart for years by civil and foreign wars.
The Congolese people are today united in their profound desire for peace and stability and in their aspiration for a democracy that allows a situation of that kind.
They demonstrated this by registering to vote in overwhelming numbers in July 2005 and they demonstrated this in December, during the referendum vote in favour of a draft constitution designed to put an end to the current transitional period.
As head of the observation mission for this referendum, I attended the ceremonies marking the promulgation of the Constitution on 18Â February, in Kinshasa, and I was able to assess the intense emotion of the participants and of the nation as a whole.
A hope was born that at the end of the next stage, which will see a president and a parliament elected this summer, the country will succeed in finally emerging from the chaos and poverty in which it is still submerged.
It is the interests of the Congolese people, the interests of the entire African continent and, therefore, the interests of Europe that are at stake.
There is a danger, however, that those who have benefited up to now from this chaos and this poverty will not take kindly to being deprived of their power by the ballot boxes and that they may be tempted, on the one hand, to use terror tactics to prevent a lawful election and, on the other, to use force to challenge the election results.
The security situation is being overseen by the UN forces, which are mainly deployed in the Eastern provinces in which organised gangs still operate.
In these conditions, and in order to increase the security of forthcoming elections, the UN has sought the help of the European Union, as you mentioned.
It will be up to the Council to determine what form this help will take.
I am one of those who believe that this commitment will have the value of being a very powerful political signal to any potential troublemakers and that it will have what we anticipate to be a deterrent effect, and that is why I will be among those giving their support to this operation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the debate over the last few weeks has laid bare the whole dilemma of the lack of political direction here.
It would be wrong for us simply to try and gloss over that.
Since UN Under-Secretary-General GuÃ©hennoâs letter of 27Â December about military engagement in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which fell during the turn of the year holiday period and came as a surprise even to the Security Council, 12 weeks have passed and there are still more questions than answers.
There is still a yawning gap between words and deeds.
We remain to be convinced.
We do not support the joint resolution, and let me explain why.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are of course in favour of supporting the process of democratisation in Congo.
But how has it happened that the issue of EU involvement has been reduced to military deployment in Kinshasa and counting soldiers?
How is it that we find ourselves discussing sending soldiers but not the issue of a large number of EU electoral observers?
How is it that the whole range of actions under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy is not being investigated?
How is it that every single day new justifications emerge, such as Europeâs interest in refugee refusal?
I ask you, what has all that got to do with facilitating democratic elections in Congo?
These verbose discussions in recent weeks have raised the question of whether the planned deployment in Kinshasa is actually about democratisation or whether it is really about the EU saving face.
I say saving face because the dynamic set in train by the inquiry has taken on a life of its own.
Months have passed since the inquiry and the inconclusive fact-finding mission to Congo and since New York, yet there is still no sign of a political plan or a clear task.
Ladies and gentlemen, a fine gesture by Mr Chirac cannot conceal the issues that have still not been addressed, that is to say how is dispatching 1Â 500 soldiers to Kinshasa going to guarantee free elections throughout Congo?
How can we refute the accusation that we are taking Kabila's side?
How can the EU play a role in Congo as a whole in the wake of a deployment of this kind?
And if the issue is evacuation, and that has become the vital topic, who is actually to be evacuated?
Do we need UN-mandated troops to be deployed in order to further the cause of democracy in the Congo?
My final point, ladies and gentlemen, is a very fundamental one.
We talk so passionately here about Europeâs responsibility towards Africa, yet how can we reconcile todayâs debate with our failure to act on the continuing genocide in Darfur?
Â Â  MrÂ President, contrary to all reason, the European Union is planning a military deployment in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Officially, it is a question of protecting the integrity of the elections, but something seems to have gone rather wrong in the run-up to the elections.
Only 60 candidates have been nominated for 500 parliamentary seats, and the close of nominations is tomorrow evening, Thursday evening that is.
The EU is planning to send 1Â 500 soldiers to Africaâs third largest nation, a country with an authoritarian regime.
As one SPD politician from Germany has commented, it is as if 750 soldiers were to land in Europe and claim that would stabilise the whole of Europe.
In military terms this deployment makes no sense at all.
So what is the point of sending these troops?
The German defence minister Franz Joseph Jung has not minced his words.
He has said that it is all about refugee refusal and that stability in regions rich in raw materials is also good for Germanyâs economy.
CDU MPs in Germany have confirmed this motivation, referring to strategic raw materials such as tungsten and manganese.
And the German Government has now decided not to take a decision about military deployment until the beginning of May.
The military is making it increasingly clear that it is not in favour of this deployment.
The position is relatively clear: once you go into Congo, it is not so easy to withdraw again â this will not just be limited to four months.
The motion for a resolution is not limited geographically and the time limit is only expressed in the vaguest terms.
That is why we are asking all Members who are sceptical about this to vote against this motion for a resolution.
I will make no bones about this: what is really at stake here is access to raw materials and refugee refusal by military means.
As a group of the left we wish to say a very clear ânoâ to that and we will not be voting for this motion for resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, apart from the technical debate on this deployment, there are also other aspects that should be discussed here too.
In part, small-minded prejudices are involved here.
In my country, Germany, instead of openly talking about a dark continent where people are permanently involved in internecine conflicts out of pure necessity, some CSU politicians, for example, suggest that Germanyâs army would be better used guarding World Cup stadiums in the immediate future instead of being sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I think that we should make it crystal clear that this is an incredibly narrow view of the world.
I admit, MrsÂ Beer, that there are a great many issues that remain to be resolved, very serious problems that have not yet been solved.
I am also very confident that they will be solved, including by our colleagues in Germanyâs Bundestag.
What should interest us at European level, however, is something that has not been mentioned so far.
I consider that in recent weeks serious deficits in the European decision-making process have come to light, deficits that remain to be removed.
It is not acceptable for some people to say that they demand deployment plans before troops are made available while others say that deployment plans will only be drawn up once we are certain that we will not have to set off alone.
That is not on, and would lead to a kind of self-imposed blockade.
Without demanding unrealistic treaty amendments, we need to achieve an outcome whereby a review of decision-making processes is conducted without delay at Council level, so that in situations in which decisions have to be taken more quickly than is the case at present, it is actually possible to take those decisions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is excellent that the European Union is fully involved in supporting the election process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we even hope that it will be more vigilant with regard to the human rights violations that have been worsening, I am afraid to say, for some time.
However, the way in which the EU military operation is taking shape in the Democratic Republic of Congo today is truly strange and odd to say the least.
Figures of a few hundred men have been mentioned, whereas MONUC already has 16Â 000 men.
You say that these men would not be directly involved, but merely on hand if they were needed: where might that be, then?
What would the mission of this military force be, and what mandate would these men have in the event of violence breaking out during or after the elections, especially in Kinshasa?
Can lessons not be learnt from the past, when the UN forces found themselves in impossible situations and were subsequently accused from all sides because they had neither a clear mandate nor sufficient resources?
There are therefore two possibilities: either the European Union thoroughly fulfils the United Nationsâ request by laying down conditions and by investing substantial resources to support MONUC, or it dedicates these resources to the success of the electoral process, to the full involvement of civil society, to respect for human rights and, furthermore, to the control and transparency of the way in which the Democratic Republic of Congoâs so very precious and coveted natural resources are exploited.
It is clear that, for our part, we much prefer this second prospect to one of supporting a military operation that, for the time being, is very limited, has unclear objectives and about which we have little knowledge at present.
Â Â  Mr President, it is right in our resolution to wind up this debate that we put emphasis on an integrated strategy for the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a clear time-limit for troop deployment, together with an exit strategy, as well as stressing the need for protection for the forces themselves.
However, I want to challenge the assumption in recital A that security in the European neighbourhood, particularly the Balkans, should come first.
Of course the neighbourhood is crucial, but with Balkan countries moving towards accession and stabilisation, we should be talking about fewer EU troops, not maintaining them at current levels.
Time after time this Parliament passes resolutions for a common foreign and security policy with Europe a leader in global affairs.
We say that terrorism in our streets is generated from fragile states worldwide, why should we then seek to limit our ambitions to the European neighbourhood?
We pass resolutions to combat world poverty, yet are we ready to apply them in the ninth poorest country in the world, with one of the highest rates of infant mortality?
As the International Crisis Group says, âeverything from elections, to humanitarian assistance, to economic activity depends on establishing a secure environmentâ.
A decade of war in the DRC has cost four million lives, and still a thousand people a day die from war-related causes.
We receive daily reports of massacres, civilian killings, widespread rape and sexual violence.
These elections are a moment of hope.
Europe is providing our biggest ever aid to support the election process.
The request for them to be accompanied by security forces comes from all factions in the transitional national government.
It is a request to which we should agree.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very much in favour of a developing common foreign and security policy in the European Union.
Now that the European Union is larger than the United States, richer than the United States and gives more assistance to the Third World than the United States, it is only right and proper that we have a common foreign and security policy dimension to that.
In that sense, of course, no one is questioning the value of the request from the United Nations for a mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The problem is that the mission is being discussed behind closed doors and we need some democratic scrutiny.
As we are increasingly sending missions to Aceh â which I very much welcome as the former chief observer to the Indonesian elections â and to the Democratic Republic of Congo, we need that democratic control.
The problem is that unless we have some democratic scrutiny, in a post-election system where we may see deterioration of the situation in the DRC, there is a danger of mission creep and being sucked into a quagmire.
We are sending an election observation mission, but we are sending this mission as well.
Can we be reassured that there is some close coordination between the two?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot answer all your questions, since, as I have already explained, the precise political, military policy and military parameters that will underpin the Councilâs final decision are being worked out as we speak, and I am very grateful to MrÂ Kuhne for mentioning in this context that it is necessary for the appropriate basis for decision making to be worked out at this stage.
MrÂ von Wogau asked what the government had actually said.
In my first statement I said that very clear comments had been made by the President and the two Vice-Presidents, and I might perhaps quote just one paragraph from the press release issued following Mondayâs Defence Council:
âDuring its meeting held on MondayÂ 20Â March, chaired by the Head of State, his Excellency MrÂ Joseph Kabilaâ.
The Head of State is the chair of this body.
âThe Supreme Defence Council examined, among other points, the question of a European military contingent being formed at the request of the United Nationsâ.
The Council then came to this conclusion:
âAnxious to strengthen the security arrangements for the electoral process, the Supreme Council recommended, in the light of a report presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the initiative to deploy these European Special Forces be supportedâ.
So that is a clear statement, and there are no grounds for questioning it.
Also, the comments made regarding doubts about the advisability of the mission were also once again mentioned in this press release.
âIt should be emphasised that this contingent will mainly act as a deterrentâ.
I am very grateful to MrÂ Morillon for specifically mentioning that too.
I can only repeat what I have already said. I believe that it is the responsibility of the European Union to make a meaningful contribution to the democratic process in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
We need to be clear that, of the broad range of options open to us, the deployment of military troops needs to be considered alongside other types of intervention for assisting democratic development, such as development cooperation and assistance in establishing the rule of law and democratic processes and in protecting human rights.
This is a responsibility borne by the European Union and one that the Council is fulfilling.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, I have received three motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Council by Margrietus van den Berg, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and setting of the amount for the 10th EDF (O-0004/2006 B6-0006/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for being here for this very important debate in relation to the European Development Fund.
As the Council is aware, because of the ongoing debate on the budgetisation of the EDF, no provisions relating to the financial framework were included in the revised Cotonou agreement.
However, in Annex 1 it states very clearly that âthe European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDFâ.
Therefore, in my view, President-in-Office, the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF.
The Commissionâs assessment was that for the tenth EDF, EURÂ 24.948Â billion was the appropriate sum.
In December, however, the Council in Brussels agreed on EURÂ 22.682 billion on current prices for the 2008-2013 period.
President-in-Office, I give this history because I think it is relevant to the position adopted by Parliamentâs Committee on Development, which is that the Development Committee requires reassurance and clarification before we agree to give our assent to the amended Cotonou agreement.
Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance, as we have done on the DCCI, we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles.
Our principles centre around development, and if they are not addressed, then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating.
One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EURÂ 0.3 billion for the EUâs 21 overseas countries and territories and that a further EURÂ 0.9 billion should be deducted to cover administrative costs.
Yesterday in committee, the Director-General of DG Development made it very clear that the position that you may have on the OCTs was not shared by the Commission.
Will the Council therefore clarify what its position on the OCTs is?
As a British Member of this Parliament, I am very well aware of the position of the UK, the last Council Presidency.
However, President-in-Office, I would like to know what your position is.
Also, on administrative costs, how can it be sensible for the Commission to pay itself for the administration of its own resources?
This cannot make sense and I am sure is not something that you are familiar with in your own administration.
Would the Member States â the Council â be prepared to consider giving additional money to cover the costs of the OCTs?
These are not unimportant caveats.
I am not introducing them in a casual way, because I really want to know exactly from you how it can be the case that you make these decisions which say that you do not want to give us the assurances that the money that you are giving to the ACP for the ACPâs use are funds for those countries to use in a clear and transparent way.
I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF.
In real terms I would argue that it is nothing more than a stagnation.
The Development Committee cannot and will not be duped by what we see as double-speak on this issue.
The ninth EDF included funds left over from the previous EDF: âunspent moneyâ.
Once this money is added to the ninth EDF, the figures touted by the Council are comparable only in nominal terms.
When things are finalised, the tenth EDF will have to be ratified and that presents us with enormous concerns when you consider that 25 Member States will have to be part of this ratification process.
The results of an under-spend in the past have been that we have gone in for all these facilities â water facilities, peace facilities â which have had very limited democratic control.
Surely this is a matter of concern for you, President-in-Office?
Our next debate will be on economic partnership agreements and one of the most contentious issues for us, and which we will raise, will be the financing of aid for trade in the economic partnership agreements.
Will you clarify, President-in-Office, whether you will be offering additional funds for the EPA negotiations, or whether you expect such funding to come from the ACPâs tenth EDF?
Finally, if the African Union is to be included, how will allowances be made for the fact that many members of the African Union are not ACP countries?
Do you expect those countries to benefit from EDF money if the Council decides that you will support the African Union from the tenth EDF?
We are talking about a binding agreement with the ACP, and I trust that the Council will reflect that in the decisions it takes on the tenth EDF.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrsÂ Kinnock, I shall try to answer your questions as fully as possible.
I fear that I shall not be able to answer all of them, partly because negotiations have not yet been concluded in all areas, and because the Council has not yet adopted a position on all these issues.
Nevertheless, I hope I can give you some clarification.
I would first like to refer to the agreement of the European Council of December 2005 on the budgetisation of the 10th European Development Fund and on the contribution key for the Member States, a process that was both difficult and drawn-out.
You are of course familiar with the agreement reached, which provides for the future development financing of the ACP states not within the general budget, but within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund.
You know the figures â the European Council agreed on an amount of EUR 22.6 billion.
That is the commitment that the European Union made to the ACP countries when the Cotonou Agreement was revised in February 2005.
In this context it is important to mention that as part of that process the ACP countries were given an undertaking that the aid effort would be maintained at the level of the ninth EDF, minus residual appropriations from previous development funds but adjusted for inflation and EU growth and taking account of the impact of enlargement to the ten new Member States.
The reason for this is clear: we did not want to reward the inefficiency implied in the non-implementation of appropriations.
This was a clear undertaking given to the ACP countries by the European Union.
The Commissionâs original proposal â and I hope this will answer your question â was for EUR 24.9Â billion, and was based in the ninth EDF including residual appropriations from earlier funds.
This was therefore right and was in accordance with the commitment made to the ACP countries to correct this Commission proposal.
In reality â and I believe that we should also acknowledge this fact â the commitment promised by the EU, that is to say the amount I have already mentioned, represents a considerable real increase in funding compared with the ninth EDF, which as we know has a budget of EUR 13.8Â billion.
The average annual contribution is increased for all 15 old Member States on the basis of the new contribution key.
The 10 new Member States will be taking part in and contributing to an EDF for the first time.
This is entirely in accordance with the Council agreement of May 2005 significantly to increase public development aid by the year 2015.
You also asked about the contributions from Bulgaria and Romania.
Bulgaria and Romaniaâs planned accession in 2007 has already been anticipated in the calculation of the total volume of the 10th EDF and the individual contributions of the Member States on which the decision is based.
As we know, the new 10th EDF can only start to run as from the beginning of 2008.
That means that there will not be any additional funding for the 10th EDF when those countries actually accede to the EU.
This is totally in line with procedure followed for earlier rounds of enlargement.
The Council has also made available EUR 18Â million for the new Cotonou member Timor-Leste from the ninth EDF, in order to cover EU development aid once Timor-Leste becomes an ACP State, and following the ratification of the Cotonou Agreement for 2007.
It is a logical consequence of this that Timor-Leste will receive no further support under the budget line for Asia, and as from 2008 will receive aid under the 10th EDF.
The Council is not at present in a position to give any information on the distribution of funds under the 10th EDF, as this will be discussed during the negotiations shortly about to start on the legal bases, that is to say on the finance protocol to the Cotonou Agreement and the internal financial agreements for the 10th EDF.
The Austrian Presidencyâs objective is to reach agreement with the ACP countries on the finance protocol at the ACP-EU Council of Ministers on 1Â and 2Â June 2006, in which I shall be taking part.
There is one more point that I need to comment on, since you raised it, MrsÂ Kinnock, and that is how the overseas countries and territories and administration costs are to be dealt with.
These are issues that are still subject to agreement and negotiation.
The Commission proposal on the distribution of funds between the ACP partner countries is currently being discussed between the Commission and the Member States.
Support for ACP countries in implementing the regional economic partnership agreements â I think you also asked about that â is expected to come from the funds earmarked for regional cooperation in the 10th EDF.
The Council has also provided for support for the African Union to be continued under the 10th EDF.
Time is of the essence.
Back in January, during the Commissionâs discussions with the Austrian Government, the Commissioner responsible, Louis Michel, pressed for swift action to ensure that the current programme under the ninth EDF flows seamlessly into the 10th EDF at the start of 2008.
As MrÂ Michel explained to us in very dramatic terms, this time there is only half as much time available as the last time, so we need to act very quickly.
In order to make sure that happens, in parallel with the negotiations on the 10th EDF that I have already described, the country programming process has also already started.
Following the adoption of the European Development Consensus and building on the Paris Declaration efforts are being made to achieve joint country development programmes, which are to include not only the European Commissionâs country programmes but also those of the Member States.
We welcome this development and will continue to support it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office, I believe that what is at stake here is not so much the distribution of funds, legal issues, programmes and so on, but, unfortunately, the fact that funding has been cut.
All of us in this House are watching with concern how the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and the negotiations on the tenth European Development Fund are progressing.
The Council has made a firm commitment to make more money available for development aid.
This was announced amidst much backslapping at the summits held in July and December 2005.
The Commission calculated that the tenth EDF covering the period 2008-2013 would have a budget of just under EUR 25Â billion.
I very much regret that contrary to these undertakings the Council has now only been able to agree on an amount of less than EUR 23Â billion.
Apart from less money being made available, this would mean that with increasing public development aid and a fixed EDF budget, EU development aid would effectively be renationalised.
This would represent a backward step in all our efforts to improve coordination of EU development aid.
That surely cannot be in our interest.
I do, however, welcome the fact that here in this House we have come up with a cross-party motion for a resolution aimed at resolving this deplorable situation.
I call on the Council to stand by its promises and to make available the urgently needed appropriations for EU development aid.
A difference of EUR 2Â billion is not chicken-feed.
We are talking about eliminating poverty, about sustainable development and about gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.
Mr President-in-Office, EUR 2Â billion less would be a false economy.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, with regard to the cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries, several sums have been put on the table: firstly by the Commission, then, in December 2005, by the Council and, in the space of a few weeks, nearly EURÂ 2.5Â billion have disappeared.
I want to believe that we are concerned here only with a gross miscalculation.
Fortunately, the Commission has recently made some new proposals, on 17Â March, which are marked by two significant advances: firstly, an additional package of almost EURÂ 1Â billion for the tenth EDF, which is designed to take care of the administrative costs and, secondly, an additional package of almost EURÂ 300Â million for the OCTs, which would thus be re-integrated into the EDF as, I might add, they are requesting.
I believe that these Commission proposals are along the right lines and represent a first step on the road indicated by Parliament.
The fact remains that these proposals are in the hands of the Council from now on and that it is its responsibility to try and come up with something better.
It is in fact the word of the European Union and its commitment in the fight against poverty that are at stake.
The word of the Union means the one that is included in Annex 1 to the revised Cotonou Agreement.
Admittedly, the wording was deliberately ambiguous since it was a matter of gaining the agreement of our ACP partners on some political points that were disputed and, I might add, disputable.
It was not ambiguous, however, to the point of explaining the fanciful calculations of the Council.
Let us not make our African partners believe that Europeâs new motto is: âpromises only bind those who believe in themâ.
Promises were in fact made in 2005.
Thus, at the European Council in June, the Union and the Member States committed themselves to increasing their official development aid on a regular basis until 2015.
At the G8 Summit in July, the European Union also committed itself, together with the other donors, to doubling official aid for Africa by 2010.
Will we be able to keep those promises given the shrinking budget proposed by the Council for the tenth EDF?
The answer is ânoâ, and the Council cannot claim otherwise.
As for the management and payment procedures for this tenth EDF, I also have cause for concern, but explanations are needed as much from the Council as from the Commission.
It is a question, firstly, of the funding of the âdevelopmentâ dimension in the economic partnership agreements currently under negotiation and, secondly, of the new performance criteria set by the Commission in the working document of 13Â January for the allocation of EDF funds, criteria that would be added to the traditional âneedsâ criterion.
I should like to conclude by saying a few words about the budgetisation of the EDF.
This Parliament has expressed its support for the budgetisation on several occasions, since it is a question of the democratic control of the budget allocation.
I believe that we could include the EDF in the budget while respecting our ACP partners because we need to get away from the intergovernmental practices that give rise to bargaining, with the kind of outcome for the EDF that we saw at the Council in December.
Admittedly, this is not the issue that we are concerned with today â everything in its own time â but it should not, for all that, be forgotten about.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it has not escaped MrÂ Winkler that this resolution is not only a joint resolution, but also a unanimous one.
All the parties, irrespective of our political divisions, remind you of your duties.
This is a question of honour for our European Union and a question of respect. It is not a question of making a promise, but rather of making commitments, and it is a question of credibility with regard to our external action.
It is as a result not only of the volume, but also of the effectiveness, of aid that credibility is gained.
With your permission, I will make two remarks on this subject.
As regards volume, one might think that we are holding a virtual debate here because, between EURÂ 22Â billion and EURÂ 24Â billion, and allowing for the remaining balances and the under-spend, there is little point, when all is said and done, in fighting for EURÂ 2Â billion that might not be spent.
It is here that you have a responsibility: one of ensuring that this money is actually spent and, furthermore, one of allocating the largest share possible to large-scale regional projects, in particular.
In saying that, I mean âregionâ in the sense of NEPAD.
The subject of my second remark deeply perplexes me.
In actual fact, if we honour our commitments and go from 0.31% to 0.56% of GDP in 2010, that will mean that we will have an extra EURÂ 50 billion available to spend on official development aid, EURÂ 25Â billion of which â or one annual EDF â will go to Africa alone, in accordance with the commitment we have just made.
I am totally perplexed when I come to realise that, where 80% of the funding is concerned, this promise of money will have to be kept by the Member States and not by the Union.
When I can already see how the Member States react to having to fund the EDF at a sum of EURÂ 24Â billion over five years, I doubt that they can demonstrate to us their ability to provide funding of EURÂ 25Â billion on an annual, or near annual, basis.
We are therefore in the realms of virtual reality here.
I believe that we are in danger of two things happening: that we will make fools of ourselves by announcing very high figures for very little in terms of achievement and, above all, that there will be a boomerang effect on our tax-paying constituents, who are going to wonder how on earth we can put the sums announced to good use.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the world faces huge challenges: poverty, climate change, serious diseases and armed conflicts.
If the Council wishes to demonstrate global responsibility, it must not be stingier and more tight-fisted than the Commission is and make cut-backs of more than EURÂ 2Â billion.
We must substantially increase the EUâs overall aid to the world's poorest people so that we can honour our pledges.
It is important to remember that the Member States promised to achieve the UN target of increasing aid to 0.7% of EU GDP by 2015 and that it has a medium-term target of increasing it to 0.56% by 2010.
Development aid is all well and good, but other things, such as fair trade, are still more important.
If, at the same time, the EU maintains its exorbitant agricultural subsidies, continues to protect its own markets and, to top it all, cuts back on development aid, the result will be a deadly cocktail that hits the poorest first and then all of us.
It is, then, for the sake of our common future that we must honour the pledges we have given.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 was the year of rhetoric about development and the fight against poverty.
Under the UK Presidency, in various institutional and multilateral forums â the European Council, the G8 Summit, the Millennium Summit, 5Â September 2005 â the European Union undertook to increase financial support to achieve the millennium development goals, including through an increase in development aid.
Not to carry out these undertakings would mean taking a backwards step with regard to all the international undertakings made in recent years for combating poverty â a confirmation that it was all just empty rhetoric.
It was a mistake to reduce the 10th EDF, even though the full amount provided under the ninth was not spent.
Instead, we ought to have made financial provision for the major structural reforms required of the ACP countries within the framework of the EPA negotiations.
How can anyone believe that these countries â and let us remember that we are talking about countries where most of the poorest peoples in the world live â can succeed in making national and regional macroeconomic reforms without European financial aid?
How will they mitigate the social impacts and further reforms that will add to the restrictions already imposed by the reforms required by the international financial institutions?
Why should further reductions in tariffs be made, leading to a further reduction in the public funds available, as requested within the framework of the EPA negotiations, if on the European side the Member States are not ready to make any effort to increase support for the state budgets of ACP countries?
What sort of partnership is this?
I also believe that there is not much clarity about the EUâs specific undertaking in the +5 development funding process or about the precise extent of development funding within the framework of the EPA negotiations.
How can we keep faith with the commitments we have made if we reduce the European development budget?
Thinking about the international geopolitical situation as well, I believe that it would be strategically more far-sighted on our part â as the European Union â to now enter into a relationship of mutual political support with the poorest countries, and thus reinforce the EU-ACP partnership.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, which is the biggest donor worldwide, has a duty to honour the commitments it made on several occasions in 2000 when the millennium goals were defined, and recently in the Council and in the G8 meetings held in 2005.
MrÂ Winkler, reducing the proposed allocation for the EDF is not a positive signal for our global partners, particularly the ACP countries, at the very moment when it is clear that the millennium goals are very far from being achieved.
Each day, globalisation gives rise to new, difficult challenges for developing countries.
As well as the size of the allocation, in order for our funds to be truly effective in the fight against poverty we must focus fully on transparency, consistency with the other policies of the EU, the criterion of performance by beneficiaries and, above all, the full participation of the governments involved and the coordination of various instruments, both at European level and with regard to the development policies put in place individually by the various Member States with a view to slimming down the bureaucracy which still accounts for too large a part of overall expenditure.
It is vital for the Council to agree to allocate the funds needed to comply with the commitments made and for the Commission, partly on the basis of the recommendations received from the Court of Auditors in September 2005, to undertake to put in place a transparent, efficient and effective system for careful management of the funds.
Â Â  â Mr President, the question we are debating tonight is very important to the external action of the European Union and to efforts to respond to our political commitment to achieve the Millennium Goals.
It is reasonable for us to question if the amount proposed for the 10th Regional Fund is lower than that calculated by the European Commission and to which we committed or is satisfactory in order for us to respond to both goals and needs.
However, it is not just the amount of financing which need concern us.
We have often observed problems which need to be addressed directly and which touch on the speed of disbursements and the accumulation of unused appropriations amounting to 11 billion, as you mentioned Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Moreover, the budgetisation of the European Development Fund will resolve many of the complications and difficulties in the application of successive European regional funds, will help speed up their liquidity flow and will wipe out the existing democratic deficit, which is something the European Parliament has expressed repeatedly.
Similarly Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the financial resources managed by the European Investment Fund are not verified by the Court of Auditors or the European Parliament.
Transparency must be improved if information on these financial resources is transmitted; we need a breakdown by type of use and an overall picture of results, of cooperation on applications outstanding and of added value.
We undertook, together with the ACP countries, to implement the Millennium Development Goals and, further to MrÂ Cornillet's reference to respect for taxpayers, I want to say that we need to value the implementation and control mechanisms both in our institutions and in the beneficiary states.
We shall be both more democratic and more consistent in our commitments to European taxpayers and more efficient in the Millennium Goals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, finance is at the heart of many debates on development policy.
This is all the more so at present, because the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the budgetisation for the next seven years have been very intense.
We know that the Commission proposal makes many objectives that have repeatedly been stated and restated unachievable.
That applies to totally different areas: exchange programmes for students, maintaining biological diversity, and also of course it applies in particular to development programmes, to programmes for eradicating poverty and to sustainable development programmes.
In this debate on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement we are not looking at the financial perspective, which is currently the subject of such intense debate, because the European Development Fund is not part of the general budget.
However, the problems involved are the same.
People talk big â and we are no exception â but far too little money is made available.
The European Parliament regrets that the Council is setting the agreed total for the tenth EDF below the level calculated by the Commission.
The exact figures have already been mentioned several times.
The reduction of EUR 2Â billion runs counter to the commitments that the Union has entered into in the context of the revision of the Cotonou Agreement, and it ignores all the promises made to substantially increase development aid.
We call on the Member States to significantly increase their contributions to the tenth EDF, so that the commitments entered into and the promises made can be honoured.
I am also very happy that it will be a unanimous resolution, because of course that would give a great deal of support for the positions that various Members of this House have expressed here today.
I would, however, like once more to declare my support for the amendments before us, which are very much concerned with ensuring how the development aspects of the economic partnership agreements will be financed.
Should you finance a âdevelopment dimensionâ by taking money intended for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, or â as we are demanding and as I would also like to see demanded in the resolution â should it be additional money?
I would like once again to support the call already made by my colleague MrsÂ Kinnock that at the time of Romania and Bulgariaâs accession â which is due to take place in the very near future â there should be additional funding for the EDF.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully and I recognise that this House is unanimous in its view.
I would like to say, however, that the Council will of course be adhering to the commitments it has made.
I have already said, and this remains my view, that we believe we are very much honouring those commitments to the ACP countries.
The issue of the distribution and allocation of appropriations is also very important, because structural problems also have to be addressed in this context â for example, the issue of residual appropriations has been mentioned.
Of course it is in our interest for residual appropriations to remain as low as possible.
That requires very careful examination.
We will put such an examination in place and we will also revisit it.
The issue of increasing ODA appropriations has also been mentioned.
I would like to point out that the Internal Financing Agreement makes provision for the possibility of cofinancing by the Member States to or through the EDF.
A number of references have been made to the issue of economic partnerships.
In the context of such partnerships, which we very much see as instruments of development aid, one of our aspirations is to support the ACP countries in fulfilling their potential for economic integration and in increasing competition by building up trade capacity.
The ACP regions will also be strengthened by means of their regional political and economic integration and their integration into the global economy.
We therefore believe that it is particularly important for the economic partnership agreements to provide support by means of development aid from the tenth EDF.
Lastly, I would like to refer once again to the increase in appropriations associated with Bulgaria and Romania.
The Council has fully adhered to the practice adopted up to now and has included Romania and Bulgaria, which will have acceded by then, in its calculations for the appropriations for the tenth EDF in 2008.
I regard that procedure as being totally proper and I do not believe that the Council has behaved unfairly.
A great deal of what has been discussed and requested here today is still subject to negotiation.
All this is also of course linked with the financial perspective.
I would like to stress once again that the Austrian Presidency is willing to exchange views with you on development issues at any time.
That is the context in which we have proposed briefing Parliamentâs Committee on Development following the forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11Â April, which will be devoted exclusively to development issues.
The date of 24Â April has already been informally earmarked for that purpose.
Â Â  Six motions for resolutions(1) have been submitted pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  I rise today to speak about a great humanitarian tragedy that is currently taking place.
Since 1 January of this year, more than a thousand African immigrants have reached the waters of the Canary Islands, but many more have drowned during the crossing from Mauritania to the Canary Islands.
It is an enormous waste of human life.
The Spanish Government and the Mauritanian Government have begun to cooperate, but I hope that the European Union, and specifically the Commission and the Council, will adopt measures to help resolve this great human tragedy very soon.
Â Â  The expansion and realisation of the Trans-European Network is almost a mainstay as we strive for the goals presented in the European Commission's 2001 White Paper, and as we translate the Lisbon Strategy into reality.
However, Trans-European Network projects have only been evaluated, if they were appropriately planned, funded and implemented.
Bearing in mind the proposal on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 made by the European Council in December, it becomes clear that there will obviously be financial difficulties when evaluating projects.
Therefore, I believe that the European Union ought to contribute more to realisation by encouraging the following measures: a more flexible approach to the use of Structural and Cohesion Funds when funding Trans-European Networks and the funding of the âGalileoâ programmes from the scientific research budget line.
Projects must also be prioritised, with priority given to such projects as for instance, the rail sector that has made most progress to date with its so-called cross-border rail corridors.
Â Â  â The problems faced by Portuguese farmers on account of the poor agricultural year, caused by the extreme drought of the past year, have been exacerbated by the unilateral termination by the government of agrifood measures agreed in 2005 with farmers and 85% cofinanced by the EU.
This situation is also an example of the consequences of implementing the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, which leads to swingeing budget cuts to tackle deficits, regardless of the economic and social problems caused, and which prevents the use of Community funds missing in the Portuguese budget for the 15% national contribution, as the government has pointed out.
This raises two questions: firstly, when the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact will be thrown out; and secondly, whether the Commission has a strategy for mitigating the problems experienced by Portuguese farmers.
Â Â  Mr President, Britain currently enjoys a tax derogation on red diesel that applies to leisure boating.
That derogation expires in December 2006.
If the derogation is not extended, the price of fuel for motorboats could treble.
If this happens there will be an inevitable decline in leisure boating.
The Exchequer will receive less tax revenue, not more, and economic damage will be done to local communities.
The continuation of the derogation is a matter between the Council and the Commission, but tax policy should be the sole prerogative of sovereign national governments.
All British MEPs should lobby the Minister responsible to ensure that the derogation continues.
They should also join the campaign to save the derogation started by magazine.
I will be pleased to supply them with details of how to do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, this is the third time in this parliamentary term that I have taken the floor at a plenary session to protest at discrimination against Catholics.
This time I wish to speak about the blocking of Radio Maryjaâs interactive Internet broadcasting, which is the only reliable source of information for Members of a Christian persuasion.
Our activities, like those of our electorate, are linked to these media, and the fact that reception of this station has been blocked therefore means that we have been deprived of any contact with our electorate for two months.
Requests and reminders to the information and telecommunications services have not yielded any results, which is why I feel obliged to speak in this Parliament with reference to Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The current situation is a glaring contravention of the principles enshrined in the Convention.
We hope that we will be guaranteed our freedoms in the European Parliament, along with other minorities.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my concern about the conditions in which the Russian authorities keep their prisoners.
Contrary to law, Mikhail Khodorkovsky of the Yukos Company has been sent 7000 kilometres away from his family.
His lawyer travelled to the Siberian detention camp â it took six hours by plane, thirteen hours by train and a couple of hours by car â to prepare an appeal to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
She was allowed to meet her client only after 6.00 p.m.
After several evening meetings, Mr Khodorkovsky was suddenly transferred to a special isolation cell.
He is still there today.
The apparent reason was to prevent him from completing his appeal to the Court in Strasbourg.
I invite my colleagues to react to these arbitrary actions by the Russian authorities, who blatantly defy their own laws.
Â Â  On Sunday two young Estonians, unofficial election observers, were arrested in Minsk.
âDonât come to Minsk with your orange revolution,â they were told.
The Belarusian elections were still not free this time round.
I am convinced that the elections that will be held this weekend in Ukraine will be democratic, fair and free.
Having just visited Kiev, I can confirm that.
Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus â Estonia sympathises with these countries, because we have not forgotten our history.
This week, Estonia mourns a person without whom our return to Europe would have been considerably more difficult.
Obituaries refer to President Lennart Meri as a great Estonian.
He was chosen European of the Year five years before Estonia joined the European Union.
Lennart Meri devoted all of his energy to the struggle against âpetty-Europeanâ thinking.
The European Union should not behave in a narrow-minded or short-sighted manner.
It must support all those countries attempting to free themselves from the shackles of the past and join a democratic Europe.
We must unequivocally state that fulfilment of the three Copenhagen criteria also offers the vassal states of the Soviet Union the opportunity to become Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  â With the decision on the expansion of the Euro zone fast approaching, the criteria for the introduction of the Euro are becoming increasingly politicised.
The head of the European Central Bank has stated that the criteria must be met in the long term, not only during the assessment period.
Recently, the high price of energy supplies â an external factor, independent from the management of a country's economy â has been having an influence on one of the Maastricht criteria â increases in inflation.
It is very complex to maintain high rates of economic growth and low inflation.
Furthermore, when determining inflation criteria, we must also take into account the accidental reduction in the price of certain goods in Finland and the Netherlands who have the lowest inflation, and improve the means of determining criteria.
In Lithuania inflation may slightly exceed the amount expected in the criteria.
For six years it has been considerably lower than Maastricht's requirements, but in an economy which is emerging so rapidly, keeping prices low is something truly complex.
After the unsuccessful referendum on the Constitutional Treaty, and without a common foreign and energy policy, let us at least expand the Euro zone and give the European Union renewed impetus for growth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the exclusion by the Independence and Democracy Group of the Polish delegation and the Northern League is a scandal, which has taken place by means of an illegal procedure from start to finish that bears a Soviet stamp.
There is a letter addressed to the President of the European Parliament by the then chairman of the IND-DEM Bureau, MrÂ Piotrowski.
We would like to know from the President when an official response will be given to this complaint.
We are ready to appeal to the European Court of Justice, and meanwhile those who have used Soviet methods to exclude us from this group, by dismissing us in a way fully reminiscent of Communism, are being investigated by the Court of Auditors for bungling the use of funds, bungling which we and our friends and colleagues in the Polish delegation have always opposed in the name of the principle of transparency.
Please clarify this issue, which is bringing shame upon the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Last Sunday, the European Parliament awaited the Belarusian presidential elections which were due to take place.
True, the election campaign left little room for hope that the elections would be democratic, free and honest, as the campaign was conducted in an atmosphere of threats, opposition leader arrests and the suppression of the independent press.
Lukashenko's regime is responsible for all this, but some still hoped that at least the elections would be honest.
Unfortunately, instead of an election all we saw was a farce of an election â a rigged election, like those organised in the 1930s or 1950s in Eastern Europe, and in Lithuania during the Soviet occupation.
This is confirmed by the conclusions of the OSCE observer mission, but the âjeans revolutionâ is not over.
Around 600 young people spent yet another night in tents on âOctoberâ Square in Minsk, braving a temperature of minus 10 degrees.
Yesterday, 11 EU ambassadors visited them to demonstrate the European Union's solidarity.
Mr President, we must demand the organisation of fresh presidential elections in Belarus.
Â Â  â Mr President, we welcome the clear progress in negotiations with the Council on the new financial perspective.
The outcome of yesterdayâs trialogue, however, was merely the first step on the road to an agreement, and this step was taken halfway through the Austrian Presidency.
It took three whole months for the Council to enter into negotiations.
Meanwhile, in nine months the interinstitutional agreement will expire, a new programming period will start and the European Union will be joined by two more members, yet we still do not know what our budget will be and what kind of European Union we are striving towards.
We do not have time for negotiations that drag on for months, particularly as the EUâs citizens cannot comprehend why it is so difficult to reach an agreement if we are all working towards the same goal, namely balanced development in the interest of all Member States.
Time works against progress, however, and delays in implementing new programmes are in effect lost investment opportunities and lost chances.
This is something we will be accountable for to the citizens of the united Europe.
In any case, we cannot afford to waste the next few weeks.
A compromise must be reached as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, next week in Cyprus is the commemoration day for those who lost their lives in the 1955 popular uprising against British colonial rule.
Hundreds of civilians, including women and children, were killed or executed by the British Army during the four-year freedom struggle which ended in 1959, after Britain was forced to grant Cyprus a form of independence.
Today, Cyprus and Britain, in a spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation, are friends and partners though membership of the EU, and they cooperate closely in trying to achieve peace and prosperity.
Unfortunately, however, this relationship is at risk of being poisoned because of the continued presence of British troops in Cyprus.
About ten thousand British soldiers are stationed in an area amounting to approximately four per cent of the territory of the island, known as sovereign British bases.
Many thousands of Cypriot civilians live in these areas in which the , strangely, does not apply.
Their human rights are being profoundly violated by Britain.
I appeal to my British colleagues to understand the feelings and respect the rights of the Cypriot people and to exert pressure on their Government to return this territory of the British bases back to its rightful owners: the people of Cyprus.
I know this is a sore point, but I hope you will agree with me that it is totally unacceptable for Britain, an EU Member State, to occupy part of another EU Member State, Cyprus.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Union has sided with the bank UniCredito Italiano in its dispute with the Polish Government.
In so doing, it has ignored the old Roman principle of â agreements are made to be kept â since UniCredito has not kept its side of the agreement.
The Union has ignored the fact that as a result of the bankâs actions, banking services on the Polish market have become monopolised.
Essentially, EU officials are protecting the interests and profits of UniCredito Italiano.
Do EU officials wish to prove by means of this attitude that the idea that the European institutions exist to protect consumers, entrepreneurs and competition is a mere platitude, and that all that really counts are the interests of big business?
That is a that we Polish Members oppose.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to speak about the latest discrimination affecting new Member States.
The Strasbourg session of the European Parliament is always a serious ordeal for the Members of the European Parliament.
Many MEPs can only access Strasbourg via Frankfurt. This means an exhausting two and a half hour coach trip.
We now have a further inconvenience added to those experienced so far.
Passengers travelling with airlines of new Member States now have to pass through security checks twice at Frankfurt airport, while other passengers go through them only once.
It is quite interesting that passengers travelling to Afghanistan must only go through security checks once, while those travelling to the capitals of new Member States, such as Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest and Ljubljana must go through two security checks.
This is an example of further open discrimination against the airlines of new Member States and passengers travelling to these countries, because it increases the costs incurred by airlines.
I would like to ask the German MEPs to help put a stop to the discrimination against new Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to address two issues very briefly.
Democracy and human rights are very important to Europeans: we like to cherish and preserve them.
Tunne Kelam has already raised the matter of the human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, the treatment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
If we in the European Union really stand for human rights, we cannot accept this.
We have to intervene in the Khodorkovsky case, as well as the human rights situation in Russia generally.
Another matter relating to democracy is the notion that we in the European Union should know exactly what the European taxpayersâ euros are being spent on.
We cannot support terrorist organisations such as Hamas, which has now come to power in the Palestinian autonomous zone.
Instead, we should be promoting democracy, and we should cease cooperation with terrorist organisations and stop financing them.
Â Â  Mr President, pursuant to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive, the agricultural sector in my constituency, as elsewhere, is being subjected to extensive capital expenditure for the purpose of radically increasing slurry storage capacity.
To assist, a UK Government scheme of grant aid was announced, with applications possible until the end of this month.
Then, unilaterally, the same department announced earlier this month that the scheme was closing, because the amount designated â a mere GBPÂ 45 million â was already over-subscribed.
Farmers who in good faith were working to the stipulated deadline are quite clearly disadvantaged.
The justification for the aid, namely the necessity to undertake excessively expensive work, still exists.
The assistance, however, has now been withdrawn. This is as unfair as the GBPÂ 45 million was patently inadequate.
I therefore use this forum tonight to call on the UK Government to release sufficient funds to enable this essential work to be done, otherwise the implementation of the Nitrates Directive will be impossible.
Â Â  Mr President, on 19Â February 2006, a small group of young Maltese members of Moviment Graffitti organised a peaceful protest in favour of peace and against war.
They wanted to show their disapproval of the presence in Maltese ports of five NATO warships by simply displaying banners saying âPeace not Warâ and âWarships Killâ.
The police authorities stopped these activists from showing these banners â a small and legitimate peaceful protest â on Pinto Wharf and on the Grand Harbour bastions.
Furthermore, the activists were allegedly told that such demonstrations would not be allowed in the future.
This attitude is unacceptable and breaches the fundamental right of freedom of expression.
This is why I have asked the Commission to come up with an opinion on this case.
We should show full solidarity with these young people and urge them to continue exercising their right to express their opinions in a peaceful manner.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by MrsÂ Morgantini, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (2005/2162(INI)) (A6-0053/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, âYou will eat when you are competitiveâ is a slogan on a poster: in the background, a starving African child.
The phrase is very emphatic, but it actually seems that the European Union, and this is a euphemism, is placing too much emphasis on the effectiveness of trade in the fight against poverty.
The report under debate today is incomplete, and in the draft, in fact, there were some points where the effects of liberalisation on the economies of developing countries were called into question.
Various econometric studies, a report by Christian Aid and the study entitled âWinners and losersâ by Sandra Polanski, published last week, have shown that many developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, would be experiencing better conditions today if we had not introduced unbridled liberalisation measures.
The Polanski study, which analyses the winners and losers in the liberalisations launched under the Doha Round, confirms data previously published by UNCTAD and the UNDP and reaches certain conclusions: developing countries will probably be the losers in the game, since they do not have the agricultural or industrial capacity to compete with the rich countries; the winners will in fact be the rich countries: the United States, Europe and Japan, and also China.
Free trade will produce modest gains at the global level, partly because the adjustment costs which countries have to deal with when they undertake the liberalisation process promoted by the industrialised countries can be greater than the benefits.
It is not a question of being against trade, since the opening up of the markets can also be an effective instrument in the fight against poverty, but like any instrument it must be used with great caution.
First of all, it is necessary to put the countries in a position to meet their own internal requirements, by boosting productive capacity in line, above all, with internal goals of self-sufficiency in food, and then it is necessary to allow them to tackle competition and limitations on supply, by providing adequate resources which are currently not present in the financial perspectives.
Secondly, it is then necessary to work on the basis of realistic timetables, which take into account the time that structural adjustments require and, thirdly, it is necessary to restrict the opening up of the market, and to lay down, in addition, mechanisms for suspending the liberalisation process, if necessary, and to give the ACP countries the opportunity to protect their own incipient and strategic industries; in any case, we used this criterion ourselves throughout the last century and some in fact are still trying to put it forward again today.
These principles are almost present in the report, partly because these are the requests of the ACP countries, and it is those countries that are putting them forward.
Because an effective principle of partnership requires that we take into account the requests of our partners, above all if they are justified, and above all if they are backed by civil society in Europe and in the ACP countries.
Also and above all because the economic partnership agreements arise from the legal and institutional framework of the Cotonou agreement, signed by the European Union â and I underline this â and they have development and combating poverty as their ultimate goals.
On the basis of this same principle of partnership, we do not have the right to impose agreements.
I believe that it is those countries that have to do it, and one of the main points in the report is the call for the Commission to carry out an immediate study of the alternatives so that the ACP countries can evaluate the options and decide whether to sign the agreements or not.
The reciprocity that is being called for in the implementation of liberalisations, then, means applying equal laws to those who are not equal in economic or development terms; this is no way to produce equality or democracy.
Thinking about development solely in terms of increasing a countryâs gross domestic product is very reductionist.
Development is hard to define, but when in my report the Commission is called upon to protect the sectors of water, health and education from liberalisation, what we are fundamentally talking about is rights that must be guaranteed, as when the Cape Town Declaration is quoted.
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly also has the power to set development indicators in order to assess the achievement of results and trade agreements, requesting that social and environmental indicators be included such as the creation of dignified work, health, education and gender equality.
We are talking about rights â the same rights for which we have struggled in Europe, the same rights on which the European Union is founded.
The European Parliament cannot wish to remove these values.
We are at a crucial point in the struggle against poverty and we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Morgantini, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Development, and in particular its Chairman, MrsÂ Morgantini, for this report which makes development central to the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements, the EPAs.
Development, we all agree, is indeed the starting point, the vital issue and the priority for our action.
We shall, of course, continue to insist on that throughout the negotiations and during the implementation of the EPAs, when the time comes.
Firstly, I am delighted that we share the same opinions on very many points, such as the importance of the dialogue with civil society and the national parliaments of the ACP countries, the objective of regional integration and economic governance, the role of investment and the diversification of exports.
I find, in this report, opinions that I myself have often put forward to our partners, who have a vital role to play in this respect.
The prime objective is development, and that also involves a flexible approach that makes it possible to take into account the economic weaknesses of the countries concerned, which we are trying to strengthen.
This approach manifests itself, for example, in the way in which trade liberalisation is biased in favour of the ACP countries, in flexibility in relation to the opening of their markets, in the extent to which we cover their products and in the necessary safeguard mechanisms.
These are all principles that were clearly stated in our negotiating positions from the first day and that the Commissioner, MrÂ Mandelson, has himself confirmed on several occasions.
Nonetheless, I have also observed that, on certain sensitive issues, the report raises doubts that I feel are not justified.
For example, the report questions how coherent our position concerning the EPAs is with the commitments made in the Cotonou Agreement or in the recent declaration on the European Unionâs development policy.
Perhaps there is a communication problem, which I shall try to resolve this very day.
There should be no misunderstandings between us, because Parliamentâs support is obviously more necessary to the Commission than ever in the delicate phase of negotiations that we are in and that should come to an end in a little more than a year.
First of all, I think that we need to put the compatibility of EPAs with the rules of the WTO back into the right perspective.
Of course, this compatibility is imperative if we wish to ensure the stability of the EPAs, as of all our trade agreements, and the Commission must attend to this.
We are also willing to improve on the WTO rules, if possible.
Some proposals have been made along these lines, but I think we should have no illusions and that we must be aware of the objective limitations and difficulties of this approach.
Above all, however, one must not forget that the real reason for the EPAsâ existence is not the WTO but the urgent need, amply demonstrated and confirmed in the Cotonou Agreement, to make better use of trade as a driving force for economic growth in the ACP countries, as it has been for so many other countries, including developing countries.
In my opinion the success of the Economic Partnership Agreements will depend on three key factors, all of equal importance.
Firstly, negotiations genuinely targeting the development of our partners, which is, as I have said, our only strategic objective.
Secondly, the commitment of our ACP partners to establishing a statutory framework that favours investment.
Thirdly, the support that the European Union, but also its Member States and other sponsors, will be able to offer to the countries concerned in order to prepare for, and bring about, the implementation of the EPAs.
I understand the attention that our partners and Parliament are giving to this last point.
From my very first day at the Commission, I promised to ensure that the necessary answers would be found.
We have succeeded â in obtaining the commitment of Member States to progressively doubling their aid for development, and I thank Parliament for its support without which this would not have been possible.
May I remind you that that will represent an increase of more than EURÂ 20 billion per year from 2010?
We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on strengthening the cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the framework of the European consensus adopted in December and confirming the priority to be given to the effectiveness of aid.
We decided to focus first on Africa and we developed a coherent strategy for Africa.
A trust fund for infrastructures, including those that facilitate trade, is already in place.
In the context of the programme for the tenth European Development Fund (EDF), we are deciding with our partners on the best means of supporting regional economic integration, for which our partners have themselves drawn up agendas.
The Economic Partnership Agreements are part of this action and represent an important part of it.
From this point of view, the timescale is essential.
For example, loss of tax revenues resulting from the dismantling of customs tariffs will arise once the EPAs have come into force.
This will be offset partly by the expected economic growth and partly by the rationalisation of taxation systems, which has already been initiated in several countries, often with our support.
Furthermore, in order to make the transition easier, macroeconomic support measures are already envisaged for certain regions.
I can tell you that I am actively working on devising measures to support the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly in terms of the consequences there could be, initially, in terms of the resources necessary for the operation of the sovereign State.
I know that there are some who would be in favour of a debate on the possible alternatives to the EPAs.
Personally, I do not think that an academic debate of this kind would be useful.
Firstly, an in-depth debate already took place when it was agreed, at Cotonou, that EPAs would offer the greatest benefits in terms of development, of market access compatible with the WTO and of support for good governance and regional integration.
Secondly, all the ACP countries are continuing to negotiate EPAs.
Finally, countries benefit from the effects of having access to markets forming part of the system of generalised preferences and of the âeverything but armsâ initiative.
We know, in the meantime, after virtually half a century of unilateral preference under the LomÃ© Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, that this preferential access to our market is not in itself enough to meet the needs of our partners.
In conclusion, the report conveys our common position on a wide range of subjects.
In order to set so many countries on the road to development and growth, I am ready to continue working with you on the objectives and challenges that we and our partners face in this complex, ambitious and vital project constituted by the EPAs.
Tomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa.
You know that I am doing the rounds of all the regional organisations and that, on each visit, I hear anxieties expressed by all those involved in development.
You have conveyed these anxieties perfectly and, believe me, I am acutely aware of them.
I am acutely aware of the very real questions that you are raising and I can tell you openly that investigations and discussions are making good progress, and creative thinking too, in order to develop a range of ways to give better support to the partner countries and to respond more directly to their concerns.
In conclusion, then, I thank you. I completely agree with the essential features of this excellent report and I remain more than ever open to the idea of a debate with you, particularly about the best ways to give support to this process.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, the Economic Partnership Agreements are about trade relations with the ACP countries, which in turn are governed by the Cotonou Agreement.
The present arrangements are, however, no longer consonant with the rules agreed within the WTO, in that the special treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries in comparison with other developing countries contravenes WTO rules and must therefore be brought into line with them.
The present system may continue to apply until 2008, and must have been adapted by then at the latest.
There are those in the House who reject EPAâs from the outset; they do not believe that a certain measure of trade liberalisation, in whatever form, can make any contribution to the development of poor countries.
My group, though, is convinced that trade can indeed play a part, certainly that the liberalisation of trade among the ACP countries can do so.
We have no objection in principle to EPAs, provided that they are arrived at on the basis of sound agreements, providing for such things as adequate time for the countries in question to adapt to the new circumstances, and support for them in doing so.
It is important that EPAs should make provision for that.
So, as far as we are concerned, let there be EPAs, if they stand a chance of helping to fight poverty.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants them to retain the development goal as a top priority, which means that liberalisation must only be gradual, for the benefit of the ACP countries and adapted to their specific and varied circumstances, with important basic services such as water, education, transport and energy remaining available to all.
The PPE wants a realistic timetable, in other words enough time for necessary changes to be made.
The PPE-DE Group wants sufficient support measures (for example technical assistance, capacity-building and reforms in such areas as customs and taxation) and it wants to see cooperation on a regional basis promoted between the ACP countries.
There are four areas about which the PPE-DE Group has concerns, and they are as follows.
The first is the limited supply of information from the Commission on the course of the negotiations.
Then there is the pressure of time under which these are now being conducted and under which they will also have to be implemented.
The negotiations have been in progress since 2002 and still no draft texts have been made available to us.
Finally, there are the financial aspects.
The EPAsâ success will depend on a decent sum of money being made available.
In the first place, this will have to come from the European Development Fund and then from other sources as well.
It is not yet sufficiently clear where the money will come from then.
There are emergency rules that make provision for this, and they are necessary.
If the system appears not to be working in some places, the process must be capable of being slowed down or stopped for a period of time.
Scope for that already exists under current WTO rules.
We have as yet no specific proposals to make about this.
The Commissioner has already gone some way deeper into this issue, and I look forward with pleasure to closer cooperation and more detailed information.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should to like to thank the Commissioner.
I wish to begin by referring to his remark that talking about alternatives to economic partnership agreements is âacademicâ â that was the word he used.
It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow.
Therefore, Commissioner, it is not an academic issue, but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP.
The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in.
I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Developmentâs concerns and priorities and DG Tradeâs concerns and priorities, which are very different.
We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives.
My impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely.
There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority.
The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support.
Market access remains absolutely central as an issue.
The proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries â most of which are least-developed countries â is a major concern.
The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs Martens said, are absolutely clear.
However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay.
Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access â market opening â may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements.
To be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so.
ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building.
All these are major priorities for the ACP.
It must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is.
It is up to the ACP â in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society â to make that kind of decision.
Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals.
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question.
The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations.
My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level â that probably means you, Commissioner â is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations.
Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed?
If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Tradeâs description of this as being the absolute role model?
Finally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002.
Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender.
The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council.
Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals?
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Morgantiniâs report was very much welcomed by the Committee on Development because it is clear about the fundamental principles on which economic partnership should be based.
As Commissioner Michel and Commissioner Mandelson have stated, economic partnership agreements must be development-friendly.
That means that liberalisation must, of necessity, be asymmetrical.
There can be no question of forcing ACP countries to open up their markets to European goods until their own domestic markets are much more firmly established.
From the European side, we can offer aid for trade measures to help with this market-building and with supply-side constraints.
Of the amendments tabled for Plenary, the ALDE Group will be supporting those which underline that the pace of market opening should be driven by the ACP and that there is scope for the EU to work much more closely with ACP partners in world trade negotiations.
Together, the ACP countries and the EU form a substantial block.
The ALDE Group will also be supporting those amendments from the PPE-DE Group which offer improved wording and avoid overly restrictive definitions of, for instance, decent working benchmarks.
Some NGOs have campaigned on a simple platform of ânoâ to EPAs, but that could be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
The regional integration which is part of the EPA process will help ACP countries to prosper, to increase South-South trade and the removal of tariff barriers between neighbouring ACP countries.
The essential point at every stage of the EPA negotiating process is to ensure that the outcome works in favour of development.
I hope the Commission will at all times be genuinely and consistently guided by that principle and by this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the purpose of the Cotonou Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreements is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development.
That objective must under no circumstances go by the board.
The mentality or idea of reciprocity, based on a principle of equality, is therefore quite wrong.
The fact is, we are concerned here with two quite unequal partners, the EU and the ACP countries, so it is not the ACP countries that should be helping the EU countries, but the other way around.
That is something I am absolutely certain MrsÂ Morgantini agrees with me about.
Poor countriesâ only export opportunities are in the fields of agriculture and raw materials and in relation to very labour-intensive products, such as textiles, which they should be allowed to export to ourselves in the EU without restriction.
The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies.
We cannot therefore demand that these countries just go ahead and open up 90% of their markets in return for the EU opening up its own markets as a kind of payment.
That is a view also expressed in MrsÂ Morgantiniâs report.
I hope, then, that I am right in interpreting paragraphÂ 17 of the report as saying that it is of course only the ACP countries that are entitled to introduce temporary import restrictions in relation to industries threatened by surges in imports.
It would be very unfortunate if we were entitled to prevent the ACP countries from selling us textiles and agricultural products just because we had not been skilful enough to adapt to the changed conditions of competition in a globalised world.
The fact is that we too were allowed to protect our own markets when our economies were still developing.
That being said, protecting markets is a very uncertain way of achieving growth and a healthy economy, and it should therefore be a limited, including time-limited, measure for developing countries too.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House have already, on a number of occasions and with a large degree of unanimity, reached agreement on the Millennium Development Goals and have flagged up the elimination of poverty from our planet as our most important task over the coming decades.
MrsÂ Morgantiniâs excellent report has now provided us with an assessment of the contribution economic partnership agreements can make to actually achieving this task.
We expect the Commission to give clear priority to development and the elimination of poverty in the ACP countries in the negotiations.
The criticism that I am about to make is clearly aimed at the appearance of a representative of DG Trade at a hearing of the Committee on Development.
Let me be quite clear about this: we do not want negotiations that reflect the style and behaviour of a colonial power; we believe that the decision-making sovereignty of our partners in the ACP countries must be preserved.
This sovereignty should be encouraged by investment in trade infrastructure, and, of course, by means of support for national strategies to combat poverty, which is fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity so prized in the EU.
If governments exercise their sovereignty by deciding to view the economic partnership agreements with scepticism, then there have to be alternatives such as those offered by the Cotonou Agreement.
That is why I wonder why the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete that reference.
Why does the PPE-DE Group suddenly no longer feel bound by agreements?
The PPE-DE Group is also seeking to delete virtually every sentence from the report that gives the ACP governments negotiating sovereignty and their own political room for manoeuvre as to whether liberalisation should be implemented in a given sector, to what extent and in what time frame.
Why, I would like to know?
The Morgantini report calls for basic provision with drinking water, education and other key public services to be excluded from liberalisation from the outset.
The PPE-DE Group wishes this to be deleted, and instead calls for the liberalisation of the water sector to be based on affordable prices.
I regard that as pure cynicism.
Given the widespread poverty in many parts of the ACP countries, that is simply not acceptable.
I urge you to reject these amendments tomorrow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank MrsÂ Morgantini, the rapporteur, for the excellent job she has done.
In a society that is now dominated by a globalised economic market, the Community institutions have a duty to encourage development cooperation, in a world in which three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and over a billion survive on one dollar.
For this shared aim, we must search for suitable means which can lead both to an improvement in the economic situation of developing countries and to gradual and increasing integration into the world market.
The European Unionâs cooperation policies must contain priorities designed to change the internal processes in those countries, promoting a stable, open and democratic political climate as well as an increase in prosperityWithin this context it can be said that the economic partnership agreements represent a suitable tool to boost and implement trade relations between the ACP and the European Union.
We should also emphasise another point: development investment in the so-called âsensitiveâ sectors such as education, health and energy should be constantly monitored, and where necessary restrictions should be imposed on economic liberalisation.
We ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries, effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in peopleâs general living conditions.
On this issue a precise, specific and consistent commitment is needed.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I wish to thank my colleague, MrsÂ Martens, for her excellent speech and the amendments that she has proposed.
This approach strengthens the report before us and supports its objectives to make Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) a workable means of implementing the EUâs targets for development cooperation.
WTO rules force us into separate Economic Partnership Agreements, because the trade relationship based on the LomÃ© Conventions and Cotonou Agreement is non-reciprocal and therefore inconsistent with the WTOâs enabling clause.
Under this clause, industrial countries are permitted to give unilateral and non-reciprocal preferential treatment to just two categories of countries: either all Least Developed Countries or all developing countries.
Since the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) regions include countries from both groups, the original preferences granted to the ACP countries are incompatible with current WTO rules, and our transition period giving entitlement to waivers expires in 2008.
In order to make the EU-ACP trade relationship WTO-compliant in the long term, a solution has been sought in the EPAs.
Under the proposed EPAs, the trade relationship between the EU and the different ACP regional groups will be reciprocal.
Under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement provided that the liberalisation of essentially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time.
In the context of the EPAs, this has come to be understood as roughly 90% of trade within 10-12 years.
It is clear that implementing a reciprocal free trade agreement will be a major challenge for the ACP countries, whose level of development varies a good deal.
Reciprocity represents a major shift in the EUâs approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners.
On the other hand, we know that the support allowed by LomÃ© and Cotonou did not halt the decline in ACP market share.
Since we are worried about premature liberalisation, we need to ask whether in this context there is such a thing as timely liberalisation.
Sometimes bold steps have to be taken, which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt.
I myself also think that it is important to allow everyone unobstructed access to natureâs own âfreeâ services.
Therefore, on World Water Day, I feel it is necessary to mention how essential it is, for example, that water resources are managed fairly.
The opening up of markets in some cases has also led to the spread of poverty in developing countries, and for that reason the progress of talks should be monitored carefully.
The negotiations must be impartial, and no pressure should be put on any party while they are taking place.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Member, MrsÂ Morgantini, for the excellent report that she has submitted to us today concerning the impact of Economic Partnership Agreements on development.
The general philosophy of this text is right.
It advocates the necessity for Community solidarity in the face of regulation that carries the risk of uncontrolled liberalisation.
This work was welcomed unanimously within the Committee on Development.
It is my wish and hope that it will receive the same support in tomorrowâs vote.
One essential principle must guide our thinking: development in accordance with, and closely linked to, the Cotonou Agreement.
It is a prime objective in all the negotiations and within the framework of the implementation of EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
I understand the need to bring trade relations between the European Union and the ACP countries into line with the WTO rules; I am talking about unilateral preferential access between Community markets.
Nonetheless, compatibility with the WTO rules must not take precedence over our international commitments to promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.
I share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations.
There is, indeed, a glaring asymmetry between the two parties.
If we do not attend to this, the swift and harmonious reciprocal opening of markets that is being sold to us will be fatally unbalanced and, I fear, will lead only to disillusionment.
This liberalisation of trade between unequal partners, far from promoting development as intended, runs the risk of having devastating effects on the fragile economies of the countries concerned and on their vulnerable populations.
And this at the very moment when, in our speeches, we are claiming to want to help these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which, as we already know, are out of reach.
I believe that if these agreements are conceived gradually and in a concerted manner, within a rational and predictable framework, in order to promote trade and investment in this area, they will represent a real opportunity for the ACP countries, an opportunity both in terms of economic diversification and harmonious regional integration and in terms of real and successful integration within the world economy.
A few priorities must be stated.
The first of these is the exclusion of the Singapore issues and of essential public services, without neglecting the principle of the right of these countries to use safeguards to defend their sensitive strategic sectors.
The second priority is to respect our commitment to seek out alternative trade systems to EPAs for those countries that request it, as is stipulated in Article 37.6 of the Cotonou Agreement.
These alternatives must be based on the principle of non-reciprocity established in the generalised system of preferences (GSP) as well as on the introduction of a clause establishing special, differentiated treatment at the WTO.
These priorities depend very much on the willingness of the European Union to give its full weight within the WTO to facilitating improvement in the rules in terms of development priorities.
Finally, stating a wish is no use without the means to achieve it.
I should like to conclude by saying that, beyond the concern about the European Unionâs financial perspectives, we must, on the one hand, keep the promises made by the President of the Commission at Gleneagles concerning aid for trade.
On the other hand, we must envisage new financial commitments to compensate for the cost, to the ACP countries, of the removal of preferences and customs tariffs, strengthen technical support to ACP countries and, finally, ladies and gentlemen, reject the unacceptable reduction in the European Development Fund.
Since, however, I am not convinced that these aims will be achieved quickly, I suggest that, where the reciprocal opening of markets is concerned, the Commission consider, as a token of its goodwill, prolonging the period of transition according to the specific needs of the ACP countries, as defined at the time of the negotiations.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope that Economic Partnership Agreements will be a workable means of eliminating poverty, and that they will allow us to go from making declarations to something concrete.
I warmly welcomed the speeches on this subject this evening, and that of Eija-Riitta Korhola in particular was excellent.
In terms of quality, I cannot add anything, but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantiniâs report.
The importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated.
As welfare societies and European communities, we want to help fellow human beings who are worse off than ourselves, both in our own countries and elsewhere.
In a way, this is a measure of how civilised we are.
It is true that today, in many Member States of the European Union, there is some debate about what proportion of financing should be channelled into development cooperation.
For example, in Finland, where I come from, this issue has just been discussed, and I know that the 0.7% target recommended by the UN has not been achieved: we have kept at around the 0.4% mark.
It is also to be hoped that the other European countries, Finland included, will make progress in this matter. Hopefully, we in the European Union will establish a common will, as well as the funding, to attend to the needs of our brothers and of nations worse off than us.
In my opinion, however, we should ensure that the aid we give is in harmony with the principles of sustainable development.
Economic, social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation.
It is not merely money that is important, but, above all, partnership, aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start.
We must also be careful to promote European values such as democracy and human rights through development cooperation.
It is important to take these into account in development cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Morgantini report is an important attempt to restrict the damage caused by the EPAs.
Do you really believe that a free trade agreement is what is needed to reduce and eliminate hunger and poverty?
Consider Burundi: the theoretical abolition of tariffs, as envisaged by the EPAs, would result in a gain for the European Union of a trade share equal to USD 12.4Â million, which Burundi would lose, and that is after having calculated the gain to local consumers.
This fact emerges from a study by the Economic Commission for Africa, a UN organisation, which also showed how that continent already has a rather high proportion of wealth owned by foreign residents, higher than any other region in the world: 39%.
The idea that a further expansion of free-market ideas can produce wealth in these areas is also refuted by the data on subsidies.
In Nigeria the cheapest meat is German and English and in Senegal 52Â 000 tonnes of onions exported in 2005 alone from the Netherlands placed farmers in very serious difficulties.
The EPAs were originally conceived within the framework of the Cotonou agreement, which enshrines the fight against poverty and the struggle for social development, but they have instead become something which promotes not social development but rather greater poverty.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with some of the points that have been made.
As regards the apparent lack of information coming from the Commission, the Commission is, of course, willing to provide all the information it has available.
Perhaps you feel that there is too little information. I shall see to it, for my own part in any case, that I give you all the information that I have.
With regard to the need to have large sums of money available, if extra money is needed, the Member States will have to provide it.
You know very well the amounts available from the European Development Fund: I have only the money that is allocated to me.
With regard to Mrs Kinnockâs speech, I should like there to be no misunderstanding.
When I spoke about an âacademicâ debate on the alternatives, this was not intended to be impertinent.
In fact, it is possible to make alternative proposals to those who do not wish to negotiate, but, as matters stand at present, they are, as you well know, Mrs Kinnock, all negotiating.
The word was perhaps ill chosen, but starting a debate on the alternatives when they are all already negotiating does not seem very useful to me.
I should like to say to you that I am fairly broadly in agreement with the other comments you have made.
Thus, I agree with your comments concerning access to the market, but you have to admit too that access to the market is not everything.
Our experience of 50 years of liberalisation clearly shows that it is not enough and that there is a whole list of other factors to consider.
You will find none more convinced than I of the fact that we must focus on the benefits of development. I am, therefore, completely in agreement with this principle.
Regarding production problems, it is clear that production is one of the areas in which we can most usefully provide support to the countries in question.
It is at this level that one can provide the necessary funding for technical or technological upgrading, for technology transfer, for product quality, in short to finance the added value so necessary for access to the market.
I agree with you in recognising that the European Union must not impose diktats.
That would not correspond at all either with my convictions or with the idea I have of development.
There is a negotiation and, in a negotiation, each partner puts forward his arguments.
There is no diktat in that.
I am also in agreement with Mrs Martens when she says that the timescale must be realistic.
I completely agree that it is necessary to safeguard access to water, to energy and to a whole range of essential goods.
I share your views on this matter completely and I am extremely doubtful about the idea of liberalising these sectors.
Mrs Kinnock, on the question of the dismissal of the secretary that I am said to have called for, firstly, I do not have the power to dismiss the secretary concerned and, secondly, I have not called for anyone to be dismissed.
What is true â because I am anxious to take full responsibility for what I have done â is that, in answer to an appeal from the secretary of CAEMC, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, I simply said that I did not agree with granting a request for extra money for someone who has done nothing, and I can vouch for the fact that he has done nothing. I am, moreover, not the only person to complain about the fact.
To justify himself, he said that he had no right of injunction in relation to Member States.
The work that should have been done was not done.
We do not receive the documents in proof that we ask for.
There is a problem about transparency in his management.
In these circumstances, I feel that it is part of my job to point out some of the basic principles of governance, especially when we are concerned with a request concerning funding from the Commission.
I acknowledge, therefore, what I did, but I never called for the dismissal of anybody and, in any case, I do not have the power to do so.
To sum up, I shall say that the package, in the negotiation, must be comprehensive and coherent.
Peter Mandelson negotiates the EPAs, and I have a supporting role.
We work in tandem, therefore.
My starting point is, of course, development and, more specifically, economic development as the driving force for growth.
I would point out, moreover, that countries have agendas for the fight against poverty, which include this aspect.
The regions covered by economic integration agendas are asking us to support them, which we are doing.
This integration involves an aspect of commercial liberalisation between them; we support this, and the EPAs support this demand for regional integration.
I can see that some of your fears are justified, but I can assure you, as far as I am concerned at least, that the development aspect will be a priority.
It is on this aspect that the negotiations will focus, and the support measures will have to make possible, according to the pace that these countries are capable of maintaining, an upgrading that should give them, in the long run, much easier access not only to regional integrated markets but also to the world market.
In conclusion, I understand all your misgivings and anxieties.
I am prepared â and I think that this is really very important â to have an exchange of views with you, including about all the supporting measures.
I am looking for all the creativity of which you are capable and I am completely open on these questions, without any preconceptions.
In any case, I assure you that I am more than ready to continue to look for the best possible solutions for supporting developing countries within the context of the EPAs.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on European political parties (2005/2224(INI)) (A6-0042/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on the financing of the European political parties that we adopted in 2004, has been a resounding success.
The separation between Parliament and its political groups on the one hand and the political parties on the other has been a success.
This was something that the Court of Auditors had been demanding for many years, a demand that this regulation responded to.
In the meantime, 10 party families have registered; they also receive support from the relevant budget line.
This demonstrates that political culture at European level is still diverse and thriving.
To have 10 party families is quite an achievement â before there were only four, so their number has more than doubled.
Our experience with the financing of the political parties has been good.
Nevertheless, there is a short wish list enumerated in the new report, wishes for planning certainty and wishes for flexibility in the way the European parties function.
There is also the desire that the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau should, at the beginning of the parliamentary term, create planning certainty for that entire parliamentary term.
This does not make the annual budget that we adopt superfluous, but I believe that it would be advisable to ensure that this budget line is preserved and can develop in line with enlargement or an increase in the number of political parties.
The parties do have their own resources: donations and membership subscriptions.
It cannot of course be the intention of the EU funding regulations that these own resources should be forfeited if they are not spent within the same year.
That is why I am grateful that in Strasbourg we have already complied with one requirement found in the report, that is to say that the parties should be able to use up to 25% of their own resources to build up reserves.
It is after all their own money and the EU funding regulations should not place disproportionate restrictions on the parties.
Another wish, however, is that it should also be possible to carry forward up to 25% of contributions into the first quarter of the following year.
Politics is an unpredictable business and in the case of unforeseeable events it must be possible to spend a certain amount in the next quarter, so that the parties do not have to embark on an end-of-year spending spree in December.
The report also includes some other proposals.
I would, however, now like to move on to the second stage that we are introducing with this report.
We need a genuine European party statute.
It is not acceptable for the European parties to have to register themselves in accordance with and be governed by the law prevailing in a Member State.
All the parties are in favour of identical rights and obligations applying in all the Member States, and that is only possible if there is a single statute.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is willing to lead the way here.
Madam Vice-President, I would be delighted if the Commission took our proposal on board and used its right of initiative to bring forward a new legislative proposal.
The second idea that we should give expression to is the importance of cross-border political communication.
In many countries political foundations exist for that purpose.
We believe that political foundations should also be created at European level.
In this area too we are calling on the Commission to bring forward either a legislative proposal or a budgetary proposal.
We should consider whether in future European elections there should not also be European lists, so that our citizens would virtually have two votes: one for the national or regional list and one for a common European list for the parties, because only with a list of that kind would a common electoral campaign be possible.
At present we have 25 different election campaigns during the European elections, and European lists would bring them together.
In conclusion, I would like to mention the youth wings of the parties.
Our young people represent our future.
We need to pay special attention to promoting political youth organisations and movements, which represent the future of the parties, and the parties are part of the democratic process.
The report take us a significant step further forward.
I would like to thank the secretaries-general of the parties and also Parliament's administration for their effective management of resources.
I would also like to thank the secretaries-general for the excellent proposals which have been incorporated into this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Leinen for this important report, which provides a good opportunity to both look back at what has been accomplished in the area of European political parties and what could be done in the future.
It was only three years ago, in 2003, that the regulation governing the political parties at European level was adopted by this House and the Council, on the basis of a proposal put forward by the Commission.
The institutions were thus translating into practice the objective set by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the new legal basis offered by the Treaty of Nice.
As the European Community Treaty acknowledges, political parties at European level are an important factor for integration within the Union.
They contribute to forming a European awareness, to expressing the political will of the citizens and to promoting political debate at European level.
It is a fact that since the entry into force of the regulation, ten European political parties at European level have been established.
We could take this as an indication that the European public sphere is being gradually built, where citizens can expect their voices to be increasingly heard by the institutions.
I have great sympathy for this, as it is also one of the thoughts in our White Paper on communication.
We need a European political culture and we need help to promote that.
However, there is still a long way to go to connect the European project and the European institutions to the citizens.
Again, this is one of the key issues that the Commission addresses in the White Paper on European communication policy.
I am convinced that not only governments and parliaments, but also political parties and public bodies have to place the issue of Europe at the forefront of public consciousness.
We should also reflect on the low turnout for European elections and jointly look into ways of increasing voter participation, as the Commission has already proposed in Plan D. It is not always easy to see exactly how we could play that role, but I think the institutions would have a common interest in ensuring that there is also a high voter turnout and high participation in the discussion on these elections.
Mr Leinenâs report emphasises that political parties have to work for citizensâ involvement, not only through European elections but in all other aspects of European political life.
We fully share this view.
There are a number of important issues that are raised in paragraph 12 of the report.
They concern the role of the European Foundation.
As Mr Leinen mentioned, this concerns the role that European parties can play in European referenda and the enhancement of youth organisations.
The Commission would welcome a broad and in-depth discussion of these issues.
They are all part of our gradual move towards the real European public sphere.
Again, we have a great deal of sympathy for these proposals.
Political parties are an essential part of the democratic structure of the Union and it is therefore appropriate that they receive some support from the Community budget.
We take note of the suggestions advanced in the report as regards injecting more flexibility into the public funding system.
Many of the ideas outlined in the report could be made concrete by an adjustment of the internal rules supplied by Parliament.
As regards other suggestions, which would imply amendments of the regulation covering European political parties or of the Financial Regulation, we have to look at those in a broader context.
You will notice the careful language that I am using on this point.
As you know, we are currently revising the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules.
We should assess the situation in the light of this exercise, as, again, one has to balance the need to look at other financing, or at NGOs for example, with a view to finding the best tools to improve the current situation.
Finally, we take note with interest of the idea underlined in paragraph 4 of the report, namely that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should consider the question of a European statute for European political parties, which could go further than the existing regulation.
Among the ideas that the committee should consider is the possibility of better defining rights and obligations for the European parties.
The Commission will certainly follow with interest and attention the work which will be carried out by the parliamentary committee in this area.
I would like to express here my personal commitment to this important reflection.
I repeat that this is fully in line with our ideas in the White Paper.
This has to do with creating a European political public sphere where we can have debate and where the political parties will play a very important role.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I represent my honourable colleague MrÂ LÃ³pez-IstÃºriz White, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I shall make a few comments on that opinion on his behalf and on behalf of my group.
I agree with the view of the main rapporteur, MrÂ Leinen, that the existing statute must certainly be regarded in principle as a total success and that it was entirely right and proper for us to make a clear distinction between party funding and the financing of parliamentary groups.
We also owed it to the public to make that amendment.
Political parties help to form the will of the people â in the European context, we should say âof the peoplesâ â and that is why it is essential that the European institutions should establish the prerequisites and create the conditions for the proper functioning of these European parties.
In this context, there are four things to which I attach particular importance.
Firstly, it is essential to create a sustainable permanent financial framework that enables parties to obtain long-term funding.
The grants that are currently paid to the European parties do not provide an adequate basis for truly sustainable long-term planning of activities.
Plans are tied at the present time to calendar years within the electoral term.
Changes in party funding can also occur if new parties are created and the volume of funding then has to be adjusted.
I am simply saying that the existing provisions do not let parties plan ahead with a sufficient degree of financial security and that, in these circumstances, changes are eminently desirable.
Secondly, we must allow European parties to create financial reserves that are not lost from one year to the next.
MrÂ Leinen likewise addressed this subject, which also featured in our deliberations in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
His reference to the notorious December rush hit the nail on the head.
We want sustainable long-term planning of party funding; we do not want a situation in which, in the run-up to Christmas, so to speak, money is splashed about because of the pressure to âuse it or lose itâ.
In this context, it is also worth considering whether the 20% limit for transfers from one budgetary item to another should be rethought with a view to making it more flexible.
European parties must have the freedom to respond to changing requirements that might stem, for example, from a crisis in the political arena by restructuring their resources more radically than the present statute permits.
Fourthly, against this background I believe that the statute for European political parties should be amended to enable the European parties to act more effectively for the benefit of the entire population and to perform their role as driving forces in the process of political decision-making.
At the same time, however, I cannot deny that the parties could do more by their own efforts to achieve this aim of bringing Europe closer to the people and involving its citizens in what is happening here in Europe.
I personally do not believe that a European list of candidates, parallel to the national lists, would be a means of solving this problem.
Party lists are an abstract concept, and seats are allocated to particular parties, and many people cannot identify with that.
What we need is a far more personalised European electoral process, and there is a very simple way of doing that: if at least the two mass parties in Europe could each decide to campaign in the European elections with a chosen leader who would subsequently be their candidate for election as President of the Commission, the elections would become strongly personalised within a fairly short time, and people would identify far more closely with individual candidates and with political statements of intent, which alone could probably lead to a considerable increase in turnout at European elections.
I hope that the political parties will have the courage to take this step.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, too, rejoice in the way in which this report makes it possible for us to take a significant step further towards the consolidation of the European political party.
The fact is that I do believe that, if we really do want to develop a real European parliamentary democracy, truly European political parties will play an important part in it.
The resolution adopted several years ago in favour of funding parties quite separately from the groups strikes me as a very important step in this direction.
It will not necessarily, however, play well with the public, who do not believe that it is necessary.
I believe, though, that we are obliged to describe political parties as being, in a sound parliamentary democracy, an important link between the public and the decision-making process and that this is not to be had for free.
To put it another way, we must have the courage to tell the outside world that there is a price to be paid for democracy, that there is nothing abnormal about this, and that it is better that funding should be transparent and from public sources rather than through all manner of dark channels.
As I have already said, an important step in this area was taken a number of years ago.
I believe that the time has come to make a few improvements, the most structurally important aspect of which will be, without a doubt, that the political parties can plan ahead over greater periods of time instead of having to work with one-year budgets and without any certainty as to what is going to happen the year after that.
There are also two significant technical amendments, which have to do with the flexibility of managing the budget.
I now want, in a sense, to misuse this platform to point out that the problem of the carrying-over to a subsequent year of anything on the credit side accumulated in a given year is not one faced by political parties alone.
This rule appears to have crept into the set of rules generally imposed by the Commission.
I have the same problem to contend with as chairman of the management council of the College of Europe, which is also required to spend money in a given year, or else a problem results and the upshot is poor management.
It is better that there should be more flexibility in this respect, just as we are here proposing for political parties.
I would like to bring to the Commissionerâs attention the fact that this problem does not exist only in political parties.
This appears to be a general rule that the Commission applies even though it is an obstacle to good management and has been thought up by accountants, whose thinking I do not follow very well.
I also want to stress, by way of conclusion, that we can now, together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, do a considerable amount of important work towards a proper statute for political parties, which will include â disadvantageous though it may be to the state coffers of my own country â a fiscal statute that ties in better with the fiscal statute for the European institutions, so that it is made perfectly clear that the political parties are part of that specific management level and that they are integral parts of Europeâs institutional framework.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor in what seems, at this stage in the evening, more like an open meeting of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, with some other Members very welcome to join us.
My group supports the report that has been put forward by our rapporteur, the Chairman of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
As we have heard, it concerns adjustments to the system that we adopted over a year ago now.
These adjustments are necessary because of the teething problems that we have discovered in operating the system.
They are sensible and pragmatic and I would urge the Commission â for that parts of the report which are addressed to the Commission, such as those pertaining to the Financial Regulation â to take them up.
Political parties are not NGOs, they are fulfilling a different role and they are vital for the functioning of our democratic system.
What we have set up and what we are hoping to improve is a system where we have â and the public can see that we have â a clear, transparent and fair system for funding the European level of work of political parties.
This is something that recent events have shown is not always the case at national level.
We should be proud that we are putting in place a sound structure at European level to finance the work of European political parties.
It is important that we do so, because what political parties offer is choice to the voter, different visions, different programmes, different ideas, different proposals.
It is that choice which gives life to political debate at European level.
It does one more thing: it shows that the choices we face at European level are really choices of policy, not choices between national viewpoints and national visions.
All too often, the press, in focusing on European Council meetings, gives the impression of some gladiatorial combat between national interests.
But the real choices we face are policy choices.
Do you want higher environmental standards but at a greater cost or not?
Do you want our markets to be a totally liberal free-for-all or to be regulated with protection for vulnerable people?
These are all political decisions, political choices that are highlighted by political parties; they are often hidden away in the Council.
That is essential for our Union to work effectively.
We already have ten parties registering.
That shows that this system is working.
There were some who claimed that this would only be financing the big parties.
Well, some would say that ten parties is a very wide range of parties being financed.
There were those who are not here tonight â including Mr Hannan from the PPE-DE Group â who said that this was going to finance only pro-European parties, as if there were a rule that we could bias the funding towards a particular political viewpoint.
This of course is not the case.
What we have seen and achieved and what we hope to improve is a sound system, one that is necessary and one that will enhance the quality of democratic debate at European level.
Â Â  . Mr President, at this stage of European development â which some would describe as a âlack of European developmentâ â the significance of this report cannot be over-emphasised.
The fact is that it is not just about political parties, and I think that is the good thing about it and about what the rapporteur is trying to do.
He could indeed have said that, yes, there are ten political parties: he could have a look at how they work and what we do with them.
But no: he opted for a much broader philosophical approach, and I think he was right to do so, for it has everything to do with the European political area that the Commissioner himself highlighted.
After all, what is it that we constantly hear, not only during election campaigns but also in the interim?
We hear people asking, âWhat is this European parliament thing for, when there is no European political area?â
They are right: there is not one.
There is no such thing as European public opinion.
It does not exist; it is not even possible.
Nor will it be if people do their utmost to ensure that no such European political area ever comes into being, of the kind that we need if there is to be European political debate without regard to frontiers.
Let us take a look at the situation as it stands now.
There are twenty-five commissioners, chosen primarily on the basis of their nationality.
The Council is, of course, composed on the basis of nationalities.
Not even this Parliament is elected through a European election, but through 25 national ones, which approximately coincide in time, but are not precisely one.
You will not, of course, end up with a European political area that way.
It is that European political area that we will indeed be in need of if we are ever to see an elected President of the Commission, whether he is to be elected by this House or, as I would prefer, by the European electorate.
It is that that will usher in a cross-border, European political debate.
Or, if there is to be a European referendum, then let there be, instead of 25 national referenda, one single European referendum, for example on whether to have a new constitution or stick with the old one.
What I am in favour of is, in one way or another, giving European elections a European element, at least to some extent.
Then you will have a European political debate, for which a European political area which be needed â as, too, will political parties, if you want a representative democracy, which we do, because we want politicians such as ourselves to be monitored, and the only way they will be is if you have strong political parties, certainly stronger than they are at present.
They will then have to be well run, and that means that their specific financial needs will have to be met.
I am glad that this report gives consideration to this, for example by creating the flexibility to carry over funds from one year to the next.
At the European level, political parties operate to a five-year cycle, rather than from one year to the next.
It is of course worthy of note that other NGOs are now very tightly regulated, in ways that some of them find highly inconvenient, and perhaps we ought to take a look at them too.
With that in mind, Mr Dehaene put it very well when he said that there is nothing crazy about giving to others too the flexibility that we want our political parties to enjoy.
Let me turn, finally, to the call for a single statute.
This is something of which I am very much in favour, and on that point too, I am at one with the rapporteur.
We need to give serious consideration to European foundations, and I would prefer to opt for party political ones; I think the German system is the most civilised in the world in this regard and if we were to be able to have the same thing at European level, we would be able to count ourselves rich.
I also â and, yes, I really am finishing now â ask you to bear in mind the amendments tabled in the name of my group by MrÂ Guardans, on participation by women in political parties.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, as Parliament, we have amply contributed to creating this baby that is the European political parties.
Now, however, perhaps we need to feed it in order to help it to grow stronger.
The Leinen report is, in this respect, very important, as it highlights all the imperfections still present in this offspring that we are bringing to be baptised.
A European political party is, first of all, a political party.
Is it conceivable, ladies and gentlemen, for a party to exist without taking part in elections?
That is why MrÂ Leinenâs comment is so important: the European political parties should be able to take part as such in European elections.
The only way that they can take part in elections is by having, one day, at last, a part of our Parliament elected transnationally.
Only then would the parties be understood in practical terms by our citizens.
They would also be understood by our citizens if it were possible for individuals to be members.
I know that some parties allow it, but not all, and I think that it would be a good way of giving our citizens more involvement.
I am a little more sceptical about the proposal from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the statute go so far as to include provisions on the organisation of party congresses and the nomination of candidates.
Regarding individual membership, however, I think that is something that we ought to pursue, just as we should pursue the fact that these parties have to be subject to Community law.
It is somewhat absurd to see that these parties are sometimes non-profit making associations, although I have every respect for non-profit making organisations.
I believe that Community law must support the emergence of these new legal bodies.
Where the budget is concerned, the proposed distribution over three months at the end of the year is also very important.
I believe that some political parties have already found themselves in a tight corner in December with money unused, and it was up to whoever had the best idea to spend this money in a rush, to make a few pens, a few tee-shirts; in short, things that were not at all in the immediate interest of the political party in question.
Hence, a ruling that makes it possible to spread the surplus over several months is a rule of good stewardship that we should support.
The last point is that the European parties are young parties, but not yet parties for young people.
I think that we shall have to make an effort at this level to find a proper legal framework and the funding necessary to enable European political organisations for young people to join in this great debate.
I have made a few amendments to that effect.
Nevertheless, in general terms, this is an excellent report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Madam Vice-President, as a member of the Party of the European Left, which was founded in MayÂ 2004, I firmly believe that, as the integration process advances, European political parties can play an important part in ensuring that our continent continues to converge and, above all, that a sense of European identity is able to develop more and more across all our countries.
Political parties are certainly not the only players in our democracy, and they are far from being the best players, but they are a key element, and so the inclusion of a clause on the role of political parties in the âdemocratic life of the Unionâ title of the Constitutional Treaty.
Unlike the other European political parties, the Party of the European Left is a young European party.
To a certain extent, therefore, it is still engaged in the process of its own development as a party.
But if I reflect on the heated debates of recent times, and particularly the debate on the crucial issue of the Services Directive, I must conclude that it has demonstrated its readiness and ability to act and has established a profile of its own.
Paragraph 12 of the report calls on all political parties to discuss specific ways in which they can play a more active role in public debates on the future of the European Union, and that is something I wholeheartedly endorse.
The current pause for reflection on the European constitution must not degenerate into a break from reflection.
