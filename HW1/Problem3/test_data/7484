Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the appalling figure of 42,000 deaths a year on the roads of the European Union, the estimated 1.7 million injuries, are a constant reminder that we must give top priority to the issue of road safety.
These figures do not only represent immense personal suffering, they also mean enormous economic losses and costs.
These are estimated at EUR 100 billion, accounting for some 2% of the gross domestic product of all the European Member States.
That is more than all the European Union Member States put together spend on culture.
I want to give warm thanks to the rapporteur and I especially welcome the fact that she has concentrated on three priority areas: accident prevention, injury prevention and post-impact care and rehabilitation.
In my view that makes it clear that road safety cannot be improved to the required level by individual, selective measures but only by a whole raft of measures, which include road user education, speed limits, alcohol limits, better road infrastructure, traffic control systems, improved vehicle safety standards, stricter checks on observance of road traffic rules and also constant assessment of vehicles on the roads.
That is why I find it extremely regrettable that the amendment on harmonising the re-registration of cars that have been involved in accidents in the European Union was not adopted, although independent reports clearly demonstrate that there is a substantial link between vehicles that have been in an accident once and their renewed involvement in accidents with an ensuing higher death toll.
I just want to address the previous speaker for a moment.
You know I tabled an amendment concerned in particular with the question of motorcyclists and safety barriers, and I would be glad if you and your group could endorse it tomorrow, since I myself am a motorcyclist and am therefore obviously very familiar with this problem.
Mr President, I can only support the Commission in not presenting a Community regulation on blood alcohol content.
My colleagues are holding a sham debate, a totally sham debate.
The socialists and our group decided jointly a year ago, when the proposals from the previous period were taken up again, that we do not want Community legislation here.
The point we make is this: we want checks.
That is the crucial question, not what the law says.
It is crucial to have on-the-spot checks.
Here I can only reply to my UK colleague: if your police carried out checks over Christmas, it would take these people off the roads and prevent the accidents.
So I can only repeat that the crucial factor is to check the blood alcohol level rather than to issue a Community regulation.
That is why we will reject the first part of Amendment No 4.
If it is nevertheless carried, my group will reject Mrs Petersen's entire resolution, because it is hypocritical to call for Community legislation when there is no need whatsoever for it.
Talk to your countries.
Most countries agree with the common view of this House that 0.5 parts per thousand is quite adequate, as the Commission rightly said.
That is what we recommended to all these countries.
The people you should talk to, Mr Watts, are those who do not apply that.
So it is not a question of a sham debate or of what the law says; the police must carry out-on-the spot checks and pick out all the drunken drivers.
That will give us the greatest road safety.
Secondly, we will not accept Amendment No 6 either, with which the Greens are once again trying to start another sham debate, namely on a general speed limit of 120 km/h. We already have speed limits on most European roads.
In my country we have speed limits on 95% of all roads.
Where do the accidents happen?
On the 95% of roads, because there are not enough speed checks there either.
So, fewer laws and more checks will do more for road safety.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a known fact that, if death from radioactive weapons is due to human insensitivity, then deaths from road traffic accidents are due mainly to human stupidity.
And it not only behoves an organised state not to be stupid in its own acts and omissions; it must also protect its citizens from the consequences of their own stupidity.
It is as part of this endeavour that the excellent report by our fellow member, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on the Commission communication on the priorities in road safety defines the way forward.
Action is needed on three fronts: first, by taking legislative, regulatory action, secondly, by promoting new technologies in vehicles and in the road infrastructure and, thirdly, by taking administrative action and running an information campaign.
Of course, if we take care to ensure that any measures taken receive widespread support, then they will be even more effective and if, at the same time, we draw on the experiences of the Member States in these areas, then we shall be sure to strike a happy medium.
For example, everyone could agree to a drastic reduction in alcohol levels for certain categories of drivers, such as those carrying dangerous loads.
In addition, modern technology can and should be used in order to put the measures decided into practice and to control the application of current provisions.
And, of course, we should mobilise local society and regional bodies and ensure that they are more closely involved in road safety issues by addressing the people directly. At the same time, the information campaign must, of course, continue to run, using cleverer ways of getting through to the public, especially young people.
Likewise, it might be worth examining the possibility of rewarding the safest vehicles through the road tax system and demanding minimum safety specifications depending on the type of road, so that road design and construction can be integrated into programmes subsidised by the European Union.
Finally, we call on the Commission not to "race" through cases such as today's.
That is what road safety needs.
Mr President, the frequency of road accidents is so tragic and so underestimated as to justify the adoption of all possible initiatives as soon as possible at all levels of government and on all aspects of the matter, including human behaviour, the infrastructure and vehicles.
The only selection criteria we need - although I fear this will be difficult, given the nature of the debate thus far - is to identify the operations which would be most effective precisely because they are simple to implement.
I believe that the areas of human behaviour and infrastructures are those in which we can expect the quickest results: for example, the results of making it mandatory to wear a helmet and seat belts were remarkable in Italy.
Motorcyclist deaths have fallen by 45% across all the age groups since it was made mandatory to wear a helmet last year.
I am aware that measures such as making it compulsory to wear seat belts and helmets can be difficult to enforce, to implement, and that if they are not implemented then they are meaningless, merely words on paper.
However, this does not mean that we should disregard the drink-driving issue, and I would therefore not be against slightly higher common blood alcohol limits, even though Italy might lose out slightly.
Mr President, we shall be voting in favour of the report on priorities in EU road safety, as it includes a number of practical measures which may reduce, at least slightly, the number of deaths in road accidents.
It is deplorable that road accidents represent the most common cause of death amongst children and adults under 45 years.
However, although most of the measures are positive, they target motorists alone, thus absolving car manufacturers as well as the government, and society in general, of any responsibility.
What is the point of measures, binding or otherwise, to encourage motorists to keep their speed down, when car manufacturers not only produce cars that greatly exceed speed limits but even make this a selling point?
What is the point of calling upon motorists to be careful and to reduce the time they spend at the wheel, when, in the quest for profit, the road haulage industry and large retail and industrial companies force lorry drivers to drive until they are extremely tired?
What is the point of lamenting the fact that road traffic accounts for 95% of accidents involving all forms of transport - there is hence no possible comparison with trains or aircraft - if every government' s policy is to encourage road transport, openly or implicitly, over all other types of transport, for both the public and freight.
Even in Europe' s richest countries, public transport is underdeveloped and many people use their cars not through choice but out of necessity, due to a lack of adequate public transport.
In the race for profit and zero stock, large companies are forced to see road transport as part of their production line and this transforms some motorways into a long, almost endless chain of lorries.
Even on the limited question of truck-on-train technology, what happens in actual practice is the opposite of the official line.
On a more general note, a sensible approach to transport would require a sensible approach to manufacturing, an approach, in other words, that does not place profit above all else.
This, however, is a far cry from the laughable measures proposed by the Commission and by this report.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I checked the statistics while preparing this short intervention and I was shocked to discover that, statistically at least, more than 55 people have been killed on the roads of the European Union since we convened this morning.
The European Union loses 4 people an hour.
Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of death among children and young people.
Every year, we lose a university or large school full of young people no less, because 15,000 young people die on our roads every year.
Add to that the fact that I personally have the unhappy privilege of coming from the Member State with the second highest number of fatal accidents in Europe.
And what is more, Greece is the only country in Europe in which, unfortunately, there has been no downward trend over the last ten years.
Entire families are being sacrificed on the asphalt alter.
Road safety can, and must, be a top priority both for the whole of Europe and for each individual country, which is why I shall support the proposal made by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, whom I should like to congratulate on her report, that we need strategic planning for road safety and we need to set a series of strict but realistic numerical targets.
This will attract citizens' attention and provide an effective focal point.
We, ladies and gentlemen, have a huge responsibility both here and in Brussels.
It is, for example, unfortunate that no legislative proposal has been submitted on the compulsory adoption of the four types of test designed to make car fronts safer for pedestrians, a research programme which, it should be noted, the European Union has been funding for the past 22 years.
In addition, further support for the European programme to evaluate novice drivers, support for strategies to promote the use of seat belts, the development of telematics systems, the mandatory fitting of daytime running lights to motorbikes and cars and other proposals in the report could benefit road safety and public health enormously at relatively little cost.
Mrs De Palacio, I am sure that you are familiar with part of your communication which highlights a disturbing disparity between the different Member States in the quality and safety of roads and number of victims claimed.
Unfortunately, this disparity closely mirrors the difference in the quality and speed of economic growth of the Member States of the European Union: the safest country is Sweden and the least safe countries are Greece and Portugal.
What does this mean?
I will attempt to answer this question as positively as possible: it means we cannot invest in safety without investing in Community action.
I feel that Parliament, with a few legitimate exceptions, is calling for greater courage from the Commission, and I would therefore like to thank the honourable Member for her report, which makes the Commission's communication totally clear and more effective.
More courage - to get straight to the point - means two things: firstly an undertaking to specify limits and rules in our prevention policy, or - without wishing to offend Mr Jarzembowski - any control will be useless.
If we are going to control the speed at which people drive, it does make quite a difference whether the limit we set is 100 or 200 kilometres per hour.
The same applies to drinking.
We feel that the Commission should present a directive setting the maximum blood alcohol limit at 0.5 parts per thousand for all the Member States.
I say this as a citizen of a country which has established a higher limit precisely in order to forestall any accusation of self-interest in our argument.
The principle of subsidiarity is all very well - although I feel that it would be grossly inappropriate to take away the licences of all drunk drivers - but the problem is working out at what point a driver is to be considered drunk according to our highway code.
Commissioner, I feel that employing this sort of courage is the simplest and most effective, but also the only way of achieving the ambitious objective we have set ourselves of reducing the number of victims claimed by the roads of the European Union by 40% over the next few years.
Mr President, let me thank the rapporteur for the great commitment she has shown in this matter.
Last year, nearly 43,000 people were killed on the road networks of the EU.
One of the main reasons for this was the use of alcohol.
There is no getting away from this fact.
Six years in the European Parliament have given me great respect for the fact that we have tremendously differing views on many issues, but we should all agree that alcohol and driving never go together.
Despite this, people are killed every day on the road networks of the EU because of this precise combination.
We can also entertain very different opinions as to whether we should have common rules within the EU or whether each country should solve this problem on its own.
Allow me to point out two things for those who are in two minds about this issue.
My first point is that no EU country would find it acceptable if another Member State tolerated a situation in which a train driver, an airline pilot flying an aeroplane with 300 passengers on board or a sea captain responsible for the safety of 1000 people or were to drink alcohol before he or she assumed responsibility for his or her passengers.
Why is it, then, that we do not impose the same requirement on those who drive on our roads?
The other point I want to make is that 95% of fatal traffic accidents actually take place on the roads.
All I want is that we should take the problem of these 95% as seriously as we do the problem of the 5% of accidents which occur in connection with the other types of transport.
That is precisely why I consider the report to be an ideal basis for our future work on this issue, which is also why I am going to vote in favour of it tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, safety on Europe's roads is a vital matter and the figures speak for themselves: 42 000 deaths a year and 1.7 million people injured.
Something has to be done about this.
We must seek to make our roads safer.
There is very great suffering among those who lose a family member as a result of a car accident.
Our society is becoming increasingly mobile, and I am in favour of it.
But that is precisely why it is our duty to tackle the risks.
Here, we as politicians must assume our responsibility towards society at European, as also at national and regional level, and call for better and more adequate road traffic measures.
The analysis of road accidents is decisive.
The way to compile accident statistics therefore includes recording, processing and interpreting accident data.
A systematic examination of what happens on the roads can provide important data to help ensure greater safety and prevent accidents.
The construction method of transport modes, as also road design and people themselves, are weak points.
We must identify and seek where possible to remedy them.
I see this as a most important aspect.
And here I think road user education is essential.
We must raise people's awareness of the dangers and risks involved in road use, as the precondition for their acceptance of measures.
Even children, a specially high-risk group of road users, must be taught through play how to behave on the roads.
Young people must be informed of the risks they and other road users face once they have obtained their driving licence.
One point is especially close to my heart: measures against drink driving but also against the use of medicines and drugs when driving.
Many measures have already been taken to combat drink driving, including many awareness-raising measures.
Yet people often do not realise that taking drugs and medicines can cloud their minds and affect their driving just as much.
The EU road safety programme aims to define the main priorities clearly.
Above all, we need to take a systematic approach to these problems.
It is vital to call for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, road accidents are the most frequent cause of death and serious injury among children and young people, in fact generally among EU citizens under the age of 45.
We must no longer accept this as a stroke of fate but must do something about it.
The condition, however, is that we stop believing that road safety depends primarily on how well road users behave or remain in control of themselves.
Apart from setting out a clear obligation, Articles 41 and 94 of the EC Treaty also provide us with the legal basis which some Members of this House doubt for a great number of effective measures to improve road user safety.
It is up to us finally to attach adequate political priority to this issue.
In fact, there is perhaps hardly any policy area in which the common responsibility of the EU, the Member States, regional and local authorities and the appropriate organisations is recognised so clearly.
Subsidiarity is, therefore, particularly applicable here.
That is precisely why we should not underestimate the added value of EU measures versus Member State efforts.
Calculations of the economic costs of traffic accidents show that they are considerably higher than the costs of preventing traffic accidents.
So that justifies the call for increased financial resources even in times of economic austerity.
But beware, let us make no mistake.
It is not always the case that the more money we put in, the higher the level of safety we can achieve.
This can be demonstrated by information campaigns on best practice in the EU states and binding measures to reduce the causes of accidents, such as alcohol, drug-taking and the use of medicines, as also a directive on expanding safety tests which will make the car industry take a more creative approach and promoting the European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP).
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on her excellent report and urge you to endorse it.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is interesting to listen to this discussion and it will be interesting to continue working on the issue of road traffic safety in Parliament after this discussion and after our decision tomorrow.
I am told that the majority of the political groups consider a regulation at European level on alcoholic content to be preferable, since this is an exclusive competence which we can utilise by virtue of the Treaty.
I agree with Mr Stenmarck when he says - and this is made plain by the previous discussion - that we should never accept safety levels that are lower than those which it is possible to bring about.
However, this is something we do accept when it comes to roads but which, of course, we do not where aviation is concerned.
In my opinion, it is important to have such a regulation at European level where alcohol is concerned.
Mr Jarzembowski presented some interesting views but, unlike Mr Jarzembowski, I think that we should utilise the opportunity of issuing a directive as well as introducing police controls and other alternatives.
We need to utilise all opportunities, and that is what we shall do.
We have not said no to a directive before.
Now, we have the chance of taking a political initiative, so let us do so.
Turning now, Mr Bautista, to the issue of black spots, which was raised by the Greens, I believe that it is important for us to keep an eye on what happens.
It would be interesting to see a report on the situation out there in the Union.
I am well aware of the fact that this is an important issue for cyclists and motorcyclists.
Finally, there is the matter of education and the situation of children.
Just as Mrs Schierhuber said, we need to have road safety education.
We must utilise this opportunity, together with all the other measures at national, local, regional, and European level.
We must make vigorous joint efforts to this end.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Hedkvist Petersen wholeheartedly on the very thorough motion for a resolution which she has prepared on road safety. This demonstrates the European Parliament' s interest - which we have seen today in your speeches - in creating an ambitious policy for combating the scourge of traffic accidents.
I would also like to express my gratitude to all of you who have spoken, who have given voice to your opinions and who have enriched this debate.
In response to the European Parliament' s request, I would remind you that last March the Commission presented a communication on road safety which listed a series of concrete measures to be implemented over the next few years, specifically the last two years of implementation of the second action programme on road safety.
I would like to stress that, in general, I am in complete agreement with the contents of the report and also with what the resolution itself says, both with regard to the action programme under way, whose implementation will soon be completed, and with regard to the future road safety programme which the Commission intends to present in the next few months.
I also wish the European Union to have an effective and lasting policy for reducing the number of accidents, which is currently completely unacceptable.
In the first stage we will have to implement the final priority measures established within the framework of the road safety programme, which is currently under way and, in particular, propose that the obligation to install speed-limiting devices be applicable to a greater number of lorries, specifically by lowering the tonnage above which such a measure is required.
Furthermore, we will have to promote the exchange of information on black spots and the techniques for reducing them and, in general, to increase the safety of road infrastructures and adopt measures to improve the car fronts in the event of collision with vulnerable users of the road network.
These road improvements must include a different design for current crash barriers, which are enormously unfriendly to cyclists and motorcyclists.
The second stage must include the adoption of a more systematic approach with regard to the future action programme, for which we must establish quantifiable objectives on a European scale, which will be drawn up with the cooperation of the Member States, in order to achieve greater efficiency and complementarity between the measures adopted in Brussels and those established on a national level.
Because it is clear that the establishment of specific objectives - as we have seen in those countries which have adopted them - provides a stimulus and has the effect of a psychological incentive on the authorities, which leads to them exercising better control and therefore to a reduction in accidents.
Nevertheless, I do not intend today to deal with the aspects on which we agree - you know these from the communication - but I would like to expand a little more on the reasons for the two points of disagreement.
The first is drink-driving.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are absolutely right.
Yesterday or the day before, the written procedure on the recommendation for 0.5 to be the maximum limit for alcohol in the blood was finally adopted by the Commission.
The date is purely coincidental.
It was in the communication in March.
You must not believe that there has been any manoeuvring by anyone.
I thought that this was at a more advanced stage.
I am sorry.
Please do not imagine that the date has been in any way chosen to coincide with this debate.
But I would like to explain why no proposal for a directive is being presented.
This is not being done for two fundamental reasons.
Firstly, I must say that the United Kingdom, one of the countries where the alcohol limit is greater than the 0.5 which we recommend -as Mr Watts mentioned a moment ago - is the country with the second lowest number of accidents in the European Union after Sweden.
If Great Britain had a limit of 0.2 instead of 0.8 it would probably be the country with the lowest number rather than the second lowest and would have far fewer accidents.
I do not know.
What I mean to point out is that it is a fact, an objective fact, that Great Britain, with a limit of 0.8, is the country with the second lowest number of accidents in the Union.
I am not recommending 0.8 but 0.5. It is not enough to recommend or to lay down that an alcohol limit be respected if the national authorities then fail to adequately control the reality of that alcohol content in drivers' blood.
I would like to say to you that if some Member States do not currently control the alcohol content in blood, I doubt that we will have better results just because we have reduced it to 0.5.
What we need is better control on the part of the authorities.
Secondly, there are customs, habits and reasons why I feel that this is the classic type of issue which should be left to subsidiarity, and that is why we are only recommending the level of 0.5.
I know that you have a different opinion - I have seen it - and, of course, the truth is that, furthermore, there has not so far been a sufficient majority in the Council to move forward with an initiative of this type.
If, suddenly, all the Member States agree, it will be very easy for them, amongst other things, to implement a level of 0.5 in their countries.
Do not tell me that the United Kingdom wants a European directive to resolve a problem in Great Britain because I would not believe it.
Then let them implement 0.5 in the United Kingdom.
Why do we have to force them to do so?
If the United Kingdom wants to do it and we already have a recommendation, let them comply with it.
With regard to car fronts, I clearly heard Mr Watts' s criticism that the Commission prefers to speak and not to act.
I cannot accept that criticism.
The Commission wishes to act in the most effective way and, sometimes, delaying an initiative for a few months can, in reality, be a much quicker way to ensure that it is implemented.
And we have given the automobile industries six months to reach an agreement.
They do not have until 2002, Mr Watts, but until June 2001.
In this respect, I would like to tell you that this initiative is not only my responsibility but it is also the responsibility of the Commissioner for Industry, Mr Liikanen, and that is what we agreed.
In saying this I wish to point out that we have by no means rejected the idea of creating a regulation in relation to front sections of cars which are more respectful when it comes to accidents involving people - unprotected bodies - but that we simply wish to be even more effective by gaining the support of the automobile sector.
With regard to the future action programme for 2002-2010, we are a priori open to all the ideas included in the motion for a resolution.
I am even prepared to reconsider the issue of the level of 0.5.
I am not going to maintain rigid positions on this issue.
I do not believe that that is the main problem.
The problem of control is much more important.
In any event, I am counting on your cooperation, your help and your support, and I congratulate the rapporteur once again.
Mr President, my name was mentioned.
It is important for the record to clarify the situation in the UK relating to the UK Government's view on blood alcohol.
I am sure that the DG on Transport and Energy has a copy of the UK's road safety strategy that was published in March 2000.
It makes it very clear that the new government in the United Kingdom is committed to a solution within a European context.
I believe you would now find a much more positive response to a proposal for a directive than perhaps was the case with the previous administration.
Mr President, on a point of order.
If I have understood my colleague correctly, then it is enough to have a recommendation that the UK Government will lower the blood-alcohol level.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Intermodality and intermodal freight transport
The next item is the report (A5-0358/2000) by Mrs Poli Bortone, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee on the progress of the implementation of the action programme of the communication on intermodality and intermodal freight transport in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will refrain from defining intermodality, adopting the definition which the Commission itself has used in the past instead.
However, the operations supporting intermodality are becoming ever more urgent for a number of reasons: the need to rationalise traffic and optimise transportation times, and economic and environmental requirements, for intermodality is a key element in sustainable mobility.
As matters stand, intermodality poses a series of drawbacks stemming from the lack of integration between the various modes of transport, together with deficiencies peculiar to some of these modes.
The development of intermodality hinges primarily upon the level of efficiency provided by the rail services on offer, which unfortunately, in many Member States, rate poorly in terms of quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
Moreover, as the Commission has pointed out on several occasions, the development of infrastructure continues to focus on unimodal systems, whereas intermodal transport requires a network-based approach focusing on complementarity and connections between the various modes.
Lastly, open intermodal information systems able to manage intermodal transport and network services efficiently and to guarantee a rational and constant real-time information and message flow have yet to be put in place.
A specific analysis of the friction costs allied to intermodal freight transport reveals that the main drawbacks compared to traditional unimodal transport can be identified as high costs, longer time frames, inferior quality, higher risks of damage to goods, restrictions as to the types of goods that can be transported, and more complex administrative procedures.
These friction costs can be attributed first and foremost to the absence of coherent system networks and connections linking the latter, leading to a loss of efficiency and an increase in transfer costs.
Furthermore, the differing profitability and service quality levels amongst the various modes of transport do not sit easily alongside notions of customer satisfaction and real-time goods transfers.
The culprit is the absence of broad electronic message systems linking different partners in the intermodal chain and the lack of an identification and information system for goods organised on an intermodal basis.
Lastly, the entire system is dogged by a series of bottlenecks stemming from the absence of harmonised time frames and timetables amongst the various modes of transport, as a result of which the needs of the freight transport chain do not correspond to the operational demands of the resources employed in the process. By way of illustration, the working hours of drivers and crews do not tally with intermodal operations, and terminals are not always able to accommodate round-the-clock train and shipping timetables.
Clearly, the intermodal transport framework in Europe varies somewhat, with totally contrasting circumstances apparent in the various Member States.
Hence the need to accord priority to the monitoring of the different circumstances, with the support of the Transport Intermodality Task Force, with a view to singling out specific lines of action designed to address emerging priorities in individual Member States.
The aims which the EU intends to pursue through the development of intermodality relate to the need to establish an integrated system comprising the various transport modes which offers seamless, customer-tailored door-to-door services, makes for efficient and cost-effective use of the transport system and promotes competition between operators.
In its communication on intermodality and intermodal freight transport in the European Union, the Commission highlighted the objectives to be pursued in the intermodal transport sector and divided them into priority areas for action, known as "key actions": infrastructure and integrated means of transport, interoperable and interconnected traffic operations, and services and regulations common to all transport modes.
The objective is to establish an information system providing for real-time transport management, as well as the use of electronic transactions in transport, by means of the development of real-time electronic information and transaction systems, the harmonisation of transport message, procedure and document standards using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems, a uniform liability regime designed to offer the end user a clear set of transparent conditions and procedures with regard to liability for cargos which may be damaged or lost during transportation, the development of information society technologies of benefit to intermodal transport, through the creation of an open structure which makes it possible to follow the movement of goods along the entire intermodal chain, and paperless transport, involving the harmonisation of document regulations and the creation of a single electronic window.
The Commission has also planned a series of horizontal measures, using research and technological development projects to introduce innovation aimed at utilising new technologies to develop innovative services and increase productivity.
Clearly, a discussion on intermodality requires, at the same time, a sharp cultural change in the culture of enterprise.
The globalisation and liberalisation of the markets are already producing a substantial increase in the demand for the transportation of goods and commodities.
The high growth rates are inducing competition which will increasingly affect the volumes transported and, therefore, mergers and other forms of association between operators in the sector will be absolutely inevitable.
Finally, I would like to thank the Members who contributed actively to the preparation of a resolution acceptable to the majority of the committee.
I should also like to inform you that, as far as the few amendments tabled are concerned, I essentially endorse all of them, with the exception of Amendment No 3, with regard to which I am somewhat perplexed by the reference to State aid.
Mr President, intermodality is still in its infancy.
Not even 8% of our freight is transported by several different modes of transport.
Yet the distances travelled on average have been increasing since as early as 1970, a trend which favours the use of more than one mode of transport.
Freight is growing out of all proportion too, and is expected to increase by 70% over the next ten years.
It is surprising that there is no breakthrough in intermodal transport in the offing.
Perhaps the pressure on the transporters and the shippers is not yet so great as to bring about this breakthrough.
But that being the case, a few warnings are in order for the relevant sectors.
Firstly, the road network will not be able to cope with the 70% increase, not in the urban or regional distribution, and not in terms of long distance transport either.
To depend exclusively on road transport must therefore be deemed a sin of reckless faith, which used to be a mortal sin.
Secondly, environmental considerations will play an increasingly important part over the next ten years.
Driving a lorry through certain parts of Europe will meet with increasing opposition.
The people will put up increasingly stubborn resistance to transport violations of their environment.
We have already seen this in the failure of the directive that sought to harmonise bans on weekend driving.
So there is no question of our being able to opt for intermodality. We are being forced into it.
Now if you take that as your point of departure, none of this is really going to make any headway.
Of course the sectors must apply themselves more effectively, and come up with some more innovative ideas, but then the government must get down to work too, and simplify and streamline procedures, for example.
The trans-European water networks must be brought to fruition quickly and as a matter of priority.
Everyone talks about rail transport, but water transport - where there really is still room for growth - no longer seems to feature at all in the European or national lists of priorities.
No one coordinates the efforts undertaken by each individual State, when that is surely one of the essential tasks of the European Commission.
It is a pity because road transport, in combination with inland navigation could make a substantial difference in north and northeast Europe.
But before we reach that point, numerous obstacles still have to be cleared away in terms of legislation, matters of a technical and practical nature.
Incidentally, the same applies to the ancient practice of coastal navigation, which has long allowed itself to be elbowed out, but is now making a powerful comeback under the modern name of short sea shipping, providing everyone pulls together at any rate.
If we look at the advances that have been made since the excellent action programme of 1997, then we see a number of positive aspects, for example the task force transport intermodality.
The extension of the PACT programme, pilot actions in combined transport, will also spur matters on.
In view of the fact that the Union is to undergo enlargement and acquire some new members before long, we must take account of the new situation during the accession negotiations even now.
But unfortunately, intermodal transport is still too expensive anyway.
This is down to shortcomings in the field of infrastructure, inefficiency in the field of management and information, and innovations that do not make the grade.
All the same, we must develop a trans-European transport network in the form of a multi-modal infrastructure network, and the business community and government must join forces at all levels in the process.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in transport policy we still do not pay intermodal transport the attention it deserves.
Hitherto, in fact, only 8% of European freight transport is intermodal, as my colleague just said.
That is why this kind of transport is often not taken seriously enough yet.
But intermodal goods transport is both the expression and the measure of the European integration strategy, which seeks to integrate not only the individual, national transport markets but also the various transport modes.
Following the liberalisation strategy that is not quite completed yet and the harmonisation that has begun, the single market needs this integration strategy if it is to have a viable future.
That is why the reports on the progress in implementing the action programme for intermodal transport also reflects the progress made in European transport policy.
The communication from the Commission and the report have raised many, indeed all the important issues: the reviews of the trans-European networks aimed at establishing a genuinely intermodal network, measures to create value-added logistical systems, the measures that are still needed to harmonise load units and so forth, genuinely intermodal information, standardised transport messages and documents, the development of a uniform intermodal liability regime and many others.
Here, as we all know, we need a whole range of regulatory, political measures to ensure that intermodal transport really has a viable future.
Because the framework conditions are so complex and because the development of intermodal transport is still far from being a self-sustaining process, we need a great number of successful pilot projects.
So I hope we will get a well-funded new PACT programme, that will be usable by the candidate countries even at this stage, for it is there that many of the decisions are taken that concern our future.
The signals are not all set wrong there yet.
I also hope that we will give intermodal transport due importance in the Sixth Framework Research Programme.
In our view, in future pilot projects should look more at strategic aspects, i.e. at linking up the existing intermodal part-networks.
Another aspect that has not really been addressed is this: perhaps we could look into the conditions for creating new European, intermodal operators.
For we do not yet have any real operators in this area.
Perhaps, theoretically at least, and as a kind of precedent, an international company could manage Alpine transit transport on an intermodal basis.
Of course we are also in favour of the European Reference Centre for Intermodalism that keeps being announced and hope it will soon become a reality.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.
Our group is in favour of adopting the report with its amendments.
At present intermodality is expensive owing to friction costs, inefficiency, frameworks of infrastructure, and partly also because road transport tends to be favoured.
The report and the Commission communication propose many actions worthy of support that would increase the volume of intermodal transport.
New technology must be utilised effectively, for example in increasing ebusiness, so that the most suitable route and services can be obtained for various situations.
I would also like to point out that this form of transport is the most efficient system for long journeys.
In the development of transport facilities, priority must be given to remote regions and areas which are seriously deprived in terms of the trans-European networks.
The improvement of collection and distribution systems in congested areas is crucial.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank both the Commission and our rapporteur for their work on this issue.
We have already said a great deal on this subject, and so I shall keep this very brief.
We have been able to ascertain that a modal shift has taken place in recent years, although the manner in which, and the extent to which, this has taken place has been very low-key to date.
We want to give this trend a huge boost.
That being the case, it is important that the modalities themselves, specifically rail, internal and coastal navigation, are booming and that political freedoms have been granted too, in the form of liberalisation, interoperability and a number of other things which the sector can use to seize its opportunities.
Yet we would also like to increase the number of opportunities available to SMEs, in particular, although this sometimes entails financial assistance.
That is precisely why we have tabled an amendment for forms of state aid to SMEs, also for environmental purposes.
Incidentally, I am not in agreement with the advantage enjoyed by the Galileo project in these matters, but that is something we should discuss on another occasion.
I would point out that the alarming increase in transport, also as a result of e-commerce, means that unfortunately, intermodal transport is just a drop in the ocean at the moment, but will have to make headway in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, road safety, intermodality, the costs of transport infrastructure: my perspective on these issues, placed one after the other on today's agenda, is that of one who is concerned with the problems of mountainous areas, particularly the Alps.
The subject of road safety brings to mind the Mont Blanc tunnel tragedy, which is an example of the need for European coordination guaranteeing safety in both operative tunnels and those under construction.
Then there is the matter of intermodality across the Alps, where, apart from the Swiss decision to invest heavily in rail transport, there are serious delays in the construction of the other links and the other new rail tunnels already provided for by Community documents, such as those along the Turin-Lyons-Brenner link, or under discussion, such as the Aosta-Martigny tunnel.
Clearly, if the wise sayings "Whoever breaks it pays for it" or "Polluter pays" crop up in a discussion on the cost of the roads, then, apart from anything else, there needs to be fewer heavy goods vehicles and more rail transport in the Alpine region in future.
In the short-term, there needs to be severe restriction of the number of goods vehicles passing through the region, including the Mont Blanc Tunnel when it reopens at the end of this year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Poli Bortone for this ambitious and constructive report, and for her speech, which offer great support for the activities of the Commission in this field.
I would also like to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate today.
The Commission agrees that an efficient intermodal transport system for goods is crucial to the Union and the candidate countries and, of course, it is essential if we want to guarantee mobility in the coming years.
I believe that the efficiency of an enlarged single market, the competitiveness of our industries and the sustainable development of the Union depend on this.
The Commission will evaluate the intermodal transport infrastructures in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in order thereby to facilitate the revision of the guidelines for the Trans-European Transport Network.
The European Reference Centre for intermodal transport, with its headquarters in Strasbourg, will be operational this year and will be soliciting the information which the intermodal industry needs and which may help in the creation of new policies.
The Commission intends to continue supporting intermodal transport, through research in the framework programmes for technological research and development and also by extending and enlarging the pilot actions for combined transport (the PACTs).
As the report indicates, we will have to invest in the necessary infrastructure and its management.
In this respect, there are various speakers - Mr Caveri, for example - who call for the great transport axes which are already in the TENs to be developed.
We wish to study the use of current budgetary resources, reconsidering their use, in order to promote the large-scale assimilation of intermodal transport by industry.
I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I hope, given the degree of adjustment and development, that we are now on the finishing touches.
With regard to the White Paper on the common transport policy, as well as the delivery of the revised Trans-European Networks, which I have promised you, I hope that the Commission will be able to definitively approve a text on that issue over the next few weeks.
Intermodal transport is one of the key elements in it.
We are at an important stage in the development of intermodal transport, since we have to move on from promoting pilot actions and projects to ensuring that industry incorporates them in a generalised sense.
The work that we have undertaken has confirmed that the knowledge, systems and technologies exist in Europe to carry out this type of activity, which facilitates the safe and durable transport of goods.
The charging policies that we are going to present will support the competitiveness of intermodal transport.
Finally, I would like to say that I am in complete agreement with the proposals to develop compatible electronic systems, made by different speakers, amongst others the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann and Mr Pohjamo.
These compatible electronic systems must specifically support intermodal transport: these support instruments are a prerequisite for achieving efficient European transport, which has a good cost-efficiency ratio and which respects the environment.
I am also very happy with the agreement between Parliament and the Commission on this issue and I can assure you that the services of the TREN Directorate-General will continue to play an active role in the promotion of intermodal transport.
I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur and all the speakers and I hope I will continue being able to count on your work and cooperation on this subject, when it comes to discussing the White Paper on transport.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Charging for the use of transport infrastructure
The next item is the report (A5-0345/2000) by Mr Costa Paolo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on transport infrastructure charging.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to present this own-initiative report, drawn up by the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with the aim of bringing about progress in an area which I hope our work will help you to understand better.
As you know, it derived from a 1995 Commission Green Paper, which called for measures to internalise the external costs incurred by environmental, safety and congestion considerations, in order to bring about a fairer and more efficient system of charging users for access to transport infrastructure.
Basically, the report calls upon the Commission to intervene by harmonising the definitions of internal and external costs, harmonising or identifying charge calculation methodologies, and then, of course, leaving the implementation of these measures to subsidiarity and the decisions to be taken by the Member States.
In my opinion, in essence, the report ensures that the recommendation to apply the "polluter pays" principle is included in the wider principle of "user pays".
This is its contribution, and it has two consequences which I wish to emphasise now. The first is that if the methodology which we hope the Commission will decide upon and we will be able to endorse enables us to produce a clearer definition of the internal and external costs and a clearer system for charging users, we will create the conditions to be able to transfer the financing of infrastructure from purely public resources and general taxation to the users as such.
We can therefore now picture the enormous effort before Europe - the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow - in the process of constructing new infrastructure, the effort of involving private capital in this operation as well, which would not be possible if we do not succeed in identifying this situation.
The next step is to consider that, where the attribution of some of these costs is meaningless, as, for example, in the case of the Italian motorways, which have already fully achieved their payback - the revenue from these charges which exist today could constitute funds to be used in cross-subsidies, in order to ensure that certain costs charged to road users serve to improve infrastructure in other modes of transport which are certainly more environmentally friendly.
I would stress that this whole system, which transfers the financial burden from the State to the user, must have a safeguard, and that is the last principle, according to which those who have the most difficult circumstances because they are disabled or because they live in rural or remote areas where access is difficult, can in some way be exempted, and a series of subsidies, including State subsidies, can therefore be developed to compensate for this.
Our objective in producing this report is to draw together certain fundamental principles which I have already mentioned: the "user pays" principle, the "polluter pays" principle and the principle of cross-subsidisation etc. together. How can we do this?
The methodological suggestion given here is that a series of good practices exist now in Europe, which we have attempted to explore and put together in a seminary whose papers we will make available to anyone one who wishes to study the issue in more depth and which we have financed with the help of the Commission.
Well then, these practices can now, in my opinion, be generalised and made available to everyone.
This would make it possible - and I feel that the time is now ripe - to obtain operative indications for advancing European policy in this direction in practical terms.
. (DE) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Costa, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give high praise to the rapporteur for his success in achieving a broad consensus with his report, after we have spent years in this House hotly debating the right way to charge for transport infrastructure costs.
Commissioner, Vice-President, I hope that after the vote tomorrow you will peruse all the drafts for the White Paper on transport policy again and check whether they follow the same lines as proposed by this House.
After all, normally the Commission's proposals always take account of the Member States' views, and perhaps in future they will also take more account of Parliament's views.
I believe that the Costa report offers an opportunity to re-think some of the habits the various departments have grown so fond of.
I also hope that we do not mix up the subject matter of the White Paper with the subject of the trans-European networks.
We are about to review the trans-European networks; these are both important subjects.
To present them to Parliament as a single package would, in my view, be extremely unwise since they are in fact separate subjects.
Allow me to make just a few comments on the Costa report.
Amendment No 1 makes it quite clear that we want use-based transport charging, which can be verified on the basis of the construction, expansion and improvement costs.
That is the first issue.
So there are two aims of which we must not lose sight when we harmonise these transport infrastructure charges.
Firstly, we must finally achieve a single market in this area.
For when you think that we still have enormous distortions of competition because of divergent fiscal and other charges between the Member States, a whole 8-9 years after the completion of the single market on 31 December 1992, then the question of equal competition is bound to arise.
Secondly, we really all think that after the meteoric rises in oil prices over the past year, in whatever way we want to convert and achieve a more fair and environmentally compatible system, the total charge for undertakings must not rise.
We do not want any forcing up of prices.
Last point: in relation to external costs I have two requests.
Firstly, about three years ago, Parliament decided in toto to work out on a scientific basis what the external costs actually are.
How can they be calculated and how can they be charged?
We never received that report.
Secondly, we must differentiate when we calculate these external costs.
To give just one example: congestion costs.
It would be absurd to charge an undertaking for the fact that the drivers are stuck in a tail-back because the Member States have not expanded the roads, so that the undertaking not only has higher petrol and working costs but also has to pay additional charges to the Member State responsible for the congestion.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his excellent work on what is a very difficult, detailed but important dossier.
Congestion, pollution, gridlock, global warming, floods, freak weather.
Is it the end of the world?
No, it is just rush-hour in my region.
The same problems are occurring in regions and Member States across the European Union.
We all have the same transport crisis and there may be common solutions to these common problems.
We must all accept the fact, for example, that the fastest growing source of global warming gases is the transport sector.
Something surely, colleagues, must be done.
However, as we all know, everyone wants someone else to do it.
That is our challenge.
I hope Mr Costa's work, his report and the conclusions we will reach tomorrow will provide a framework within which we can begin to tackle these problems.
We must promote better understanding of our common problems and, indeed, find common solutions to them across the European Union, but on the basis of consensus and mutual understanding.
Secondly, we must promote an exchange of ideas.
Many localities and regions have excellent ideas, and that knowledge and information must be disseminated throughout the European Union.
Indeed, that is my third point: Europe has a key role to play here in disseminating best practice as to how best we tackle the transport challenge.
Fourthly and finally, in terms of what Europe's contribution can be within the framework of this particular initiative, I hope that governments, local authorities and those implementing taxes and charges can do so within a framework that is developed and integrated at a European level, and do it together.
However, I want to say that there is great concern and anxiety about this particular Commission initiative and, indeed, about Mr Costa's report, although I personally feel that many of those concerns were fully addressed in committee where, I know, there was widespread cross-party support for Mr Costa's work.
There were concerns, for example, about subsidiarity.
But that was more than adequately addressed when we said to the Commission: you have a key role to play in trying to pull this research together.
But, clearly, Member States and their role will be fully respected in terms of their rights to determine their own taxation levels.
Indeed, the work we have done has already gained and secured widespread support.
I can refer to a letter from the organisation that represents the motoring clubs across Europe, including, for example, the AA and RAC, who are broadly sympathetic and supportive of our work, because they know that unless Europe takes a lead on this issue, unless we begin pulling together the best of the ideas from across the European Union, then the cities, towns and rural areas, will continue to suffer from unacceptable levels of congestion and pollution.
I commend Mr Costa's report, his work and, above all, his ability to bring us all together in a single common objective of trying to tackle the transport crisis.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his most excellent work.
I would also like to say thank you for the interesting debate on the subject with some illuminating examples.
I think it is important that the issue is now being dealt with by Parliament.
The main principle of the report is quite right, that users should pay for the transport infrastructure and its maintenance costs.
Charges for the use of the transport infrastructure must take account of the costs to society, but also the ability-to-pay principle and the need to support remote areas.
The importance of charging for the use of the transport infrastructure will increase as a means of controlling the situation in the future.
The system of charges must be flexible and dynamic, so that it would offer incentives for the introduction of new technical services.
As there are plans, however, for a combination of fares and taxes, we have to take care that we are not simply left with a system of taxation.
There are still a lot of problems attached to a system of charges.
Covering overall costs with fares will work in areas where there is a lot of transport.
Conditions vary regionally, however, to a significant extent, so the same bases for charges cannot apply everywhere.
Long distances, scattered populations and difficult natural conditions must be taken account of when the instruments in respect of charges are determined, just as the report states.
In my opinion, it is important that we look into the possible impact of the scheme before charging becomes a reality.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who did, when all is said and done, put in a huge amount of work, having started by following the activities of the high-level working group on this subject, because it is an own-initiative report.
Ultimately, we were left with a report that we would have preferred, at the very least, to send out a different signal to the Commission, in particular.
In fact we expect more from the Commission than the signal sent out by what, in a sense, remains of the Costa report.
Allow me to explain as follows - it will also speak of a certain amount of exasperation.
Every so often, I cherish the hope that we will be sufficiently clever to gain insight into a certain period and do what we have to with it.
I have already anticipated for quite some time that fair pricing would be a rational, intelligent debate and would deliver measures.
When I see how long it all takes, that is when I start losing patience.
If I can draw something of a comparison between the way in which the discussion on the changes in the agricultural policy is now taking place against the backdrop of the problems surrounding food safety - in Germany, among a number of other countries, my own included - then I predict than something similar will happen where the transport policy is concerned, and the environmental problems we are now experiencing, irrespective of the failed climate conferences, etc.
I am also exasperated at the fact that almost everyone still hides behind all kinds of issues to do with our supposed inability to establish the cost scientifically.
We can do it for accidents all right, but not for other things.
I have a problem with this.
Again, there is more than enough data for us to make headway with this whole affair.
I therefore hope concrete measures - of the kind, incidentally, that first featured in Mr Costa' s report and a number of which we quite deliberately re-submitted - will be included in the actual White Paper. Not that we expect everyone to go along with them, but the primary intention is to send out a signal to the Commission to attempt, in the meantime, to coordinate, if not harmonise, these measures - which will include a kilometre levy and so on - at European level, so as to avoid a situation where one country does take action and another does not.
One country will say that none of this is scientifically feasible, while another will simply get on with implementation, which is a most curious state of affairs of course.
That is why we have put a number of subjects back on the table and we hope that some of them make it through.
Apart from that, I wish everyone luck at the drafting stage.
Mr President, I would also like to join Members in recognising the considerable work that has been carried out by the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have incorporated many amendments.
I would, however, like to come back to some points I think worth emphasising to make the report as effective as possible.
First of all, I feel it is imperative to point out that the main thing is to promote the sustainability of transport, which is a fundamental, long-term measure needed to protect our environment and avoid congestion.
On this issue, I do not believe that it is possible to consider freight transport on the same level as private transport.
The former is currently widely favoured as an economic activity, whereas the latter allows freedom of movement, a fundamental freedom.
We must extend the quality choice range in the variety of transport available.
That should then drive us to consider the need to improve services of general interest in these sectors that are so important to the people and to the economy.
Secondly, I also believe that we need to pinpoint priority issues.
We cannot consider rail users and road users on the same level either.
This means that the cost of road use is added to the total of costs borne by society such as environmental costs and the costs of accidents.
All studies have clearly shown this.
We must give this factor priority in terms of Community action.
To sum up, with regard to changes in charging, I believe that this type of charging should not further increase costs, particularly those paid by users.
Any infrastructure charging system, like the one proposed in my group' s amendment, should improve the services of general interest, which some transport services provide, in order to offer all citizens equal access to high-quality, safe and affordable services.
Mr President, Commissioner, it may be common knowledge that our group is not convinced of the need for all the current competences. However, these go unchallenged in the sphere of the European transport policy.
Yet this cross-border problem demands a cross-border solution.
That is something we are all agreed on in this House.
That is why I am surprised that opinion is so divided on this.
After all, we have agreed that we must strive for a sustainable transport policy, which allows for mobility both now and in the future.
Seen from this perspective, it is necessary for users of different forms of transport to foot the bill for the costs they incur, in order, in this way, to be able to repair the damage caused or prevent it from happening.
This concerns both the internal costs of the infrastructure and the external costs, which are less easy to convert and allocate.
In the present resolution, the emphasis is very much on the internal costs, which can be quantified very precisely at this stage.
Although these costs form a substantial part of the total costs incurred, it is wrong to suppose that this means the total costs are known.
The lack of complete knowledge concerning the magnitude of a particular cost item is not a legitimate reason for excluding this item from the methodology to be devised.
I can fully identify with Mr Bouwman' s amendments on this point, as I could with his contribution.
I would agree with those of you who have doubts, that passing on all costs incurred must not leave transport operators with such narrow margins as will put their livelihoods at risk.
In order to avoid this, however, we must not attempt to keep transport prices as low as possible, thereby keeping the costs to be passed on as low as possible, but what we must do instead is offer the transport operators legal support with a view to passing the costs incurred onto the group that should by rights foot the bill, namely the end-users.
Finally, I would point out that the optimum situation from the competition viewpoint is when there is a level playing field for all transport modes.
However, that must not be our sole point of departure.
In our efforts to secure sustainable mobility, we must concentrate specifically on those forms of transport which do society and the environment the least damage.
Supporting the development of such modes of transport may not be ideal from the competition perspective but is completely justifiable, also politically, given the goal to be achieved.
You will appreciate that I am unable to vote in favour of the present resolution as it stands.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to start by thanking the rapporteur both for the enormous amount of work he has done and also, in particular, for his willingness to accept the suggestions, amendments and proposals of all the rest of the committee, to the point that I feel this report can be said to be a highly collegial report produced by the committee as a whole.
Moreover, the current situation is clear - the White Paper and the Green Paper illustrated it perfectly: there is a great problem because of the environmental and social costs we have to bear and because of the attack on free trade that the difference in taxes and taxation systems in our countries imposes upon their economic systems.
With this report, therefore, we have identified a possible situation, a road to take, and it is now up to the Commission to take it.
I recall the benchmarks that we all share: greater proportionality with regard to use in the distribution of costs, attentiveness to social costs, but also protection of disadvantaged geographical areas and sectors of the population, "yes" to environmental sustainability but, at the same time, reconfirmation of the right to mobility as a universal right.
The only recommendation I would venture to make, Commissioner, is that all this is good, particularly the shift to the "user pays" principle, but with the reservation that we cannot allow this principle to penalise the citizens or businesses.
Shifting to the "user pays" principle means entering into the rationale of providing a service for which a price is set, and we must therefore guarantee the citizens and businesses what they want and what they are willing to pay for: namely quality.
Quality in the context of transport, in my opinion, means above all safety, accessibility and coordination of infrastructures.
If we can provide this, then, at the same time, we will have overcome our present difficulties and set the wheels in motion for a new perspective for the future.
Mr President, I would like to add to the praise for Mr Costa, the rapporteur, because this is an extremely difficult subject and there are very conflicting opinions.
Furthermore, he has had many amendments to work through.
When all is said and done, I believe that the text presented is clear and consistent - no mean feat.
I think that this contribution by the European Parliament will enable the Commission to make good progress in its subsequent work.
The issue of infrastructure charging is perhaps one of the most difficult for the general public to understand, but it is perhaps also the key to achieving our objective of a sustainable freedom of movement, given that the number of people travelling and the amount of freight transported within the Union is expected to increase considerably.
Today, we know that road travel produces the most pollution but that it is also cheaper in terms of both infrastructure financing, which is often funded by the community, and in terms of its use.
Therefore, if we really wish to travel without causing so much damage to the environment, we will certainly need to establish charging; that is, how the various types of transport pay the real price of costs.
All the same, I believe that we must be very aware that the rail system is not and will not for many years be in a position to compete to a great extent with road transport, in particular in terms of freight transport or combined transport links, which are urgent priorities.
There are still considerable infrastructure costs and infrastructure and investment needs, and rail companies' profits do not provide enough to cover them.
Compared to road tolls, those on the railways are still too high with a concomitant strain on operating costs.
The issue of charging is therefore absolutely central to this matter and if we really wish to improve transport we need to be in a position to absorb efficiently the external costs of transport; as mentioned; in other words, so that road transport actually pays for all the costs it entails, as does rail transport, and so that the prices charged accurately reflect this transparency regarding costs.
We should not, however, close our eyes to one political stumbling block in all this.
The political stumbling block is that our fellow citizens want to travel.
They believe that they have the right to freedom of movement, something I think we should bear in mind, and very often they do not differentiate freight transport and the private car.
This was obvious last September.
Therefore, on a political level, we must take a cautious approach, which should be both gradual and selective.
A gradual approach means that we cannot impose extra costs on road travel until the railway is in a position to take over from it, and for the time being the railway is not in any such position.
A selective approach is needed, because I believe that we have to distinguish between private transport and goods transport and that we may also have to gradually introduce taxes on heavy goods vehicles, if we really wish to improve pollution in regions like ours, that act as crossroads.
Mr President, we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU raising taxes or imposing a new tax over and above the existing national taxes.
It is an attempt to find a common set of criteria, of cost components for the transport infrastructure, and minimising substantial discrepancies across the EU.
However, it is up to the Member States to set and levy charges, albeit in a common framework.
At present, revenue is not earmarked for transport infrastructure.
Quite often, I know in the UK, it is used for bolstering government coffers.
I am sure it is the same in other EU Member States.
Transport costs should be paid by the user, but governments should not charge rural users if there is no public transport, and this report makes that very clear.
This report is about a level playing field: not to charge more but to charge more efficiently.
Hauliers in the UK complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage, and that is true.
Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax.
Other EU countries' average is ten times lower HTV taxes.
The same applies to diesel fuel: it is three times more expensive in the UK.
That leads to distortion of competition across the EU.
Instead of the UK Eurosceptics criticising this report, they should welcome it because it will do a lot to help our hard-pressed hauliers.
Mr President, I have not yet reached the point that a number of people whom I have heard speak this evening have reached.
As matters stand, infrastructure investments are made in waterways and other transport modes, for example.
Nobody knows exactly how much is invested.
On the other hand, the state receives revenue from transport, such as road tax.
Nobody knows precisely how much this amounts to, but one thing we do know is that it is not directly re-invested in roads and other forms of infrastructure.
This report addresses the balance between revenue and expenditure; intangible costs such as environmental and noise-related costs are also taken into account.
Some people also want to recoup the cost of traffic jams from those who get stuck in them, according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
I think this is an excellent principle and I would like to see it applied in full, but not to traffic jams.
Traffic jams are indicative of failed government policy on the infrastructure front, which is why the government itself, certainly in the Netherlands, must be regarded as the polluter.
This report talks about balancing the payment of social costs between the different modes of transport.
Let us take a moment to consider the train in this light.
Road transport always seemed to cause far more pollution than rail transport.
Following research, this seems not to be the case.
Now the question is: what are we actually seeking to achieve by making social costs visible in this way?
Do we really want an objective, rational assessment of the costs of the transport modes, or, if certain results do not meet with our approval, for example if rail transport becomes prohibitively expensive as a result, will we end up making a political assessment?
We want people to travel by train and so it must be made more affordable.
That is fine by me, but not by using this method.
We are not going to tax water and road transport heavily first on the basis of the theoretical model, and then spare the train.
Road and passenger traffic already pay far more than their share in terms of social costs.
So either we stop beating about the bush, so that everyone knows what they can be for or against, or we operate a well-balanced and proportional system with guarantees for the disabled, people who live in rural areas and have no choices, and the competition position of the Union.
Commissioner, I must say, this is a hornet' s nest you have got yourself into.
Why should a system of this kind only be applied to the transport sector?
Why should it not be applied to aluminium factories, hospitals, ski runs, hypermarkets, parliament buildings and high-voltage networks too?
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, but I would like to point out that he deserves congratulations not for his psychological capacity to unite wills, but for having included certain factors in the report which allow us all to be united.
I would like to highlight two of these factors, the ones which lead me to support the rest of his proposals.
The first is that the report, "stresses that such methodology needs a gradual and step-wise implementation based on transparency and sufficient information."
The second factor which leads me to approve this report is the subsidiarity issue, because, undoubtedly, Mr Costa' s report makes it absolutely clear - he has said this with complete transparency - that there is going to be an increase in the cost for users, as the cost of funding by the States is going to be passed on to users.
We cannot ignore that fact.
We therefore need this gradual implementation, which seems to me to be absolutely essential because, when we speak of tariffs in relation to internal and external costs, in the fullest sense of the word, which is currently difficult to define, we are talking about an increase in cost for the user.
Therefore, in fact, we are talking about favouring rail transport.
I believe that this is one of the bases which justify the imposition of tariffs.
The fact is that road transport - automobiles - have a clear and very serious environmental impact, so much so that they alone are replacing, and therefore increasing, what all the other industrial sectors are saving in terms of greenhouse gases.
The time has therefore come to tame the automobile.
Nobody wants to be deprived of an automobile, but we must tame it.
On the one hand, by means of research, aimed at reducing consumption.
On the other hand, however, we must also influence drivers.
It is clear that these tariffs are going to produce an increase in the cost to users so that they might consider the possibility of using public transport and the possibility of making more rational use of the railways - both for goods and for passenger transport.
I believe that this is the key factor, which truly justifies the Commission and Mr Costa' s proposed imposition of tariffs.
That is why we are going to support him but, of course, this gradual implementation seems to me to be fundamental to the consumer being able to accept and take this process on board.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Costa on his handling of this difficult dossier.
It is an intractable subject and the fact that there are 126 amendments shows how divided opinion is, but at least it has led to a more realistic position.
Broadly speaking, I would, in theory, agree with the report that we need to have a more accurate idea of the marginal social costs of transport.
However, in practice, it would appear that such measures would be attended by unexpected and unintended effects.
That is why a great deal more research will need to be done before the prices can be calculated correctly.
I do not see eye to eye with Mr Bouwman on that score.
One of the undesirable effects is that the cost to roads will rise by a relatively small amount, around 10 to 15%.
This contrasts with the 100% rise in the cost to rail, and the 50% rise in the cost to internal navigation.
The desired modal shift will come under review again then.
My second concern is that the cost to transport will rise by a substantial amount.
That would be to the detriment of Europe' s economic position.
Finally, I do not go along with the rapporteur' s proposal to depart from the 'user pays' principle, in that he wants to grant extra assistance to remote regions, for example.
Firstly we must consider in real terms whether this would lead to distortion of competition and an increase in the total costs.
I am against cross-subsidies for the same reason.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the Costa report the discussion about a common framework for levying transport infrastructure charges has got going again.
If we want a single market that works, we need a transport system that works, in which the conditions of competition are equal or at least comparable for all those involved in transport.
The gradual harmonisation of transport infrastructure charges is the most important step towards that.
The way we agree to calculate costs is certainly important to the maintenance, operation and new development of infrastructure whether full costs or marginal costs, social marginal costs or social net costs.
But almost more important in terms of equal opportunities in competition is that we reach agreement, and do so as fast as possible.
Yet we must remember one thing. If we want to see fair competition between the various transport modes too then we need to go on discussing the implementation of the external costs.
To prevent that discussion also means preventing the integration of the various modes of transport and is therefore no more than lobbying, or a policy of lobbying for the status quo.
I will fight out the question of who is holding sham debates in this House with Mr Jarzembowski elsewhere; at present I only have two minutes' speaking time.
For heavy goods transport we urgently need a Europe-wide, kilometre-based heavy goods charge; here we could also envisage reducing the motor vehicle taxes.
Many transport associations are themselves seeing it that way now.
Only if we charge transport costs on the "user pays" principle can we obtain a market-compatible instrument to tackle the emerging crisis in goods transport, for we all know about the next leaps in goods transport costs: rising costs as a result of enlargement eastward, of e-commerce, and that is on top of the rates of increase we have seen up to now.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Costa for his magnificent report and all the speakers for participating in this debate.
I am happy to be able to say that the Commission has received the report and its conclusions with great satisfaction.
I am aware of the great amount of work and the enormous effort that the rapporteur, Mr Costa, has put in to trying to achieve the greatest possible consensus, and for which he has been praised by Mr Jarzembowski and other speakers.
I would like to say that, with regard to such a sensitive and thorny issue as charging for infrastructures, it is a great achievement - and I stress this - to have almost squared the circle, because it is really difficult to reach a consensus on a proposal such as this.
This report is based on a series of seminars with the members of the Commission' s own high level group on charging for infrastructures and on an information conference on best practice in charging for infrastructures.
By this I mean that this is a well-worked, well-informed and studied document and we owe that firstly to Mr Costa and to the other speakers who have shown their great interest in such a thorny and difficult issue.
The report is therefore well-worked and makes a solid contribution to the understanding of the policy of charging for infrastructures as well as its application, a key issue in the orientation of transport policy and in making progress with a policy which guarantees lasting transport and mobility for the future and in dealing in a rational way with the extraordinary demand to which we are going to have to find a solution in the years to come.
The report also coincides with the Commission' s policy on charging for transport infrastructures.
The Commission believes that the lack of coordination in fiscal policies, the lack of coordination in Member States' charging, hinders the efficiency of transport operations and restricts the development of the single market and economic integration.
Whatever the treatment of the different means of transport, it imposes real costs on European companies and on society in general.
Consequently, the Commission has proposed the gradual implementation - and I am sorry that Mr Izquierdo has left, because he has not seen that not only has Mr Costa accepted that amendment, but that the Commission is happy that he has - of a harmonised framework for charging for infrastructures in the European Union which is applicable to all means of transport.
The Commission' s policy of charging for infrastructures provides a framework for the reform of charges and taxes on transport, with a view to reflecting environmental costs, infrastructure costs and the cost of managing demand for transport.
Progress has been made, as in the case of the approval in December of the measures on railway infrastructures through the conciliation procedure.
A great deal, however, remains to be done.
I am therefore pleased to be able to assure Parliament that the concerns highlighted in the report in relation to charging for infrastructures will be taken fully into account in the next Commission White Paper on the common transport policy, which I referred to previously and which, although somewhat later than the dates initially envisaged, will enable us to make progress in solving one the most complex problems of that transport policy: charging for infrastructures.
All of that will be possible thanks to the magnificent work of the Members of this Parliament and Mr Costa in particular.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday' s Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I must apologise, because this is not a comment on yesterday 's Minutes, but on the Minutes from the day before yesterday.
Unfortunately, I noticed too late that my name was not on the attendance register.
However, I was here the entire day and took part in all the roll-call votes and other votes.
I would be grateful if this could therefore be corrected.
Mr Posselt, of course the Minutes will be corrected to reflect the true situation.
Mr President, Mrs Maes is not present in the Chamber.
She is attending a Bureau meeting of our group.
But I noticed that she is not listed on yesterday' s attendance register. She was quite definitely there.
She spoke in the debate on the Swedish Presidency.
I would ask you to amend the attendance register accordingly.
That will certainly be done, Mr Staes.
(Parliament adopted the Minutes)
Mr President, on Monday afternoon, Parliament proposed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should look into the situation of the workers of the European corporation, Danone, threatened with the loss of 3000 jobs in the biscuit sector, 1700 of which are in France.
We do not know when the committee is going to meet to discuss this matter and it is very urgent as the European Board of Danone is going to meet tomorrow.
Today, the workers of this company, in France at least, are on strike.
I would like to hear your reply on the subject of this inquiry and, in the meantime, on behalf of myself and my fellow party members, I would like to express solidarity with these workers. It is appalling that a corporation worth millions should be able to drive thousands of workers throughout Europe into unemployment and poverty.
Mrs Laguiller, I would suggest that, given the importance and the nature of the matter, you speak to the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Rocard.
Mr President, I wonder if you have seen the exclusive report in today's edition of Le Figaro.
It contains an interview with a Corsican terrorist under the headline 'Armata corsa: menace terroriste sur Paris et Strasbourg.'
The terrorist belongs to the Armata Corsa organisation.
The interview appears on the front page of today's Le Figaro and says that the Armata Corsa is threatening direct strikes on Paris and Strasbourg if its demands, which include the release of prisoners, are not met.
The newspaper says that it has published the article in order to alert French public opinion to the immediate danger threatening it and it also states, by way of information, that emergency measures have been taken in Paris in order to deal with this immediate threat.
It says nothing about Strasbourg.
I should like to draw the bureau's attention to this major issue and ask if it knows anything about this and if it has made representations to the authorities in Strasbourg for additional measures to be taken to protect Parliament because it seems to me that anyone who so wishes can enter the Parliament building and I fear that we may have to deal with highly dangerous and unforeseen circumstances.
Mr Marinos, I wish to say, first of all, that I am grateful for your information, or at least for the fact that you have shared it with us.
There is a feeling in Parliament, which I think is shared by all Members, that the authorities governing this institution take account of and give great priority to the issue of security.
I therefore feel that everything necessary is either being done or being considered in order to guarantee the smooth functioning of this Chamber in Strasbourg or in Brussels in the most secure conditions possible.
In any event, thank you for your information.
Mr President, as rapporteur in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on preparations for the accession of the Czech Republic, I have a request to make of you.
It has come to our attention that a member of the Czech Parliament, Mr Ivan Pilip, has been arrested in Cuba.
He has evidently been accused of spying.
The truth is that he met civil rights campaigners and that his actions were quite normal for a member of a freely elected parliament.
Mr President, I urge you to arrange for a request to be made to the Cuban authorities for Mr Pilip and those accompanying him to be released immediately, because the Cuban regime does not have any moral grounds for giving lessons in democracy to members of a freely elected parliament.
I have all the more reason for asking you this given that in April this year a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is due to take place in Cuba.
How can one possibly justify holding a meeting of this kind in a country where members of parliament are arrested if they talk to civil rights campaigners?
Thank you very much, Mr SchrÃ¶der, I shall convey your information and your concern - which, I think we all share - to Mrs Fontaine, the President of this Parliament, who will certainly state Parliament' s position on this issue.
Mr President, I rise to request that the threats of terrorism against this House be taken seriously and that the Secretary-General draw up a plan to actually guarantee the safety of this House.
I shall repeat what I said a few moments ago: I believe that Parliament takes security issues extremely seriously, and we all feel that the circumstances in which we work and the fame of Parliament itself make it a target.
The competent authorities are therefore very attentive to this issue and to looking at measures to improve the situation so that we can work safely and in peace.
Mr President, also on the question of the security of the House, you will recall that on 28 November 2000, the Turkish Foreign Minister addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of this House and he was interrupted by demonstrators.
This was a cause for great concern.
At the time, we drew the attention of the President to this matter and she promised she would look into it and find out what the circumstances were, how the demonstrators had got into Parliament, and take appropriate steps to ensure that such things did not happen again.
In the context of what we have been discussing, the security of this House, I wonder if you would follow this up and see what steps have been taken to improve security and report on that particular incident last November.
Mr Van Orden, the President of Parliament and the Bureau fully note your comment and you will soon have a response to the important issue that you have raised.
Balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process
The next item is the report (A5Â­0373/2000) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on a report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of Council Recommendation 96/694 of 2 December 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process [COM(2000) 120 - C5-0210/2000 - 2000/2117(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you all know, respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women is a very recent affair.
It was not until the twentieth century that women acquired the right to access education, the sciences, the arts and paid employment and that they were finally recognised as beings with political rights.
The 20th century began with women fighting for the right to vote.
At the start of the twenty-first century, the demands of half the population on the planet centre around achieving a fair division of responsibilities and obligations between the sexes in all sectors of economic, social, family and political life.
The need for women to be promoted in the decision-making process and for a balanced participation of women and men in the democratic institutions, reflecting the balance of the sexes in nature, is a sine qua non of democracy and peace and of the cohesion and competitiveness of the European Union.
In response to this need and on the basis of documented proposals by the European network of experts which made up the Commission in 1992, the Council adopted an important recommendation to the Member States on the balanced participation of men and women in the decision-making process in December 1996.
We can see from the details provided by the Member States that little progress has been made over the last three years and that there are huge discrepancies between the Member States.
The most satisfactory results are in countries which have a long tradition of promoting equality of the sexes, such as Sweden and Finland, where the proportion of women in parliament and government is over 40%.
Sweden, as you all know, has a cabinet of 10 male and 10 female ministers.
And of course, at the other end of the spectrum, there are countries such as Greece and Italy, where the proportion of women is below or around 10%.
The problem obviously relates to the upper rather than the lower echelons of administration, where the real decisions are taken, where the real power is exercised, where the future of the European Union is planned and organised.
Clearly, courageous measures are needed if the problems and contradictions inherited from past covenants between the sexes are to be resolved.
We need a new institutional and social framework which reflects all the changes that have taken place since, which guarantees equal opportunities and divides responsibilities fairly and evenly between the two sexes, so that any decisions taken reflect the wishes, values, priorities, interests and abilities of both sexes of the human race.
Now that women are fully involved in the production process and outnumber men at European universities, there is no excuse to exclude them from policy- and decision-making processes, nor is it right that women should bear the burden of family obligations and home-making alone.
According to studies and research, men and women working and taking decisions together, a balance between the male and female, could result in a more balanced and fairer world.
This balance must not, of course, drop below 40% for each sex, which is considered an acceptable percentage, especially in Scandinavia, where it has been applied for years now.
What is certain is that, once there is a critical mass of women in the decision-making process, priority issues relating to the quality of life, such as environmental protection, social policy and welfare, medical care, education, the fight against drugs and trafficking in human beings and the peaceful resolution of conflicts will emerge on the political agenda.
If we are to move in this direction, i.e. if we are to achieve a balanced participation of the sexes, we need to adopt specific initiatives and measures, such as revising the party political structure and the procedure for selecting candidates.
The legislation on public funding for political parties should make provision for greater funding for parties which guarantee a gender balance within the party and for sanctions for parties which have too few women, as was recently decided in France.
Governments, especially in countries in which the proportion of women is below 30%, should consider how to adapt and reform their electoral systems.
Similarly, if quotas introduced are to be effective, they must be linked with other measures relating to political parties and the reform of the electoral system.
We also need to tackle stereotypes by teaching the role of the sexes from an early age and to cultivate women's ability to hold high office.
We need to strengthen the social infrastructure in order to care for and support senior citizens and, finally, the Member States need to take part in the next Intergovernmental Conference to reform the Treaty so that there is a strong legal basis which will guarantee a balanced participation of the two sexes in the institutions of the European Union, so that we can finally do the obvious and ensure that the natural balance of the sexes is also expressed in the centres of power and that any decisions taken on the future of Europe are not taken in the absence of women.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how can we strive to create a balance between men and women in their working life, both in the private sector and in public institutions, and both at European and national level?
We need an effective strategy leading to positive measures.
We need to combat ignorance and outmoded clichÃ©s about gender roles.
Our role model should be those confident women who very effectively occupy senior positions and who actively participate in the community.
However, they, and this applies equally to men, have to be able to manage their domestic commitments just as well as they cope with the professional demands placed on them.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on her report, which includes many important sections, such as the demand for the role of women to be enhanced or for action to be taken to counter women's inadequate representation in management and decision-making bodies within companies and also, I have to say, in trade unions.
The lack of equal opportunities in the labour market needs to be tackled by developing talent early on.
We also support the call for gender-specific statistics in order to produce meaningful comparisons of objectives and outcomes.
We are in favour of cooperation between the two sexes and therefore want to see women's concerns, outlook and experience making a contribution. They really do enhance a man' s world.
However, on some points there is not a majority amongst the Members of the PPE Group in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
That is why one half voted for the report and the other half against - now that is equality.
The main concerns are covered in the four amendments which I have tabled jointly with Astrid Lulling.
Mrs Karamanou has already agreed to one of them: career and family are no longer to be described as a double disadvantage which women have to face, but rather as a twofold burden which they have to cope with and which they can indeed cope with in practice.
Another amendment opposes the idea that women need to be trained in areas like public speaking and assertiveness if they are to get on in the world.
For one thing, men also have shortcomings in these areas and, what is more, these days many women do not wait to be given financial support to do this.
They are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time.
However, the two most important amendments are about rejecting the establishment of quotas.
We know that there are various systems in the Member States.
Some have quota arrangements of one kind or another.
Some want a kind of exchange system, alternating men and women, and others stipulate that the parties have to pay fines if an adequate proportion of women is not guaranteed in their lists.
The principle of subsidiarity should come into play here.
Surely it is not right for individual measures in Member States to be eroded by Europe through the back door.
Elsewhere, governments are called upon to review the differential impact of varying electoral systems.
That is not a job for governments - it is a job for the parties.
They should look at this and draw up their voting lists carefully with this in mind. It is their job and not one for governments.
We regard these amendments as so important that we have requested a roll-call vote.
If you could give us your support on this, Mrs Karamanou, your report could well secure an overwhelming majority.
Anyone deeply concerned about equal opportunities needs to make sure not only that the overall objectives are right, but that the detail is right too.
The more precisely we word this, the greater its credibility will be, especially among those who do not have sufficient experience in this field, and that will make it all the more likely that we will secure a broad consensus today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is for every female citizen of the EU to have access to decision-making processes at local, regional, national and European level.
Equal participation for women in political and social decision making is not only our legitimate right, but a social necessity.
We do not just enrich a man' s world; we are participating in all areas of this supposedly male world.
As the new millennium dawns, we are continuing to fight alongside our colleague Mrs Karamanou, who I would like to thank sincerely for her persistence and hard work, in order to move closer to the objective of equality in the distribution of power between men and women.
It has been a long haul from the first women's suffrage, in Finland in 1904, to gender-balanced political lists in France, and we still have a long way to go before we can take women presidents, mayors, ministers and party chairs for granted as a part of everyday life.
The European Union has made considerable progress in this regard.
We have now been able to increase the proportion of women in the European Parliament to 30%, and it is, incidentally, markedly higher in the left-wing groups than in the Conservative and more right-wing groups.
25% of the Commission is made up of women, and the figure is 24.8% in the governments of the Member States and 22.5% in national parliaments.
I am pleased to bear glad tidings from my own country.
Since the last government reshuffle in Germany, women now make up 37.5% of the Federal German Government, and this has been achieved by my party, by my political family.
We are therefore confident about our own role and can act as a driving force for equal rights and the demands arising from the Karamanou report.
I must call upon the House to support the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, as regards the three issues just raised by Mr Mann, and stick to the original text presented by the committee.
It would be a mistake to reject quotas, as the parties are being urged to do.
Furthermore, we also supported quotas as advocated in the report to the World Conference on Women in Beijing.
The right thing is to keep all mechanisms open.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Karamanou for a really outstanding report.
I think it is exemplary in the way it is written.
The report clearly emphasises the big differences between the Member States, but there is one thing all the countries have in common: there is no equality, including in those countries which are furthest along the road, and here I am thinking, for example, of the Scandinavian countries.
In Scandinavia, we have made a lot of progress at parliamentary level, both on the back and the front benches.
Only Sweden and Finland are mentioned, and Denmark is included in an aside.
I should therefore like to say a couple of things about Denmark.
I want to stress that 9 of the 21 ministers in the Danish government are women and that both the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance are women.
My own party has 4 female ministers at the moment and one male minister, plus a female leader of the parliamentary party and a female party chairman, and I am the only woman elected to the European Parliament.
We have fortunately never gone in for quota systems for, if that were the case, I believe that men would have begun to take advantage of the fact.
In the Scandinavian countries too, however, there are very few women in management posts, particularly at the highest level.
Denmark has nothing to boast about, and nor has Sweden, as far as I can see.
As was pointed out yesterday, the Swedish Prime Minister' s delegation consisted only of men.
We clearly have a problem, therefore.
I personally believe that this has to do with the demands made of women in the hierarchical system.
But that is, of course, something we can discuss.
Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions.
Clearly, ICT has a flat structure, and that is to women' s advantage. Globalisation has a concentrated structure, which is to the disadvantage of women who thoroughly lose out in the hierarchical system.
In conclusion, I want to say that my most important message is that cooperation at European level can be extremely useful to us, but we must recognise that the different countries face very different problems, and quite different initiatives are therefore required.
We must distinguish between those things from which we can all benefit in the Community, for example statistics that can be compared, and those areas in which we can clearly only offer each other inspiration.
That attitude will be of no less immediate importance in connection with enlargement.
Here, we are concerned with countries which may well have the legislation in place, but not the tangible arrangements, and joint aid on our part is really needed in this area.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on a very good and comprehensive report.
One of its main themes is the need for an integrated strategy.
If we are to tackle the very serious imbalance of representation of men and women, not only in the political sphere but also in decision-making at all levels in society, this is essential.
We should remember that just last year the Finnish presidency looked at nine sectors in the Member States, including national, regional and local parliaments, the civil service and the supreme courts.
Wherever it looked it found women were under-represented.
The problems have been recognised for a long time, but progress on solving them has been slow.
We repeat ourselves constantly in these reports, calling for better statistics and training, awareness campaigns to encourage more women into politics in the same way as they have already very often become key players in their own communities and local groups, and for measures to make it easier for men and to women to balance work and family life.
We have to keep on saying these things because they are needed.
But, in addition, we need positive action, such as quotas, to make a real difference.
This report does not dictate what should be done in individual Member States, but calls upon the governments to look at their own situation and take action to improve the balance of women and men, using legislative means, if necessary, as some have already done.
Where these measures have been used, they have been successful, not only in getting more women elected to Parliament but also in raising awareness, providing good role models for other women - girls in particular - and improving debate and decision-making all around.
So the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support all the conclusions of the report because it will contribute towards achieving equality and real democracy.
Mr President, in the Swedish Encyclopaedia of Women' s History, the entry under the heading Patriarchy reads as follows:
'A social system based on hierarchical relations between men, structured so that the decision-making processes are controlled from the top down and so that women as a sex are placed in a subordinate position.
The ideological justification is provided by a system of values designed by male thinkers and founded on men' s perception of reality.
The material basis of this system consists of a division of labour according to gender which, at all levels of the hierarchies, assigns to women the tasks which are either unpaid or more poorly paid.
One of the prerequisites of this is control of women' s sexuality and fertility.
This control in turn requires structural violence against women, on the one hand, and that women practise self-repression, on the other.'
I would like to come back briefly to the question of how we practise self-repression.
After all, it is not just in this Chamber - it also happens throughout the various sectors of society - that representatives of the Group of the European People' s Party discuss the allocation of quotas and, for some reason I cannot fathom, have a terrible dread of allocating quotas according to gender.
It is said that women must be appointed on merit, but I should like to ask the question which, more often than not, employers and leading male politicians apparently fail to ask: What merits are we actually looking for?
After all, we know that, to a large extent, women and men are at present unequally represented in society as a whole.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have no problem whatsoever with backing Mrs Karamanou' s report one hundred per cent - on the contrary.
We are waiting for what is called the 'ketchup effect' .
We have now been waiting for 150 years, so we do not want to wait even another two years for something to happen.
Mrs Karamanou, I think that the low level of representation of women and, indeed, young people in our parliaments is the result of a democratic deficit, not a surplus. Closed electoral lists drawn up directly by the parties - as recommended in your report - where it is not even possible to express a preference vote, represent the best system for achieving proportional representation of parties, or rather party officials and candidates selected by parties, be they women or men, in our parliaments.
On the contrary, I think the slow progress in representation of women and young people in our parliaments is actually due to electoral systems which prevent candidates standing against each other and being chosen, if only in primary elections, by the people rather than by party secretaries.
I doubt if the statistics are particularly telling either way - I wonder what Margaret Thatcher or Hilary Clinton would think of your position on the majority system - but a great deal of data and evidence exists to demonstrate the opposite of your theses.
Another recommendation, made in the explanatory statement to your report, is to go so far as to grant public financing incentives to the parties which get the most women into parliament.
Although done with the best of intentions, that could be the road to bureaucracy and subsidised representation and representativeness in our parliaments, and it is a road I do not feel we should take.
Women' s representation requires more democracy, not less.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our central concern must be to establish equal opportunities between men and women.
By equal opportunities I do not mean levelling down, I mean equal opportunities for equally qualified women to join and progress in the decision-making process and in professional life, for example by eliminating differences in salaries between men and women doing equivalent work.
We know from the statistics that in nearly all countries at least half the electorate is made up of women, yet the number of women in decision-making positions in companies and in public bodies is remarkably low.
I regard the prime political task as being to eliminate all barriers to equal opportunities.
I have in mind framework conditions that allow women to take responsibility for shaping their own individual lifestyle.
A policy that shifts this task to economic players lets policy makers off the hook at the expense of those affected.
Because the issues involved are social protection, the value of family work, qualifications and skills, working conditions, working hours and much more besides.
It is not a matter of quotas and positive discrimination.
If you will forgive me, I consider that notion in itself to be absurd.
How can discrimination be positive?
I do not want to have my job because I am a woman, but because I am qualified for it, and I believe that many women feel the same way.
Mr President, Commissioner, this report deals with the balanced participation of men and women in the decision-making process by analysing the different situations and the lack of participation of women.
We always point out that we women make up half of the population and therefore we need greater participation so that women can feel duly represented.
However, it is important to point out that the incorporation of women into public life and the labour market in prominent positions is very recent.
And we should also point out that it has happened thanks to the efforts of women themselves, who have had to overcome enormous difficulties.
It is a long road along which we must continue to make progress, until such time as it is so normal to find women in the positions which have always been occupied by men that reports such as this are no longer necessary.
Women need support, they need more training, more convenient hours of work and sufficient help so that they can reconcile their professional lives with their family lives.
Greater participation by women means improvements in democracy and the full recognition of their rights on equal terms with men.
We agree with the majority of the report - and we would like to support it totally - with the exception of the specific reference to establishing fixed obligatory quotas, because that could create added problems for women themselves.
We argue for more balanced and higher-level participation by women than there is at present, particularly in certain countries of the European Union.
The European network of equality committees of the national parliaments, which already exists, should be strengthened, because it is a very appropriate forum for the exchange of experiences and of good practice.
Women must be involved in all areas - not just in the defence of their own rights - by participating in the resolution of everyday problems, in the institutions and on company management boards, in unions and in social and cultural organisations.
Mr President, a successful man once said that half of heaven is borne up by women.
But the voices of women are absent when it comes to taking key decisions and setting priorities.
In other words, women, who make up more than half of the world' s population, are seriously under-represented in political, economic and social areas.
This is unacceptable in a democracy.
Nowhere is the rift between de jure and de facto equality greater than within the decision-making process.
In order to achieve a balance, a concrete plan of action with a set timetable is needed.
An important part of such a plan is a benchmarking system.
I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Karamanou would like to see such a system.
I propose that the EU' s objectives regarding women in the decision-making process be based on the average of the three most successful Member States within each field, with annual reports from the Member States.
It is mainly women who are victims of violations of human rights, such as rape, sexual offences, abuse in the home and trafficking.
Women are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies that judge these crimes.
This leads to the latter being given low priority. Often, the perpetrators are not prosecuted.
The equal participation of women in decision-making processes is not only a matter of demanding social justice and democracy, but is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge is to be made the most of.
Failure to utilise women' s decision-making abilities is an unacceptable waste.
In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party has opted for the allocation of quotas. This comes after many years' struggle to increase the number of women involved in the party, which is to say qualified women.
Women represent 50 per cent of our Government and 44 per cent of the Swedish Parliament.
The only party to have openly opposed this is the Conservative Party. All these women, however, are qualified.
Women should not only bear up half of heaven, they should also accept responsibility for decisions concerning our whole world.
Mr President, I want to express my thanks for a good report.
It should be obvious to everyone that men and women should have the same opportunities to participate in decision-making at all levels, but unfortunately this is not the case.
So what can be done?
We need greater equality in the home, access to good child care, shared parental responsibility, more encouragement within educational systems to break with traditional gender-linked roles, and flexible working hours in order to accommodate individual requirements.
In addition to this, we also need working methods in politics, industry and trade unions which are not based on men' s priorities.
Despite the fact that politics continues, to a far too great extent, to be a male domain - in some countries more than in others - the problems are greater still in industry and trade union organisations.
This is unacceptable and needs to be the focus of more attention.
Equality is not a women' s issue and can only be achieved through cooperation between both sexes.
Therefore, men must be involved - in a totally different way than at present - in working towards equality.
For instance, more men should be actively involved in working towards equality within this Parliament.
We need more women in decision-making positions, but - and this is where I agree with Mrs Theorin - not because they are women but because it is unacceptable for so much skill and experience to go to waste.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Karamanou' s report places emphasis on a very important issue: equality between men and women is extremely precarious.
All the figures consistently demonstrate this and we are making slow progress.
That is why, in my view, we have to keep emphasising the issue of decision making and what Europe can do.
Europe has played a leading role in the struggle for equality of treatment, on the one hand, and equality in decision making, on the other.
This has been largely inadequate, however, bearing in mind the contents of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, where decision making on policy is taken into account only with regard to European Parliament or local elections.
I would just like to tell you about the French situation, where we have a law which is currently being implemented for local elections.
In the battles we are waging we discover that every day in the French press there are truly fascinating articles and debates about the way that the real situation is being transformed, for, Mrs Karamanou, alongside Greece, France is the most backward country in Europe in this regard.
Today, with the game of musical chairs that is being played by the government, women make up 8% of the national parliament.
That is less than 10%, and that means that the French situation is significant.
The debate we are having today in this Chamber is one that has been going on continuously for two or three years in France.
I have just one argument in defence of equality, not just political equality but equality in general.
This argument, which is both political and philosophical, is this: there is no equality without restrictions, and I challenge the Group of the European People' s Party to prove otherwise.
Let us not talk of positive discrimination quotas or anything else.
There can be no production in our society without restrictions in order to ensure equality.
This is the only comment I wanted to make.
It was our final argument in the battle for equality.
That is why I want to add very quickly, by way of conclusion, that there is nevertheless something important which must be clarified in today' s debate about decision making, which does not cover the whole problem regarding sexual equality, and that is the difference between political and economic matters.
We now know what we have to do in the political arena, and I believe we are making progress.
Certainly, I am gaining a great deal from the current experience in France.
As regards economic equality in general, and decision making in particular, however, the problem is much more serious and much more extensive.
As my fellow member in the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has just mentioned, what happens within trades unions and in professional elections has as yet hardly been formulated.
We have to work on this.
It is a much more complex issue.
I believe that in future we must no longer talk about political equality without finding the appropriate mechanisms. These will not be the same mechanisms in terms of constraints as those used in the political arena.
The means of guaranteeing better representation of women both in industry and at a professional level must be found.
Mr President, when I started out in politics some thirty years ago, and I went along to the preliminary meeting of the Mexico World Conference on Women, which took place in New York, I accompanied the only female diplomat our country had at the time.
All the discussions in New York on how we could help women penetrate the world of decision making, the world of employment, etc., were wasted on her.
She had reached her goal under her own steam, but she had made so many sacrifices along the way that she had become a woman whom I do not wish other women to take as a role model.
For women who made their way into politics, diplomacy, etc. many years ago, are women who had to make huge sacrifices.
What we want is to give women the opportunity to find their niche in decision making, politics and the world of employment in a normal way, with some help from society.
We might well question how this should be done.
How can we help women?
For years, we have been looking for strategies for a society which pays lip service to the idea that women must be given all opportunities, but which has so little input when it comes to setting up binding, effective strategies in order to achieve this.
The few strategies which were set up have always been strategies with target figures or quotas - call them what you will.
The target figure system or the quota system is not a system which only applies to women.
In my country, where the two language regions, Dutch and French, should coexist in harmony, we also apply quotas for language proportions.
The quota system, therefore, is not a system specifically designed for women.
People now act as if it were a system which only applies to women, but it is a system that is used in many areas of society.
It is likely that it will also be applied to other areas in future.
I have quoted one example.
I cannot understand, therefore, those who are so anxious about this system.
Each time, I wonder whether the reason why they are against the quota system is because, ultimately, their aim is to prevent women from joining at all, or whether it is genuinely because they have fundamental objections.
I am in favour of a quota system.
This view is not shared by the majority of my group, but is by a number of others.
I am an advocate of the system.
I successfully introduced it in Belgium as the only country in Europe, and it was soon copied in France.
I believe it is one of the few practical options which exist at the moment.
I support the Karamanou report.
Congratulations.
Mr President, Commissioner, despite the fact that the number of women in education, employment and politics has increased and continues to increase, it is clear that there are still great problems and inequalities in the social sectors under discussion.
Those who trust in the idea that, thanks to official equality and the passage of time, self-regulatory mechanisms will work in favour of social balance, are mistaken, because they do not appreciate the fact that, although equality before the law and equality of opportunity are necessary conditions, they are not sufficient in themselves.
Women with the necessary abilities often do not make it, but we know many cases of men who attain positions of power without having sufficient merit and they are never called 'quota men' .
Parity democracy, which we have been talking about for many years, is an instrument which is intended, through balanced representation, to put an end to the model of structural power which has kept women out of the decision-making process.
It is essential to create administrative structures which promote and monitor gender equality, and it would also be very helpful to resume the work of the European network of experts in the promotion of women in the field of decision-making, which had considerable success in the past.
On the other hand - as Mrs Karamanou' s excellent report points out - it is especially important to promote the participation of men and women in all policies at a proportion of a minimum of 40% and a maximum of 60%.
In this respect, the systems of alternating men and women on party lists, promoted in certain political parties, have had unquestionable success.
So the aim must be the adoption of national electoral regulations which provide for the creation of parity lists.
The next Intergovernmental Conference must include amendments to the Treaty in this respect, so that this objective may be fulfilled in all the institutions and policies of the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, fellow women MEPs, if we want to improve our democracy - and that should be our objective here - it is essential that we share responsibilities and power.
Mr President, the participation of women in decision making is not only a necessary condition for the rights and interests of women to be respected, but also an essential basis for consolidating justice and developing democracy.
The reality of the situation shows that, despite various recommendations and resolutions, this is an area in which major imbalances still remain, with a huge under-representation of women in decision-making bodies, both in economic and social spheres of activity and in politics, and this contributes to maintaining existing imbalances and discriminations.
As the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on her work, emphasises, it is therefore crucial to adopt bold measures to promote the participation of women in decision-making, which will also require men and women to take on an equal share of responsibilities in public and private life. We must also encourage new anti-discriminatory practices, and that includes within political parties and public and private administrations too, with the aim of eliminating the psychological and practical obstacles to the participation of women in decision-making structures and in political life, thereby preventing retrograde action such as the recent case in Portugal, where the government abolished the Ministry for Equality.
We must change this situation.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I am in favour of a much more balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process than is currently the case.
But, unlike our rapporteur, I am not conceited enough to claim that everything would be different and better if women participated equally in the decision-making process.
Nevertheless, we must not accuse all men across the board of having the wrong intentions, for example in relation to defending the rights of children or to the environment, to name just a few of the areas mentioned in this context by our rapporteur.
Fortunately, there are men who are talented and fervent supporters of the rights and interests that are close to our hearts.
Unfortunately, there are also female politicians who just cannot be relied upon, even when it comes to putting more female candidates on the electoral lists.
In my long political career I can tell you that it has mostly been women who, afraid of competition from me, have tried to put spokes in my wheels.
It must, of course, be said that, despite the good policies of equal treatment and equal opportunities which have been developed since 1975 by the Community and, above all, despite the well-intentioned recommendation of the Council in 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process, progress towards these objectives is slow. It is moving at a snail' s or a tortoise' s pace rather than at the speed of a racehorse.
The reason why I voted against this draft resolution on the Commission report in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities was because it makes a number of exaggerated claims and demands, which are counter-productive for women who want to participate fully in the decision-making process.
I am therefore against the reference to a 40% quota, below which measures would be called for to achieve a balanced representation of both genders.
I am of the opinion that such measures are essential now and in the future, irrespective of the percentage of participation that is achieved.
I am against the demand addressed to political parties that they adopt quota systems and, in particular, the zipper system to set up the electoral lists.
This zipper system would be incompatible with the electoral law of my country where, fortunately for me, it is not the political party which decides the place of a candidate on the electoral list, but the people, by means of preference votes.
What we need to do is to call on political parties to reform their structures and procedures with a view to getting rid of the direct and indirect obstacles to the participation of women, given that Member States could encourage political parties to put a larger number of female candidates on their electoral lists, by means of financial incentives if necessary.
Finally, I find it absurd to demand that only women be trained to take on leading roles and to take decisions when many men, who already have such roles and jobs, would greatly benefit from such training.
My Group has tabled amendments to get rid of the counter-productive demands I have just described and I hope that these amendments will be adopted.
I would just like to make one more comment, which I should not really do before the vote, on the French translation of our amendments.
It is defective to the extent that these amendments are not only incomprehensible but, as co-author, I am bound to say that, when I read these amendments in French, I feel like a mother hen who can no longer find her chicks.
So, Mr President, it is the German text which takes precedence.
I ask Members to be aware of this and to bear it in mind when we vote.
Mr President, Commissioner, as the rapporteur has told us, the number of declarations, resolutions and undertakings on equal opportunities for men and women is pretty respectable.
The Treaty of Amsterdam is ultimately the legal basis and it defines equal opportunities between men and women as one of the main priorities of European policy.
However, although there has been some modest progress, there are still some conspicuous shortcomings.
There is a marked imbalance in the involvement of men and women in the decision-making process, and there are alarming differences between individual Member States.
Throughout Europe, there are especially few women in leading positions in administration and in political decision making.
This means that everyone involved in the economic and social world has to play a part if responsibility is to be distributed evenly across the public and private sectors, in business, politics and family life.
Above all, we need to recognise that the equal opportunities deficit in the labour market is partly attributable to the low proportion of women in Europe's businesses, in its trade unions and in its public sector, and partly attributable to an inadequate social infrastructure, distorted stereotypes and low pay.
One important area we need to tackle is education and training.
Amongst other things, women have to learn to lay claim to a role in leadership and decision making.
You cannot talk about balance when women account for just 40% of all those involved in politics at European or national level.
Quotas are therefore an important instrument if we are to approach this target.
But it is not just a question of increasing the number of women, but also about enhancing their role in society and recognising the quality of their work.
Party and government structures need to be examined and where they are found to be lacking we need to jointly create binding requirements, such as ministries for equal opportunities.
Greater involvement of women in public life needs to be regularly monitored using up-to-date statistics. This would also clearly demonstrate that not only have we reached targets but that we have also regressed in certain areas.
This means that we have to promote equal opportunities while, at the same time, defending what has already been achieved.
Mr President, I would like to express the point of view of working women not only because it is on them, of all women, that the burden of social organisation weighs most heavily, but also because the workers' movement can take pride in having been the first to fight for the recognition of equality between men and women.
Long before the ruling class gave women the right to vote, the workers' movement had already, within its own organisation, given leading women the place they deserved.
The fate of working women is linked to the status of the working class as a whole.
It is women who are the main victims of insecure employment, enforced part-time work and the low salaries that are paid for such work.
What is unacceptable is that insecure employment, enforced part-time work and low salaries are allowed to exist.
Speeches about equality between men and women will continue to be just so much hot air as long as countless working families are deprived of adequate housing and as long as there are not enough public amenities, child care centres and nursery schools.
In all areas, European institution policy is no more favourable to the interests of working women than Member State policy.
Although I will vote in favour of the report because of the good intentions that are stated in it, they are still nothing more than good intentions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even today we cannot assume that men and women can work alongside each other with equal rights in all areas. That much we all agree upon.
But we also know very well that participation in decision making, be it by men or women, is not an automatic right.
The situation varies widely, depending on the field, the specialism and the area of responsibility. This is bound to be a factor when reaching a decision about any man or woman seeking to hold a particular office, applying for a job or wishing to join a particular committee.
However, we can legitimately ask if this always applies.
Is it not true to say that there are still certain prejudices in our society which militate against a person or a sex from the outset?
The male nursery school teacher or woman fire-fighter are still exceptions to the rule - as are women who make it to the very top on management boards, as directors or on political committees.
As a rule, this under-representation is not because of any lack of skill or expertise.
A woman always has to do something extra to prove herself - expertise on its own is not enough, her entire circumstances play a part.
Her children, her family and even the simple idea of the weaker sex are barriers to progress.
For far too long we have been telling women that they have to be better than the men they are competing against.
For that reason alone we need things like the report before us to wake society up from time to time and keep up the momentum.
I believe that the double burden of family duties and a career should not be used as grounds for discrimination, nor are they a double disadvantage as stated in Recital D. Combining a family and a career in fact demonstrates a high degree of organisational skill and life experience that should not be underestimated, and should be regarded as a particularly useful skill for those in leading positions.
It should also be assumed that men have the same family commitments as women, and all we women debating here this morning who have a family would be unable to do all this if our partners were not also committed to their families as fathers.
Unfortunately, we have not quite reached that point yet, and it can still be said that whereas a family provides support for a man, it is a millstone for a woman.
So, right from the outset, when we are educating young people, we need to counteract these entrenched social images.
I doubt whether simply demanding quotas and percentages is the right way to achieve greater representation, and it should surely not be this Parliament' s job to call for 40% representation in all political fields at national and international level.
For awareness to grow we need balanced reports and discussion papers that emphasise equal representation, and I therefore urge you to support the PPE Group' s amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish, first of all, to congratulate our fellow Member, Mrs Karamanou, on the excellent report she has presented to us.
I am not offering my congratulations as a mere formality.
I am doing so in order to be fair and because I believe they are deserved.
This report is not only excellent, but its explanatory statement is a study of the greatest interest to anyone concerned about equal rights for men and women and will undoubtedly serve as a seminal reference work for the future.
This proves the eccentricity of the Bureau's decision to reduce the length of explanatory statements to one page.
This Chamber does not produce paper by the metre.
We are engaged in politics and politics must have a sound basis.
Your report, Mrs Karamanou, is a fine example of the importance of the political texts drawn up in this Parliament.
In my speech I shall focus on the electoral system.
This is a crucial problem because it predates our own participation in politics.
Women must be given the opportunity to be elected in order to prove what they are capable of.
Some electoral systems make the participation of women even more difficult.
These are, as we have seen, systems that use single name lists.
This practice has systematically penalised women.
It is not so much the electorate that is to blame, but the structures of the parties themselves, which create enormous difficulties by means which are often less than legal.
Thus, although there is a move towards attempting to change this system of single name electoral lists, with procedures being created, in France for example, to set the balance right and to achieve a quota of 50% for both sexes, the Portuguese government has announced the creation of a new electoral law that will partially replace the proportional system with the single name system.
This is an initiative that gives great cause for concern and we must be aware that, in this case, this will clearly discriminate against women who wish to participate actively in politics.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on her excellent presentation of the situation in Europe as regards equality of the sexes and on her ordered approach to proposals and solutions.
I am sorry that the spokesman for the PPE who expressed the greatest opposition to the report has left because the debate would have been highly interesting.
Allow me to start by making a political observation.
The title of the report: "The balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process" has a dual meaning.
The decision-making process takes place in the centres of power; but it also means balanced participation in the most important decision-making process for the future, which takes place in the family.
So it refers to both sexes and the numbers of women in decision-making centres cannot be increased unless the proportion of time which men spend on family matters is also increased.
This automatically means that if we want to achieve the required target, we need to make changes to the family, society, the economy and the cultural identity which we have had for centuries.
The debate revolved largely around whether or not quotas, i.e. a quantitative commitment on participation, was an acceptable solution.
I would say, from a philosophical point of view, that a set of numbers or rules can never change a social fact of life.
However, history shows that rules and targets can bring about change, especially if they are accompanied by a set of policies.
So what we need to do, and this is clearly expressed in Mrs Karamanou's report, is to implement three types of policy simultaneously if we are to achieve this important objective, which concerns democracy in our societies.
The first type of policy is mainstreaming equal opportunities in the economy and employment, in social systems and social protection and in education systems and the cultural identity of our societies.
The second type of policy concerns specific measures and specific positive action to support the policy of participation in the decision-making process.
These measures relate to electoral systems, where it has been proven that there is a close correlation between electoral systems and the participation of women, they relate to the need for continuous statistics which throw the facts into relief, they relate, of course to political parties and their internal political commitments and they relate to laws for positive action.
Excellent examples have been cited in this Chamber, which prove that wherever quotas have been applied in conjunction with all the policies which I have just mentioned, they have had positive results.
And we cannot ignore the fact that the only countries which have made any serious headway with the participation of women are the countries which had applied specific policies.
Not always with legislative undertakings on quotas but with political undertakings by the political parties and always with specific quantitative targets.
Finally, there is a third type of policy which relates to intervention by the European Union and collaboration on the part of the Member States, such as political networks of women, indicators at European level - I refer to the Finnish Presidency and the 9 indicators, the application of which could create national undertakings and national targets - benchmarking, training and, finally, support for women in the national states and on the European political scene with an important international role, because this is what creates the standards for power and the standards for women politicians for later generations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall close by repeating what the Prime Minister of Luxembourg said when the question of whether or not there should be specific targets for employment in the Member States was being debated: 'The expression of political desire, the expression of political intention is not enough. Policy without specific quantitative targets and means is simply literature.'
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
Competitiveness of EU forest-based and related industries
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0384/2000) by Mr SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The state of the competitiveness of the EU forest-based and related industries [COM(1999) 457 - C5-0306/2000 - 2000/2159(COS)]
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank those who helped to have the debate on this report moved to a time when we can speak about it and vote on it today, in the daytime.
If the report had been discussed in the evening it would have been insulting to the four million employees directly or indirectly connected with the forestry industry cluster.
This sector is responsible for a tenth of the total industrial output for the EU and a third of the world' s forest industry production.
All of us present here know the problems that the Thursday evening sittings will pose from this day on.
During the debate on the Commission communication it became apparent that the Forestry Industry Cluster is extremely heterogeneous.
Publishers and printing works use paper and other forest industry products, but many of them see themselves mainly as content producers.
The content industry' s output is characterised, not just by its use of paper, but also by the new electronic industry: electronic communication.
The report expresses the hope that the Commission will also take account of the special features of competitiveness in these new industries.
The report recommends that the peat industry should be included in this cluster.
Peat has its own part to play in forest-based industries, particularly in the Nordic countries and in Ireland.
The report does not adopt a position on whether peat is a renewable or a fossil fuel.
However, as it is produced industrially, these producers must have their place in EU administration.
In the opinion of the rapporteur, the report contains an unnecessary number of additional conclusions relating to forestry, but it was the wish of the committee, although Parliament has already expressed its view on forestry matters in the recent Thomas report.
Nothing more needs to be added; instead, its conclusions should be put into effect in the Commission in a more proactive way than is the case at present.
The Commission must also carefully study the conclusions of Mr PesÃ€lÃ€, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The forestry cluster represents the open sector of the economy, where the activity is conducted in globally competing markets.
For that reason, I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by my colleagues, Mrs Schierhuber and Mr RÃŒbig, that the Directorate-General on Agriculture should be responsible for forestry.
Agriculture in the EU is not accustomed to working in accordance with the conditions of the open sector.
The same problem also relates to Mrs Ainardi' s proposed amendment.
Mrs Flesch' s amendment, in my opinion, is taken account of in the text adopted by the committee and not least on the basis of her own amendments.
The special needs of the content industry are dealt with thoroughly in my report, and, for that reason, I do not think this amendment is necessary at this stage.
Wood is a renewable natural resource.
It has many uses; for example, it can be used in the energy industry.
The report accepts the principle according to which forestry products should be used for the production of energy only at the end of the production chain, after which there is no longer any other use for it and it cannot be recycled.
Member States are the best experts when it comes to managing their own forests.
The multipurpose utilisation of forests, their importance as sinks of carbon dioxide, and their preservation for future generations will be best realised though the application of the principle of subsidiarity, and there is no justification for increasing the Commission's powers in forestry matters.
Instead, it has an important job to do, safeguarding the competitiveness of forest-based industries.
The needs of the forestry industry must also be taken into account in commercial policy.
The European forestry cluster will succeed amid fierce competition if the rules are the same for all.
If the over-exploitation of nature and people is not allowed in Europe, it should not be allowed elsewhere.
The diverse utilisation of wood can improve employment, especially in rural areas, and, consequently, forests also connect with the EU' s employment strategy.
Science and research must find new uses for wood. For example, using grass to make chemical pulp would mean more wood for other purposes.
Such ideas must be promoted within a new Framework Programme of research.
Wood can be used more in construction, as an environmentally friendly and healthy material.
And finally: if the forests do well, so will people.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would first like to express my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mr SeppÃ€nen, and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for an excellent report and some excellent cooperation.
The Commission has drafted a creditable communication on the state of global competitiveness in the forestry industry.
This document has meant that forestry matters have been made the subject of very necessary debate in the EU, which, unfortunately, happens all too rarely.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is mainly satisfied with the policies set forth by the Commission and Parliament' s draft report.
We would like to stress the importance of the whole forestry chain in our own opinion, and that includes the importance of the profitability of forestry and wood harvesting, which is responsible for the raw material base of the forestry industry.
Sustainable agriculture in Europe still depends on the family forest businesses practised by twelve million private forest owners and the activities they are engaged in.
The Hague Convention on World Climate Change failed.
We, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have followed the climate agreement process actively, as, in our opinion, the Kyoto Protocol takes totally insufficient account of the importance of forests.
Forests and all wood products are a considerable carbon sink, and their importance in this respect has to be recognised.
The coordination of matters of forestry in the EU is poor.
There are more Directorates-General to deal with them but there is a lack of uniformity.
Personnel resources have been increased in the area of the environment, but the Directorate-General on Agriculture responsible for forestry has very few resources to work with, as does that for industry. For that reason, I support Amendment No 1 by Mrs Schierhuber on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
Likewise I want to show my support for Amendments Nos 3 and 4 in particular, which are from the opinion by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Our committee approved them by general consensus.
Mr President, Commissioner, may I start by declaring an interest, or two interests, in this issue.
I have an interest in a forestry business in New Zealand, inherited from my father, so that gives me a practical interest.
More recently I visited Finland to see the forestry industry at work as the guest of CEPI, the Confederation of European Paper Industries.
