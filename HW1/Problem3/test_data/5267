I would like to know if this principle was stated properly in the PPE-DE Group when they rejected Mr HÃ¶kmark in favour of Mr Daul in a very narrow vote.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is the only supranational parliament with genuine legislative powers in the world that is elected by universal suffrage, and the President is the voice and face of Parliament.
I am standing for election today precisely because I believe that the ambition to make the European dimension of democracy more of a reality and the ability to represent the will of the majority, while maintaining one's own independence of judgment and while respecting the value of individual Members, are the crucial characteristics required of the person chosen to lead this House.
Over the next two and a half years the President, who I hope will be female, will have to be able to show on many occasions that he or she represents an institution that is free from the interests of the Member States and from the pressure of economic lobbies and that he or she is able to talk to an increasingly divided and indifferent public.
(FR) The President will have to show that he or she is capable of fighting for the constitutional rights acquired by Parliament.
We shall have to know how to defend these essential and legitimate rights when we are told - perhaps by Mrs Merkel tomorrow - that, if we are to escape from the constitutional deadlock, there is no point in going through the European Parliament or holding a public debate and that a quick bout of intergovernmental negotiations will do very nicely: one more Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors, which will produce one more unsatisfactory compromise on the cheap.
(ES) In a world in which even the Commission and certain Member States tolerate the use of breaches of individual and collective rights as currency in the economic field, in the control of resources and in the fight against terrorism, the European Parliament and its President must continue to provide a voice and provide legitimacy for all of those people who are unable to talk or act freely, wherever they are, and they must continue to publicly denounce uncomfortable truths, as they did in Chechnya and in China and in the case of the CIA flights, GuantÃ¡namo, Cuba and many other issues.
(Applause)
The elected President will have to ensure that the question of the seat is not continually brushed under the carpet by the big groups.
More than one million citizens have signed the one-seat petition, yet the big groups in this House continue to side-step any discussion on the seat of Parliament.
This issue has become important for the credibility of our institution, whether we like it or not.
No matter which way we choose, we must take a clear stand, and this means at least holding a debate on the issue.
The elected President must also prioritise internal reforms which have been blocked for too long.
Our debates must be made more interesting and relevant, and this certainly entails greater flexibility.
However, the new President will have to engage with the Council and the Commission to encourage them to improve the quality of their answers during Question Time and statements: ensuring that responses are not simply diplomatic hot air is also a way to motivate our Members to be in this House during the plenary.
(DE) If better governance also means the adoption of fewer laws, one must acquire the means for estimating their effects and better monitoring the application of European legislation.
The President of Parliament, though, needs not only to be available to all the groups, but must also guarantee that the House's staff will remain independent and aloof from political trends.
(Applause)
There is a trend, now prevalent, for administration to take on more of a political colour and for posts to be openly shared out between the European People's Party and the Socialists; this is downgrading many of our officials and will weaken our institutions.
It must be reversed.
Colleagues, I ask for your support today because I believe that across the political divide we share a profound concern about the risks and dangers of this Parliament becoming too quiet and obedient a place.
We can and we must reverse this trend, and whatever the outcome of this election, I pledge to work passionately to take forward the difficult task of building a coalition for change.
(Loud and sustained applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am, today, putting myself forward for the position of President of the European Parliament, and I am doing this in order to join with you in serving the citizens of the European Union, the law and solidarity between our peoples.
I am doing this on the basis of having served here in this House ever since the first direct elections in 1979, when I started out as my group's coordinator in the Committee on Regional Development, where I became familiar with the problems of the structurally weak areas throughout Europe.
I spent ten years chairing the Security and Disarmament Sub-Committee at a time when our embarking on this work was regarded with some amusement.
I have particular recollections of working together extremely well with our former President Klaus HÃ€nsch.
As deputy chairman of our group - something in which I take particular pride - I was responsible, on behalf of my party and our political family, for the Treaty of Amsterdam, which represented a breakthrough in terms of this House's legislative role.
I then took on responsibility for enlargement issues.
All those who witnessed what happened know that I, from the very outset, dedicated myself to ensuring that all the countries of Central Europe that are now Member States of the European Union were given equal treatment in the negotiations.
I rejoice that the countries of Central Europe are now part of our community of values in the European Union.
(Applause)
As chairman of my group, I subjected the Treaty of Nice to critical scrutiny here in this Chamber.
Back in December 2000, I said this: 'What we need is a further reform.
We need a major convention to consider the future of Europe'.
I am glad that this view was supported by our group and then by almost everyone in this House.
Building on this foundation, there are a number of things I would like to achieve together with you.
Europe must become a citizens' Europe.
People need to be won over to the great project that is ours - our continent united whilst maintaining the identities of our peoples - and this is a task for all of us to perform by doing our work in a convincing way.
There is a need for further improvement in cooperation with the national parliaments, but not only at the national level, for Europe is founded also on our regions, our cities and our communities, and in those, too, there is a need for cooperation in good faith.
Rather than being opponents, they and we are working together towards a common goal, the unity of our continent.
I would like to apply some determination to helping us make the substance of the constitutional treaty a reality.
This European Union of ours has 500 million people, and it needs reforms.
We will have to fight - peacefully - to make those reforms happen, and to that I would add that this Europe of ours has a chance of a future only if we affirm our values; that is why the values on which we agreed in Part II of the Constitution matter, and, together, we must put them into practice.

Finally, what I would like to do is to join with you in making my contribution to the dialogue of cultures, particularly with the Arab and Islamic world.
Over the past five or six years I have visited sixteen Arab countries.
We need to cooperate better with them.
We want partnership and - if at all possible - friendship with the Arab and Muslim world on the basis of our convictions.
Whilst respecting the convictions of others, we must walk into the future in a peaceful manner.
I shall always be what I have been in the past - an advocate of human rights.
We have always taken a critical line on Chechnya and the massacres there, and I speak as a friend of the United States when I say that GuantÃ¡namo is incompatible with our European legal order.
(Applause)
I would like to extend warm thanks to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and to its chairman Mr Daul, to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and its chairman Mr Schulz for their support, and also express my gratitude for the support given by the Liberals and Democrats under their chairman Mr Watson, the Group for a Europe of the Nations and their chairman Mr Crowley and for the support I have received from other Members.
I would like to say how much I respect those other group chairmen who are applying for this position.
Together with you, Members of this House, I wish to work for the unification of our European continent with the same dedication as I have shown since 1979.
I promise you that I will be a fair and objective President of this House, and I ask you to put your trust in me.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole of my group, including those colleagues of mine who are unavoidably prevented from being in the House today, has come out in favour of my candidacy.
Why?
We have always considered the election of the President of the European Parliament to be a political act of some significance and, as such, an opportunity not to blur the political differences between us but, on the contrary, to affirm them loud and clear, at least in the first round if there are also to be others.
That seems to us to be all the more true this time round, when the second half of the parliamentary term will be marked by the debate on the future of Europe.
In this connection, Mr Poettering consistently and unambiguously champions a certain vision of Europe with which most conservative and liberal MEPs and members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group can readily identify.
It should be acknowledged that I, for my part, advocate in this House, just as consistently and unambiguously as Mr Poettering, another vision of Europe that might be referred to as an alternative to what we call liberal Europe.
If I had to define it in broad terms, I would refer to five areas.
First of all, there is the social dimension.
We must stop setting one social model up against another - models that systematically chip away at the social achievements of several generations.
Then there is the ecological dimension.
We must resist the ever stronger temptation to lower our sights in the name of competitiveness in an open economic set-up.
There is also the dimension of mutual support.
We must banish all forms of exclusion, mobilise every instrument at our disposal in combating inequalities in development and turn our back on Fortress Europe.
Above all, there is the democratic dimension.
We must encourage the critical spirit, dare to let the people speak and agree to question what needs to be questioned.
Finally, there is the global dimension.
We need to use what clout we have to transform international relations.
We must join forces in order to oppose the war in Iraq and fight for a just peace in Palestine and for a genuine partnership with Africa. In our relations with the United States, the principle whereby we are allied, rather than aligned, nations needs to prevail.

My candidacy is aimed at simply offering fellow Members who identify with this desire for change and with this demand for critical reflection on the current social model the opportunity of expressing their opinions.
Democracy is about accepting the majority decision, and there is no doubt at all that Mr Poettering will be the next President of the European Parliament and one who represents all of us.
Democracy is also about respect for individuals.
I wish to say again in this House that I have nothing but praise for the loyalty and cooperation demonstrated by Mr Poettering in the Conference of Presidents, where we have sat together for seven and a half years.
Democracy is primarily, however, a debate about ideas, and, in a few moments, this will be demonstrated in the shape of a clear and unequivocal vote reflecting our convictions.
We all share political responsibility.
That is why I, for my part, did not feel the need to conduct any kind of election campaign.
It is for each of us to accept our responsibilities with our eyes wide open.
I should like to thank the four speakers for their speeches and for not having exceeded their speaking times.
Election of President of Parliament
In accordance with the provisions of our Rules of Procedure we shall now proceed to the election of the President.
I call on the tellers to proceed to the ballot boxes.
I also call on the Members to proceed to the ballot box corresponding to the first letter of their surnames.
I declare the vote open.
(The Members proceeded to vote)
I declare the vote closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.05 a.m. for the votes to be counted and resumed at 12 noon)
I can confirm the outcome of the vote on the election of the President.
Number of voters: 715
Blank or invalid ballot papers: 26
Votes cast: 689
Absolute majority for election at the first ballot: 345
The votes cast for each candidate are as follows:
Mr Jens-Peter Bonde: 46 votes
Mr Francis Wurtz: 48 votes
Mrs Monica Frassoni: 145 votes
Mr Hans-Gert Poettering: 450 votes
Mr Hans-Gert Poettering has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast and is therefore elected President of Parliament.
(The House rose to applaud the new President)
Mr Poettering, I congratulate you on your election; I invite you to take the Chair, which is rightfully yours.
My first duty must be to thank the Father of the House, Mr Berlinguer, for having conducted this election so worthily and so well.
For that he deserves our warm thanks.
(Applause)
Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all most sincerely for having given me the great, but also difficult and responsible, task of presiding over the European Parliament.
I will endeavour, with all my strength, to serve the citizens of the European Union, democracy and parliamentary government.
I wish to play my part in building a democratic European Union that is strong and effective at home and throughout the world.
In dedicating myself to this, I shall be guided by the principles of human dignity, observance of the law and the affirmation of solidarity between the peoples of the European Union.
To the citizens of the Union, I wish to say that it is only together that our peoples stand a chance of defending our values and interests in the world at large.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to say that the President of that institution that has done so much for the cause of European values and will continue to do so, one with which we want to work well, is present with us in this House today.
The person to whom I refer is Mr RenÃ© van der Linden, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and I bid him a warm welcome.
I propose to present my work programme to this House on Tuesday 13 February at 10 a.m.; that is of course conditional on the group chairmen - powerful people that they are - agreeing to it.
The President of the European Parliament is bound by their decisions.
I will be inviting the Presidents of all the European Union institutions and all former Presidents of this House to attend on that occasion.
My intention in so doing is to express the truth that, wherever we may stand politically, and by whatever convictions and ideals we may be guided, we are bound by the determined will to make, whilst retaining the identities of our peoples, the European Union an ever-closer union of peoples of the kind prescribed by the Treaties.
Right now, I should like, on behalf of us all, to thank my predecessor in office, Mr Borrell Fontelles, for his tireless endeavours, and I do this for a particular and personal reason, in that, in my former role as a group chairman, I had constant dealings, and a fruitful relationship, with him, so my heartfelt thanks go to Josep Borrell.
(Applause)
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to working with you in this new function, in which I shall endeavour to be a fair and objective President of your House, and I would also ask you to be fair and objective in judging how I do the job.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
We now have a series of speeches from the group chairmen, and I give the floor to the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Joseph Daul, whom I warmly congratulate on his election.
Mr President, Mr Poettering, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and its 277 Members, I should like to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the Presidency of Parliament.
The European Parliament is the voice of Europeans.
From now on, this voice will be yours, Mr President.
Your election is a great moment for our political group.
You have been Chairman of the main political force in Parliament for eight years, and we know that you have all the qualities necessary for exercising your new responsibilities with a great deal of courage, determination, conviction and, above all, humanity.
I should like to thank all those MEPs who have been prepared to put their confidence in you.
I am sure that they will not regret their decision.
I should also very much like to congratulate Mr Bonde, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Wurtz and to tell them how much I appreciated the high standard of their campaigns.
Many national parliaments are no doubt deserving of such campaigns.
(Applause)
Mr President, Europe is already grateful to you for your political and personal commitment in favour of the reunification of the continent.
Parliament and the European institutions in general have already benefited from what you have done to increase their powers.
We know that you will ensure that all Members of the European Parliament benefit from your experience, knowledge and conviction.
We know that, European statesman as you are, you are firstly and above all concerned about human beings and anxious to respect their dignity and freedom.
Congratulations!
I wish you every success and the courage to achieve it.
Mr President, you know that you can count on the unfailing support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I was told that, in the experience of the previous Presidents, it was the political family from which they came that expected most of them, and that that was the most difficult thing.
I hope that things will turn out this time the way you have described.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start by following the previous speaker's example and addressing thanks to Mr Wurtz, Mr Bonde and Mrs Frassoni.
We have had a worthy election, a worthy debate, which was always fair and friendly in every respect.
I congratulate the three on the results they have achieved, and you, Mr President, on being elected to preside over this Chamber.
I can tell you, Mr Poettering, that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will work together faithfully with you in your presidential capacity, and, by the same token, expect the President to exercise his office in complete neutrality and be a constantly reliable and loyal partner to our group.
Nobody who knows you, Mr Poettering, can have even the least doubt that you will do that, and so we are full of confidence as we embark on the forthcoming two and a half years of working together with you as the newly-elected President of this House and in which it is to be hoped that we, together, will help to make European integration a success.
Mr President, being among those who have been privileged to get to know you rather better over recent years, I claim the right to add a personal comment to the congratulations I bring on behalf of my group.
Everyone who knows you better and in your private capacity, knows that your political stance is inseparable from your personal situation and the course your life has taken.
You were born in September 1945, and anyone who knows you will know that your father was killed in March 1945, in the last days of the Second World War, and you yourself never knew him.
I am sure that this experience of childhood and youth without a father was one from which you learned, that it led into European politics and into the work of European unification, and that it was this experience - which, in Germany, and among people of your generation, is actually commonplace rather than unique - that motivated you to strive for European integration in the way that you have done.
It is this work of integration, the important part you have played in it, your personality as one active within it, the course of your life, that has now brought you to the head of this European Parliament, and so I would like to add to what I have said that I am certain that, if our nation, our people, had been able to take a path different to the one it actually did; if your father had not been killed in action; if he had been able to see where his son's - Hans-Gert Poettering's - path led him, he would certainly have been proud of his son, just as your sons have, today, every right to be proud of their father.
Well done!
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I offer you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of our House.
It is the pinnacle of a remarkable parliamentary career, stretching from the first direct elections to the European Parliament.
You know that my group opposed the process by which you and the Socialists carved up the House between you during this mandate.
Nonetheless, I believe that the majority in my group voted for you, recognising your experience, admiring your political work in this House and convinced of your capacity to be an objective and fair President.
In the five years that I have had the honour to lead my group, I have appreciated the cooperative relations that we have enjoyed.
I know the same can be said for my predecessor, Pat Cox, who sends through me his warmest regards to you on this day.
But as you know, in politics a halo is only 12 inches from being a noose and our reputations depend on our ability to meet ever-new challenges.
I hope you will listen to the swelling chorus in this House in favour of reform.
From having been ahead of our citizens in advancing the cause of European integration, our Member State leaders are now in danger of lagging behind.
The opportunity falls on this House to show a lead in building the European Union we need in order to meet the challenges we face.
That will require a house designed and organised so as to be capable of meeting that challenge.
I hope that we can work together to create that House with you during your term of office as President, for which I wish you every success.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is today celebrating an important moment with your election; in fact, we are convinced that, at a time when Parliament represents 27 countries, your election also gives a further boost to a Europe in which things are not just whispered quietly and to a House in which clarity and openness are such that the groups and the individuals count for what they say and for what they do - they are not just counted as numbers.
We have some difficult and important engagements: in my four terms in the European Parliament I have seen how you work and I therefore have faith that this parliamentary term - the second half of this parliamentary term - will follow a path that enables the European Parliament to stop focusing on so many futile matters, and to become more serious in tackling certain major challenges.
I am thinking about the many times we have forgotten about Africa, about our silence regarding what is happening in Nigeria and about how the European Union missed the mark in Somalia by supporting the terrorists over the legitimate government.
I am thinking about functional matters, about the translations that are of use to us, because, as you have rightly pointed out today, if we are to talk to other cultures and grow alongside them, we need to safeguard our own identities and our own traditions, too.
It is in this spirit and with this wish that we hope to turn over a new, important page today, one that will actually enable us not only to breathe life into the institutional reforms that are useful to us, but also to become closer to our citizens.
Good luck!
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my dear Hans-Gert, who would have guessed that you were a Jimmy Cliff fan?
'You can get it if you really want!'
You have dreamed so long of getting your dream job that my congratulations to you on now having got it are heartfelt.
Bravo!
It was about time that you got to be President; we recognise that.
Like everyone else, we have no doubt whatever about the fact that you will be an independent President.
Sometimes, it will be difficult, for example, when you are meant to be representing our House and feel the urge to hug a certain lady Head of Government; that is the sort of thing you can do as chairman of a group, but not now.
Now that you are President of this House, your love for a Head of Government will have to take second place to the European ideal.
I would like to see how that turns out.
Tomorrow will be the first day of your probation.
(Laughter)
Secondly, I would just like to say that the independence of a parliament is shown by the independence of those who run it.
I hope that you were listening carefully to my colleague Mrs Frassoni's speech; if not, we will send you a copy so you can read up on it ready for your work programme.
In it, she talked about the independence of our administration.
All of us here in this House must take a stand together to stop this place being run on party lines; we want the administration to be independent rather than politicised, and that is something for you, Mr Poettering, as our independent President, to do something about.
There is one thing I would like to add: it is that I know that the debate about Strasbourg is a difficult one; it is one that divides all our groups, with majorities and minorities in favour or against every conceivable position.
Having this debated here in this House would be the decent thing to do, for we could then have a clear majority emerging in favour of the one-seat solution, the two-seat solution, or some other.
I think it is unworthy of this House that we refuse to debate something that is a live issue everywhere else, so your second task is to make this House a place where issues are aired.
(Applause)
Now for your third task.
When we come to debate the constitution, I ask that you consistently present the line that this is a problem that only public debate - but no intergovernmental conference - can resolve.
It is this House, rather than some intergovernmental conference held under conditions of secrecy, that is the venue for public debate.
That is your third and last task.
Tell your beloved Federal Chancellor, and all the European Union's Heads of Government, that we want this House to be the forum for debate.
Congratulations; I hope you will enjoy us, and we will support you.
We Greens also congratulate Mrs Frassoni on her outstanding result.
(Applause)
You can take it as read that I always listen very, very carefully to the Members of this House.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I offer you my sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the European Parliament.
Quite apart from the agreements concluded between the groups and taking account of the power struggles at present going on in this House, your election is not only fully legitimate but also perfectly logical.
You are now the President of us all.
As for myself, I have no doubts at all about either your determination or your aptitude for performing this role without, of course, giving up either your ideas or the nature of your commitment.
You have strong convictions that often form the basis of our disagreements.
However, you also have an ethical code that earns you genuine respect and you display a commitment to pluralism that makes constructive cooperation possible.
We therefore have confidence in you.
I hope, Mr President, that you succeed fully on the challenging but pleasurable path ahead of you.
(Applause)
We have been together in this House since 1979, and a great deal of trust has grown in that time.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I wish to congratulate you and to thank all the Members and volunteers who ensured we had an election campaign.
Your election did not come as a great surprise, as we have known what the result would be since 2004.
However, we have avoided a coronation and we have had a debate.
You are now the elected President of the European Parliament.
You are now the President for all Members.
You are my President too, and you know of my wishes for reform: a single seat, better organised voting, better legislation, fair distribution of rapporteurships and posts, clean faÃ§ades in Strasbourg, fair representation abroad, neutral staff and a fair chair.
(DE) My dear Hans-Gert, I have known you for 27 years, and you have been a good colleague.
You are the best qualified to be an outstanding President, and I hope you have the will and courage to be one.
I congratulate you on your election and wish you a good new year.
Mr President, the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group congratulates you, of course.
It congratulates you as an individual, in the light of your courteousness and other human qualities and also in the hope of your impartial management of this Parliament that we are forming.
Admittedly, we find it rather embarrassing that your election - which, incidentally, you fully deserve, since you were previously the leader of the largest group in Parliament - has been obtained at the cost of a compromise between the two main groups which, as I had the opportunity to say yesterday, are seen as rivals by the electorate but are, rather too often for our taste, in agreement about the running of Parliament and the future of Europe.
We are relying on you to ensure that MEPs' rights, which must be the same for everyone, are respected.
The parliamentary immunity of an MEP whose freedom of expression has been compromised is no less to be protected when the MEP in question belongs to the dominant political strand as when he forms part of a minority.
The Rules of Procedure must not be changed just because the provisions concerned have benefited a minority group.
I would take the liberty of recounting something that happened this morning.
I heard the President of the sitting - our senior Member, Mr Berlinguer - speak and then conclude very quickly, saying that he could not make a speech as senior Member, since the Rules of Procedure prohibited him from doing so.
The Rules of Procedure do indeed prohibit him from doing so following a change to the Rules that deprived the senior Member of the opportunity of speaking when he shared our sympathies.
The person whose speech prompted the change was Claude Autant-Lara, France's greatest film-maker.
It was after his speech, admittedly a controversial one, that the relevant provision of the Rules was changed.
It is unfortunate that this petty trick subsequently deprived us of hearing the speech that Mr von Habsburg could have made or, this morning, of the speech that the senior Member, Mr Berlinguer, could have made, even though he does not at all share my own political opinions.
Finally, we are relying on you to defend us and to champion the rights and the dignity of MEPs.
Your predecessor, Mr Cox, was able to do this when Mr Schulz, for example, had been subject to attacks by the then President-in-Office of the Council.
Yesterday, I heard some remarks about my group - made, for example, by the representative of the Commission, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m - that were totally out of place.
This official should be reminded that it is Parliament that oversees the Commission, and not the other way around.
All MEPs are full Members of this House.
Indeed, to quarantine-off certain MEPs would amount to calling for a policy of discrimination against those who voted for them, and we are counting specifically on you to oppose a trend that would be the expression of an unfortunate drift towards totalitarianism.
(Applause)
(SK) I too would like to offer you my warmest and most sincere congratulations on your election.
I wish you good health in this role and great patience for your decision-making.
There is a request I would like to make of you that has not been mentioned in previous speeches, as all of the speakers were from the fifteen old Member States.
May I ask you to bear it in mind that today the European Union consists of 27 Member States, and may I ask you as well to respect and try to support officials from the twelve new Member States, whose MEPs have also been elected in the hope that their voices will be heard here.
As regards non-attached MEPs, I would like to ask you to do away with the discrimination which those Members have been facing.
My best wishes for you in your new role - I am keeping my fingers crossed for you.
Mr President, on my own behalf and on behalf of the European Commission, I want to congratulate you very sincerely.
It gives me great pleasure to see you as President of the European Parliament.
Today the European Parliament has elected a new leader whose qualities as a person and as a politician are uniquely well suited to this high office.
I know the President as a person of political vision and integrity - qualities that will be needed in this very challenging job.
As the leader of your group for eight years, Mr President, you pursued your vision of a political Europe as the only guarantee for a peaceful and prosperous Europe.
Your attachment to the core values of justice, human rights and the dignity of the human being have, for so many years, been the hallmark of your work.
I want to highlight your fairness to everybody, from your insistence that everybody must be treated equally within Parliament to the view that, in the European Union, no one country is bigger than another.
We have all appreciated your honesty and transparency: with Mr Poettering, you know that a done deal is a done deal and one which he will honour and respect.
His experience as one of the longest-serving Members of this House will be of immense value to all of us.
No one knows this House and its ways better than him.
Mr President, you have always served this House with excellence, as an ardent defender of the interests of Europe and its citizens, and have thus promoted the European Parliament's standing.
Mr President, let me highlight what I think will be a special responsibility for your mandate.
You are the first President elected in this Parliament after this great enlargement of the European Union.
You assume your office immediately after the conclusion of the fifth enlargement of the European Union with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
That is why this is a truly historic moment: the first President elected by a Parliament representing the citizens of 27 countries.
No other parliament in the world can compare to this.
I should like to make a personal remark.
Yesterday I was in Ljubljana, Slovenia, together with the current President of the Council, Chancellor Merkel, and many colleagues from the European Council, and I was really moved by the enthusiasm of the Slovenian citizens, who have now joined the euro area.
I was also moved by the enthusiasm and the dynamism that the new members of the European Union bring to our Union.
That is why I believe that our joint task is to make all Europe united, with no first- and second-class countries, with no first- and second-class citizens - and you may count on our cooperation to achieve this task.
I have no advice to give you: you have been involved in European politics longer than I - even if you look younger, you are not so young!
(Laughter)
However, let me use my experience as President of another European institution - the European Commission - to make a personal comment: today's Union requires, more than ever, a spirit of partnership among all European institutions.
This Union is much more complex than before: it takes time and patience to find the necessary consensus.
It is sometimes difficult; sometimes it is controversial and even painful, but we need, more than ever, this spirit of partnership.
No European institution can build its prestige and standing at the expense of another institution.
It is in the common interest of all the European institutions to reinforce each other in the service of the European project.
This is specifically true for relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission, because we know that the cause of greater and deeper European integration has been advanced only when there has been this spirit of cooperation among our institutions.
That is why I call for a great coalition of all those who stand for Europe and its values, including, of course, some on the left, some on the right and some in the centre, whose ideological differences contribute to the richness of Europe as a political system, but who are also able to go beyond those ideological differences and share what I believe is our common goal: a strong, united Europe for peace, democracy and human rights.
(Applause)
Mr President of the Commission, thank you for your remarks.
You can certainly always count on the President of the European Parliament, and indeed the whole European Parliament, as a fair partner.
We have different roles to play, but we have the same ambition: to make Europe united, so we can defend our values and interests.
(DE) Several Members have made reference in their speeches to the equality of status enjoyed by both the larger and smaller Member States of the European Union.
On Thursday afternoon, on my way home from Strasbourg to OsnabrÃŒck in Lower Saxony, I shall be paying my first visit to Luxembourg, with the intention of thereby emphasising the equality of all Member States, and also of highlighting Luxembourg's great commitment to Europe.
Its people, its citizens, have said 'yes' to the constitutional treaty, and we must never forget the countries that have done that.
We now have to convince the ones that have not yet decided and those that have said 'no'.
That is the task that we all, together, now face.

Order of business
As this is the first time I have presided over this House, allow me to start by thanking you for your applause, for your welcome and for the trust you have placed in me.
The final draft agenda has been distributed.
The following amendment has been proposed:
Wednesday:
I have received, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a request for the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Pervenche BerÃšs on greater convergence of supervisory practices at European Union level (Î-0126/2006 - Î6-449/2006), which was planned for today's debate, to be postponed to a later sitting, so that it can be examined jointly with the oral question to the Council on the same subject.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate you on your election.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to put a question both to the Council and to the Commission regarding the convergence of supervisory practices.
However, the question to the Council has clearly got lost in the preparations for the Conference of Presidents.
We are still happy to be able to debate these kinds of subjects with the Commission, but there is a major issue at stake in the matter that we are discussing, including for the German Presidency.
We are therefore counting on its support to find a slot in the agenda of one of our forthcoming sittings so that we can deal at the same time with the oral question submitted to the Commission and with the one submitted to the Council on this absolutely crucial issue of the convergence of supervisory practices in the field of financial markets.
I am also counting on the support of the presidency of this Parliament to obtain a good slot for this debate.
(Parliament approved the requested postponement)
Development of the Community's railways - Certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community - International rail passengers' rights and obligations (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways and Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure (05895/2/2006 C6-0309/2006 (Rapporteur: Georg Jarzembowski);
the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community (05893/5/2006 C6-0310/2006 (Rapporteur: Gilles Savary);
the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on international rail passengers' rights and obligations (05892/1/2006 C6-0311/2006 (Rapporteur: Dirk Sterckx).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Madam Secretary of State, speaking as rapporteur for this House, I recommend to it that, tomorrow, the national railway networks should be not only opened up to cross-border passenger trains run by all railway companies, irrespective of their country of origin or of whether they are state-owned or private - which is what the Council envisages - but also that they should be opened up for the purposes of passenger traffic within the country at a later date.
This is the line that this House has been taking ever since 2003.
We have always taken the view that the European internal market must be made, once and for all, in the railway sector as well, thus making possible, by way of fair competition among railway companies, more and better-value service for railway travellers.
By way of a concession, Madam Secretary of State, to the Council - which still has its own misgivings about opening up the networks to private passenger traffic at too early a juncture - the committee is now proposing 2017 as the date for networks to be opened up to domestic traffic.
It is also the intention that those states that acceded as recently as 1 May 2004 or later should be able to extend this deadline by another five years in order to give their railway companies more time to prepare themselves for the internal market and for the competition that it brings.
We ought really to agree that, for the Member States, ten or fifteen years really ought to be enough to reorganise their railway companies in such a way as to meet demand and the needs of their customers, for the public are entitled to efficient and good-value passenger transport within their own countries as much as anywhere else; after all, without that, the railway sector will be unable to compete against cars and aircraft and thereby have a future.
Apart from a few minor amendments, the Committee on Transport and Tourism agrees with the Council and the Commission that the Member States must be allowed not to open up - or to open up only partially - their networks if their being opened up would endanger regional and local passenger traffic; that is where we agree, for regional and local transport are of vital importance to the public, not least for environmental reasons.
We do not agree, however, Madam President-in-Office, when it comes to the great big package that the Council has come up with in order to further limit the opening up of networks.
The committee proposes that the introduction of the 'principal purpose' criterion and the giving of pre-eminence to long-term concessions be rejected.
I am very pleased to note from Annex II to the Common Position, that the Portuguese presidency took exactly the same view as Parliament on this, for, if one weighs up the demands of the internal market - which should have become a reality a long time ago - against the special interests of public passenger and regional transport, it becomes apparent that the special rules imposed to secure the latter's position already do enough to restrict the opening up of networks.
The committee did not do as I recommended and do away outright with the mandatory levy on all types of passenger transport to the benefit of public local service providers - which the Council surprised us by inserting - and instead recommended amendments to it.
In the conciliation procedure, Parliament and the Council need, together, to consider to what extent such a mandatory levy is actually justified by the facts of the situation and the system's requirements, or whether, on the other hand, it risks being no more than a pretext for deliberate restrictions on the deregulation of the networks.
The committee also recommends the incorporation of the new rules on transit, the acceptance of the derogations for Malta and Cyprus, and the amended wordings for amending Directive 2001/14/EC in the interests of the more effective planning of high-speed routes.
Through you, Commissioner and Vice-President Barrot, I appeal to the Commission to endorse the substance of this House's proposals, since I see the statements made to the committee by your staff, to the effect that they could see no reason for the networks to be opened up to domestic traffic as well, as going against convictions that the Commission has held for many years.
I would remind you of the celebrated White Paper on the European single market that the Commission published in 1985.
It will be evident to anyone who remembers what is in it that the principle has applied ever since that it is not the completion of the internal market, but resistance to it, that needs to be justified, and no such justification has been forthcoming from you.
Finally, let me say that I do not believe that the Presidency of the Council will accept Parliament's proposals in toto, and so I appeal to it to set the conciliation procedure in motion without delay, if at all possible, as soon as February, so that we can get this wrapped up before the German presidency ends in the summer.
I believe that this third railway package is what the public and European businesses need, let us work together to get it adopted by the summer.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to present to you my report on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community.
I would like firstly to say that this is an exemplary issue, an extremely unusual one, because we are talking about the transposition into Community law of a sectoral social agreement, in this case a prior agreement between the European rail companies and rail employees.
All of this is laid down in the texts but, generally speaking, in our certainty, we quite often avoid this agreement between the railwaymen and the bosses of the rail companies, or more generally between the employees and the management, when really we should stop avoiding it when everybody feels affected by a European project and a directive.
I am one of those who believe that, in order to create the Europe of the railways that is so essential, the railway workers need to be in favour of that Europe and to have the conviction that, far from starting a kind of economic civil war amongst rail companies, its purpose is to develop the railways.
The text presented is entirely exemplary.
I would also say to Mr Jarzembowski, because we have always disagreed on this subject, that simply laying down dates for liberalisation is not sufficient to create a European internal market.
This battle of dates is terribly restrictive.
In order to create the internal market, we must first ensure that trains are interoperable, which requires considerable funding before anything else.
In this regard, it seems to me that the liberalisation train is travelling much faster than the budget train or the interoperability train.
Returning to the directive, it will have little impact on Great Britain because there is only one tunnel entering its territory and it has little in the way of land borders.
It will not affect Spain very much because it has a different gauge of rails.
It will not affect certain other countries that do not necessarily have direct rail borders with the Union: I am thinking of Finland and Greece.
Liberalisation is therefore basically about interoperability, and my report relates to human interoperability, that is to say, the recognition of a train driver's licence throughout the Union's territory.
I would like to thank the Members for doing such remarkable work.
I would like to make the following comments with regard to the directive.
First of all, we are talking about a licence for the whole of the network and not simply for the international network, since we believe that all train drivers should be able to aspire to move on to international level and that there is little difference between driving a TGV, a high-speed train, within one of the Member States and driving one that crosses the border.
I believe that that is absolutely essential.
Next, Parliament's great contribution - which also led to a disagreement with the Council - is that we believe that crew members who carry out safety duties must be taken into account in a subsequent text, and we propose a road map.
Lives are regularly saved by crew members who have learnt a number of tasks: the evacuation of trains, the protection of passengers, signalling, the activation of certain alarm circuits.
It is entirely legitimate for these qualified people to be recognised and, above all, for us to attempt to harmonise their qualifications in all European countries in order to prevent any of them from being under-qualified.
This is a safety issue and not just a social issue.
Parliament has made a proposal on this subject, and we believe that it is very important to do so now: we are dealing with a world in which there is more than one rail company, and, since we are creating a Europe of railways, it is entirely legitimate to lay down rules on compensation that are applicable between rail companies when they exchange staff who they have trained.
In other words, when a company spends a lot on training a driver and that driver leaves the company for another company within two years, we need minimum rules to oblige the company taking on that driver to partly repay the company that trained him.
Since there is no railways university, training is currently provided by certain companies, principally the historic companies, and companies who are joining the market should not be able to benefit by becoming more competitive at less cost.
Commissioner, I believe that the European Parliament's proposals are right.
I am entirely aware of the disagreements that remain with the Council, in particular the ones I have just mentioned regarding the scope.
Nevertheless, I believe that Parliament's position is the right one.
I would remind you that our fellow Members, from all political groups, voted unanimously in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
We therefore have a strong position, which we will uphold in conciliation, just as we will in relation to the other dossiers, such as that of Mr Jarzembowski. I understand that he is in favour of liberalisation, though I do not understand ...
(The President asked the speaker to conclude)
I simply wished to say 'yes' to liberalisation, provided that it is regulated and that public services are preserved.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the purport of the reports that are here before us is to make European rail more attractive to its users.
One of the things that have for years provided the European Union with an enormous boost in this respect is the opening up of the market, which brings more investments to the railways and improves the quality of the services on offer, and it is to this, in fact, that the work related to the resolution on passenger rights relates.
Since the Commission's proposal, much has been done at first reading and also with the Council's common position and the vote in our Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I would like to extend warm thanks to the fellow Members who have taken part, more particularly the shadow rapporteurs, for the contribution they have made to this report.
As I see it, we are now drafting a comprehensive and viable set of rights, which provide for liability on the part of railway companies in the case of accidents - I hope that we will never witness one, but if we do, then this should be taken care of in the same way across Europe.
These rights also provide for areas including the reception of passengers and compensation in the event of delays or cancellations of train connections; accessibility of trains and stations to people with disabilities; rights and regulations with regard to luggage or larger items such as bicycles or buggies; ticket accessibility, in which connection I should like to urge my fellow MEPs not to get carried away and not to compel railway companies to imperil their viability by adopting heavy and prohibitively expensive ticketing systems that are used by very few people.
We should, instead, ensure that tickets are widely accessible and available to people who choose to travel by train.
At the same time, information to passengers should be clear and accessible, and a complaints procedure should be in place which everyone is familiar with and which is easily accessible to everyone.
I should like to ask the President of the Council to talk her colleagues into adding one point, namely that the whole system of rights be made very clear to the citizens and train travellers at the stations and on the trains.
I think we have managed to compile a very balanced set of rights.
Where we still have differences of opinion with the Council, I hope that we can reach a compromise in conciliation based on sound dialogue.
There is, however, one important difference of opinion between the Council and Parliament: we cannot understand why all these rights will not apply to all railway passengers.
If somebody has an accident and sustains an injury, does it matter whether they are on a train that is crossing a national border or not?
Liability must be provided for in a clear and understandable manner to all train passengers within the European Union.
Trains or stations should be accessible, whether I wanted to board the train in a wheelchair or whether this train travelled from Hanover to Amsterdam or from Hanover to Berlin.
I should therefore like to ask the Council to abandon its position in this respect and to ensure that all railway passengers have the rights they deserve.
After all, every European citizen would then know, wherever they board a train in the European Union, that they would be entitled to a set of basic rights.
They would know that, when they board a train, they would be able to enjoy the EU's diversity with peace of mind.
Since it is this diversity of the European Union, as Mrs Merkel stated this morning, that constitutes the soul of Europe, we would like to encourage everyone to get acquainted with this soul of Europe by train, if possible.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Federal Minister, Mr Tiefensee, who is unfortunately unable to be with us due to an important appointment, I would like to express my gratitude for this opportunity to address you all today.
The German Presidency of the Council is just getting under way and already, with the upcoming vote on the proposals for the Third Railway Package, we have before us on the agenda one of the most important dossiers of this six months' Presidency in the field of transport.
These three measures will bring us a significant step closer to the complete opening up of the market and thus to the completion of the European railway area, continuing what we began together with the first programmes of measures.
Through the First Railway Package, adopted in 2001, we made it possible for individual rail freight companies to make practical, independent use of neighbouring railway networks in cross-border traffic.
Adopting the Second Railway Package brought us to a further milestone on our journey towards the realisation of a single market in railways in Europe, something which is urgently needed.
Thus, on 1 January 2007, the opening up of markets for freight traffic became a reality.
This step represents great progress in which the Council and Parliament can take pride in equal measure.
This opening up of markets is made urgently necessary by the tremendous rate at which freight traffic is increasing, but that will hardly be news to you.
According to the Commission's estimates, there will be a 45% increase in road freight traffic by 2020, which would mean an extra 1.5 million lorries on the roads.
The railways, by contrast, still have great potential available for us to exploit.
We therefore urgently need, above all, to get more freight transported by rail.
If the opening up of the markets is to be more than just a date, we need to invigorate the process and put all our energies into ensuring that those obstacles still in place are quickly removed.
One part of this is also to ensure that it is also possible, in reality, to employ the staff carrying out freight transport operations - in particular the train drivers - on a cross-border basis without obstacles.
Regulations of this nature have been laid down in what is termed the directive on the certification of train drivers, on which a decision is now due.
I see no major differences between the positions of the Council and Parliament in respect of this piece of legislation, although there are a couple of points I would like to make.
Firstly, the committee now seeks to ensure - by means of amending Article 1 of the directive - that staff not working as train drivers but performing safety-related tasks are also required to undergo certification.
In principle, this approach is correct.
The question, however, is to whom it is to apply.
The phrase 'other crew members performing safety-related tasks' is so vague that we are at a complete loss to say who exactly it would cover.
In my opinion, it is worth clearing this up before doing anything else.
Only then can we decide under what conditions and on what terms a certificate is necessary.
The Council's Common Position did take account of this issue.
The Common Position stipulates that the European Railway Agency (ERA) should examine whether additional staff should be certified.
The ERA can thus help us to work out under what conditions it makes sense to certify staff other than train drivers.
We should await the results of the ERA's investigation before we rush to include this item in the directive prematurely.
Secondly, it is proposed in Amendment 23 that, if a train driver moves to a different undertaking, there should be statutory compensation for training costs.
There is a consensus between the Council and Parliament on this matter as far as content in concerned.
Yet why should we regulate this matter through legislation, when contractual solutions could be much more effective?
It is envisaged in the Council's Common Position that management and labour should regulate the transfer of training costs contractually.
To that extent there are, in fact, no differences.
I would now like to move on to the second piece of legislation in the Third Railway Package, namely the proposal relating to the rights and obligations of passengers, which aims not only to improve the rights of consumers but also to promote the long-term attractiveness of railway use within the Community.
The significance of this proposed regulation for those with mobility disabilities should also be pointed out, as the regulation would make rail travel considerably easier for them.
The Council's Common Position overlaps, in many respects, with what your House is calling for, in, for example, taking up the COTIF/CIV provisions on the liability of railway undertakings for personal injury or damage to baggage and the conclusion of transport contracts.
There are, however, differences, in particular when it comes to the scope of the regulation.
By way of deviation from the Common Position, the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling for the regulation to apply, in principle, to domestic rail traffic.
It was, however, particularly difficult to reach agreement on this point in the Council.
It is the Presidency's view that the compromise embodied by the Common Position ought therefore not to be jeopardised.
The same applies to the third and final legislative strand of the Third Railway Package, the directive on liberalisation.
The Common Position, which we have reached with all the Member States through considerable effort, provides for the opening up of international markets for passenger transport, including cabotage in connection with international journeys, as of 2010, but initially without opening up the national networks.
It is very much to be welcomed that your House's Committee on Transport and Tourism agrees with the date of 2010.
On the very difficult topic of opening up the national networks, your House has proposed a new compromise.
Although I very much commend such a move, we do have serious doubts about the possibility of reaching agreement on the basis of this compromise proposal.
In this regard, the compromise proposal also represents a move away from the step-by-step approach that has characterised the liberalisation so far, and so it is to be feared that many Member States will fail to see the new compromise as a compromise at all.
In the case of the opening up of national rail networks, the question must be asked as to whether we are not asking too much of many of the Member States.
In the light of the desired joint approval of all three legislative proposals, we must allow ourselves to ask whether, by pushing for the highest requirements in relation to passenger transport, we are not ruining the much more urgently required solutions for freight transport.
I am aware that it will not be easy to reach agreement on this issue.
Europe's passenger rail services must be attractive and reliable.
Parliament and the Council therefore need to recognise their joint responsibility and live up to it.
I think I can say that the Third Railway Package is so important to all of us that all of us must surely have an interest in coming to an agreement.
The German Presidency of the Council will be pulling out all the stops to make it a success and to realise the integrated rail area that we desperately need.
To do so does require bold changes, but it also calls for a sense of proportion and a little patience from time to time.
The Council and Parliament have, in the past, often proven their good faith and achieved mutually acceptable compromises from mutually opposing positions.
We are not afraid of searching out a durable compromise through a sensible conciliation process.
However, I call on Parliament not to introduce a large number of material amendments and thereby make reaching a consensus an almost impossible task before we begin.
I think I have got the message through.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with the progress made on this third railways package since March 2004.
We are talking about a raft of legislative proposals that are technically and legally rather complex.
I would also like specifically to thank Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Stercx, all three of whom have done wonderful work.
Almost three years after the adoption of the initial proposals by the Commission, Parliament and the Council must reach a compromise on all of the texts, as Mrs Roth has just explained very well.
First of all, I would like to stress that, with one exception, the whole legislative package as proposed by the Commission has been maintained by Parliament and the Council.
There is a general philosophy underpinning these proposals that will make it possible to Europeanise the railways.
I would add that the new proposal on public service obligations has also made good progress, even though it is not on today's agenda, and I believe that a reading of the third railways package in parallel with this proposal will make it possible to reach an overall compromise at the end of the legislative procedure.
Everybody will have to work hard, of course, as you have said, Minister.
The Commission is prepared to do so, and your Commissioner will endeavour to play a mediating role.
I would now like to make a few comments on the three reports.
I would like firstly to thank Mr Jarzembowski.
The Commission is pleased that the Council and Parliament have reached a consensus on the opening up of the market in international services with cabotage, which will take place in 2010, as the Commission proposed.
On the other hand, the opening up of the market in domestic services raises certain problems.
In 2004, the Commission was pleased to propose the opening up of the market in international services.
On the basis of its analysis, it concluded that the financial and legislative conditions were not in place to justify a broader opening up.
It should be pointed out that the operation of domestic lines, and particularly regional lines in certain European Union countries, is especially problematic and is not yet profitable.
It is true, Mr Jarzembowski, that the introduction of more competition in this market is beneficial in terms of increasing the efficiency of operation, but we are forced to achieve it by means of harmonised regulation of public service obligations.
We are not, therefore, in any way opposed to the principle of opening up the market in domestic services, but we believe that, within the framework of this third rail package, there is the risk that a decision would be premature.
We would like to assess this issue in the light of a more detailed analysis and we would like to take account of other elements contained in the proposal on public service obligations for which Mr Meijer is rapporteur.
That is why we have reservations about the opening up of domestic traffic, Mr Jarzembowski.
On the other hand, I can support a number of Parliament's amendments to other articles of the text, such as the extension to fifteen years of the period in force of framework agreements for the awarding of services in the case of specialised infrastructures.
Furthermore, we are in favour of changing the wording of the article on framework agreements, the clarification of the scope of the levy to be paid for the funding of public services as well as the methods laid down for that purpose, and also the replacement of the concept of economic balance with that of profitability for the analysis of the possible impact of cabotage on an existing public service within the framework of an international service.
That is what I wished to say about this first proposal on which Mr Jarzembowski has worked so hard.
The second proposal is that of Mr Savary, which I know has been unanimously supported by the committee.
As Mr Savary quite rightly pointed out, this proposal makes it possible to implement human interoperability, which is just as important as the interoperability of equipment.
You have restored the scope proposed by the Commission at the outset.
In an increasingly open rail network, we feel that it is important to ensure that crew members - who, as you have pointed out, are qualified personnel, responsible for the safety of trains, and not only drivers - are properly trained and in an adequate state of health.
I have also taken note of Mrs Roth's comments, but I believe that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement.
I would like, Mr Savary, to express a few reservations with regard to certain amendments relating to the funding of training.
You have proposed that a rail company employing a train driver whose training has been totally or partially funded by another rail company, which that driver has left voluntarily after less than five years' activity, should repay part of the cost of the training to the company that has provided it.
We agree in principle, but it is true that the amendment raises problems, legal problems in particular - is that not the case with a more contractual approach?
The Commission is wary about involving itself in an area for which we do not really have any factual data; we are not fully aware of the scale of the problem or the possible options for resolving it.
Having expressed that reservation, Mr Savary, we agree with this proposal, which has been backed unanimously within the committee.
I shall now turn to the report by Mr Sterckx on international rail passengers' rights and obligations.
The first problem relates to the scope and its extension to domestic services.
Mrs Roth has just explained to us that that scope posed certain problems within the Council.
I would like to say, however, Mr Sterckx, that I believe that we must accept that it is impossible to distinguish the sections from the different slots, because otherwise users will never know what their rights are, as you have quite rightly pointed out.
The Commission will therefore support your amendments and will assist in reaching a compromise with the Council on this point.
Furthermore, an approach that leaves more freedom for the Member States for all rail services subject to public service contracts seems logical and should facilitate that compromise.
The other issue is civil liability in the event of accidents.
Your desire to establish strict liability for rail companies would bring their liability into line with that of air companies.
In that regard, it clearly reflects the Commission's approach, and I can therefore support this ambitious proposal, even though it goes further than the COTIF/CIM regime.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, our services will forward you the Commission's detailed position on each amendment.
The Commission will naturally listen carefully to your debate and be at your disposal with regard to any issues that may be raised.
I shall conclude by reiterating what you have said, Minister.
I believe that we must all get to work on concluding this third rail package.
It would be a real shame to miss this opportunity to re-evaluate Europe's railways.
We need the railways so that we can transfer some of the freight to them from the roads.
It is essential that this third rail package is not derailed and that it arrives at its destination.
I would like to thank you all for the excellent work you have done so far and I promise that I will do everything I can to lead it to a successful conclusion.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend a warm welcome to Mrs Roth as President-in-Office of the Council.
As the rapporteur and also the Commissioner have already explained, the European licence for train drivers on which we are to vote tomorrow represents an important step towards the opening-up of rail transport throughout Europe.
The licence for train drivers forms part of the third railway package, which also includes two other legislative procedures we consider important, namely the one on passenger compensation and the one on the opening-up of cross-border passenger transport from 2010.
These three legislative procedures create the essential preconditions for successfully implementing the full liberalisation of rail transport in the EU.
The European licence for train drivers takes on particular importance in the light of the EU-wide opening of freight-transport markets that entered into force at the start of this year. It will save time and money.
At present, each of the 27 Member States of the EU has different requirements for which members of train crew require certification and for the means of certification.
Up to now, the recognition of the various licences for train drivers has involved a great deal of bureaucracy, but it is to be hoped that the EU-wide standardisation in question will eliminate these problems.
A further advantage of this European licence for train drivers is that it will significantly improve the free movement of railway workers and also improve railway safety.
However, this licence will only be a real success if, in the final reckoning, it also reduces bureaucracy - and we have set the course for this as well.
For example, we have been able to avoid bringing in certification for the whole crew, as some had wanted.
We shall now have certification of train drivers as a first step, and of crew members performing safety-related tasks as a second - which the Commissioner had not considered a good solution.
The European Railway Agency is to decide what form this second step should take on the basis of the experience acquired up to that date.
This is our position.
We have also managed to move the date of introduction forward to the end of this year, as prompt introduction will save railway undertakings money.
We have had to accept a compromise on the Annexes dealing with the technical aspects - but it is one that makes perfect sense, and so it has our support.
I find this very satisfactory.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for his constructive cooperation.
We shall be supporting this report tomorrow in plenary.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I represent the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and our approach to the problem is as follows.
As regards Mr Jarzembowski's report, we are very much concerned about railway regeneration and are committed to it.
We understand regeneration as making better use of the railways' potential and reaping the benefit of the positive contribution they could make to a European transport system.
We have passengers' interests very much at heart, including the need to make railways accessible to all social groups from both the technical and the economic point of view.
Finally, we believe it is very important for railways to be able to provide a wider range of attractive services on the market.
One way of achieving this is to allow competition between railways on the international market.
We therefore perceive liberalisation as a means to an end, not as an end in itself.
We are in favour of the liberalisation of international services in 2010, and would like to emphasise that international services are at issue, not simply cross-border ones.
We can accept the Council's position and its proposal concerning the role of national regulatory bodies and monitoring of the provision of public services.
We can also accept all the provisions designed to ensure efficient operation of national passenger service systems.
We tabled an amendment concerning submission, in 2012, of a report assessing the effects of the 2010 liberalisation.
Our ideas are in line with those Commissioner Barrot was kind enough to put forward.
We expect a lot from that report.
The issue of the possible liberalisation of domestic services gave rise to much debate within the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
As a major compromise, we suggest that the possibility of liberalisation in the years 2017-2022 be considered, for the Fifteen and the EU as a whole respectively.
The group is divided on this issue.
We do believe, however, that it is important to send out the message that Europe is interested in creating a European transport system.
We were also delighted to hear from the Minister that the Council is ready to seek a compromise and a way of reaching agreement.
My group also warmly welcomed Commissioner Barrot's stance and his statement that the Commission wishes to be actively involved.
As I conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their efforts.
Thank you all.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many years ago we agreed to create a common European area characterised by free movement within its borders of persons, goods, capital and services, and we have unquestionably made progress over the years since then, but we still have a lot to do in order to make what we proposed a reality.
One of the outstanding tasks is precisely the one we are discussing today: opening up passenger services by rail to the common European area.
We are talking about a service that affects the citizens directly and we must therefore act prudently in order to prevent the achievement of our objective from creating so much harm that the expected benefits are no longer worthwhile.
As in the case of other kinds of liberalisation, we must be careful and patient so that our decisions allow for a sufficient margin to adapt to the changes and do not have a negative effect on any basic public service.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is entirely in favour of opening up international services to the market, as the Commission proposed, as did the Council in its common position, but we also want other national services to be liberalised and for that to be included in this amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC that we are debating.
With regard to this last aspect, we know that many people, including our French colleagues and others, fear that free competition may have a negative impact on the provision of the less profitable internal rail services.
We share that concern and therefore, although we are going to vote in general for the Committee on Transport and Tourism's amendments, we are going to vote in favour of Amendment 37 so that in 2012, on the basis of two years of experience in the liberalisation of international services, the Commission will present us with a report analysing, five years in advance, the state of preparation of the opening up of the market in passenger services within the States.
We are also going to reject Amendment 18, because it seems to us to be reasonable to be able to limit for a maximum period of up to fifteen years the right of international services to cabotage when that means competing with another previous State concession awarded by means of a transparent and open public procedure.
We are going to argue that the introduction of new international services that represent competition should not affect the economic viability of the current regional and local rail services, and also that rules could be established to be met by both State and international services and which will be intended to compensate for public service obligations.
We also want to encourage private initiative to invest in the development of railways and, to that end, we propose that framework agreements on the award of rail services may last for fifteen years, and more in cases of large investments in specialised infrastructures that present an annual repayment plan that justify that exceptional duration.
I would like to end by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, for the work they have done.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mrs Merkel and Mr Barrot, I am extremely pleased that three of my colleagues, with whom I initially had the honour of participating in drafting the third rail package, have very successfully prepared the second reading.
I say 'successfully' because, firstly, the package has been preserved and, secondly, because the European Parliament is rigorously keeping to the line that in the future Europe we cannot apply differing standards as between so-called international transport and domestic transport.
Passengers in Europe should have the same protection whether they are crossing a state border or not.
Thinking about liberalisation in the passenger transport market, we need to be principled.
If the European Union internal market exists, then it exists also in internal transport.
It cannot be that in the services or goods market sector we say that there is a single internal European Union market, but that here the market is confined within Member States' borders.
If I look with the eyes of a citizen of the Baltic States at this third rail package and ask what will change for me as a customer, then the Council's common position would give me the reply that nothing will change.
For just as the Baltic is disconnected from the European Union's electricity network, so is it also disconnected from the European Union's international rail transport system.
Parliament must therefore be ready to go to the conciliation procedure, thinking of those with special needs, as well as of passengers in western and central Europe, and those in the eastern periphery.
In my view, we also need to find some new solution regarding the quality of rail freight transport, but this is a matter for the future.
Thank you.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, until now, unrestricted travel through Europe, from Lisbon to Tallinn, from London to Athens, from Paris to Warsaw, has been possible only by road or air.
The rail network, on the other hand, resembles a patchwork quilt with 27 patches, and so the railways are being left behind.
The national networks should be opened up.
At the same time, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants to be sure that social and environmental interests are also safeguarded.
In addition, we must learn from the mistakes made in the United Kingdom and Estonia, for example, where it was not only the networks that were opened up: the infrastructure was privatised, too.
That was a disaster.
For this reason, and also based on our experience of the monopoly structures of European electricity companies, we say that an essential requirement should be that the infrastructure remain in the public sector.
Europe cannot be content with the present situation on the railways - and customers certainly cannot.
An international European licence for train drivers is nothing short of exotic.
Nor is it acceptable that I am promoting the use of French trains on the German network whilst France is closing its network to other providers.
Thanks to the European licence for train drivers, it will no longer be necessary to change drivers at the border between Member States.
Passengers' rights should be strengthened in the passenger rail services of all EU Member States, with the possibility of legally enforceable claims for compensation in the event of delays.
All trains - including high-speed trains such as the French TGV and the German ICE - should have a multi-purpose compartment to enable the carriage of sports equipment and bicycles on board.
Comprehensive information on European rail services and the option of buying tickets to anywhere in Europe should be the rule rather than the exception.
Access is to be guaranteed for people with reduced mobility.
National railway networks should be opened up for long-distance passenger transport, too, by 2017 at the latest - or 2022 in the case of the new Member States.
We shall be making our consent to this conditional upon the following, however: there must be no social dumping or destructive competition.
We know that the opening-up of the networks has meant a substantial increase in rail freight transport, but we also know that those Member States which have shut themselves off have recorded a decrease.
There are only five approved railway undertakings in France, and the tonne-kilometres transported in that country fell by 28% between 1999 and 2005.
There are more than 700 approved railway undertakings in Germany, and freight transport there increased by 25% in the same period, whilst the figure for the Netherlands was even upwards of 40%.
These are real success stories.
We want to replicate these positive results in passenger transport, and that is why we want to see networks opened up for European passenger transport, too.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues for their cooperation.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, long before the European Union entered into existence, we enjoyed good cooperation on the railways, with cross-border, long-distance train services, with people being able to buy direct tickets to far-flung destinations in their own countries and an international time table being available in every country.
This good state of affairs is now under threat.
The European rail network is in a state of constant disintegration of a kind currently seen in the USA.
Soon, we will be left with only metropolitan district networks and high-speed links between the major cities.
On 27 and 28 September 2005, at first reading, this Parliament missed an historic opportunity to retain and strengthen sound European coordination and high-standard services by going too far in its voting and by not going as far as the Commission suggested in the area of protecting passenger rights.
In Amendment 37 on passenger rights, the right for train travellers to be able to purchase integrated railway passes for the entire railway network of the European Union was replaced by a call for voluntary cooperation.
This is how railway companies are given the freedom to curtail the sale of tickets for, and information relating to, far-away destinations, and, to an increasing degree, to restrict passenger-friendly offers for travelling abroad.
Last year, three major Member States abolished their Euro Domino Cards that afforded residents of other states better access to their railway networks.
InterRail passes for travelling around the whole of Europe, which were mainly popular among young people for getting to know other countries of Europe, are granting less and less access to fast, long-distance trains.
The public no longer have any concept of the overall shape of European railways.
Since state monopolies have fallen by the wayside, the European railway business is being split up into a number of companies that are competing with each other on the same territory.
As a result, years of cooperation have turned this territory into a battleground and cross-border links are being thinned out or discontinued altogether.
The European Union is sitting on the fence as long as it continues to assume that, on the basis of Article 5 of Directive 91/4401, railway companies must be run as trading companies and must, on this basis, seek to reduce costs as their main priority.
This is how we drive train travellers away to air travel for medium-long distances.
The more public transport relies on the market, the smaller its chance of survival becomes.
Not only the advent of cars and a widely available motorway network, but also tax exemption for aircraft fuel and the advent of price-cutting airlines has meant that rail transport is considered expensive in relative terms.
In order to survive, rail must be made appealing to younger generations.
If that generation starts to experience the car and aviation as normal and considers the train as an inaccessible museum piece, railway will only become more loss-making and will need to reduce their costs even more.
Those who expect that the position of railway is reinforced by inflicting the same mechanisms of competition on it as on air and road travel will end up catching a cold.
This development is as detrimental to passengers and railway staff as it is to the protection of our environment.
I am aware that for many years, Mr Jarzembowski has been fighting for more market and for more competitive companies being admitted more quickly to the rail network, not only in cross-border freight transport, but also in domestic passenger transport.
He claimed that, if his wishes were not met in the first railway package in 2001, he would continue to fight in order to get what he wants eventually in the third package. My group has never supported him in this.
In Amendment 35, my group has suggested not to go along with Mr Jarzembowski's liberalisation report and, in the event of it being adopted, to at least enable the Member States to restrict competition. This can be done by adopting Amendments 33, 34 and 36, which have been drafted with that in mind.
With regard to the Sterckx report, we support the wishes of the European consumer organisation in our Amendments 70 to 73.
Finally, only the Savary report, which makes it possible for train drivers to cross borders more easily and work under technically different circumstances, is a valuable contribution to the integration of European rail.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, all this week we have been told that this is a bright new dawn, with Parliament having a new President and Members.
However, as this report demonstrates, we still have 'leaves on the line'.
At the first reading in 2005, Mr Sterckx said that we must not tinker with international agreements that are already satisfactory.
I would therefore remind him that the COTIF Convention is a practical agreement between 42 individual nations, including many non-EU nations, to facilitate railway travel between them, yet today Mr Sterckx wants this agreement to be derailed. He is lingering under the impression that neither Member States nor domestic rail companies are capable of establishing codes of passenger rights on their own.
That is certainly not true in the UK.
Mr Sterckx says this is really about consumer rights, yet it is conceded that more regulation means higher fares.
Why do my countrymen need EU regulations when they get higher fares?
But Mr Sterckx has not drawn up a report about consumer rights. It is about EU control.
The rapporteur says there is no point in drawing up regulations which only apply to the 5% of rail passengers who use international services, so why are we doing this?
There is a lot of EU regulation which will not affect the vast majority of people with no cross-border interests, but which at the same time damages the ability to provide domestic services.
In the EU, Mr Sterckx, the cross-border distinction is irrelevant, and until the EU gravy train finally hits the buffers, it is all unstoppable.
Behind all this week's self-congratulation, that remains the real truth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this speech celebrates the end of the well-known discrimination against those who used to be Non-attached Members.
It is also the first speech on behalf of the new Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group regarding a tabled report.
I shall therefore take this opportunity to point out that several million European citizens are at last no longer just half-represented, and that should be a source of satisfaction to those who claim to be fully democratic and who perhaps, in many EU countries, at least until the fall of the Berlin Wall, were and perhaps still are proud to share their responsibilities, ideals and so on with the Communist International.
Anyway, to return to the subject of our debate on the development of the Community's railways, we are against liberalisation, not least in view of all the dreadful experiences that have resulted from liberalisation in a number of countries.
We cannot therefore support the proposals of the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, on those aspects.
We consider the reciprocity clause to be essential; otherwise liberalisation will not correspond at all to the kind of free competition that ought to favour the consumer.
On the subject of passengers' rights and obligations, our ideas substantially coincide with those of Mr Sterckx: we agree with extending the scope of the regulation on passenger rights to include domestic transport.
I am thinking, for example, of how much we need it in my own country, not least because we believe that passengers should not be placed in different categories just because of the rail company they use.
Passengers' dignity and rights should be guaranteed by all services, public or private, that operate within Union territory, and we therefore consider the temporary exemptions provided for in Amendment 22 to be more than sufficient in that respect.
Although the definition of a person with reduced mobility is as broad as it is vague, so much so that it will include several million passengers per day, we agree entirely that rolling stock and stations need to be adapted.
Assistance on board trains is also necessary, perhaps by allowing an accompanying person to travel free of charge, and we are therefore in favour of Amendments 47 and 66.
On the other hand, we are against a number of amendments.
In particular, we do not think it should be made compulsory to have a special compartment for transporting bicycles and sports equipment on every train, especially without any further specification.
We therefore cannot support Amendments 26, 58, 59 or 69.
Lastly, on the subject of licences for rail crews, our group agrees with the approach favouring certification for train drivers, but we are somewhat sceptical about whether it is appropriate to license other crew members as well, as happens in the case of other forms of transport.
Mr President, opening up the rail market to competition is all well and good and, indeed, necessary.
However, if you do not have a sufficient rail infrastructure, it is really a secondary consideration.
In my constituency of Northern Ireland, we benefited from essential improvements on the north-south rail connection from Larne through to the border with the Irish Republic and on to Dublin. That has been done as part of the trans-European network.
However, the other key limb of our infrastructure is languishing in neglect and resulting decline, namely the link from Belfast to our second city, Londonderry.
This is something which I discussed with the Commissioner when he visited Northern Ireland some time ago.
This north-west route, particularly north of Ballymena, has had minimum investment, and mooted expenditure of GBP 10.5 million will not address the essential need for infrastructure improvements but merely arrest further deterioration, leaving us with a network incapable of carrying the necessary fast trains.
What is urgently needed is the inclusion of this north-west line into the TENs programme, followed by the investment and upgrade which could result.
It is for this that I appeal to the Commission.
A rail bridge across the River Foyle would open up the opportunity of a link into Donegal and thereby provide a truly transnational link.
This north-west line must not only be saved but also radically improved and, through TENs, the EU can make a worthwhile contribution.
Finally, on the Savary report, I must say that it seeks to place far too much regulatory burden on the rail industry.
It will provide a tier of EU regulation on top of already adequate national regulation, while providing no benefit, as I see it, to the rail sector or to its users.
(DE) Mr President, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor and President of the Council, gave a brilliant speech in the House this morning.
She showed us in simplified terms that the EU is not a straightforward issue, but it is one that is worth fighting for.
We can confirm both of these aspects specifically in the context of this afternoon's topic.
Raising awareness of our work among the people at home is no simple matter.
They often feel it does not affect them.
Europe is so far away, they say, and this prejudice grows when politicians here join in.
It is a prejudice, however, and therefore incorrect.
In recent days and weeks, large numbers of interested parties and lobbyists have been contacting me and many of my fellow Members repeatedly on this very subject - and are continuing to do so.
The railways have spelt out to us what they want and need, and what they do not want and do not need.
They have shown that Europe does affect them.
Large numbers of consumer representatives have approached us and said what, in their eyes, the public expects and needs.
They, too, feel that Europe affects them.
In addition, very large numbers of workers' and employers' organisations have approached us repeatedly in recent weeks and months; showing that Europe affects their clientele.
Admittedly, all these solicitations have involved widely differing concerns, and this leads to another fundamental problem for our European community.
Trying to reduce everything to a common denominator will complicate things greatly and dilute the matter, and the result will be neither fish nor fowl.
Besides - and this concerns a third element of European legislation - our processes take a very long time.
We know that our railway package, too, will have to go to conciliation.
It will be no easy task to reach agreement there with the Council, and long transitional periods in a number of cases will ultimately mean that it takes even longer.
We should not be discouraged by this, however.
The Sterckx report on passengers' rights is worth fighting for.
We mean to, and shall, succeed in laying down a single legislative text for all passenger services in the EU.
We want financial compensation rather than just fine words.
We also want rights for passengers with disabilities and passengers with reduced mobility.
In this connection, it is important to me that we also see the case of mothers or fathers travelling alone with several young children as a problematic area and offer them help.
It is important to us all, however, that we ultimately achieve a good result, and that European citizens then see that Europe does affect them, and that it is something worth fighting for.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the Members of this House who have contributed from afar or from close by to the result we are discussing today.
As you know, we will take this matter further, and will probably set the conciliation procedure in motion, which will involve quite a bit of work.
Turning to the Sterckx report, I should like to repeat what I said at first reading, namely that we managed to reach a consensus across the party-political divides about the key issues concerning passenger rights.
It may be possible to bridge the chasm that separates us from the Council, which wishes to restrict these rights to international passenger travel by putting in place transitional measures for situations where public service contracts already provide for these passenger rights.
At the same time, we must make sure that these exceptions are very clearly defined and thus prevent this regulation from becoming an empty shell.
Opinions are clearly divided over the Jarzembowski report, not only between the groups, but also within them, since the situation within the railway market and the potential implications of liberalising the national railway market make for very different opinions from one country to the next.
I deeply regret - and this is my personal view - the fact that most of my fellow Members, not least in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, have voted in favour of liberalising national passenger transport.
This is something that has not actually been requested by the sector, something the implications of which have not been properly looked into and something that the Commission, the Council, the trade unions, the consumer organisations, and the Association of European railway companies do not want to see approved today.
I have to tell Mr Sterckx that this is especially the case because we have failed to dispel, in a legally reliable manner, the fear that liberalisation will eat away at the public services in our Member States or render them unaffordable, for the simple reason that new competitors will obviously only be interested in the few profitable lines within the railway market, which will result in a considerable economic loss for the public service provider who will need to attract new sources of income in order to maintain the minor non-profitable lines, or else will be forced to cut these down.
It would have been preferable, as the Commissioner already said, to look at the issue of liberalisation in combination with the Meijer report, so that clear and uniform procedures could be put in place which would allow Member States or regions to offer sections of the network to one particular company in the framework of public service provision contracts.
To vote on liberalisation at this stage, without putting arrangements in place in this area first, is to put the cart before the horse, and this will not work.
Moreover, as I have already said several times, I do not think that the liberalisation of the market is in itself a panacea to get more people to use rail.
In Belgium, for example, the number of train travellers has rocketed in recent years - last year by 6.6% - not because of liberalisation, but as a result of investment in new and comfortable rolling stock and of the adoption of an attractive pricing policy.
(DA) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as my group's rapporteur for the directive on the certification of train drivers, I wish sincerely to support the approach set out by Mr Savary.
For much of the way, the Council has, of course, agreed with Parliament's approach from first reading, so there remain only a few outstanding points on which we can disagree.
The fact is that a common framework for the training of drivers is a logical consequence of the forms of liberalisation already adopted.
The big debate has been about who is to be covered by the Directive on the certification of train drivers.
Is it to be exclusively train drivers, or other staff too?
My group is satisfied with the outcome now before us.
A proper balance has been found whereby train drivers and other staff with a direct involvement in safety are covered.
We also think it important for train drivers to be able to have access to data on themselves.
It is a simple issue of legal certainty, and we attach importance to the proposal that training costs should be refunded if the driver changes jobs shortly after being trained.
The fact is that the training is expensive, and we must not create a system in which a number of train companies can freewheel and systematically avoid paying training costs by recruiting newly trained staff from other companies.
I very much hope that, tomorrow, there will be a large enough majority here in Parliament in favour of the Jarzembowski report's proposal on the liberalisation of passenger transport.
Liberalisation is necessary, and not just of the 5% of passenger transport that crosses borders but also of national passenger transport.
It is necessary if trains in the EU are to be able to deliver a sufficiently competitive alternative to other forms of transport and, in so doing, provide more environmentally friendly and energy-saving transport.
What happens when liberalisation takes place and free competition is brought about?
The passenger is put first, of course.
Punctual trains and good comfortable transport become main objectives and, instead of just being the stuff of slogans and advertisements, become integral to the self-image of the entire train company, which recognises that without customers there is no business.
Passenger rights must apply not only to cross-border, but also to national, transport.
Mr Sterckx has clearly shown that there is no sense in distinguishing between passenger rights in relation to, respectively, national and international transport.
In Denmark, train companies have taken the lead and have already adopted the proposals on passenger rights in the event of delays that we in Parliament have put forward - something, then, that obviously can be done.
(PL) Mr President, in view of the time available I shall only refer to one issue.
The development of Community railways and decisions on railway infrastructure capacity and levies must be governed by the definition of the function of and the demand for the services concerned.
All of this is determined by the economy and the passengers.
Development of the railways should also involve cooperation with other forms of transport.
Such an approach could set the scene for private capital investment and for the European and national subsidies required for long-term investment guaranteeing the development of the railways.
It is appropriate to give priority to subsidising investment in high-speed passenger trains, but the development of freight transport is equally important.
Investment is needed to improve border junctions as part of the effort to create a common market and develop trade beyond our Eastern borders.
Countries like Poland have unused broad gauge track.
Dry container ports could be created at the end of these lines. This would relieve the pressure on the inadequate road network and be beneficial to the environment.
I believe that the ideas contained in Mr Jarzembowski's report will contribute to the process of liberalisation of rail transport and further development in Europe.
(FR) Mr President, as you know, for we Greens it is essential that we implement a genuine European transport policy leading to a modal transfer from the roads to rail.
Road traffic creates 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, and this is therefore a significant challenge.
We should be asking ourselves the following question: is opening up to competition, specifically in passenger transport by rail, going to respond to that challenge?
On the contrary, I believe that the proposals contained in the Jarzembowski report are in danger of leading to a deterioration of the service for users.
Fares, ticketing, information on timetables, management of connections: how are users going to know how to make the most of the different services offered by the rail companies?
We can expect the less profitable lines, which play a fundamental role in terms of social and territorial cohesion, to be abandoned.
We can also expect increased pressure on the working conditions of railway personnel, as is happening in the case of low-cost airlines in the aviation sector, and fierce competition for the most profitable slots, without this having any effect on the final number of passengers transported.
In order to strengthen the railways, we need a genuine European commitment to funding the modernisation of infrastructures, the obsolete nature of which is a major obstacle to their development.
We also need to overcome the obstacles to interoperability and to adopt - and this is crucial - a tax system which genuinely penalises the most polluting forms of transport, such as a tax on kerosene or the internalisation of environmental costs for road transport.
Liberalisation is by no means the only way to Europeanise transport policies.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the debate on the second reading of the third package of measures dealing with the railways.
The composition of the package has been controversial from the outset, a view shared by the social partners and not restricted just to MEPs from the Left.
We have clearly stated on several occasions that the failure to carry out an assessment of the second rail package is a breach of the conditions under which Parliament, jointly with the Commission, adopted it.
Rational debate has been cast aside in this discussion.
Without mentioning the state of the infrastructure and the rolling stock, or the implementation of measures under the Commissioner for Transport's agreement with the Community of European Railways, we are discussing today the highly controversial report by Mr Jarzembowsky on opening up the market for rail transport.
Let me get straight to the point: the Commission and the Council are trying to extend the deadlines in this report or to make them flexible.
In view of this fundamental discrepancy, the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will once again vote against the report.
Above all, there are some dangerous amendments that serve to exacerbate the situation.
On the other hand, we endorse the outstanding reports by Mr Savary and Mr Sterkcx, whom I wish to congratulate, as they take account of the practical situation, along with the demands of the unions and of the pragmatic senior executives.
I wish to reiterate the point that some amendments may make the situation considerably worse.
I believe that the outcome of the vote on this package will reflect similar concerns on the part of the new Member States.
This, among other things, is about making use of transitional periods, and about specifying the conditions of passenger transport services.
I hope that we can soon clarify the problems of the rail freight annex to the Convention Concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), and that we achieve this mainly on the basis of an agreement between the Member States that have ratified it.
The current state of affairs is unsatisfactory.
Perhaps just one further remark; the wording adopted in the Stercx report comes across as an attempt to impose penalties in the event of trains being delayed.
Personally, rather than penalties, I would like to see attempts to comply with a contract of carriage along the lines of the Swiss model, the basis of which is transporting goods and passengers to their destination.
Along with a number of other Members, I shall vote on the amendments with this objective in mind.
Whatever the outcome, I believe that we will be returning again to this issue in the future.
(NL) Mr President, in recent months, opinion on the subject of the third railway package has turned out to be anything but unanimous - in the Council and this House at any rate.
I can understand the Council's cautious attitude, given the differences among Member States and the division of powers within Europe, and can, to a large extent, identify with it.
This does not, though, alter the fact that the Council has not opted for the best solution all round with the future in mind.
The Sterckx and Savary reports definitely have a hand in this, which cannot be said for the Jarzembowski report, in which, as I see it, the balance which the Council had struck between the future market opening and the existing situation, has been broken.
As a result of the amendments in this report, a situation has been created in which for all passenger transport, even though it is phased in time, services can be offered in different ways at the same time.
This can result in profitable lines being cherry-picked at the expense of less profitable ones, a lower quality of service provision and possible safety risks.
By giving Member States the choice between different competition models, the said drawbacks can be avoided.
On behalf of my group, I have tabled two amendments to that effect.
Since, moreover, it is important for existing agreements on time-limited rail services to be respected, Amendment 18 is, in my view, uncalled for.
I hope, although I have my doubts about the likelihood of it, that we will reach the right decision tomorrow.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the railway package is an interesting trilogy, and all trilogies contain an element of drama.
Anyone who knows Mr Jarzembowski will know that he always likes to make sure his proposals are not boring.
The first two proposals attracted a very broad consensus in this House.
I consider it a very good thing that we are talking about the liberalisation of the railways and are discussing the accompanying measures early on.
It would be a shame to make the same mistake as we did with road transport, for example - namely liberalising first and only then looking at where further regulation may be needed.
This also applies to the European licence for train drivers, in my opinion.
It goes without saying that there should be equivalence of training throughout Europe, including for the staff directly entrusted with safety-related tasks.
We can hardly develop a European railway network when requirements for train drivers and criteria differ from country to country.
Mr Savary has largely reflected Parliament's opinion on this, and I should like to thank him for his report.
The same goes for passengers' rights.
Simply put, it would even be sufficient to say that rail transport should be punctual and of high quality.
In many countries, people would be pleased just to see these two requirements met.
Yet we have gone even further.
My concern is that we are perhaps setting the bar a little too high.
Whilst service quality and passenger rights should of course be respected, we should not set our sights too high, when we already know the kind of difficulties the fulfilment of all these requirements entails in international transport, in particular.
In international transport, too, the same rules should apply.
As the Commissioner has already said, it is unacceptable that passengers' rights suddenly change when they cross the border from one country to another.
The proposals regarding people with reduced mobility are particularly good.
I should like to remind the House, however, that the package originally contained a fourth proposal, which has been lost along the way.
We must not forget that a certain level of quality is to be ensured for freight transport, too.
The fact that we have introduced sanctions for this kind of transport must not result in its being neglected across the board for fear of sanctions being introduced in other fields, too.
On the subject of the liberalisation of the market, it goes without saying that international transport, too, must be liberalised.
The same criteria must apply in Paris, Brussels and Cologne.
The issue of domestic operation now arises.
I hail from a small country, Belgium, where we have missed the boat on this to a certain extent, as the major lines are cross-border, for example the Aachen-Brussels line and the line running from Brussels to Antwerp and continuing on to the Netherlands.
One question remains with regard to the small countries, however - as Mr Jarzembowski, too, knows - and that is who is willing and able to pay for these services and how can they be organised?
This question must be dealt with alongside the present package. This can be done within the framework of the Meijer report, before we express our opinion on this subject in general.
In addition, I support the Commissioner's suggestion that we include the Meijer report in the overall package with this proposal by Mr Jarzembowski.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is hard to imagine a mode of transport that is in such urgent need of political support as the railways.
The third railway package brings us a little further forward.
There is nothing controversial about the Savary and Sterckx reports, and I should like to thank the rapporteurs.
Not only train drivers, but other staff, too, must be covered.
We should not concern ourselves exclusively with passengers on cross-border services, but with passengers in general.
The controversial issue is - as it always has been - how to deal with market opening.
Both we and the Council have traditionally made heavy weather of this issue. This has a good deal to do with national safeguard mechanisms, but it also has to do with fears.
These positions must of course be respected, but they do not help us achieve a result.
We could of course disregard the liberalisation of rail transport if it were not for the fact that - as has been pointed out several times - other transport sectors have been liberalised without regard for the social or environmental costs in recent years, with disastrous consequences.
Tremendous growth in road and air traffic has been recorded for the 1995-2004 period, whilst the railways have been lagging behind and stagnating.
The future looks even more bleak.
By 2020, the volume of freight transport will have increased by 50%, and that of passenger transport by 35%, yet the various modes of transport will not benefit equally from the expected 35% increase in passenger transport.
The increase will be 108% for the aeroplane, 36% for the car, and just 19% for the railways. These are the Commission's projections.
No one can seriously be happy about these figures.
It may well be that increases in passenger numbers are already being seen at national level; but we have to look at the overall picture.
The realisation that it takes one person a 17 000 km rail journey to release a tonne of CO2 pollution into the atmosphere, but a journey of just 3 000 km by air, does lead one to reconsider one's position on the opening of rail markets.
What we are discussing today is not the Meijer report, as that will have its turn soon, nor the ports package, but instead - for reasons of energy and environmental policy - we are discussing market opening.
I would say to Mrs Roth, on the subject of exacting requirements, that 2017/2022 is hardly a sledgehammer approach, but a very gentle one, one that also takes the smaller Member States into consideration.
Both the Council and Parliament have incorporated safeguard mechanisms for the smaller Member States.
These countries obviously need special protection and consideration.
I shall repeat that, if the railways are to have a real chance, we must permit a measure of market opening in this field.
I look forward to the conciliation procedure and hope that the Council Presidency will be very active and willing to compromise, and will bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the distinction between international transport, and transport between Member States and national transport dates back to 1956, specifically to Article 70 of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, in other words the first piece of European transport legislation.
It seems quite obvious to me that cross-border transport should have been prudently entrusted to the European institution when the internal market in transport began to be created, but it is just as obvious that the false distinction between international and domestic transport should subsequently have been abandoned for road, sea and air transport, for cabotage, and finally, on 1 January this year, for rail freight transport.
Why then, Mrs Roth, should this distinction persist just for this last enclave of premodernity: rail passenger traffic?
Why, Mr Barrot, make so much effort to liberalise 5% of the rail passenger market within three years, by 2010?
Why prevent the beneficial effects of competition from helping the remaining 95% of the rail market to regain its competitiveness compared with road and air, without which we will not find a solution to any of the problems facing us?
Why enable only 5% of passengers to enjoy at last the obvious protection that all consumers deserve, particularly those with disabilities, when we have already extended it to all air passengers?
Do you not think that a ten-year transition period for everyone, or even 15 for the new Member States, is enough to allow even the shakiest of national monopolies - which are today defending their exclusive internal markets - to get ready to face up to competition?
After all, competition cannot be destructive, because the market is already declining and only competition can help to expand the market for everyone.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, are we really incapable of giving up an attitude that was effective 50 years ago but today, frankly, is endangering our whole strategy?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your very open and interesting comments on the railway package.
They show how important the railways are in transport, and how they must become still more important.
Parliament is very united in this, and that strengthens the Commission, the Council and us all.
I firmly believe that the differences between the 27 countries must be taken into consideration, including when it comes to their enthusiasm for opening up access to the market.
If we show sound judgment and enthusiasm in accepting the requirements of the individual countries while at the same time providing options for regulation and deregulation, then we will achieve greater acceptance.
In many Member States, there is a legitimate fear that the opening up of the market in national passenger transport will result in certain companies simply taking over the market.
That is one of the viewpoints that result in the topic of market opening not being approached very energetically, as you made clear in your report, Mr Jarzembowski.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs and those who took part in the discussions for their commitment to transport policy, and in particular to the railways.
I am sure we will meet again at the next opportunity, in order to search out compromises.
The debate is suspended.
It will resume at 9 p.m.

Development of the Community's railways Certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community International rail passengers' rights and obligations (continuation of debate)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on European railways.
At this moment when for the first time I am exercising my duty to preside over the European Parliament, I would like to acknowledge all of those people who have accompanied me until this point in my life and career, my party colleagues and the citizens of my province, Ciudad Real, in Spain, who kept me in my country's Parliament for twenty-two years.
In particular, it is a happy historical coincidence that we should be talking about railways when I come from a town called AlcÃ¡zar de San Juan, which was a central point in the history of the railways and in the history of the workers' movement in my country.
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am essentially in favour of the third railway package.
Originally, I took the view that the State should never hand over operation of the railways to private companies, but, provided the infrastructure remains under State ownership, and local, regional and cross-border transport services are transferred to private companies only under very clear conditions, in a socially and environmentally responsible way, I now think that we must accept fair competition.
If, however, a State monopoly were simply to be replaced by a number of private monopolies, as has sometimes been the case with the energy companies, then liberalisation would certainly get us nowhere.
My experience as a frequent rail traveller has shown me that the quality of railway provision depends not on the level of privatisation, but rather on a clear political will to give rail preference over road.
What counts in this respect are the true costs and the attractiveness of the railways in general, including, for example, appealing stations, well-planned timetables, a reliable service, comfortable trains, and so on.
We have a good example in the middle of Europe: Switzerland.
The Swiss Government has not abdicated its responsibilities, even though 45% of the railways are not owned by Swiss Federal Railways.
There are clear requirements, and there is a political will on the part of those responsible.
The railways work, and can compete with the road network.
A bad example is Italy, where the focus has to date been on grand projects and the existing rail network has been seriously neglected for decades.
Perhaps this European initiative will gradually make Italy, too, change its approach.
(PT) Once again, the majority in Parliament is trying to speed up the liberalisation and privatisation of rail passenger transport by seeking to broaden the scope of the proposed directive not only to international passenger transport, and by as early as 2010, but also to national passenger transport by 2017.
Its aim is to deliver the most profitable lines into the hands of the large private economic operators by privatising services, specifically by means of public-private partnerships, thereby fostering, as has happened in other sectors, the formation of monopolies whose aim is profit.
These monopolies often receive outlandish amounts of public funding, regardless of the interests and needs of each country and its people.
In Portugal, experience has shown that, following the implementation of such a policy, public rail transport services have deteriorated, thereby hampering people's mobility.
The policy has led to higher ticket prices, to the removal of hundreds of kilometres of the rail network, to the closure of stations and to a reduction in passenger numbers and in service quality.
Furthermore, fewer people are working in the rail sector, and there has been an onslaught on salaries and workers' rights.
This is a policy to which the workers and the general public alike are opposed.
We have therefore tabled a proposal to reject this directive, explained in general terms in the minority opinion in this report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the third rail package is a major step towards the goal of a liberalised market and a common policy to protect passengers' rights and obligations at a European level.
The Jarzembowski report certainly makes up the core of the third package, and I fully endorse the rapporteur's position.
It opens up to competition not only international but also national rail transport, makes the principle of reciprocity compulsory, and thus avoids giving undeserved advantages to companies in countries closed to competition.
The Sterckx report concerns passengers' rights and obligations.
Again, I agree with the rapporteur's position, in that he rightly proposes extending the scope of the regulation to include all rail passengers, both national and international.
International passenger traffic in fact represents only 5% of rail traffic, so what would be the point in approving a regulation that applies to such a small percentage of consumers?
Another argument in favour of extending the scope is suggested by the legislation in force in the air transport sector, where no distinction is made between international and national traffic as regards passengers' rights and obligations.
Many Member States will find it difficult to reconcile their current situation with the provisions proposed in this regulation, and we therefore think it appropriate that the proposed measures should be phased in gradually.
Above all, they should comply with the feasibility criterion: for example, passengers with reduced mobility will see the gradual removal of physical obstacles and barriers as major restructuring work is carried out, new stations are built and new trains and carriages are purchased.
Companies will be liable for passengers and their baggage, and in the event of delays there will be minimum compensation rights throughout the European Union.
Mr President, may I begin by congratulating you on your elevation.
I hope you will enjoy your two and a half years in the Chair and, of course, give me plenty of speaking time!
This debate is a bit like the political equivalent of Nero fiddling while Rome burns.
We talk a lot about encouraging a switch of people and goods from road to rail, and yet leave in place huge obstacles to operation of the railways.
No wonder passenger numbers and goods figures are falling.
We must have a European single market in railways, rather than a series of totally incompatible national markets.
Without it, the railways are at a handicap, particularly in relation to air travel.
I can get a plane ticket from Manchester to Prague on my computer at the click of a button, but just try getting a train ticket from Manchester to Prague.
It is impossible.
We must have liberalisation of the railways now.
We must open up the market now.
Of course we have to have safeguards.
I would not recommend anybody to follow the experience of the United Kingdom.
The privatisation - as opposed to liberalisation - there was a complete disaster.
However, under the current government, the UK has put things right and now has the highest investment in railways anywhere, the largest increase in passenger numbers and also has actually seen more kilometres of railway line being built.
Nobody needs this investment more than the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Why are we delaying when they are desperate for investment?
We need that investment in order to put a proper European railway market into operation.
We also need to ensure that passengers are properly treated.
I receive many complaints from people with reduced mobility who find it very difficult to travel by rail across Europe.
We need standards on this, and we need proper ticketing so that you can press a button in Manchester and get a ticket to wherever you want to go.
What is more, we need to move faster than is being proposed by the European Commission and the Council.
(NL) So far, a broad majority in this House appears to be holding firm to liberalising a railway network for both cross-border and domestic transport, which does not come as a total surprise, as indeed, more extensive market forces in public transport have demonstrated to us that this produces 25% more public transport for the same level of outlay.
I do consider Amendment 37 at any rate to be of key importance in this framework.
We should not only consider competition in the rail network, but also, and especially, around it, or the so-called concession model, an important form of market forces, whereby safety, efficiency, a logical timetable and healthy financial management can all be given equal weighting.
Following in the footsteps of the shadow rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, I should like to ask the rapporteur to give full support to Amendment 37.
I should like to finish off by saying a few words about Amendment 18.
Unlike the rapporteur, I take the view that contracts for international passenger services that have already been put out to tender in accordance with an open commercial and fair procedure, and only those, should be respected.
To be honest, this simply strikes me as a matter of good governance.
If existing contracts with private parties must be broken, Member States could be faced with insurance claims running into hundreds of millions of euros, which is, in all honesty, not exactly the message that I, as a Member of Parliament, want to see going out to the European public.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will therefore be rejecting Amendment 18, and I should like to ask the rapporteur to do likewise.
(FR) I too would like to congratulate our new President of the sitting: welcome, Mr President!
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change requires a considerable commitment on the part of the Union in favour of public transport, and of the railways in particular.
In my region, Lorraine, a recent tragic cross-border accident, resulting from a signalling error, dramatically illustrated the urgent need to harmonise the rail network, which is no small challenge.
Because it involves the concepts of access to a public service and of land management, achieving uniformity requires the greatest possible prudence, as the Minster acknowledged just now.
I do not therefore believe that the liberalisation proposed in Mr Jarzembowski's report is the right approach.
Apart from the fact that opening up to competition will jeopardise the Member States' public service duties, it will not ultimately lead to fare reductions for our users.
Citizens travelling to work on a daily basis will not see any improvements to their travelling conditions either.
Quite the contrary!
Opening up to competition will lead to a deterioration of secondary lines, which are so important to local development.
And what about the impact of liberalisation on rail safety, Commissioner?
The transfer from the roads to rail is essential, and it is essential that Europe implements that.
I shall end with a nod to the Minister, who is not present: I would like to say that yesterday's utopias are today's realities.
(HU) The liberalisation of rail travel in the internal market will be fully implemented with the third railway package.
It is certainly true that Europe needs a sustainable, efficient rail service.
The third railway package, however, will be successful only if economically healthy and logistically prepared modern railway companies provide the service.
This is not the case today.
Railway companies in the new, and in some cases in old Member States, are struggling with an accumulated deficit, and Member States are faced with the problem of consolidation.
All this appears to be a domestic matter, but in terms of its dimensions and significance it is a European-wide problem and puts at risk the implementation of all three of the railway laws being discussed today, especially if we set the bar high.
The railway package contains a proposal that extends the preparation time for liberalising domestic passenger transport.
In my opinion, this extended preparation time is not sufficient.
I suggest to the European Council that it put on the agenda of its work programme the true situation in the expanded European Union, and to address the problem.
Furthermore, it is essential to examine what is to be done and what can be done in order to solve the existing railway problem in a significant part of Europe.
Thus, it is not a question here of drawing a line between the old and new Member States.
On the contrary, let us look for a way to create a well functioning, liberalised rail service throughout Europe that is competitive or complementary to the other transport branches.
The goal, therefore, is that existing values in the new Member States - in this case rail service - should not fall victim to the opening up of the internal market, but should instead become a valuable part of it.
Unfortunately, previously this did not succeed in the case of certain services.
With regard to the liberalisation of domestic passenger transport, I consider the proposed amendment which I submitted to be better than the compromise proposal.
The difference between the two is that my proposal would grant every Member State that is not able to prepare itself in time, or that runs into other obstacles, the possibility of a derogation.
The compromise proposal would make this possible only for the new Member States.
In my opinion, the impact assessment prior to the regulation should in each case extend to the specificities of the new Member States, but the regulation must be unified.
In any case, I welcome the fact that the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism have striven - as was, in fact, the case the first time - to pay attention in drafting the law to the special problems affecting the new Member States.
(ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate you most warmly.
Miguel Ãngel, who would have guessed, when, under the isolation of the Franco dictatorship, you left from AlcÃ¡zar de San Juan, which was Spain's symbolic rail and trade union hub, that European railways would take you once again tonight to AlcÃ¡zar de San Juan, but this time as Vice-President of the European Parliament?
You look very handsome, and, furthermore, somebody must have put some flowers in republican colours just there to your left.
Well, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, particularly Mr Jarzembowski, because he is the rapporteur who, as always, has been patient enough to stay here to listen to everybody, including those of us who disagree with him, but who, when it comes down to it, love him and respect him.
I would like to thank all of you for your intensive and meticulous work, and for your patience in dealing with our reservations and doubts.
I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to persuade the Council and the Commission to take account of the majority of its proposals, aimed at the complex task of harmonising and modernising the twenty seven different current rail systems with a view to creating a European railways area that ensures that our railways are sustainable, attractive and safe and that they have a future.
I believe that the European Parliament should once again advocate a gradual and controlled opening-up, of which this third legislative package represents one more step.
However, we are not so naive or cynical as to deceive the European citizens by claiming that, by setting a specific date - which, furthermore, many believe to be premature - the current rail problems are going to disappear.
