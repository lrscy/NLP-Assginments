Against this backdrop, four priority areas have been established for 2006-7.
In its spring 2006 meeting, the Council also prioritised higher rates of employment and working activities for the disabled.
The key point of next year's European Action Plan must be access for the disabled to high-quality, affordable services.
Disabled access to material values and services is absolutely vital to ensuring that they exercise their rights as citizens and to guaranteeing their independence.
The Union must be capable of better analysing and identifying the development of factors influencing the situation of the disabled.
This Action Plan has already yielded positive results.
The first European legislation specifically relating to the disabled has been adopted.
This law on the rights and obligations of the disabled in the area of air transport has been mentioned by the rapporteur.
Legislation relating to the new structural funds guarantees the rights of the disabled to access to Community-funded projects and lays down that the principle of access must be upheld at all stages of the fund's activity.
The adoption of the UN Convention on the rights of the disabled is an event of historical significance.
The European Community has for the first time in history signed up to the Convention.
With this Convention the fundamental principles of the EU's strategy on the disabled - namely, non-discrimination, equal opportunities and active measures aimed at social integration - have gained solid foundations.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - I will speak on this item, as our chairman, Mr Sifunakis, has other duties today.
However, we and every member of the PSE working party in the Committee on Culture and Education agree on the subject's importance.
The year 2007 will be the European Year of Equal Opportunities, as part of which we must also give attention to disability in education and culture programmes.
The new digital technologies, especially relating to the media, can provide equal opportunities for the disabled.
It is crucial to use these tools for the advantage of disabled people.
The European Union has important multiannual cultural programmes between 2007 and 2013.
Our group wants to increase the involvement of people with disabilities in these programmes.
Some weeks ago, I welcomed a group of visitors that included some disabled people.
We, Members of this European Parliament, can also act at a personal level.
Our possibilities may be modest, but we can invite more disabled visitors to Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European action plan 2006-2007 for people with disabilities identifies a strategy based on the principle of equal access to goods and services for every European citizen.
This is a culture that is no longer associated with the idea of passive welfare but with the objective of integration, of active participation in economic and social life and of recognition for the safeguarding of these people's rights.
The theme of quality of life takes centre stage, such that people with disabilities may fulfil their expectations while keeping their human dignity.
That is why we emphasise the importance, too, of the relationship between the state of people's health and the environment in which they live.
We support the formulation of the following three objectives: to finish implementing the directive on equal treatment in employment and working conditions; to do more to integrate disability-related issues in relevant Community polices; and to improve access for all.
Our amendments have highlighted the need for a basically uniform approach in all of the Member States, in terms of transport and mobility, one that ensures that disabled people receive adequate support from the school and education system and within the home, and that also promotes sign language.
It is also crucial to highlight the need to establish and enforce high European standards on quality in the social services, because the quality and fullness of people's lives in the future will depend on the quality of service that they receive.
We therefore hope that ever more concrete, practical acts will follow on from the statement of principle.
Finally, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her work.
Mr President, the report by my honourable friend Mrs Lynne, whom I should like to congratulate on a cohesive and integrated piece of work, lays down the basic principles which the policy of the European Union and of the Member States needs to follow as far as disability is concerned.
I should like to refer in particular to the safeguarding of accessibility for people with disabilities to the built environment.
We need to remove the obstacles which prevent people with disabilities from participating in economic, social and cultural life.
In precluding their natural access to goods and services, we are not only marginalising an important section of the populace, but also, at the same time, we are causing significant economic damage, as we are excluding them from the labour market and economic life in general, pushing them into a life on benefits, which cannot but be harmful.
In addition, although I consider that mainstream education is a fundamental right of people with disabilities and makes a decisive contribution to their unimpeded integration into society and towards combating stigma and discrimination, we must not overlook the need to support special education structures as and where necessary.
Similarly, I should like to stress the importance of the problems of mental health and the handicaps it causes and to underline the need to promote the mental health of the populace.
I also wish to mention and to add that the adoption of a common definition of disability at European level will greatly facilitate the recognition of the common issues of people with disabilities for the purpose of adopting policies at European level which will give greater added value to national social policies in a sector which still - to a significant degree - comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
Finally, I wish to convey two points on behalf of my honourable friend, Mr Sifunakis, who drafted the opinion: firstly, the Commission must increase the involvement of people with disabilities in the new multi-annual programmes for the next budgetary period and, secondly, there must be a corresponding improvement in sports facilities.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, who have thoroughly studied and presented recommendations on one of today's most pressing social issues - the full integration into our society of people with disabilities.
I support the numerous recommendations of those who prepared the report, which show that today there are still quite a few problems in this area.
I would like to draw attention to some of them.
Modern information technologies, the Internet and digital television open entirely new possibilities for adapting information to each user, with regard to his/her needs and potentials.
These include wider use of subtitles and sign language on television, specially adapted workstations for disabled people and suitably adapted Internet interfaces, especially for public websites.
We must encourage and ensure that all these possibilities are implemented.
When new buildings are being designed, appropriate attention should be paid to the disabled.
In future, improved transport systems will increase the mobility of these people.
It is essential that these specialised needs be considered each time, especially when European Regional Development Fund and Structural Fund grants are being put to use.
National law should be improved in parallel, removing all discriminatory provisions that are not in keeping with Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty.
Further efforts should be made to renounce the medical model of disability and to replace it with a social model.
It is most important that, in educating the public, all means adopted be accompanied by common efforts to eliminate stereotypes and preconceived notions in regard to the disabled.
Only the coordinated and all-embracing efforts mentioned in the report will enable improved results to be obtained more rapidly.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) It is crucial that the noble promises of the Commission and the Member States to defend the rights of the disabled do not remain just rhetoric.
More effective action must be taken, the existing legislation in this area must be effectively complied with and human rights for all must be guaranteed.
We commend the rapporteur Mrs Lynne on her work and wish to underline the importance of the recommendations contained in her report, to which we contributed some proposals.
We would like to highlight the effective application of the legal framework for equal treatment in employment, access for all to public transport and to new information technology, and the elimination of architectural barriers.
We once again call for a specific directive on disability to be drawn up, based on Article 13 of the Treaty, and for the UN Convention in this area to be ratified and signed.
I also wish to call for the Member States to focus more on disabled children and young people and their education, as well as the inclusion, wherever possible, of disabled students in mainstream education, taking account of the specific support required to meet the special educational needs of the pupils.
Lastly, I should like to call for special focus on severely disabled people and their families.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I should like to thank Mrs Lynne for her excellent work.
We are today dealing with an issue that is a measure of our humanity.
Every time a disabled person is discriminated against, it is an attack on human rights and dignity.
The concept of the disabled being able to enjoy their full rights as citizens must become more than fine-sounding words.
It must be recognised that much has been achieved in this area over recent years.
Nonetheless, it is still far too often the case that disabled people feel they are second class citizens.
Integrating the world of disabled people with the rest of society represents a considerable challenge for the Member States.
All kinds of barriers have to be removed.
I mean here not only to the built environment and transport facilities, but also to access to work, medical care, social care, education, culture and sport for example.
The issue of disability amongst children and young people is especially important.
Disabilities can be physical, mental, acquired, or congenital.
But I would also like to draw attention to the situation of those individuals who have become less able because of their advancing years.
I am confident that the action taken by this House on this matter will lead to improved living conditions.
This is not charity. It is our duty.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the report on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union is actually more of a wish list for improving the quality of life of the disabled than a factual account and analysis of their present situation.
In addition to the obvious issues relating to the built environment and transport, action is urgently needed to provide financial support for employers and compensate them for the losses they incur by employing disabled people who are less productive in the workplace.
The issue of ongoing support of the educational process for the disabled and their carers is both a tremendous opportunity and a problem for families with disabled members.
Making it possible for parents to stay at home for the necessary time and awarding them financial support so that they can live with dignity would be a step in the right direction.
The European Union ought to make a commitment in this regard and ensure that the necessary resources are available.
An order of priority for activities should be assigned to all guidelines aimed at improving the situation of the disabled, so that our aid and efforts do not become empty political declarations.
In addition, the disabled need the certainty that the Member States of the Union are supporting them by imposing harsher punishments for offences against the disabled.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for this House and I would therefore like to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her report, because we are taking a further step in our task of building a Europe of opportunities.
By means of a broad agreement, we shall approve new measures today that will represent progress in terms of equal opportunities for people with any kind of disability.
I believe that this new European Action Plan 2006-2007 is a great challenge in terms of eliminating any kind of discrimination and, furthermore, it tackles the needs of people with disabilities throughout Europe.
I shall highlight several issues.
Firstly, it intends to establish a general framework for equal treatment in work, not just in terms of education and access, but also promotion and lifelong learning.
Secondly, it undoubtedly improves the conditions and rights for passengers with disabilities using air, sea and land transport.
I must warn you, however - as I have done in the report - of the need not to create a new and so far non-existent barrier: the economic barrier.
To oblige people with disabilities to be accompanied is positive in terms of improving the quality of their journey, but it would not be a positive thing for the disabled person to have to pay for the ticket of the person accompanying them, since that would mean those people having to pay for two tickets, while the rest of us would only have to pay for one.
Thirdly, the improvement in access to new technologies.
There is no question that new technologies should break down many barriers for people with disabilities, provided that we achieve universal access to them and provided that technological advances take these people into account from the outset of their design stage.
Fourthly, we need integrated and coordinated responses to disability amongst children and amongst people who are already suffering other forms of discrimination, such as women and the elderly.
Finally, the prevention of work risks.
We have opted for a broad agreement on work-related risks, which has already been presented in this House, and which the Commission has not yet taken up - and I would remind you of this, Mr Å pidla - and in which particular attention will have to be paid to the possible risks faced by people in the workplace.
I would also like to stress the extremely important role played by disabled people's associations.
There is no question that this is a great challenge and that it represents progress towards achieving the Europe of opportunities that we all want to see.
I join with the rapporteur in reiterating Parliament's support for a comprehensive non-discrimination directive on disability under Article 13.
The Portuguese Presidency promised it to us in 2000, as did the former Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs in 2003.
Four years later and unless there is action, the Commission will continue saying that there is a hierarchy of discrimination, which none of us can accept.
Secondly, I welcome the action plan's emphasis on moving beyond employment rights to social care.
I call on the Commission to undertake this work with a genuine spirit and commitment towards an independent lifestyle for people with disabilities, to the right to personal assistance and to the right for disabled people and disabled children and their parents to choose mainstream provision, whether that is education or housing, not only employment.
Thirdly, we can do much more on the international front in external assistance.
We claim to adopt a human rights approach to disability.
Let us do more within our human rights programmes worldwide.
We have not done enough regarding the human rights of disabled people in assessing candidate countries for accession to the European Union.
We can do better in that area.
We should not only move swiftly to ratify and sign the draft UN Convention on People with Disabilities but work with third-country governments to make sure they do too.
Finally on PPE-DE Group's Amendment 5, I am outraged that the Conservatives should try to withdraw the part of my text suggesting that the Commission should be required to monitor the participation of people with disabilities in their programmes.
We should not just talk about participation, we should make it happen.
The PPE-DE Group should withdraw that amendment.
Madam President, the European Union is a society of shared values.
One way by which we judge our success as a society is how we address the issues facing the most vulnerable members of our society.
Last year, as rapporteur on the Commission paper on demographic change, I was invited to speak at a special conference on disability in Graz during the Austrian Presidency.
The banner on the platform behind me said simply: Leben wie andere auch - to live the same as other people.
In English the translation of the word 'leben' is not just 'to live' but 'to have a life', and it should be the aim of our society to help all members of society to live and to have a life like every other member of society.
UK Conservatives are not persuaded that we need more EU legislation to secure this aim, but we do believe that we need the whole of society to embrace it.
We need not just a welfare state, but a welfare society, in which communities recognise their responsibilities for the support of all members of those communities.
Governments cannot do everything, but they can become enablers of individual choice, helping people with disabilities to do what they themselves want to do by removing the barriers that stand in their way - barriers in education, employment or simply in getting from A to B. Governments can also promote and enable a culture of independence rather than dependence.
Support for people with disabilities is not just about care: it is about support for their desires to fulfil their lives and to live in the same way as other people.
We welcome this thoughtful own-initiative report on this important subject, we shall of course be supporting it, and we congratulate the rapporteur.
(Beginning of speech off-microphone) ... particularly what the Commissioner was just saying about how close together the Parliament and the Commission are in terms of disabled people's rights.
Commissioner, you talked about the accessibility of services.
Of course, we can only have accessibility of services if we have a specific disability directive.
I am pleased that Richard Howitt and many other Members brought that up as well.
I would like some sort of commitment today as regards a timescale of when you might be bringing that forward, Commissioner.
I welcome what you were saying about structural funds.
It is very important that we have a disability criterion in the structural funds. I am very pleased that it is in there now.
One of the Members here also talked about mainstreaming. It is very important that we should have that.
Mrs Tzampazi, thank you very much for all your support and work.
We have worked very closely on this.
It is very right to talk about the European Year of People with Disabilities and to build on that.
Unfortunately, I have not had enough time to talk about education and training.
There are so many points that I would like to mention, but really the bottom line is a specific disability directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the debate, which I have followed with interest.
I feel that Mrs Lynne's conclusion corresponds to the situation on the ground and I was delighted to learn of the committee's view that the opinions of Parliament and the Commission are very close to one another.
The most important principles, namely those of non-discrimination and active inclusion, were raised and some issues were clarified or followed from a number of different perspectives in the debate.
As several speakers have mentioned changes to the European legal framework, I should like to point out that a feasibility study will be completed this year on how to improve the EU legal framework on the disabled.
Honourable Members, perhaps it is also appropriate to mention that 2007 is the Year of Equal Opportunities, which in my view provides a good opportunity to mobilise the Community.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(IT) I give my full support to the Lynne report, insofar as it has succeeded in addressing a broad range of the problems affecting the world of disabilities, as diverse as it is, and has proposed actions and instruments that are sufficiently appropriate to meet the associated requirements in terms of people's lives, relationships and place in society.
I should also like to express the hope, in this House, that the statements of principle, which I support, will pave the way for ever more concrete, practical acts on the part of the Commission and that 'people with disabilities' (or, if one prefers, 'people with different abilities') might achieve their life goals while keeping their human dignity.
With the work done by the rapporteur in our parliamentary committee, the text on which we are preparing to vote successfully summarises, among other things, the social needs arising from the various national situations.
I would stress, in this respect, that it is advisable for the Member States of the European Community to adopt a basically uniform approach, so as to prevent unjustified inequalities from materialising among Europeans in this regard just because they come from different parts of Europe.
(HU) People with disabilities in Europe today face particular difficulties and discrimination at several levels.
In most places even basic, unobstructed mobility has not been made possible, not to mention social integration.
It is important for this to be made known: independent living does not only mean that one is simply a member of society, but that one is just as much a member of society as anyone else.
Every policymaker and decision-maker should give this matter due consideration.
People living with disabilities make up 10% of Europe's population, and therefore their integration and ability to function is not merely a social question but a mutual interest, since the creation of workplaces for disabled people, and their involvement in lifelong education and vocational training contributes not only to improving their living conditions, but to the development of the economy of Europe as well.
Finding an approach to the question is problematic as well, and not only because statistical data in this area are inadequate.
People with disabilities certainly constitute a diverse, far from homogeneous group, and therefore the numerous challenges in this area require an integrated, gender-based approach; this point must be taken into consideration at every level of policymaking.
What is more, as in many other areas, the situation of women living with disabilities is often more disadvantaged than that of men with disabilities, and women are more often the victims of poverty and social exclusion.
This must be taken into consideration in the wide range of programmes and measures.
(SV) The June List believes that it is completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to encounter prejudices, unhelpful special treatment and limited opportunities.
Such experiences are not in accordance with our view of the EU as a union of values.
The European Parliament's and the Council's Regulation of 5 July 2006 constitutes progress, then, and clarifies something that should be self-evident, especially since we have a common internal market: namely, that people with disabilities should have the same rights as other citizens where flying is concerned.
Sweden is a pioneering country when it comes to the rights of people with disabilities.
Far-reaching EU legislation, involving detailed perspectives on how people with disabilities are to be treated, might have placed a question mark over the successful Swedish reforms of the Seventies and Eighties.
Let us, then, do without detailed regulation and instead state clearly and unambiguously that society, trade and industry and the rest of us as individuals should treat people with disabilities exactly the same as other people.
Let us, in conclusion, practise some self-criticism.
The EU institutions present reports on the rights of people with disabilities but cannot, at the same time, ensure that all EU buildings are fully adapted for their purposes.
Nor are the European Union's websites and documents accessible in suitable formats to people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired.
When do the Quaestors in the European Parliament and the relevant EU authorities intend to take action on these urgent issues of such close concern?
Time to move up a gear Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth
The next item is the report by Mrs del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Time to move up a gear - Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently debating a report that is going to be voted on this morning and which deals jointly with a number of reports presented by the Commission with one fundamental and very well defined objective, which is no less than to establish a range of measures enabling us to develop a knowledge-based society and economy in Europe, which is ultimately the fundamental instrument for generating employment and growth and therefore prosperity for all Europeans.
In this report, like other reports by experts, such as the Aho report, which is an extremely complete and precise report dealing with the same issues, or other previous Commission reports, we are being presented with a situation in which we have a very good diagnosis - I would say - of where we are, why we are in this situation and what we need.
There is probably no other area in which we have such precise knowledge as in this one, allowing us to promote growth in Europe.
We have a diagnosis and we also have the solutions.
We all know that in order to promote a knowledge-based society we need to promote innovation.
We all know that we need to promote training so that people can adapt to all the changing situations in employment and can recycle themselves and find new kinds of work.
We all know that innovation is necessary so that the social welfare system does not lose its capacity to meet the citizens' needs in terms of health, training, etc. We all know, too, that companies need a favourable framework, a framework that helps them, that encourages them to develop innovation and that prevents them from having to deal with bureaucratic problems, with difficulties in a whole range of fields of action.
This is not the time to list each of the aspects of the report, because they are there and you all know about them.
I would like to take this opportunity to place as much emphasis as I can on the need to stop all the talk once and for all and to stop giving reports and analyses wonderful titles, while there is still a degree of paralysis in the national States' actions.
The step that has been taken in relation to the 25 national reform programmes is important, but I believe that we should place extremely great emphasis on a very thorough assessment of the progress made with those national programmes.
As time passes, we are being left further and further behind.
When the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up, there were expectations in terms of how things would develop.
At the half-way point in the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, the European average - the situations vary from country to country, of course - was worse than when the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up.
We may find that in 2010 we have still failed to make any progress and that we have therefore got further and further behind.
I truly believe that if we were to hire an external auditor, they would be amazed to see what a good diagnosis we have, and what good remedies and solutions we have, but that, in spite of that, there has been such a complete lack of action in their application.
Like life itself, societies are created by means of cooperation amongst different generations.
One generation carries the baton; it is like a relay race, but it is our foundations that are being passed on.
Many Europeans are currently growing up and being born.
Others, like ourselves, will be retired before too long.
All of us need a society in which Europe can continue to have that capacity to compete, to have the leadership and sense of future that it has had in the past, because Europeans used to be determined, with their hearts and souls, to leave a better legacy for the future of their countries and, in our case, for the future of all of the countries making up European society.
That is our responsibility, therefore, and we must put our hearts and souls into it.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity to participate in this debate on growth and employment policy and we are quite clear in welcoming the present report.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, most warmly for her thorough and objective consideration of the issues involved.
We are having this debate a few days before the Commission's decision on the progress report on growth and employment policy in 2006.
I share Mrs del Castillo Vera's analysis that we, in Europe, do in fact know perfectly well where our problems are.
We also know exactly what needs to be done.
We have the right answers to the problems but - and this is where Mrs del Castillo Vera got it quite right - there is a problem with the implementation of the measures deemed correct, in particular at the national level.
It is also easy to explain why.
The long-term needs for reform that we have identified for European growth and employment policy always come up against the short-term interests of national politics.
There are always elections somewhere. The machinery always grinds to a halt somewhere.
Even so, I am in a position to tell you today that the progress report that we will be adopting in a fortnight will be sending out two uncommonly positive signals.
The first signal is that, for the first time, we actually have a functioning mechanism in Europe to coordinate the economic policies of the Member States and the EU itself.
That, of course, was the big problem with the Lisbon Strategy, as you identified, in that while its aims were very ambitious, its implementation mechanism was practically non-existent.
The second positive answer is that the priorities of the Member States have changed to a noticeable degree.
We will be able to show in our reports, which cover every single country and every single sector of the economy, that the issues in our strategy are now on the agenda all over Europe.
These issues are education and training, research and development, innovation, better conditions for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and improving the employability of those social groups denied access to the labour market.
These issues are all the hottest topics on the political agenda in every Member State, and so I am very pleased that the report under discussion today has very clear things to say on precisely these subjects.
I would like to emphasise in the clearest possible way how much I welcome the fact that this report so clearly endorses Commission policy in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises and to innovation.
I would like to state very clearly that the future of our growth and our jobs depends on our success in bolstering the innovation potential in small and medium-sized enterprises such that they are able to contribute more and more to growth and employment in Europe.
It is from this sector that the extra jobs that we need will come, and so it is important that all of our policies are assessed in respect of whether or not they allow Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises the leeway they need.
We will very soon be in a position to debate the state of growth and employment policy on the basis of the Commission's progress report.
I am fairly sure, Mrs del Castillo Vera, that, when that happens, you will share my opinion that Europe is not in a state of stagnation.
We are, rather, clearly moving in the right direction.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union definitely needs renewed impetus in order to bridge that gap, that divide that exists in relation to the world's other strong, dynamic, competitive economies: I am not just referring to the traditional ones, but to the new ones, too, which have made an appearance on the international stage.
Europe is therefore risking a great deal if it is unable to keep pace and to modernise by giving itself that impetus and that extra something that is being requested of it, not least through this debate.
It is in danger of losing that compatibility that it has always been able to demonstrate between economic, productive and industrial growth and, at the same time, social cohesion and the ability to promote employment and a more inclusive kind of growth.
I believe that this 'extra something' requires two elements.
Firstly, we need to take action regarding new factors of economic and employment growth: human capital, the training of human capital, the enhancement of people's abilities and skills, and technological innovation, which is also understood to mean the ability to transfer the results of research and of what knowledge today places at our disposal into production processes.
There is a second element, however, which I should like to mention in closing, and which is key to overcoming this challenge: Europe needs to work together more!
Europe needs to provide itself with this strategic ability that is a common outlook.
Twenty-five national plans are weakening our ability to grow together: we need one outlook, a more univocal outlook.
We need, in short, more harmonised policies in the fields of taxation, of employment and of industrial policies.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Madam President, in olden times young people learned their professions in the workshops of older masters.
In Hungary, before the World Wars and the Iron Curtain, many young people went to western Europe for some years to extend their vocational training by working in the workshops of foreign masters.
In this way, they learned both their profession and one or two foreign languages.
We should not invent new things, we should just remember the old traditions.
Of course, times have changed and the state has an important role in vocational training.
However, as with the individual masters or guilds in the old times, small and medium-sized companies should be involved in providing practical experience for students.
Our projects in the field of vocational training are rather modest.
We must provide more financial resources for programmes that provide foreign experience and possibly the exchange of students.
Vocational training should also provide language courses, including business technology phrases.
It is nice to learn the Hamlet monologues by heart, but carpenters or computer operators should know their professional terms in foreign languages as well.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, and thank her for all the work undertaken on an issue of such great importance for the future of the European economy.
We are unfortunately bound to recognise that the European Community's economic results are consistently disappointing, particularly when we take into account the opportunities offered by the single European market.
Particular attention should be paid to the difficulties experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises.
After all, SMEs are among the powerhouses of the European economy.
Better regulation and simplification are crucial to increasing the cohesion and clarity of Community legislation and would help to reduce the administrative burden weighing so heavily on SMEs.
Future legislative proposals should adopt a broad and comprehensive approach based on detailed consideration of current legislation and an in-depth assessment of the implications.
There should be regular contact with SMEs and the organisations representing them so that they can be involved in the implementation and further development of Community programmes.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, first of all, allow me to thank our rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, and to congratulate her on her excellent report, especially since it is structured around clear sets of themes designed to improve monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy.
I think, moreover, that one issue in particular ought to get us moving: that of reviewing the Community Patent.
For too long, we have been saying, as Mrs del Castillo Vera said just now, that it is crucial for innovation to be promoted via harmonisation at European level.
Now, what we are saying needs to be heard.
We talk about producing better legislation, and the scope of such legislation is vast.
There is also, however, cause to be surprised that Europe is so far behind in terms of innovation.
Bearing in mind, however, that a patent costs on average EUR 46 700 in Europe compared with EUR 10 250 in the United States, I think that we know, unfortunately, why this is so.
Charging as much as that is the best way of stifling innovation in Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises.
This cost is utterly prohibitive.
It is therefore a matter of urgency to get the Council to think again and help extricate our companies from this unfortunate situation.
I should now also like to emphasise another important point that we ought to have taken up in this report, namely the Agreement on Public Procurement.
In the process of being reorganised under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, this Agreement offers the 36 signatories, including our 25 Member States, access to their partners' public procurement markets.
Nonetheless, a number of these partners are not playing by the rules.
One has only to look at what the United States and Canada do. By means of national provisions, they exclude from the scope of the Agreement those public procurement markets that they reserve for their SMEs, even though these countries can put themselves forward in the public procurement markets of the 25 Member States.
I find it unacceptable that the progress made in transatlantic relations is all in the same direction.
We therefore have a duty to promote a European Small Business Act on the model of that in place in the United States since 1953.
We might be said to be 50 years behind.
You will agree that enough is enough.
It remains for us to come up with better legislation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we keep on reminding ourselves, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe's economy, employing most of Europe's workers, yet still not without their problems.
I want to point out that the first communication from the Commission in which many problems were addressed reached us in July 1994, followed by recommendations in December of the same year, a second communication in 1998, and then, in 2000, experts found out that not even half of the measures were being put into effect in the Member States.
It is necessary to note that, even today, only 55% of them have been, so the Member States have to back up their words with actions.
I would like to say something about the transfer of undertakings, which is an important matter to which too little attention is given when considering the problem as a whole, not only on the part of the authorities responsible for Member States' tax laws but also by the enterprises themselves, which have to start work in good time on the business of transferring their enterprise to a new owner.
There is work to be done by all parties involved.
Not least in the Seventh Research Programme, this House has taken action in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises; enough words have been bandied back and forth, so now is the time for some action.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the preparation of her speech.
Essentially I agree with her.
This is yet one more document among a multitude of others that should encourage entrepreneurship in Europe - starting with the expansion of small and medium-size enterprises.
Indeed the Community's policy on this question is consistent and, I would say, fair.
The problem is that in real life it is often not observed.
Laws are frequently ignored and bureaucratic obstacles are created.
I would like to point out two problems: I think the success of small and medium-size enterprises depends on their solution.
Firstly, there is a problem with business registration procedures.
The Commission has promised that by the end of 2007 the so-called One-Window Principle would be implemented in the entire Community.
At the Summit Meeting in March, the Member States also agreed to simplify registration procedures for new enterprises.
It was agreed that they should not take longer than one week.
However, in reality business registration in some Community countries now takes from one day to several weeks.
Registration costs also differ markedly.
In certain countries it does not cost anything, yet elsewhere the cost can amount to hundreds of euros.
The second problem - control over the activities of enterprises, overseen by various State institutions.
In Lithuania at the present time, 152 controlling bodies are in operation.
Business people mention this as one of the biggest problems and sources of corruption.
Recently 300 Commission employees made a commitment that by 2009 they would work for at least one week in small and medium-size enterprises.
That way they will attempt to understand the problems.
This is a welcome and concrete step. Perhaps similar initiatives should be extended to other parts of Europe, but would the Community endorse them?
I am certain that we will have to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to business expansion.
Then we will be able to say that we are creating Europe through business and that we are encouraging its growth.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you.
I have no doubt that achievements in innovation, the skill to make use of them and the capacity to revive the entrepreneurial environment, particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, will establish Europe's place in global economic competition.
Europe must adopt a proactive and leading position on global economic and social regulation.
Thus, for example, if we wish to catch up with the USA in the sphere of innovation where, according to an assessment by the European Commission, we are currently lagging behind by 50 years, it is vital to change existing relations between science and business, and between business and the regulatory role of the state, as well as the models for funding science.
Restrictions, not lack of enterprise, are the reason why the majority of Europe's residents want to be employees and not employers.
We welcome the report's emphasis on the role of the common market in fostering entrepreneurial activity.
The spheres in which the common market is not functioning properly are services and the free movement of labour.
A task that is behind schedule in the promotion of the free movement of labour is achieving comparability between Member States' degrees and qualifications, which has become particularly topical following the 2004 enlargement and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
I hope that the report will stimulate MEPs to rethink and understand the errors that have crept in, not least in the recently adopted services directive, and in rejecting the introduction of the European patent.
Thank you.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, just for a moment I should like to test our wonderful interpreters.
'European Union entrepreneurship' is an oxymoron, is it not?
The whole raison d'Ãªtre - if I may lapse into the vernacular of this place - is to stifle small business.
Rule upon rule, regulation upon regulation are generally made by people with no commercial experience at all.
I went through the list of over 700 MEPs just yesterday, and I could not find more than about 5 people who had bona fide business experience.
The Commissioners go on the Microsoft yacht for their holidays, the British Prime Minister has close relations with Lord Browne of BP, and so on and so forth, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with business.
Business in Western Europe is millions upon millions of small businessmen and women living a life of quiet desperation, trying to put their livelihoods together.
Small businesses account for over 52% of the UK's GDP.
You tell us in this place what age we may recruit at; you tell us what colour they may be; you tell us how much leave they must have; you tell us how much their pensions will be.
It goes on and on.
If we really wanted to get this place sorted out and we really wanted entrepreneurship, I would suggest that we only have Commissioners and MEPs who have actually done an honest day's work in their lives.
There are none!
(Applause from the public gallery)
While I can indeed understand that some of the speeches made in this House meet with the approval or disapproval of visitors, I really must ask those in the galleries to refrain from expressing their views.
Madam President, I wonder how many people in this Chamber have had an idea for a new business, raised the money themselves at their own risk and successfully run that business for 20 more years and generated jobs and wealth.
I see that not a hand goes up, and yet here we have a Commission talking about authorising entrepreneurs and about level playing fields - which is the most fundamental contradiction of the word 'entrepreneur' you could possibly imagine.
The whole point about entrepreneurship is creating something that nobody has ever thought of before.
There sits the Commissioner talking about criminalising the use of imperial measurements on exports from the UK after 2009.
As a consequence of that, the manufacturers of tyres, bicycles, clothing, medical equipment, dairy products, frozen foods, specialist papers, domestic appliances, hand tools, computer components and oil and gas components will all suffer, every single one of them.
One of them in my constituency will be faced with going out of business because there is no way he will be able to sell his components to the oil and gas industry in the United States.
They are not going to pull their drill up thousands of feet just to check a measurement - no way!
He will either become a criminal to stay in business or he will go out of business.
Years ago I walked into the office of one of the biggest industrialists in the United States and behind him was a notice that said: 'If you are not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, so get out of the way!'
That is a message I commend to this House.
(PL) Madam President, there are many reasons why the European Union loses out when competing with other countries.
It does badly against both highly industrialised and developing countries.
I cannot run through all the factors involved, but the main ones are inadequate support for SMEs and inadequate investment in science and education.
I would, however, like to focus on a different aspect today, namely the very marked differences in development within the European Union, at both national and regional level.
If we are to create a genuine European scientific and technological area, we will first have to bridge the gap between the richer and poorer Member States.
This obviously calls for additional resources, by which I mean not just the structural funds or funds allocated to agriculture, but also to resources for research and development, science and education.
Unfortunately, the richer countries have managed to secure almost all the funding set aside for such purposes, arguing that they are more effective in these areas.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the differences between the rich and poor parts of the Union are becoming more rather than less marked, and that the European Union is developing at a significantly lower rate than the United States or the Asian countries.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two more things I should like to say.
The first is that, however much one might wish to go along with the criticism of the conditions - and the Commission, as you know, does not hold back when criticism is merited - there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is that Europe's economic statistics show an upward trend.
Growth this year has surpassed expectations by far; a fall in unemployment is making itself very definitely felt; European firms are producing more, and we are becoming very much aware that the Member States' priorities are changing as they become keener to improve the conditions for entrepreneurship.
Secondly, when compared with - for example - the United States, it is indeed the case that there are fewer people in Europe who are prepared to set up a business themselves or to run one, or - to put it in the way a Member did a moment ago - to take upon themselves the risk of using their own money to create jobs for others.
The causes underlying this are very interesting, and are to be found in our culture.
It is for that reason too that the Commission has been such an energetic advocate of coupling together entrepreneurship and education; as early as at school and university, it must be possible to guide young people towards entrepreneurial activity.
Remarkable successes are making themselves visible in the countries in which this is being done, while, in those where it is not, there are quite simply too few enterprises, and the plain and simple fact is that no jobs will be created in the absence of a business to create them.
What we are currently learning - and it is a matter of considerable interest - is that 'learning by doing' is still the best way to go about it.
Reference has already been made in this debate to the 'Enterprise Experience' project, which I started with the aim of getting all the senior civil servants from my own offices to work in a small or medium-sized enterprise for at least a week.
The first fifty to do so have now got back, and the results are fascinating.
Every one of them - and yes, I really do mean every one of them - has come back with important proposals for improvements, for ways in which we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses, and these deserve to be the subject of serious discussion.
On the other hand, though, the firms that took our official on and enabled these to work for them say that they learned a great deal from it and now have a far better idea of what is feasible at the European level and of what is not.
I really do want to encourage the Member States to take similar initiatives.
Businesses change so quickly that it is absolutely necessary that those who create the conditions under which they operate should have a real knowledge, derived from their own observations, of what actually goes on in them and of what effect what they do has on them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs del Castillo Vera on the subject of entrepreneurship and growth.
This report is an essential contribution to achieving the objectives laid down in the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, designed to make Europe the most competitive region in the world by refocusing on growth and employment while maintaining the balance between the three pillars of the process: the economy, the social dimension and the environment.
If the EU wants successfully to meet this enormous challenge to bring about growth and employment, it needs to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which, let us not forget, account for 70% of the total number of jobs in Europe, with 75 million workers.
Having constructed the internal market by taking an interest in consumers at the same time as relying on competition, the EU must from now on take an interest in producers and, while protecting us from the harmful aspects of globalisation, ensure that European creativity is given full rein.
Finally, I deplore the fact that the disastrous monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has not been criticised, as monetary policy is not being put sufficiently at the service of economic growth.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed for voting time at 11.00 a.m.)
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes
(FR) Mr President, I should like to invoke the Rules of Procedure.
A number of Members, including myself, are concerned.
It seems that additional security measures have been taken in this House.
Have you any information to give us, or are these simply about scaring employees intending to take union action?
I am not aware of any particular reason why there should be additional security measures, but we shall check and inform the House.
Thank you for that observation, Mr Henin.

European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, on 12 October, when Parliament last voted on the report on the regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, we asked for it to be referred back to committee under Rule 53(2).
Since then, the Council and the Commission have decided to add political declarations to complement the legal document.
This was accepted by Parliament in a round of trialogue discussions.
I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour in the final vote on these issues and not block the process any more.
7.
Fundamental Rights Agency - activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, my report called for extending the competence of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to the third pillar.
I ask my fellow Members to continue to support this recommendation, and to vote for Parliament's original proposal.
For my part, I have taken note that the political declaration contains this proposal to a slightly limited degree.
8.
Accession of Bulgaria (vote)
- Before the vote on amendment 2:
Mr President, with regard to amendment 2 by my group, I should like to tell you that the Van Orden report brings this Parliament away from the legal basis of the accession protocol.
(DE) We have stipulated in the accession protocol that the Kosloduj nuclear power station must be shut down.
Contrary to what the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has asserted, nothing has been said by the Council or by Euratom to alter this view, which has to do with safety, and I therefore call on the Members of this House to agree to our amendment in order that we may not be in breach of the accession protocol.
Thank you, Mrs Harms.
We take the point, but I do not want to reopen the debate now.
- After the vote on amendment 2:
rapporteur. - Mr President, I tried to take the floor before we voted on that last vote.
You gave the floor to someone that was opposing the position which the rapporteur had taken on this particular issue.
It was quite wrong to say that there was anything here going against the Accession Treaty.
All we were asking for was more flexibility on this issue.
In view of that, I would ask that we do indeed vote on amendment nine.
I know the vote was very close, Mr Van Orden, but I do not think what Mrs Harms had to say affected the outcome of the vote.
I think the reaction of the House to her remarks indicates that everybody knew what she was going to say.
I do not propose to reopen the vote, though.
That would be wrong.
I am sorry about that, and I apologise for not having seen your hand up.
However, on the other hand I do not think we can change the vote.
rapporteur. - Mr President, we are not asking to reopen the vote, we are asking to vote on the text that we have in front of us.
I am afraid that the intervention did in fact influence things as regards that particular amendment.
The difference was only three or four votes.
I really think that we should give the House the opportunity to vote on the other amendments as put forward there.
I take the point, Mr Van Orden, but I am afraid we cannot reopen it.
It was a roll-call vote and it was a clear result, even though it was close.
Even if the Chair has some flexibility when it is a show of hands, I am afraid in these circumstances it is not possible to reopen it.
(Applause)

Research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013, FP7) (vote)
- Before the vote:
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - I just wish to inform the House that the compromise package of amendments, which is in the first block, and amendment 15 represent a hard-negotiated compromise with the Council and the Commission.
I would urge colleagues to vote for the package and against any other amendment, irrespective of its content or merits, because we have an agreement that will enable the Framework Programme to go forward and be implemented in January.
Adopting any other amendment might put that at risk by reopening the procedure, which would be a matter of great concern to the research community.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tabled two amendments: numbers 47 and 48.
However, with regard to the second one, number 48, the common position has been corrected in line with the aim of this amendment.
I am therefore satisfied, since there is no sense in voting on an amendment that has already been accepted.
The second part of the other amendment has been declared inadmissible, that is to say the part that specifies today's date, 30 November, as the deadline for destroying embryos used for the procurement of stem cells.
I do not agree with the declaration of inadmissibility, against which I can unfortunately do nothing.
What remains of the article is the replacement of the word 'extraction', as it features in the common position, with the word 'use', as Parliament was proposing back at the stage of first reading.
This is an issue of secondary importance, although, with the Commissioner having stated last night that, throughout the entire development phase of the programme, the Commission would accept the word 'use' and not the word 'extraction' - which, in practice, means that it will not fund any research into the destruction of embryos - I feel that this is a proposal that deserves to be endorsed.
Therefore, on this point, I would say that we should not insist on the vote if the Members that have signed the amendment agree.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the speech made by my fellow Member, Mr Casini, and to the amendment tabled by myself and others, Amendment 49.
Last night, Mr PotoÄnik gave ample reassurances regarding the Commission statement, with which I, for my part, am already satisfied, and I do not think it necessary to insist on the amendment in question.
Of course, that is my view on the matter, but if there are others affected, they can obviously insist on it.
(FR) Mr President, I think that it is necessary to return to Mr Chichester's proposal.
The package as a whole has to be voted on, and some people's interpretations of the Commission's reply are incorrect.
The Commission has been very clear.
It said that it was going to apply the Agreement Protocol - an annexed statement aimed at ensuring that research on spare embryonic stem cells takes place in very strict conditions governed by ethical considerations.
It is not, therefore, a question of reopening a debate.
It is the same thing each time, and I think that Mr Chichester's proposal needs to be adhered to.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, now that Mr Busquin has spoken, we really do have a problem.
Yesterday, the Commission took up a clear position; Mr Casini and Mr Prodi have commented on it, and Mr Busquin has just now cast doubt on it.
Mr Prodi and Mr Casini have hinted that they are going to withdraw their amendments, but we do appear to need another confirmation before this vote goes ahead, and so I would ask that Mr PotoÄnik be again given the floor in order to repeat the statement he made yesterday.
(Protest)
We are being told different things, and yet we must be in a position to proceed with the vote with it being clear to everyone what we are voting on.
Thank you, Mrs Breyer.
The position is simple.
Mr Casini has withdrawn his amendments; he has made his political statement.
Mr Prodi and Mr Busquin have made their positions clear.
Everybody understands that it is the wish of the House to proceed on the basis of the block votes, and that is what we shall now do.

Therefore, I should like to ask colleagues to change their vote on Article 2(2) and vote against those amendments.

Situation of people with disabilities (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, the English version of paragraph 40 should apply.

In English 'moving away' does not mean 'abandon' but a gradual approach.
In paragraph 47, 'Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS)' should be replaced with 'instrument for accession (ISPA).'

Voting time
The next item is the vote.
I have had a request from a number of Members, who have unavoidable commitments that will prevent them from being here for the whole of the vote, that the votes on Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria and Mr Moscovici's report on Romania be moved up the list.
I therefore propose that we take the votes on the Bulgaria and Romania reports after the simplified procedure votes.
Are there any objections to that change in the voting order?
(DE) Mr President, there is, essentially, of course, no reason to move reports up the list simply because a few Members cannot be here, but Bulgaria, Romania, and their accession are of such importance that we can, by way of exception, agree to this.
(Parliament agreed to the change in the voting order)
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
The present fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde sets out the fisheries opportunities for the Community fishing fleets for 2006 to 2011.
It is an important agreement for tuna fishing industry and grants fishing licences for the seven Portuguese surface longliners.
We therefore voted in favour of this report.
This agreement, in common with other fishing agreements with third countries, also raises important issues, however, as regards the economic viability of long-distance fishing fleets and the actual fishing opportunities granted in their field, given that the commercial nature of these agreements is constantly changing, and the partnership and development dimension has been strengthened.
There has been an immediate increase in the cost of the agreement, in the context of fewer fishing opportunities, not least due to cuts in the number of licences granted.
On the other hand, the cost to shipowners has gone up from EUR 25 to EUR 35 per tonne of tuna caught in seiners and longliners.
These conditions have exacerbated the difficulties experienced by shipowners in using these licences to supply the industry at national level, and in the increasing external deficit regarding fishing products.
I voted in favour of the report by Ingo Friedrich today as it contains positive elements such as the monitoring and reporting procedure to review every six months what has been done to ensure that the multilingual way of working in the European Parliament extends to the full range of official and working languages.
However, I view with regret the delays and restrictions on what will be possible in Irish in the time ahead.
This disappointment stems not from the role of Mr Friedrich but from the fact that the necessary preparatory work was not done by the Irish Government or the EU institutions.
I will continue to press for the restrictions on what can be done through the medium of Irish to be lifted.
(FR) Mr President, the GÃ¡l report proposes the creation of a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
I fear that Europeans' fundamental rights are sparsely represented, including in purportedly superior varieties of court.
I wish to speak about international criminal tribunals and, in particular, the one set up for the former Yugoslavia.
As I speak, a highly important Serbian leader, Vojislav Seselj - President of the Serbian Radical Party, one of the most important Serbian parties - who voluntarily gave himself up to that tribunal, has been detained for four years.
He does not have access in his own language to all the documents relating to the charge made against him.
He is a law professor and refuses to be defended by an officially appointed lawyer.
Moreover, he is being denied the right to defend himself.
I think that what we have here is a very grave violation of fundamental rights, and I wanted to draw our House's attention to this particular case, which is extremely serious.
(FR) Mr President, as I was saying just now, it is to be feared that these tribunals, which are wrongly presented as the perfect guarantors of human rights in Europe, instead lead only to such rights being violated. Through the excesses of these tribunals, confrontations between nations are perpetuated to an inordinate degree, and the necessary reconciliation between those nations is in that way delayed.
That is particularly true where the criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is concerned, and that is why we shall refer to the case of Mr Seselj every time that the issue of human rights is raised in this House.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the true motive behind the creation of the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency is to boost EU interventionism in third countries.
Hence the proposal, just adopted, to make the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy one of the action areas of the new Agency, which will pave the way for human rights to be used as a tool for applying pressure and for meddling in the internal affairs of other countries, and for the use of financial resources to be based on the EU's criteria and interests.
What is important to the EU, characterised as it is by double standards in its approach to human rights, are 'allies' and 'enemies'.
Or, put another way, the prevailing state of affairs dictates its interests in domination and exploitation, and its imperialist ambitions, Palestine being a glaring example of this.
For this reason, we have rejected these proposals, as part of our campaign for the vital causes of freedom, the citizens' fundamental rights and guarantees, social progress, peace and solidarity between peoples.
Sinn FÃ©in supports the upwards harmonisation of human rights standards in Europe and accordingly supports the principle of creating an Agency for Fundamental Rights.
For this reason we supported the report of Ms Gal and Ms. KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs.
We do have concerns however about the possible duplication of roles given the established role of the Council of Europe in these matters.
The shift of power from the Council of Europe to EU level is also something we are not entirely comfortable with.
As the Agency is to be built upon the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the work of the Agency should continue to cover the phenomena of racism.
An EU Agency for Fundamental Rights should tackle discrimination on a systematic basis rather than on a case-by-case basis as is the case with the Council of Europe.
I and my British Conservative colleagues support strongly the principle of upholding and developing human rights.
However, if the experience of its predecessor, the EUMC, is anything to go by, this agency will not help in the achievement of these worthy goals, having shown in the past that it is susceptible to political manipulation.
More seriously, the inspiration for the agency is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has no legal status pending the entry into force of the proposed European Constitution, something to which we are wholly opposed in principle.
In addition, we cannot support the creation of this new agency as we are opposed to creating new agencies when the case for them has not been made.
Taxpayers in the European Union have the right to expect parliamentarians to have a clear understanding of the costs of establishing new European agencies.
We are not convinced that this important matter has been given the due consideration it deserves.
(FI) Mr President, I am presenting this explanation of the vote not only for myself but also for my colleague Piia-Noora Kauppi.
I have to say that I am unhappy about two things relating to the vote on Mr Van Orden's report.
I must first complain that Mrs Harms misinformed everyone about the amendments we tabled, right in the middle of the vote.
Does she have no sense of honour?
It was out of order.
Secondly, I must point out that you did not provide an opportunity to correct that mistaken information, despite requests for you to do so.
As the outcome of the vote was very close, I am tempted to think that it could have gone the other way but for the mistaken information.
I myself said in this House earlier that we are not asking for this Treaty to be rescinded, but to be amended in the light of the latest information so we can be flexible on the closure date.
There can only be partial compensation for closure, and that will be for the lignite power plants, the dirtiest possible source of energy.
Thus, aid sought in the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would be spent on switching from a cleaner technology to a dirtier one.
Once again, measures by the Greens are tending to accelerate climate change, not hold it in check.
Although I am in favour of Bulgaria's accession to the Union in principle, I abstained on this report.
Under its current rules, the EU is currently having genuine difficulties in making decisions and in reaching agreements; under these conditions, it is premature to bring new participants around the table.
Our shared institutions must undergo reforms and new sources of funding must be found before we can properly press ahead with the integration of new Member States into the EU.
There needs to be a break in the enlargement process at this stage.
In any event, if Bulgaria's accession is to be confirmed on 1 January, I hope that certain safeguard clauses, not least regarding the free movement of persons, can be activated.
I will not be supporting this report.
I support the idea that Bulgaria should be able to join the EU, but I do not believe at this point in time either that they are really ready for membership or that the Union is ready to receive them.
This is only made worse by the attitude of the Bulgarian authorities towards the rights of minorities or judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
I realise there is little to be done at this stage, but unfortunately feel my position will be justified by future events.
Yet this is not a vote against free movement of EU citizens.
When they join on 1 January they should have the same rights as everyone else.
Ahead of Bulgaria's accession, scheduled for 1 January 2007, the majority in Parliament has adopted a report which, for the umpteenth time, lists the obligations that Bulgaria must meet; it criticises, congratulates, urges, and has the cheek to demand that Bulgaria do what other Member States fail to do.
The majority in Parliament is once again singing from the neoliberal hymn-sheet.
It has reverted to type by placing the accent on privatisation, on tenders and public contracts - thereby boosting the development of the private sector - and on more flexible labour laws.
Externally, it once again congratulates Bulgaria on its activities as a Member of NATO and on its agreement with the USA regarding the use of military facilities 'as a tangible commitment to the transatlantic alliance'.
In other words, this is the EU and its enlargement unmasked.
Last year, we were still labouring under the illusion that Bulgaria's accession to the EU would not be problematic in any way, in contrast to that of Romania, which was set to cause, or sustain major problems, as a result of which accession would have to be postponed until 2008.
This House insisted on the right to be able to codecide on the postponement for Romania, but failed to do the same for Bulgaria.
Meanwhile, the problems in Bulgaria do not appear any less significant.
With the benefit of hindsight, this House should have insisted on the same right of postponement for Bulgaria last year.
Although it was initially anything but evident that it would be possible for the newcomers to be admitted on 1 January 2007, opposition has in the last few months melted away surprisingly quickly.
The ambition to complete the longed-for enlargement after the collapse of the Iron Curtain prevails over practical objections.
A majority in this House decided today that Bulgaria can join the EU in 32 days' time.
Although nobody is enthusiastic, the opinion that another year's delay will not solve anything now prevails.
We feel that those in favour underestimate how negative this enlargement will be experienced in Member States where people will be inconvenienced by it and how unfavourable this can turn out to be for the further admission of newcomers.
I voted for the Van Orden Report.
I was pleased Parliament resisted attempts to water down the Bulgarian obligation to close units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station.
This is clearly part of the Accession Treaty commitment.
in writing. (DE) The fact that I reject the report on Bulgaria has nothing to do with any refusal on my part to acknowledge that the country belongs to the European community of states or to rejoice in the imminent arrival of new Members of this House.
What it does have to do with is the fact that the report is, in my view, seriously flawed as regards the way in which it discusses nuclear power or its too muted calls to the Commission for the safeguard clauses to be carefully reviewed and, if necessary, applied in good time.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor very briefly in order to say that I voted in favour of the Moscovici report because I believe that Romania should become a full member of the European Union, as it has taken some huge steps in the right direction.
I hope that, as regards the issue of minorities, there is the same openness and the same willingness in Romania as there is, for example, in Italy, where it has been acknowledged that minorities represent added value and that, by giving them skills, by providing them with opportunities and by letting them have their own culture and even their own local government, minorities actually create added value for the majority.
In this respect, I am relying on the willingness of the Romanian Government and of the minorities, whose numbers are quite substantial in Romania.
(SK) Despite the fact that there are many shortcomings with regard to Romania's level of preparedness, I voted in favour of the adopted report, as it is both critical and uncompromising.
I would like to emphasise that, besides the areas most frequently criticised, we must also not forget about the areas of human rights and minority rights.
I therefore welcome the provisions that point, albeit in a very general form, to the need for subsidiarity, and cultural self-determination at the very least, with the funding of complete mother tongue-education schemes for citizens of ethnic Hungarian background.
I believe that the Copenhagen Criteria stipulating the rights of ethnic minorities have not been consistently enforced, as evidenced by the reported scandal at BabeÅ-Bolyai University in Cluj where three lecturers lost their jobs on Monday for merely demanding that the university's premises be designated in multiple languages.
This gives a very bad signal, all the more so as Romania will be assuming responsibility in the Commission for multilingualism in the EU.
Following the accession of Romania, that country's problems will be an additional burden on the external and internal security of the EU.
The Commission's move to establish monitoring and systematic evaluation with the possibility of using the safeguard clauses is a very sensible decision.
Although I am in favour of Romania's accession to the Union in principle, I abstained on this report.
I feel that in the current context, in which the institutions have not been reformed, Europe is seriously haemorrhaging its efficiency in pursuit of enlargement.
Community finances must also be reformed and new sources of funding must be found before integrating countries that, as things stand, will not be net contributors to the budget but debtors.
There must be a moratorium on the enlargement process at this stage.
In any event, if Romania's accession is to be confirmed on 1 January, I hope that certain safeguard clauses, not least regarding the free movement of persons, can be activated.
Too far, too fast!
I will not be supporting this report.
I support the idea that Romania should be able to join the EU, but I do not believe at this point in time either that they are really ready for membership or that the Union is really ready to receive them.
This is made marginally worse by their attitude to international adoptions.
I realise that there is little to be done at this stage, but unfortunately feel my position will be vindicated by future events.
Yet this is not a vote against free movement of EU citizens.
When they join, as they will on 1 January, they should have the same rights as everyone else.
Yesterday, our group did not take the floor to discuss enlargement again, because the outcome is a foregone conclusion.
A majority in this House decided today that Romania can join the EU in 32 days' time.
It appears that postponement, as a result of which Romania was not allowed to join the EU on 1 May 2004 together with the ten other states, is not enough to get that country to comply with the original expectations.
Although nobody is enthusiastic, the opinion that another year's delay will not solve anything now prevails.
We feel that those in favour underestimate how negatively this enlargement will be experienced in Member States where people will be inconvenienced by it and how unfavourable this can turn out to be for the further admission of newcomers.
Public opinion is associating this enlargement more and more with low wages and poor reception of immigrant workers, or with crime, corruption, environmental pollution, discrimination against the Roma, fascistic movements, legal uncertainty, child beggars and financial scandals.
This will become an argument against the candidacies of Croatia and Macedonia, with the fact that those countries probably cause fewer problems than Romania and Bulgaria counting for nothing.
On 15 December 2004, we voted in favour of the principle that Romania and Bulgaria can be admitted in future, but today, we have reached the conclusion that admission in 2007 is not justified.
I voted in favour of this report on the accession of Romania.
I believe the Romanian authorities have to do more to bring order to the system of international adoptions of Romanian children, but this is not an issue that should delay membership.
Although the British Conservatives support cultural and linguistic rights for ethnic minorities, including Hungarian minorities, throughout the EU, we are concerned that invoking the principle of subsidiarity and self-governance for the Hungarian minority in Romania could set a precedent for forcing Member States to abandon their unitary constitutional arrangements.
Subsidiarity under Article 3B of the Treaty on European Union remains the legal basis for returning powers from the EU to the Member States whenever possible.
It remains a sovereign right of each Member State to determine how powers, including self-governance, should be devolved internally on an ethnic, religious, linguistic, or territorial basis.
in writing. (SV) I have chosen to vote against the report because Romania, in particular, cannot be regarded as fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
Its problems with corruption must be viewed as particularly serious, since they are in danger of undermining legal certainty and, ultimately, the democratic system.
The sensible thing would instead have been to have postponed accession until at least 2008 in order to make sure that the reforms were continuing and reaching an acceptable level.
Once membership has been obtained, not only will the countries concerned have less incentive to carry out reforms, but the EU will have fewer opportunities to exercise pressure.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor in order to express my satisfaction with the success of the reports on Romania and Bulgaria, particularly with the Moscovici report.
I must say that, although I am pleased with the report and with the progress made by Romania regarding the accession protocol, I, like so many other Members of this Parliament, am deeply dissatisfied regarding the issue of the moratorium on international adoptions, in which around 1 200 children are embroiled.
Romania had made assurances that it would review these cases, something that it has by no means done.
We are still in a situation in which these children, who have met their families, find themselves back in orphanages: this kind of resistance is unacceptable because, as has been said many times in this House, we must find a solution for these children, but certainly not by violating their fundamental right of having a family.
They have connected with these families and they should return to them.
We are calling for greater sensitivity on the part of the Romanian Government, even though the amendments tabled by Mrs Gibault and others have not been supported by Parliament, and we call for this sensitivity to take the form of a goodwill gesture towards these children, at least on the eve of Christmas.
(DE) Mr President, the fact that a majority was found to support Amendment 2 to the Van Orden report is attributable to the fact that the Austrian People's Party delegation voted in favour of it; the consequence of that has been to clarify and ensure compliance with Article 30 of the Protocol on the conditions and arrangements for the admission of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, that is to say, that the Treaty has been completed and that, in consequence thereof, reactors 3 and 4 at the Kosloduj nuclear power plant must be closed down.
Since that ensures that Kosloduj will be decommissioned, the Austrian People's Party delegation has voted for the report as a whole, and therefore for the accession of Bulgaria.
I am firmly convinced that Bulgaria and Romania are part of Europe and, as such, should become full Member States of the EU.
I do, however, regard the coming New Year as a premature time for them to do so, since there is evidence in both countries of deficits in the compliance with, and enforcement of, European requirements.
In view of the multiple documented instances of both countries' tardiness in complying with the accession criteria, particularly in relation to the combating of corruption and the presence of a functioning system of justice, I think it indefensible that the safeguard clauses for which provision has been made are not automatically being invoked with effect from 1 January 2007 in respect of the economy, the internal market, justice and home affairs.
It is for these reasons that I have been unable to vote in favour of these reports today.
in writing. (SV) The June List has pointed out on many occasions that it is very important indeed that the EU be enlarged but that this should only happen once the candidate countries are ready for membership, that is to say once they have fulfilled all the accession criteria.
Unfortunately, we have recently seen an unfortunate development whereby negotiations have been embarked on without the candidate countries being reasonably near to fulfilling the membership conditions.
Both Bulgaria and Romania are wrestling with great problems, especially when it comes to legal certainty and corruption.
To accept them as Member States at this juncture would, then, be against the principles of the EU.
These countries should have been required to make much more progress before they were offered EU membership, a process that might have taken a good number of years.
The June List believes, however, that, when a country actually has become an EU Member State, the same rules should be applied to it as are applied to the other Member States and their citizens.
The EU must have a common labour market with freedom of movement for workers.
According to the accession treaties, the individual Member States are, however, entitled to introduce transitional rules in this area for a limited period, and that entitlement must be respected.
Nonetheless, we do not believe that Sweden should make use of that right.
Since we do not believe that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to become Members by as early as 2007, we have voted against the two reports.
The EU's enlargement policy was and is an important means whereby stability may be brought to Central and Eastern Europe and to the Balkans.
It was and is the incentive of membership that made it possible - and still does - to persuade these countries to include in their state constitutions the fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law and the market economy and to actually put them into practice.
It is of the utmost importance that premature promises and adherence to fixed dates for accession should be allowed to lessen the pressure for reform exerted on candidate states by the EU.
I still take the view that the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria are happening too soon.
This is the sort of thing whereby precedents are created, since in neither case do the fundamental conditions for accession appear to have been met, even though they are required to be even before any accession negotiations are started, and not only on paper either.
That makes it all the more important that all institutions really do keep up their pressure on Bulgaria and Romania and that the implementation of those reforms that are still needed is monitored most closely.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports this resolution and would like to echo the congratulations and welcome given to both Bulgaria and Romania ahead of accession on 1 January 2007, whilst underlining the importance of adhering to commitments made in the Accession Treaty.
This includes the closure of plants 3 and 4 of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station before the end of 2006.
The EPLP would also like to emphasise that the EU is founded on clear principles of human rights, and therefore it is essential for all Member States and acceding countries to respect minority rights and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.
I voted against the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
Corruption and the rule of law are such that the criteria have not been met.
The question was whether accession of one or both countries can be delayed by one year.
The opportunity to postpone has once again not been seized, although objectively, according to the Commission report, there is every reason to do so.
This is why today, I will once again be voting against the Moscovici and Van Orden reports.
The voters ask time and time again for the criteria to be applied strictly, and whilst this is promised time and time again, this is not done.
This is why I personally - although I am in favour of admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the EU in due course - will be voting against it today.
(DE) Mr President, I find it very disappointing that this House has not, today, succeeded in sending out a very clear message to the effect that Europe is a community founded upon values and that it is not acceptable that human life in the form of embryos should be bred, exploited and disposed of.
I do hope, though, that the Commission's statement will prove to have some mileage in it.
I really do think it cause for shame that the Commission's statement should, as soon as today, be called into question or be made subject to an interpretation that actually does raise the question as to why, if what Mr Busquin said is indeed the case, the Commission made the statement in the first place?
Yet that is what it did do, and many Member States have taken a stand on it in order to exclude outright the possibility of Member States, such as, for example, the Federal Republic of Germany, being required, whether directly or indirectly, to cofinance a type of research that, in Germany, is very definitely illegal.
That, and nothing else, was what this statement was intended to do.
I hope that this will be reiterated with great clarity at the next meeting of the Council, for it is not acceptable that it should be Europe that opens the floodgates to the commercial exploitation of human life.
I believe, then, that, far from today being a black day, we have to once more spell out the fact that the Commission's statement can be interpreted to mean only that not only the use of embryos, but also their harvesting - and in particular the destruction that accompanies such harvesting - shall not be supported by means of European funds.
I support adoption of the Buzek report, which will enable the common position compromise agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to put in place and implement the Seventh Framework Programme, despite my disappointment that the budget allocated to research and technological development has been reduced.
I particularly support the compromise agreement reached on the sensitive issue of stem cell research, both adult and embryonic.
I will therefore vote against amendments, such as Amendment 49 tabled by Kathy Sinnott and others, which endanger embryonic stem cell research.
I am also especially supportive of references in this common position compromise which identify marine sciences and technologies as a cross-cutting scientific priority.
I hope that these references will enable the Marine Institute, headquartered at Oranmore, Co. Galway, to continue to provide a world-class platform for the development of marine science in Ireland and allow Ireland to play a more significant role internationally.
One of the questions concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013) that inevitably raises its head is its funding, or in this case its meagre funding, which is the consequence of the unsatisfactory agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
This is indicative of the lack of consistency between what are trumpeted as key EU objectives and the resources put in place to meet those objectives.
This is a recurring problem both in the EU and in Portugal.
Some positive results, however, have emerged from the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, which have just been debated and put to a final vote, of which I should like to highlight the increase in funds for SMEs and the prevention of work-related accidents.
Sadly, however, some proposals tabled by our group were not adopted, such as those relating to free software.
I welcome this report. I will vote in favour.
Europe's future lies with high technology, where we can compete with the rest of the world by being the best in the world.
I would have preferred ever more resources and a set of programmes closer to the market, but at least the Union is moving in the right direction.
I do support, with safeguards, research using human embryonic stem cells and I support Framework 7 resources being spent on this research.
The EU defined the issue of the oceans as one of its new strategic priorities on its political agenda.
More than just a fad, the preservation of the sea and of related marine activities is a vital prerequisite for prosperity in an increasingly globalised Europe.
In the future, Europe must invest in the development of new technologies relating to the sea and be a pioneer in new areas.
The fisheries sector must play a prominent role in the next Community framework and must be a research priority, on account of its current weakness, and given that the preservation of the oceans is a strategic EU priority.
The compromise reached to include fisheries as one of the main themes of the Seventh Framework Programme represents an important step towards preserving marine ecosystems and defending the Community's fisheries sector.
Given its overall importance for research in Europe and the fact that due prominence has been given to fisheries-related research, I have voted in favour of this document.
We welcome the adoption of FP7.
On the other hand, we underline that the compromise found on funding of research using human embryos and human embryonic stem-cells does not reflect the position of the EPP-ED Group as fixed before the first reading in June.
In a vote after discussion on many occasions, a big majority of the Group supported Amendment 319 by Niebler and others, who sought to fix a deadline.
We regret that the European Parliament did not support this amendment, especially because only 19 more votes were needed for the necessary majority.
The EPP-ED accepts that, according to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, Amendment 319 cannot be tabled for the second reading.
This does not change the position of the EPP-ED Group in this area.
I am pleased that the Industry Committee has managed to reach a consensus with the Council and Commission to allow the framework programme to be adopted before the end of the year.
I hope the reality of the 7th programme will be better than the 6th.
My contacts with users and potential users of EU research funds suggest that many, probably a majority, find the administrative burdens attached to utilising the money off-putting, cumbersome and often disproportionate to the benefits of obtaining funding.
We welcome the adoption of FP7.
On the other hand we underline that the compromise found on funding of research using human embryos and human embryonic stem-cells does not reflect the position of the EPP-ED Group as fixed before the first reading in June.
In a vote after discussion on many occasions, a big majority of the Group supported Amendment 319 by Niebler and others, who sought to fix a deadline.
We regret that the European Parliament did not support this amendment, especially because only 19 votes more were needed for the necessary majority.
The EPP-ED accepts that, according to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, Amendment 319 cannot be tabled for the second reading.
This does not change the position of the EPP-ED Group in this area.
We welcome the declaration of the Commission on Article 6 and we ask the Commission and the regulatory committee to bear in mind that almost 50% of the European Parliament voted for a more limited approach in this sensitive area.
Therefore, we ask the Commission and the regulatory committee to approve a careful approach when implementing FP7 and the procedure prescribed in the Commission declaration.
in writing. - (FR) I have today voted in favour of the Busquin report on the rules for participation in the Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development.
This report is part of the European Union's policy to promote research and supplements the Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development for 2007-2013, for which I have also voted.
The modifications made by this report to the rules of participation will make it possible to simplify and improve the operation and implementation of the next Framework Programme, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), whose participation in European research programmes will accordingly be encouraged.
The report pays particular attention to SMEs, calling for more flexibility, together with rules and controls adapted to the specific features of these enterprises.
I am delighted that European Union funding of SMEs is to be increased and that the report refers to more reasonable deadlines for making the payments.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to refer to the Directive on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles.
I must begin by saying that I have voted in favour, because, as a whole, we have genuinely improved the safety aspects, the environmental aspects, the aspects relating to human health and also the aspects relating to the interests of European companies.
I believe, however, that we have missed a good opportunity to establish a very clear distinction between fireworks, used in public celebrations or displays, in theatres, in cinema etc., and percussion pistons, which are used in toys, in airbags in vehicles and even in safety belts.
I believe that our text is a little confusing in this regard.
I hope that this can be improved in the future.
For the time being, my vote is in favour, though I do not consider the text to be entirely satisfactory.
(SK) We need clear rules for the pyrotechnical products market, and I have therefore supported the report by Joel Hasse Ferreira.
Thanks to the contribution of the European Parliament, professional users will now have access to facilitated procedures and product designations, such as those for airbags and safety belts in motor vehicles that employ pyrotechnical technologies.
This step will help sustain the competitiveness of Europe's automobile industry.
A single EU directive with harmonised safety requirements will now replace 25 national authorisation procedures operating in parallel, thus eliminating the present complicated legal framework, which lacks transparency and is a major administrative drag on enterprises.
I am convinced that we have taken a sensible step towards the free movement of pyrotechnical products, with particular emphasis on protecting human health and public safety.
The market in fireworks is characterised by problems relating to the quality of imported products, their safe handling, safe storage and their condition of manufacture.
I voted for this report and welcome the moves towards improving the safety of fireworks and their use.
Far too many people (particularly young people) suffer burns and scars because of faulty fireworks or mishandling.
in writing. (SV) We do not share the rapporteur's view that it is important to create a European system of social protection statistics at EU level.
The Member States are capable of cooperating on significant tasks of this kind without the interference of the EU institutions.
in writing. (DA) In protest against the Euratom treaty, I am voting against all the reports on revising the framework programmes for research and development within the nuclear area.
Instead, the 50th anniversary of the Euratom treaty should be used as an opportunity for a revision designed to ensure that it is only those countries that wish to participate that are party to Article 43 of the Treaty of Nice, relating to enhanced cooperation.
In that way, it may be ensured that those Member States that, like Denmark, neither have nor intend to acquire nuclear power are no longer forced to help fund it.
The June Movement believes that it is a mistake to invest in either nuclear power or fusion energy.
That is because there is such huge worldwide potential for solar and wind power which, even if we exploit only 10% of their potential, will provide 30 times more energy than will be consumed globally in 2010.
Energy policy should therefore be exclusively about devising a plan for exploiting this potential by further developing and extending already existing technology, including wind turbines, solar cells and wave power - and, eventually, hydrogen - for carrying and storing energy.
Not only the framework programmes for scientific research, but also the specific programmes, are being voted on, and, although it is the Parliament/Council compromise with regard to the framework programme that will be voted on, the specific programmes too, will be the subject of voting en bloc.
Exceptions are the specific programmes 'Ideas', 'Cooperation' and 'Capacities', where, although an extra change has been made to stem-cell research, the opinion that this House adopted in 2006 and on which the following compromise has been reached remains intact:
'Certain areas of research, such as activities aimed at cloning people reproductively or changing human genetic material, do not qualify for Community funding.
Moreover, the Commission confirmed that it will remain faithful to current practice, and will refrain from submitting proposals to the regulating committee that involve research activities in which human embryos are destroyed, not least when this involves the extraction of stem cells.
Whilst this research stage is excluded from funding, the Community has committed to funding the subsequent research stages, involving human embryonic stem cells'.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has voted for these amendments in 'Ideas' and 'Capacities'.
With regard to 'Cooperation', however, the shadow rapporteur has indicated a free vote, which we are also happy to accept.
in writing. (SV) We would have voted against Amendments 11, 20 and 21 if they had not been included in the block vote.
Since, however, Mr Guidoni's report attaches great importance to protection and security, we have voted in favour of the report as a whole.
I will vote against this report, mainly because I believe ITER to be an example of 'Big Science' that wastes money that would be best put to other R[amp]D projects that would do far more for EU competitivity and energy self-sufficiency than this enormous 'boondoggle'.
For more than half a century fusion was to deliver 'tomorrow', but the day has never come.
(FR) Mr President, having seen the floodgates opened to uncontrolled immigration by means of the Schengen agreements' abolition of EU border controls and seen whole swathes of asylum legislation communitised by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are now being invited to go further down the road of delegating competences to the EU by abandoning unanimous decision-making in the Council on issues of judicial and police cooperation.
Obviously, our Eurocrats never learn.
Having been alarmed by the unceremonious arrival on the Spanish and Italian coasts of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants taking advantage of the absence of border controls in order to enter European territory and having bitterly noted Europe's powerlessness to manage such situations, we now hear Mr Cavada, taking up where Mr Sarkozy left off, proposing to us that, by activating the bridging clause, we do away with the unanimity rule in the Council and so reduce by a still further degree the Member States' power to make decisions about their migratory flows.
It is not a Europe organised on federal lines that will be able to reduce cross-border crime. On the contrary, the European nations need to take a leaf out of Switzerland's book, take their future back into their own hands and be able to protect themselves effectively against the onslaught of migration.
The British Socialist delegation (EPLP) voted in favour of the Cavada report and the EP's resolution on the progress made in the EU towards the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) because we support any actions to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the EU institutions and their capacity to deliver for our citizens in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
Whilst we welcome the EP's demand on the importance of launching a wide debate on how to improve our effectiveness in this field, both procedurally and in practice, we nevertheless recognise and respect the significance for Member States in Council of agreeing how best to take this agenda forward.
It is imperative that any procedural decisions which would affect issues of national sovereignty are given full and serious consideration before any decisions are taken.
This debate should involve national parliaments and the European Parliament as well as the Member States in Council and the Commission.
in writing. (SV) We regret the fact that it has not been possible for the Constitution to enter into force and that, because of this, there is no codecision making in the very significant and far-reaching area of justice and home affairs.
We do, however, have serious doubts about resolving the current situation by using the bridging instrument and have therefore chosen to abstain in the final vote on the resolution on the EU's progress in creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
Parliament is tasked with assessing, on a yearly basis, the progress made by the EU in creating the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.
I am very much in favour of the idea that the European project should not be limited to economic areas and that, in addition to the Europe of trade, capital and services, a Europe of the citizens must be constructed.
It should be noted that a number of steps have been taken and significant progress has been made.
Yet we must also acknowledge that the pace and scope of measures must correspond better to the universally recognised needs in this area.
One of the reasons for the lack of more substantial progress is institutional; keeping many decisions under the third pillar and the unanimity requirement make adopting the necessary measures more difficult.
I would also highlight what I consider to be the most important new development this year, namely the legal basis for the second generation of the Schengen Information System.
I believe that it would be desirable for SIS II to be up and running as soon as possible and I feel that the Commission should notify Parliament of any delays that occur and the reasons behind those delays.
Although the resolution condemns the fact that the unacceptable supply of personal data by the EU to the USA undermines the citizens' fundamental rights and guarantees, the resolution before us is indicative of the federalist obsession dominating the majority in Parliament.
Hence the countless proposals to transfer Justice and Home Affairs from the sovereign control of the Member States and their institutions to supranational EU level.
Examples of this include the proposals to 'bring the provisions concerning police (including EUROPOL) and judicial cooperation on criminal matters (including EUROJUST) into the Community sphere' and to 'extend codecision with Parliament and qualified majority voting in Council' to immigration.
We therefore voted against the report.
A further reason to vote against was that the majority in Parliament rejected the inclusion in the resolution of proposals tabled by our group aimed at the following: firstly, condemning the immigrant detention centres; secondly, calling for respect for the right to asylum, and for compliance with the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; and thirdly, calling for funding to be used to improve asylum systems, to integrate immigrants and to combat the underlying causes of immigration, rather than promoting policies of detention and repatriation.
If there is in fact an area in which Parliament and the European Commission have been mistaken, it is in the establishment of their so precious and sought-after 'area of freedom, security and justice'.
When the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted, we were promised a European area in which all freedoms would be present and effective and in which we would be protected from all insecurity.
As we predicted, the opposite has occurred.
With the abolition of border controls by the Schengen Agreement and the communitisation of policies on asylum and visas, levels of immigration, in particular illegal immigration, and insecurity have never been so high, and there have never been so many mafia groups and criminals.
Today, Mr Cavada's resolution proposes that we go further in handing over powers to the European Union in the field of immigration policy, by abolishing the unanimity rule in the Council.
Once again, it is not by handing over these prerogatives of national sovereignty to the European Union that we will put an end to illegal immigration and the human tragedies associated with it.
The main cause of these problems is linked to the abolition of Member States' border controls.
Let us re-establish these controls: then, and only then, will Member States be in a position to fight effectively against the huge influx of illegal immigrants and the many cross-border crimes.
in writing. (SV) The global fight against HIV/AIDS is a very pressing issue, requiring a comprehensive international commitment.
We are, however, of the view that the HIV/AIDS issue should not be dealt with within the framework of EU cooperation.
We believe that the fight against HIV/AIDS should be conducted by the individual EU Member States within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The June List seeks limited EU cooperation.
We are opposed to the EU having influence and competences in respect of issues already being dealt with by other international organisations.
However, this resolution is, for the most part, an opinion on how AIDS should be combated.
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution as a whole and of those amendments advocating reproductive health care.
If we want to address the spread of HIV and AIDS effectively, it is essential to channel specific funds to various vulnerable groups.
In this respect, it is important for non-governmental organisations to be actively involved, so that they can monitor national authorities and call them to account once the international agreements are implemented.
In addition, people infected with HIV must be involved in the setting up of policy and be at the heart of policy that pertains to them.
Since the fight against HIV and AIDS is one of the biggest challenges the world has to face, this resolution deserves our support.
The motion for a resolution highlights existing problems by proposing some practices for dealing with and managing the situation.
However, the inability to prevent and combat the illness persists as a parameter which reproduces the poverty and misery of the populace in less capitalistically developed countries, resulting in further exploitation, especially of the natural wealth.
In addition, the huge spread of the illness in less capitalistically developed countries constitutes a source of the spread of the illness worldwide, with serious repercussions on world public health.
The fundamental approach to the problem of AIDS is based on resolving this political and economic issue for the benefit of the peoples.
Drugs and the scientific knowledge and techniques which lead to their production are social commodities.
We are fighting against action to protect the monopolies which prevent or make it hard for the people to obtain essentials.
It is the duty of every state to protect the health of its people.
We refute and condemn the substitution of public and permanent health services by non-governmental organisations and the philosophy of voluntary supply and individual responsibility being promoted internationally as a solution to public health problems.
The states in which there is a health system must orientate themselves towards the creation of permanent public infrastructures and services at all stages, with suitable scientific personnel and primary health care as the main objective.
They can also be supported by international financing, with management responsibilities vested in international health organisations, and cooperation and assistance can be established at scientific and practical level globally between nations.
I voted in favour of this Resolution on the fight against AIDS.
HIV/AIDS transcends all borders and knows no limitations.
It is relentless in its global spread, infecting over 450 people every hour, totalling more than 4 million people per year.
In 2005, 40 million people were living with HIV, approximately 95% of them in developing countries, placing an impossible burden on the health system and economy in general.
HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest threat to attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
I believe the number-one objective for the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry today is finding a vaccine for AIDS.
Such a discovery would allow us to imagine a world without AIDS.
in writing. - (FR) AIDS is back with a vengeance.
Record levels have been reached in Belgium, with 1 072 new infections in 2005: an increase of 52% in eight years.
Fewer people die of the disease, at least in Belgium.
AIDS has become commonplace, however.
Using condoms is like having to follow a diet all year round; sometimes, you want to give in.
We must therefore strengthen the resources for prevention and, in areas strongly influenced by religion, point out that calls for abstinence are out of the question.
It was for this reason that I co-signed the draft resolution on AIDS.
I wanted to draw attention to the children who are victims of AIDS.
There are 15 million children orphaned due to the disease, of which 12 million are in Africa alone.
Professor Montagnier, who discovered the virus, said that it would take ten years for the full impact of the wave of infection to be seen and that the demographic impact would be considerable, because the disease would wipe out an entire population of young adults.
This Friday is the International Day of Action on HIV and AIDS.
We cannot miss this opportunity to point out the growing magnitude of AIDS.
Thankfully, the death rate due to other infectious diseases should, meanwhile, decrease.
- (LT) In voting today, I endorsed the most important provisions of the Report on the situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007.
I would particularly like to stress the importance of employment for the disabled and, through employment, the chance to avoid social isolation.
It is very important that work should also be available to people with mental disability or people with multiple disabilities, in accordance with their capacities.
Therefore, it is essential not only to implement the Council's Directive establishing the general basis for a uniform attitude to employment and the professional field, but also to prepare a special Directive regarding disability and to create a common European definition of disability.
In addition, it is important to initiate information campaigns and community and employer education regarding the employment of disabled people as quickly as possible.
There should be public expression of respect and community appreciation for companies that employ disabled people.
The various forms of discrimination and injustice faced by disabled people and their families are well known.
Although progress has been made, there remains much to be implemented.
One of the key priorities is to strengthen public policies aimed at ensuring that equal rights are effectively upheld.
More investment is needed in public policies of health, education, social security and employment that will guarantee free access to high-quality services, that will promote social inclusion and that will combat poverty and exclusion.
The report adopted today refers to the different areas in which the actions of the Member States could be improved.
We also welcome the call, which Parliament has just adopted, for a specific directive on disability to be adopted and for the recently adopted UN International Convention of the Rights of Disabled Persons to be ratified and signed.
Hence our vote in favour of the adopted resolution in the hope that due prominence will be attached to it.
in writing. - (EL) The ÎU is deliberately concealing the class-based causes of the problems of people with disabilities.
Many would not be disabled today if there were health and safety measures in places of work and business, if there were only free public health systems and rehabilitation centres integrated into them without any business activity.
On the contrary, further decoupling of disabilities from health services is proposed, taking the anti-grassroots Maastricht and Lisbon decisions as given.
Certain individual measures appear to be positive.
However, they mostly facilitate privatisations and maximisation of the profit of capital, by methodically eliminating resistance from disabled and grassroots movements.
No mention is made of the obligation of states to provide special, free schools for all disabled children, work with full rights for those able to work and special care and protection.
The employment of disabled persons is mentioned in tandem with cuts to benefits, rather than with the right to work and protection.
No mention is made of the rights won in the former socialist countries, which capitalism is taking away.
How many disabled persons used to go to school and how many go now.
How many were in work under socialism and how many are in work now.
What capital is interested in is in forming elites in organisations of the disabled, so that it can lead them by the hand.
The disabled must view talk about 'equal rights' and 'combating discrimination' with distrust: the aim is to extend the privatisation and commercialisation of social policy, thereby harming the disabled and the poor, grassroots classes.
They must step up their fight against the policy of capital.
I voted for this excellent report.
Disabled people have the right to be in a position where they can make the same individual choices and have the same control in their everyday life as non-disabled people.
This clearly emphasises the need for an environment that enables disabled people to be as independent as possible.
The recommendations in this report, if implemented, would take us a long way down that worthwhile road.
The trend towards the elimination of many forms of discrimination faced by disabled people is a welcome one.
As regards employment, the main restrictions that disabled workers face come in the form of prejudice among employers' organisations, access to information and communication technologies, and the use of public transport to get to work.
The main consequence of these physical barriers is higher levels of unemployment among these workers.
I am therefore in favour of specific actions at both EU and national level aimed at targeting support to services encouraging the integration into society, education, vocational training and the labour market of people with disabilities.
Against this backdrop, I support this report, as I am in favour for example of promoting access for the disabled to the Internet, and in particular to the websites of public institutions.
I find it appalling that the socialist government in Portugal is pursuing the exact opposite line, by proposing a reduction in incapacity and tax benefits for the disabled in the 2007 State budget
in writing. - (FR) Accessibility of public transport and information and communications technology is vital for people with disabilities, who have a right to better integration in education and in the labour market.
The rapporteur rightly recommends a European charter on 'quality of support for people with disabilities'.
That is why I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Lynne, which also highlights the need for European legislation on the rights of people with disabilities to have access to all modes of transport, on the model of the laws in force for air passengers with disabilities.
We must break down prejudices.
Information campaigns should be devised to encourage employers to give unprejudiced consideration to taking on people with disabilities, particularly in the light of false notions about the financial cost of this type of employment and about the abilities of candidates.
Member States should ensure that the management of disability is offered as a new service for businesses. In terms of prevention, this would ensure that those affected by disabilities in the workplace would keep their jobs; in terms of rehabilitation, it would help them to get back to work.
Although we welcome the measures aimed at removing bureaucracy and simplifying administration, not least for SMEs - provided this does not mean the 'simplification' of existing processes aimed at protecting the workers - and at improving access to funding, we feel that the path suggested by this report is a dangerous one.
The growing emphasis on the link between education/teaching systems and the business world is worrying, as it will lead to the merchandising of education and the replacement of education for the citizen by workforce-orientated training.
At the same time, 'entrepreneurship' is posited as a solution to the problems of unemployment in the EU, along with attempts to validate the idea of 'employability', whereby areas that are the responsibility of the State revert solely to individual responsibility, contravening what is proposed in the so-called draft European Constitution.
The same can be said for the 'inevitability' of raising the retirement age, which undermines the rights of workers and of young people looking for work in an increasingly sparse labour market.
Lastly, it sets great store by private-public partnerships, which, as a rule, are a way of handing on a plate to the private sector important areas that, given their social nature, belong in the public domain.
Hence our vote against the report.
in writing. - (FR) What purpose is served by Mrs del Castillo Vera's report?
The enticing title, 'Time to move up a gear - Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth' conceals a list, typical in this House, of truisms and principles.
Some of these are very useful, such as promoting small and medium-sized enterprises or streamlining bureaucracy, but are never put into practice in Community legislation.
Others - a dogmatic attachment to free trade, competition taken to extremes and the ever increasing European dimension, etc. - are the very cause of the problems that we claim to want to resolve.
In the end, the most instructive part of the report is the three pages of 'citations', which make up at least a third of the text.
They contain what is perhaps not even an exhaustive list of documents summarised by the report, all of which is far from moving up a gear as promised.
They are, above all, symbolic of the logorrhoea that the European institutions are capable of showing on the subject of growth and employment in order to disguise their share of responsibility for the disastrous social and economic situation in Europe.
in writing. (PT) I supported this excellent report, which offers a way for the EU to deal successfully with competition on the world market.
The EU can derive benefits in tackling international competition from fostering a culture of innovation and research.
Pursuing this line, the EU must channel all its efforts into promoting the entrepreneurial spirit and in particular SMEs. This is because:
they play a key role in the European economy, contributing to stronger and longer-lasting growth;
they are responsible for around 95% of the jobs created;
they can serve as an effective meeting point between universities and businesses;
they guarantee a vital link between the realities of manufacturing and its territorial dimension, and thus enable the phenomenon of relocation to be overcome and managed.
In spite of this fundamental contribution to economic growth, the SMEs continue to be beset by obstacles.
Non-wage costs are one of the biggest obstacles facing SMEs; they often do not create jobs because they are unable to meet the administrative requirements involved.
SMEs continue to be affected by bureaucratic obstacles, including access to capital markets, to Community programmes and to the Structural Funds.
That concludes the explanations of vote.

Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 30 November 2006 have been distributed.
Are there are any comments?
(NL) Mr President, as you will remember and as is also evident from the Minutes, we held the debate on World AIDS Day and Europe's measures in this field on Thursday, which featured the issue of the Global Health Fund and funding.
In the debate with the Commission, it became apparent that Parliament was extremely anxious about the lack of funding; the reason why it quizzed the Commission about the development instrument - which will be the subject of tomorrow's debate - was that this instrument was at risk of being looted in favour of the Global Health Fund, with the risk of the same mistake being made twice.
I can inform you that we in the Committee on Development received a letter from the Commission on 3 December in which it still pledges to get the funds for the Global Health Fund from the European Development Fund and to leave the programming of the thematic section of the development instrument alone.
We will continue this debate tomorrow, but it is good to make a mental note of this.
I am sorry, Mr Van den Berg, but I do not understand how what you have said relates to the Minutes of the sitting.
Are you suggesting any amendment of the Minutes?
(NL) No, Mr President, I have no comments regarding the content of the Minutes.
You have indulged in a little parliamentary filibustering, but what is done is done, there is nothing we can do about it now.
It will be recorded in the Minutes, of course.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 7 December 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
We shall examine the amendments proposed.
Tuesday:
Mr President, there is a slight mistake in Tuesday's agenda regarding Commission Question Time.
According to the English version, Question Time starts at 6 p.m. and goes on until 7.30; in the French version, it starts at 6.30 and goes on until 7.30.
So either our French colleagues are being deprived of half an hour of questions, which is not very fair on them, or the French agenda is correct and we are all being deprived of half an hour of questions, which is not very fair on us.
Perhaps you could explain.
Without wishing to set a precedent, I must tell you that the French version is the correct version.
(DE) Mr President, I am not surprised by your claim that this is not a precedent.
I have looked into this.
The reality is that, of all Question Times this year, 75% were cut short or deferred, yet we are told, again and again, that this is exceptional.
No, when I said a precedent I was talking about our taking the French version as the correct version.
That was what I meant when I said, 'without wishing to set a precedent'.
- Thursday:
With regard to the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes that the item 'Release of health workers imprisoned in Libya' be replaced with the item 'Myanmar'.
Does that group wish to explain its proposal?
It would appear not.
Mr Swoboda, do you wish to speak for or against?
(DE) Mr President, that is a very difficult question.
I would like to hear some justification for why we should now discuss Burma instead of the unfortunate nurses and medical personnel in Libya, whom we do not want to let down so badly in this way.
If I am to be able to speak in favour or against, I would like to hear a justification first; if there are good reasons for making matters even more difficult for these nurses, then we propose to abstain, but the message needs to go out from this House that Libya is being criticised for the fact that they are not yet at liberty.
Mr President, that is exactly it.
It is not the right time.
The judicial proceedings involving the Bulgarian nurses have come at a very critical moment.
Having such a resolution this week would be very dangerous; it would do more harm than good.
It is for that reason that it would be better to shelve any proposal to have a motion for a resolution this week and to change the topic entirely.
(DE) Mr President, even though we shall be abstaining in the vote on the replacement, we can go along with the substance of these arguments, but I would like once again to emphasise - and I hope that we agree on this - that we will be raising objections to the actions taken in Libya and shall be continuing to defend the interests of the Libyan nurses and the medical personnel as we have done in the past.
It was not very clear to me whether you were speaking for or against, but we shall proceed to the vote in any case.
(Parliament accepted the proposal)
(The order of business was adopted)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Many Members are listed, but they will not all be able to speak.
I shall have to be strict about speaking times and I would remind you that Members who have spoken in either, or both, of the previous two sittings will not have priority.
Members that did not speak in either the sitting of 13 November or the sitting of 29 November will have priority.
(SK) As soon as the Commission announced last October that the free movement of citizens from the new Member States would be postponed until 2009, we voiced our objections in the European Parliament.
We also launched several initiatives, including questions to the Council and Commission, and we subsequently drafted Declaration No 72, which is still pending.
This declaration is designed to ensure compliance with the original deadline for accession to the Schengen area.
For this reason I regard the decision taken last week on St. Nicolas Day by EU interior ministers, enabling citizens from the nine new Member States to travel freely within the European Union from 1 January 2008, as a great success of the European Union and a consequence of the intervention by the MEPs.
Colleagues, I would like to thank you for your support.
I am convinced that all countries, including Slovakia, will soon agree upon the strict security requirements involved in temporarily deploying an enhanced version of the current system as proposed by Portugal.
(EL) Mr President, last week Turkey made a 'Diplomatic move' by agreeing to open a port and an airport for trade with the Republic of Cyprus.
Their timing was a bit odd, considering that their move was made during the COREPER meeting.
However, the Turkish proposal is nothing more than a clumsy, unacceptable and provocative manoeuvre, whose sole objective is to bypass the obligations undertaken by Ankara towards the European Union and its Member States.
Not only is Ankara persisting on essentially denying its obligations, but also is arrogantly setting conditions aimed at gaining favours in Cyprus.
Turkey's obligations towards the European Union are very specific and are not subject to bargaining.
Given these facts, the European Union should reject without further consideration these so called Turkish proposals.
I believe that the European Union should unanimously reject this inappropriately provocative offer.
(FR) Mr President, as I speak, the trial of Mr Vojislav Seselj, the chairman of Serbia's main party, the Serbian Radical Party, is getting under way.
Mr Seselj surrendered voluntarily in January 2003, four years ago, when the indictment against him was published.
The indictment referred only to speeches and a political plan to bring all Serbs together in a single country; that may be questionable of course, but we know what very painful circumstances that country has been through.
Mr Seselj has been held in solitary confinement since December 2004 for granting interviews to Serbian newspapers, but the prosecutor, Mrs Uertz-Retzlaff, speaks against him in the press freely.
Mr Seselj is demanding to see his family; he should be entitled to do so and to appear freely.
He is demanding to correspond with the Tribunal in Serbian, his native language, which he is also entitled to do, but is being denied that right.
As a doctor and professor of law, he wishes to conduct his own defence, which is a fundamental right.
He is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal, whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution.
What does Alphons Orie, the presiding judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have to say about this?
I quote: the court finds that the accused's self-representation ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Igor Smirnov, who, 15 years ago seized power with the help of the Russian forces in Transnistria, had himself elected for another five years as the president of an illegitimate country.
The dictator, who holds a Russian passport and was trained by the KGB, claimed 80% of the vote.
The election was organised by an illegitimate government on territory controlled by foreign military forces; its result is null and void in terms of international law.
The Smirnov regime will not be made any more legal by the permission given to three weak opponents to take part in a contest the result of which was known in advance, having been decided in Moscow during the summer.
Smirnov's only serious rival, Mr Shevchuk, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of Transnistria, withdrew his candidacy at the urgent request of the Kremlin.
The European Union must continue to support Moldova's territorial integrity.
Our border assistance mission has proved successful where Russia's de facto veto has paralysed the OSCE's effectiveness.
The greatest obstacle to the self-determination of the inhabitants of Transnistria is the presence of Russian forces.
We must urgently demand their departure.
(EL) Mr President, Article 49 of the European Union Treaty, which contains the accession clause to the European Union, specifies the role of the Union's institutions.
According to the said article, the Council is the body which decides on negotiations.
I direct two questions to this Body and the present European Commission: First, on what legal grounds does the European Commission carry out European Union accession negotiations with candidate countries on behalf of the European Union?
Second, is the European Commission authorised to express political opinions on critical issues for the selection or non-selection of a candidate country during interim, nonetheless, decisive stages of the negotiation procedure?
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to your attention the tragic development in the Middle East and the immediate need for swift and effective intervention.
We need to stabilise the region or at least prevent any deterioration which would have unforeseen consequences.
Europe is not absent from that region.
It is present: with its diplomatic action, its development and humanitarian aid, its corporate relations in the Mediterranean and its participation in peace-keeping forces.
However, it did not manage to play an effective role and so we must look into it immediately, because our hopes that military interventions will create a new Middle East with democracy and stability are not coming true.
Therefore, we must look into a new intervention plan; moreover I believe that the European Parliament can promote the relevant talks, demanding results, which will positively affect the prosperity of both the people living in the region and ourselves of course, because whatever is happening in our neighbourhood should concern us.
Mr President, I rise to speak because of my concern about the interference by Commissioner McCreevy in Irish politics last week, where he made a public statement challenging the Irish Government's policy with regard to health insurance on the Irish market.
The area he is interfering in is not his responsibility: he has responsibility for the internal market, not for competition.
In addition to that, the policy being pursued by the Government has been approved by the Commission and has recently been approved by the Irish courts.
My only conclusion is that Commissioner McCreevy is assisting his former Cabinet colleague and friend, Minister Harney, in shifting her policy on health insurance and blaming Brussels for that shift in policy. That is an unacceptable direct interference by a Commissioner in Irish political decision-making.
I would appeal to you, Mr President, to make those concerns known to President Barroso.
I will pass on to you the correspondence I have had on that matter with the President and with Commissioner McCreevy.
I shall communicate your points to Mr Barroso so that he can take the action he deems appropriate, Mr De Rossa.
Mr President, I apologise for not being here when you first called me.
A number of years ago, I, along with other Members of this Parliament, was involved when Europe provided funds for a study into having a ferry service between Ballycastle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and Campbeltown in Scotland.
The study was dutifully carried out, proved to be good, and the ferry service started and ran for a short time.
The Scottish Parliament agreed to provide GBP 700 000, with the Northern Ireland Executive being prepared to provide GBP 300 000, making a total of GPB 1 million as a seedling grant to get the service up and going.
Now we find that, while the Scottish Executive is prepared to honour its position and to pay the money up front, the direct-rule minister, Maria Eagle, is refusing to honour her side of the agreement.
That is totally unacceptable and wrong.
I have raised this with the Secretary of State and with Commissioner Barrot and I want to pursue it as far as possible.
I see that the Irish bench is waking up.
Mr President, I want to bring to the attention of the Commission - and, if possible, try to get a resolution about - a difficulty that Irish fishermen are facing at present because of an inflexible interpretation of the '100 kilometre rule', which means that fish must be landed and processed within a 100-kilometre range.
The difficulty is that a lot of the processing capacity in Ireland is not exactly on the shore or on the docks, but further inland.
This creates difficulties in terms of transportation, since road transport counts as part of the 100-kilometre range.
I ask Commissioner Borg to look very carefully at that issue and give us a more flexible interpretation of the rule: both to allow what is a very successful Irish fishing industry to continue, and because it has an impact not only on Irish catches but also on the ability of other boats operating in Irish waters to land their catches in Ireland.
This means they have to travel further, use more fuel, and are being forced to land their catches in other markets, which may not necessarily benefit the European Union as a whole.
