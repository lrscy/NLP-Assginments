I am also concerned about plans to phase out some of the opt-outs to the Working Time Directive, which give additional flexibility.
Of course it is important to ensure that people do not have to work excessive hours, but there are many aspects of the Working Time Directive that just add red tape and do not give proper protection to working people: these measures just make it more difficult for them to run their lives in the way they would like to.
There are other proposals which I think are overreactions: the intention in the Chemicals Regulation, for example, is that one must control and regulate the use of dangerous chemicals, but this should not give rise to the disproportionate reaction we have seen from that regulation.
Many items of European legislation are over-intrusive and simply add to business costs.
In the end, that will cost jobs for people in Europe and very often mean that consumers end up getting a worse deal and a narrower range of choices.
To make the Lisbon agenda a reality we have to cut down on the red tape produced by the European Union.
Â Â  Â . Â MrÂ President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members who took the floor for speaking in this debate.
I should also like to thank them for the ideas they put forward.
Unfortunately, time constraints are such that I am unable to comment in detail on all of the latter.
I would, however, like to highlight what I feel are the key aspects of the debate.
There seems to be widespread agreement that the rate of growth needs to increase, and that our present rate is unsatisfactory.
Nonetheless, I would caution against simplistic comparisons.
For a comparison between the UnitedÂ States and Europe to be valid, their respective starting points must be taken into account.
The anticipated commitments of both areas must be borne in mind too.
Even a comparison between the Eurozone and the zone beyond it is not straightforward.
Essentially, the key issue arising at present is whether the Lisbon diagnosis remains valid or not.
I am convinced that basically, increased capacity for growth in Europe depends on two factors, namely more employment in Europe and more productive employment.
I believe this diagnosis remains valid.
If that is the case, the question arises as to what is going wrong in Europe.
I do not believe the difficulty lies in the diagnosis.
Rather, the difficulty lies in the implementation and practical application of what was decided in Lisbon.
It has to be said, however, that the Commissionâs report clearly states that progress has been made in certain areas, though there is general dissatisfaction regarding others.
On the one hand, ground has undoubtedly been gained on the employment front.
On the other, rather less has been achieved concerning productivity.
Progress has also been made within the internal market, though not on the scale anticipated.
A number of obstacles have been overcome, allowing the financial system to become more unified.
Unfortunately, unification has not yet resulted in bringing financial costs down to a level comparable with what is the norm in the UnitedÂ States.
Certain additional elements have been put in place, and I am sure these will prove helpful.
In my view, the growth initiative is an important factor in relaunching other aspects.
Our proposals for this year focus on those elements that can facilitate productivity and ensure it increases.
Research and development are indeed one of the objectives set.
It is, however, important to put discussion of research and development into context.
Clearly, 3% of GDP is a figure similar to that of the UnitedÂ States, but if one distinguishes between public and private investment in research and development in Europe and in the UnitedÂ States, the figure for public investment in Europe is higher than in the UnitedÂ States.
The question arises as to whether the figure alone is the problem, or whether the problem concerns our ability to work better between ourselves, avoiding duplication of activity.
There is also the issue of generating added attraction and promoting private activity.
These factors are all crucial, in my view.
I certainly feel these priorities are well chosen and appropriate.
It should always be remembered that the Lisbon strategy also has clear limits.
All agree that it should be a sustainable strategy.
That implies a certain appropriate degree or level of social protection.
It also implies a certain level of environmental protection.
This led to further points raised during the debate.
The question arose, for instance, as to whether this was a difficulty related to defining a strategy.
I maintained this was not the case.
It is a problem of the political will, essentially at national level, to implement agreements reached.
As to whether the StabilityÂ andÂ GrowthÂ Pact is a problem or a positive element, I myself believe the latter is the case.
I believe sound finances are essential to long-term growth.
With regard to fiscal policy acting as a discretionary element to improve growth in the short term, it might indeed serve as such in some cases, at least in theory.
In my view, however, it is also important not to overlook certain other fundamental issues.
Firstly, the operation of the budgets and automatic stabilisers in Europe.
This is far more dynamic here than in the UnitedÂ States.
It means that every one-point drop in activity is compensated for by half a point as regards budget deviation.
There is indeed a limit in place, that notorious 3%.
Experience has proved it to be a reasonable limit.
I am convinced this is still the case, and that it is useful for the EuropeanÂ Union to have a fiscal framework.
I also believe this fiscal framework calls for budgetary balance to be achieved in the medium term, given the difficulties anticipated and the ageing population.
Further, it seems to me that 3% as a nominal reference is a key factor for that budgetary balance in the medium term.
It is essential to the desired efficient system that will make it possible to control activities under way and allow us to cooperate.
I therefore feel it is vital to tackle the problems related to the future of the pact.
As I see it, the Treaty remains valid.
The fundamental concepts certainly do.
Nonetheless, improvements are called for in certain areas.
The interrelation between the guidelines for economic policy and the pact is certainly one such area.
It is important not to focus on fiscal consolidation .
Fiscal consolidation should be perceived as a way of generating increased growth.
Clearly, this is closely connected with the BroadÂ Guidelines of economic policy.
It presents a second difficulty we have become aware of in recent years, namely that some of the problems currently experienced result from inappropriate action at a critical point in the economic cycle.
Growth elements have been introduced into the pact by giving more importance to structural deficits.
Last Novemberâs communication was along those lines.
Some problems do still remain in this crucial area, of course.
We are certainly prepared to discuss and debate them.
We feel the problem of the future is extremely important.
With this in mind, the debt needs to become more important in the pact game.
So too should all future commitments that are bound to have a negative impact on growth in the long term.
Issues like the ageing of the population and the need to fund future commitments are crucial.
I have one last remark to make.
In my view, as some honourableÂ Members have indeed pointed out, the national will to apply the pact is absolutely vital.
This could mean improving current budgetary processes.
I have in mind changes to ensure national parliaments themselves are more involved in defining their own future commitments and in meeting the commitments eventually entered into.
I feel the starting point is sound.
Increased growth would of course be welcome, and the margin for manoeuvre is indeed limited.
In establishing its financial perspective, the Commission endeavoured to achieve a balance between on the one hand, not exceeding the current margin of manoeuvre, despite the additional commitments, whilst on the other hand, not increasing the current financial margin more than absolutely necessary.
We are very much aware that at the end of the day the Unionâs budget is 1, 1.4, 1.24%.
We appreciate that the major element of public expenditure is currently at national level.
Consequently, if there is no cooperation at national level it will not be possible to move towards that increased growth we all aspire to for Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank every Member who participated in the debate.
I may not agree with all of the analysis, but I found the debate extraordinarily interesting and very constructive.
I do not have time to mention each of the points, but there were a number of interesting points made during the course of the debate.
Mr Blokland, for example, illustrated that the Lisbon agenda is running out: we can number the amount of time we have left in days.
That was a very interesting point.
Flexibility in our approach was emphasised by MrÂ Crowley, and Mr De Rossa indicated how dynamic a world Europe exists in and how extraordinary the challenges are which arise from that.
Not surprisingly speakers were very clear as to the need to continuously tackle the barriers that prevent full implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Mr Baron was absolutely correct when he said that the way to hell is paved with good intentions; there are plenty of good intentions in the Lisbon strategy.
As presidency we are conscious that as well as expressing good intentions we also need to focus the whole process in very much the way that Mr Watson suggested.
The strategy does not belong to the European institutions, but to the people of Europe.
There are many stakeholders here â a point well made by Ms Randzio-Plath.
Somehow we have to engage the attention of all these stakeholders â not just the Member State governments and the institutions, but the people of Europe â and make sure they focus on the agenda itself and what this means in reality.
Many Members spoke about the issue of regulation.
I am not sure that Mr Jonckheer and myself would agree with each other, but he made the point about the concerns that exist about liberalisation and regulation, a matter that was also touched on by many other speakers.
We feel very strongly that a significant amount of time and attention must be focused on making sure that regulation is effective, i.e. that it helps the process rather than hindering it.
Another of the key focuses in the debate was on what is necessary to put in place to create a truly knowledge-based economy.
I would agree with Commissioner Reding who at the very outset made a point about the necessary emphasis on education.
I would also agree with the points made by Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo on the need for research and development.
There were many contributions throughout the debate about how we deal with the issue of creating a knowledge-based economy and I believe that Members were correct in pointing out that education is key, as is investment in research and development.
One point that did strike me was the one made again and again about the necessity of creating a research environment within the Europe.
Researchers are the seed capital of a knowledge-based economy and the EU and its Member States must recognise this.
The Lisbon strategy is not some musty academic concept; it is vital to the lives of the citizens of the EU-15 and, as from 1 May 2004, it will also be vital to the lives and wellbeing of 450 million citizens of our Union across 25 states.
It is an endeavour that deserves all of our attention, our energy and our ingenuity.
Insofar as this presidency is concerned it is a key priority and we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it.
At the March European Council meeting we intend to use a focused, as opposed to scatter-gun, approach.
We believe that we have to focus very carefully on those things that we can achieve and get on with the task of achieving them.
In conclusion I would like to thank each Member for their contributions to this very interesting and focused debate.
Â Â  We should like to thank the Council.
To conclude the statements on the follow-up to the Lisbon Strategy, I have received three motions for resolutions.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  . The European Union must modernise the operation of our labour markets.
We must ensure that we coordinate our economic policies to a greater extent.
We must ensure that we bring about less and better regulatory reforms.
We must guarantee that we complete the trans-European networks in the transport and energy sectors.
We must ensure that all areas of the European Union, both urban and rural, peripheral and central, receive maximum benefit from new technologies that are coming on stream.
The European Union, if it is to remain competitive and if we are to reach the targets laid down by EU leaders concerning the implementation of the Lisbon strategy requires the enactment of a series of legislative measures at an EU level.
We have to ensure that the internal market is fully completed.
We should also ensure that we invest to a greater extent in research and development policies and this is one area where the European Union has been lacking when compared to the US in recent times.
I support the European Union becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
And we must all work towards this goal.
Â Â  . â The European Commission should compile a timetable for the Member States, specifying who is going to achieve what, when and how.
The European mini-summit in Berlin has once again demonstrated that everyone is agreed on the objectives but not on the actions to be taken, and so we are not making any headway.
Replacing the current vague agreements with a timetable with exact objectives should help the Heads of Government find a way to invigorate the knowledge economy and make the European labour market more flexible.
In addition, during the Spring Summit, the Commission should indicate what has been done about removing superfluous legislation, of which, according to the Commissionâs promises to European industry, 25% is to be deleted.
By reducing the burden of administration, companies will once again have the chance to be enterprising and thereby generate economic growth.
A European 'super-Commissioner' for economic affairs is not the answer.
Germanyâs Chancellor SchrÃ¶der should have known this, for the German 'superminister' for Economic Affairs and Employment, Wolfgang Clement, has not managed to prevent the German economy from still achieving one of Europe's lowest growth rates.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2004) by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Council, concerning the failure to consult the European Parliament in connection with the TEN Quick Start projects.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, the question that has been tabled seeks to avoid any confusion and to prevent any possibility of the current codecision procedure on the development of the trans-European transport networks affecting the list of sections of priority projects indicated by the Commission in its communication to the Council of 11Â November 2003 on the growth initiative.
This identifies sections and projects that have been taken into account as recipients of community funds that are currently available as well as credits from the European Investment Bank.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of which I am giving this speech, looks to the Council to know what importance it should attribute to the afore-mentioned communication.
On JanuaryÂ 27 of this year, the Vice-President of the Commission, MrsÂ de Palacio, clarified in writing to the parliamentary committee to which I belong, that the communication on the Growth Initiative including the list of priority projects is not a legally binding document, nor is it a list of sections intended to receive preferential treatment.
According to the Commission, therefore, what we have is merely an incomplete list of actions within the priority projects that the European Commission and the Member States have pointed out as being sufficiently advanced to allow them to be immediately started, thus stimulating the European economy.
It seems necessary for the Council to confirm the Commission statement today and for it to further explain what it intends to do to ensure that indicating sections of projects proposed by the European Commission in no way makes them a priority before the codecision procedure that is currently underway on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport networks has been concluded.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, that I am representing here, is aware of the benefits of quickly starting programmes which, apart from building the necessary infrastructure to create the single market within the whole of the enlarged Europe, will be able to make a major contribution to the revival of the European economy that everyone hopes to see and which we spoke about a few moments ago.
This is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is working and will continue to work in weeks to come to ensure that the guidelines can be adopted within the current parliamentary term.
To this end, we must look at the European Parliamentâs commitment and the Council needs to undertake to do even more, not just to meet the deadlines that we have set ourselves, but also to show willing to try to reach a genuine agreement because the codecision procedure makes sense, is important and does not give the impression that the decisions have already been taken by the Commission and the Council without Parliament being able to indicate its duties and its prerogatives.
A swift conclusion of the codecision procedure on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European networks would undoubtedly allow the green light to be given to the list of advanced projects.
This list must not be seen as pre-established, but as one that must be redefinedÂ âÂ again, within the framework of the codecision procedureÂ âÂ in line with the afore-mentioned guidelines.
The only way in which we will be able to revive the European economy and physically construct the European single market without inconsistencies is by swiftly concluding the codecision work on trans-European transport networks and only then to subsequently identify advanced projects to which we will commit Union resources, as well as urging Member States to begin programmes.
Â Â  . Mr President, at its meeting of 12 and 13 December 2003, the European Council endorsed the European Action Plan for Growth on the basis of the reports presented by Ecofin, the Commission and the European Investment Bank.
The action is an important step in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda to improve competitiveness, employment and growth potential in the enlarged Union.
Structural reform will be complemented by higher investment in both physical and human capital.
The Council also welcomed the work carried out by the Commission and the EIB â and by the relevant configurations of the Council itself â in the establishment of the Quick Start Programme.
Identification was also made according to a strict set of criteria of a provisional list of projects for immediate action.
The Council also recommended that if other projects fulfil the same criteria the list may be complemented in accordance with the procedures followed for its establishment in the framework of the annual cycle for reporting to the spring European Council.
I would like to confirm to Members that the Commissionâs communication to the Council on 'the European Initiative for Growth â Investing in Knowledge and Networks', as well as reports from the EIB and the different Council formations in this regard, constitute guidelines only.
In order to be taken forward they should be enshrined in a formal legal instrument â in this case, a decision of the Council and the European Parliament.
The Commission communication is a non-exhaustive list of actions within the priority projects which have been identified by the Commission and the Member States.
These projects are considered to be sufficiently mature to commence immediately and thus stimulate the European economy at present.
It is important that the Council and the Parliament pursue their constructive engagement in the current discussions on the revision of the guidelines.
In this respect Council welcomes the letter from President Cox to President Prodi dated November 2003.
The presidency is strongly committed to ensuring that the work on this critically important dossier should be successfully completed by the end of this Parliamentâs term.
It is essential, therefore, that the EUâs institutions work together to bring forward this work.
We recognise that the European Parliament has a particularly important role to play in this process.
Agreement will open the way for crucial investment to be disbursed on key network projects and thus facilitate the pursuit of our fundamental objective of promoting economic growth for the enlarged Union.
The adoption of the draft decision on TENs on the eve of enlargement â by 1 May â would have considerable symbolic importance.
It would also provide a welcome illustration of the EU's commitment to the rapid integration of the economies of the new Member States.
As a final point, may I add that I listened very carefully to Mr Costa's contribution to the debate.
There seemed to be some concern about Parliament's potential to contribute to this area.
This has perhaps not been fully acknowledged.
I would like to assure him and the House that the matter in focus is part of a bigger issue in which the Parliament and its talents will be fully engaged by the Irish presidency.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, that was not sufficient.
I will repeat that for your benefit, Mr President-in-Office: your statement was inadequate.
The Chairman of the Committee asked a specific question as to whether the Council agrees with the description of the âQuick Startâ list as, in essence, a personal list drawn up by the Council, but as not binding upon Parliament.
You have failed to answer that question, and I find that extremely sad.
You embarked on a major statement about why the âQuick Startâ list is necessary, but you did not address the way in which this âQuick Startâ list gives the impression â which your speech, in my view, reinforces â that you want Parliament to be kept out of decisions about which projects are to have priority.
We did try to help you out of your difficulties, making it clear to you that the TEN projectsâ Annex III, the priority projects, is a matter for our joint decision, and that the Council cannot draw up its own special list from among these priority projects, effectively saying that, of the 30 projects, it finds this one and that one and the other one the most attractive, and that it is now deciding to start with those.
You subsequently attempted to defuse the issue by saying that the choice was made on the basis of readiness for work to begin or the availability of funding.
Indeed so: which projects are tackled and when is not a decision for the Council; it must be decided in accordance with the criteria in Annex III as to which projects are ready to be built, which have received planning permission and which are capable of being funded.
So I will again ask you to state unambiguously whether the âQuick Startâ list is binding in law, and if so, on whom; or whether you have attempted to use it to circumvent Parliamentâs and the Councilâs right of joint decision on the priority projects.
For my part, and on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we will not let this pass.
We will not allow the Council to use a so-called âQuick Startâ list as a means of unilaterally disregarding Parliamentâs rights.
Â Â  Mr President, this oral question has at least one thing to be said for it, inasmuch as what was a phantom dossier has now become clearly visible, since the Council has just confirmed that what we have been reading in the press, what we have heard whispers about from the Council, and what, in some cases, certain Commissioners have been saying, does in fact exist.
There really is a Quick Start programme, even though Mrs de Palacio had explained to us that it did not exist.
Thank you, then, President-in-Office of the Council, for confirming this so clearly here today, and I should also like to thank all those Members who put their names to this oral question.
After all, it is a good method to try to begin with those projects which have been around the longest, thereby avoiding a situation in which, as a result of trying to take on too much, we end up by not achieving very much at all.
I therefore welcome the fact that there is, after all, a method for implementing the TEN projects.
What is clear, however, is that the real priority list is this one, the Quick Start list, because that is where our meagre funds will be going, and our funds are very meagre compared with the immensity of the task.
I therefore share Mr Jarzembowskiâs point of view. I believe that it would be inappropriate for the European Parliament not to be informed about and associated with the implementation of this list.
I am not sure whether we should go as far as codecision when it comes to the method for funding and implementing the TEN projects.
What I sure about, however, since it was I, together with a number of other Members, who called for it is that we must have regular information about the implementation of the thirty TEN projects which we shall be voting in favour of.
I hope, therefore, that this sitting will at least have been useful in two ways. On the one hand, it has sought to clarify the procedure so that we can see whether or not we are within the codecision framework â and we shall have to have a very clear answer on that subject â and on the other hand, if we are not involved in a codecision procedure, it has at least made provision for an annual report on the implementation of the TEN projects which we have voted in favour of.
Â Â  Mr President, there has been a lot of talk about involving the European Parliament in drawing up what is termed the Quick Start list.
I do not want to make a further contribution to this discussion, but instead concentrate on something of equal importance in this context, namely the financing and management of the projects.
The Court of Auditors has investigated the management system for the trans-European transport network and is extremely severe in its criticisms.
The conclusion is that control must be improved.
It must be more effective, and there is a need for uniformly consistent application of the TEN rules in all the Member States.
The new Member States already participate in the TEN programme.
I am sincerely in favour of enlargement, and I am sincerely in favour of the Member States participating in all the EU programmes as rapidly as possible, but the new Member States are not always as good at controlling EU funds, and the Commission is not always that good at keeping the new Member States up to the mark.
Unfortunately, the Quick Start projects are an example of this.
In Slovakia, for example, a motorway project designed to link Katowice to Zilina and not in any way complying with our standards was approved.
The project was approved even though there is no justification for it whatsoever in terms of economics or traffic conditions.
Unfortunately, we see far too many examples of projects being approved without proper investigation, without cost/benefit analyses and without account being taken of their environmental consequences.
The TEN programme is a success, but we must not build motorways and bridges if there is no need for them.
We must ensure that the controls are effective and uniform in all the Member States.
If we secure proper control of EU funds, we secure greater legitimacy for the TEN projects.
If the finances are in order, we make it easier to attract private venture capital.
That is something we must, in particular, remember, since public-private partnership looks like being an option in connection with financing future infrastructure projects.
Only once these things are in place will we be well on the way to giving impetus to a great many of the necessary infrastructure projects, and that will take us closer to our common objective of creating a coherent EU.
Let me give an example of a project designated both for EU cofinancing and a public-private partnership.
This is the fixed link between Denmark and Germany across the Fehmarn Belt.
There is quite clearly a need for a bridge across the belt so that we can remove this bottleneck from the north-south axis.
On the Danish side, a lot has constantly been done to ensure that this major project can be carried out.
Unfortunately, it appears that there is rather a lack of political will in Germany.
Once the project has got under way, and it will hopefully not be very long before that happens, the EU will be stronger and, at the same time, the regions on both sides of the Fehmarn Belt will find that employment has been given an economic boost.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there are those who call into question the Constitution that extends Parliamentâs powers to approve legislative procedures by codecision.
This is not a good time, therefore, to overlook Parliamentâs power to approve, in conjunction with the Council, the vital question of the Trans-European transport networks.
I therefore request, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that this crucial issue should be put before Parliament for consideration.
In any event, as a Member of this House, I should like to bring to your attention today high-speed train projects in Galicia, in Portugal, in the North-east of the peninsula and in Aquitaine; in other words, a highly significant stretch of the EUâs Atlantic seaboard.
I refer to the projects linking Oporto, Vigo and El Ferrol; Santiago de Compostela, La CoruÃ±a, Vigo, Orense, Valladolid and Aquitaine; and El Ferrol and Bilbao.
All of these are contained in plans drawn up by the Portuguese and Spanish Governments, in this case the Galicia plan.
We want this project to come to fruition and to be approved in the proper manner by codecision.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a new Eurobarometer poll was conducted a few days ago.
What attracted particular attention was the extremely low level of participation in Juneâs elections to the European Parliament.
In some countries, scarcely more than 20% of the public say they are interested in these elections, and in virtually none of them do over 50%.
There is absolutely no cause for surprise at these figures.
The fact is that the European public hear the same old thing year in and year out, that everything bad comes from Brussels, and the good things are all home-made.
The game here is âpassing the buckâ, and the Council is particularly good at it.
It keeps quiet about the fact that it, as a rule, is part of Brussels, and, when it has the opportunity to play Santa Claus, as it is now, for example, doing with the TENs, the Council likes to be seen dispensing blessings in what is, of course, a solo performance.
Who cares about the fact that the Treaty speaks in terms of codecision in these matters, with Council and Parliament jointly taking decisions on the trans-European transport network?
Their Eminences of the Council want to be the only ones to dole out largesse and to make promises; none of the glory must rub off on anyone else, certainly not on Parliament.
We are not prepared to play along with this charade of disinformation; we are not prepared to do so as a matter of principle, and we are certainly not prepared to do so with 13 June in the offing.
The resolution we have submitted is intended to press that point home.
Most of all, we demand a clear message to the European public, that not only bad things come out of Europe, and that the European Parliament and its members share responsibility for much that the public see as important, and which, it is to be hoped, benefits them in practice.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have a lot of trust in the Council, especially in Mr Roche, and understood his speech to mean that he is in favour of Parliament being fully entitled to take decisions in all the areas to which we have referred.
Judging by what I hear my fellow-MEPs saying, they are less trusting.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council â and this is my first point â to say, here and now, loud and clear, whether he acknowledges Parliamentâs full decision-making rights in all these matters, be they the âQuick Startâ list or any other list.
My second point is that the committee, when it was under Mr Costaâs chairmanship, agreed that this House is not so irresponsible that anyone can, by hook or by crook, add on his or her pet projects; on the contrary, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism added a limited number of projects for which there was a rational justification.
If I may mention just two of them, out of â I think â about six, which enhance Europeâs cohesion and unity, not only in and around the new Member States, but also in and around the future accession countries in the Balkans, we were talking in terms of lines running across Austria from Prague via Linz, and another running from the North via Vienna to Graz and then on to Croatia â in other words, lines that make a great deal of sense.
I really do think that this House has, over the past months, shown itself to be responsible, in that not even in the run-up to an election does it add on one project after another indiscriminately.
Parliamentâs right to share in decisions must, however, be guaranteed in full.
It would be a good thing if the President-in-Officeâs ambivalent answer today could become a clear and unequivocal statement to the effect that the Council does indeed acknowledge Parliamentâs power of codecision, because this House demonstrates a high degree of responsibility and comes up with a few extra ideas for these important investment projects.
After all, the Council and its Presidency ought to have an interest in getting a few more good ideas, and you will get them from this Houseâs Committee on Transport.
Â Â  Mr President, I certainly agree with promoting a European growth initiative.
Nonetheless, I cannot accept the restrictive interpretation of the so-called QuickÂ StartÂ List.
A list of priority projects already exists.
These were endorsed at the Essen and Dublin EuropeanÂ Councils, and the Commission has proposed a second enlargement.
I believe all these priority projects should have an equal chance of access to Community aid.
The challenge ought to be getting the projects under way at the earliest opportunity, not cutting the number of projects.
In my view, one option could be setting up some sort of a bonus system involving an extra payment for projects or parts of projects certified as having been completed over the next three years.
That would be far more effective than an cut of the list of projects on the basis of the likelihood of their being launched or completed.
Certain sections of high-speed railway line could be largely completed between now and 2006.
The Vitoria-Dax line is one of these, yet it does not appear on the QuickÂ StartÂ List.
I am also of the opinion that the so-called maritime highways should be deemed cross-border projects on condition that they link ports in two MemberÂ States.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is with great amazement that I see that, in a debate as important as this one, the Commission is conspicuous by its absence.
In addition to what has been said by other Members, I would like to reiterate that Commissioner de Palacioâs handling of this dossier has not been particularly democratic.
On two occasions, she has attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of this House; on one, she wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Committee to tell him who the rapporteur for this dossier had to be, and she has, secondly, insisted to the groups that the procedure should be a simple one and not a full one including codecision.
It is my belief that we have to endure a full codecision procedure and fight in this House for what we want, as we have a responsibility to the public, whose taxes pay for these investment projects.
Â Â  â Mr President, speaking personally, I wish to repudiate the attacks made on Mrs de Palacio.
Not in any way did she attempt to exert negative influence on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism; on the contrary, she offered help in bringing the trans-European networks dossier to a conclusion, and that was very valuable.
What I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, though, is whether he has nothing to say to us.
Are our questions so unimportant that he is unwilling to give us an answer?
Â Â  . Mr President, I had not intended to respond to the debate.
My comments at the outset were, I think, comprehensive, particularly the additional comments I made at the end.
Â Â  This statement by the Council has been noted.
To conclude this debate, I have received one motion for a resolution.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to emphasise the need to give a determined boost to the priority TEN projects. They are vital for the economic development of the EuropeanÂ Union.
Regrettably, certain MemberÂ States have failed to support projects essential for the Union.
This is the case of the project to build a high-speed and high capacity goods railway link through the central Pyrenees.
The project was supported by Parliamentâs Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but not by the FrenchÂ Government.
MemberÂ States should be aware of the need to implement such projects urgently, in order to prevent the anticipated collapse of goods transport systems within the Union.
Parliamentâs warning call should be heeded.
The EuropeanÂ Union must facilitate the work of the MemberÂ States and continue to support its implementation.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B5-0063/2004) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to the Council, concerning the Olympic truce.
Â Â  âMr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are so many conflicts and trouble spots in the world at present â let us appeal to common sense and act instead to preserve life.
This is the aim of the Olympic truce, an ancient and noble tradition dating back 3Â 000 years and which the International Olympic Committee has been trying to revive for the past decade.
At a time of conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, the Pacific and the neighbouring regions, we need to send out a strong message supporting the truce and calling for dialogue and reconciliation both during and after the Olympic Games.
In November 2003, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution to build a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal.
Thousands of public figures from all over the world and from many different fields â politics and art to name but a few â went on to sign the Olympic truce.
This is the European Year of Education through Sport, and in this context we can, and should, convey the fact that sport has a key role to play in the process.
We should use the widespread publicity that the Olympic Games and the European Year of Education through Sport are receiving to convey a message of peace, to discuss conflict resolution and to emphasise the invaluable role played by sport in society.
Finally, too, we should ask ourselves why the security measures for the Olympic Games and many other international sporting events are becoming stricter and stricter.
In Athens, 50Â 000 people will be deployed to protect visitors to the Games and the 10Â 500 athletes taking part from 201 nations â an operation costing EURÂ 650 million.
How can this be called a cultural and peaceful event when it has to be guarded around the clock?
What message are we sending out here?
This is why we are appealing to EU Member States and international institutions and calling for common sense and understanding and also why we, in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, are putting this oral question to the Council.
We want the EU and its Member States to shoulder this responsibility and take advantage of the common sense prevailing during, and hopefully after, the Olympic Games.
It is my hope that the European Year of Education through Sport precedes a broader discussion in which we will think about how to resolve conflicts more peacefully while putting our weapons to one side and allowing the weapons of peace, represented by the Olympic ideal, to reign supreme.
Â Â  . Mr President, I particularly want to thank Mrs Prets for the question.
The European Council of December 2003 expressed its support for the idea of an Olympic truce and welcomed the relevant resolution which was agreed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly.
It is in fact no coincidence that 2004 is both the year of the Olympics and the European Year of Education through Sport.
The Council recalls to the Parliament that the educational values of sport were already acknowledged by the Nice European Council in December 2000, thus confirming previous declarations, particularly Declaration 29 attached to the Amsterdam Treaty.
This defines sport as something which forges the identity of people.
The Council's resolution of 17 December 1999 also presented sporting activities as having a pedagogical value which contributes to the strengthening of civil society.
One of the aims of the European Year of Education through Sport, as set out in the European Parliament and Council decision of February 2003, is to take advantage of the values conveyed through sport to develop knowledge and skill, particularly amongst young people.
Sport allows young people in particular not only to develop physical prowess and readiness for physical effort, but also provides social skills such as team work, solidarity, tolerance and, of course, fair play.
The Council confirms its commitment to these aims and values, as, I am sure, does the Parliament.
I should point out that it does not come within the Council's competence to undertake the specific actions proposed by the honourable Member.
However, at its meeting of 29 January 2004 to launch the European Year of Education through Sport, the troika of education and sports ministers stressed the importance of the Olympic truce.
The ministers supported the truce for its message of peace, tolerance and friendship; its unique place in the lives of citizens and its positive role in the promotion of friendship and the breaking down of social and cultural barriers.
The troika ministers also strongly recommended that joint actions bring together the goals of the European Year of Education through Sport and those of the Olympic truce during 2004.
On a personal level, on behalf of the presidency, like to wish the Greek nation, and all the athletes who go to Greece to compete, peaceful and successful Olympic Games.
I hope that these Games, as Mrs Prets has said, take place in an atmosphere of tolerance and peace.
Â Â  Mr President, sport is not just about performance, competitions and elite sportspeople; it is also about developing a sense of community and a common purpose; it is about humanity itself.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are not my words.
They are the words of the United Nations Organisation, the UN.
I fully support them, however, and I also fully support the idea that this Parliament should back the Olympic truce.
What does seem to me to be important is that sport should not be politicised.
As far as possible, sport must be kept outside of politics and must serve as a tool for constructing, never for destroying.
Sport must be a tool for promoting peace and understanding.
With regard to the Olympic truce, we are not talking about anything new.
There have been Olympic truces every two years, for the summer games and for the winter games, for many years, and at the end of last year the United Nations adopted a resolution urging its Member States to observe the Olympic truce.
I am in favour of it, as is the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We do, however, want it to be a contribution from the world of sport to the rest of the world.
We do not want any political party to try to gain electoral advantage or to try to politicise this issue.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the real world there are conflicts and wars.
In the world of sport there are games and competitions.
In the real world there are armed forces.
In the world of sport there are teams.
In the real world there are laws.
In the world of sport we swap them for rules of play.
In the real world there are neutral parties.
In the world of sport we have referees.
And in the real world, regrettably, there are many deaths, and we want to help to preserve life by means of the world of sport, and this must be the world of sportâs contribution to society.
Â Â  Mr President, in an effort to end the clashes which were plaguing the Peloponnese, the Delphi Oracle advised the warring sides in 776 B.C. to organise games, putting their differences to one side, so that athletes and citizens from all over Greece could take part in the games in safety.
Thus the ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic truce was born and has lasted for over 1000 years.
Greece promoted the revival of this tradition with the support of the UN, the European Council, UNESCO and the International Olympic Committee.
In the run up to the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004, the International Olympic Truce Centre was set up and undertook to conduct a major campaign.
Over 400 famous people in the world have signed the text of the Olympic truce.
The Olympic Games, which return this year to the country in which they were born and to Europe, are a global reference point and, together with the message which emerges from the sporting performances, can send the message of the culture of peace.
Peace and dialogue are two objectives which the European Parliament has always supported.
They are values which we continue to hold at the centre of our efforts for as long and with as much effort as are needed to achieve them.
Each of us, as members of the European Parliament, are called on to act as ambassadors of the good will of the Olympic truce, promoting the message and the culture of peace in all meetings, missions, parliamentary committees and international fora in all the corners of the planet which we frequently visit.
We expect the support and encouragement of the Council and the Irish Presidency in this effort.
The main message of the Olympic truce is: if we manage to have peace for 16 days, perhaps we can manage to have it forever.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0062/2004) by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2005 budget: guidelines for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII(A) and VIII(B) and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I).
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present the guidelines for other sections and the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2005.
My intention is that the guidelines should deal with the essentials and be kept very concise.
Details and the consideration of specific measures will be left for the motion on the estimates.
Please allow me now to touch briefly on some aspects of this yearâs guidelines.
The exceptional feature of the budget year 2005 is that it will be the first full budgetary year for the European Union of 25 Member States, the first full year of activity for the newly-elected European Parliament, the newly-appointed Commission, and the first full year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations.
Technical adjustment will reduce the ceiling of the financial perspectives of heading 5 for 2005 by EURÂ 94 million at current prices.
On the basis of these budgetary constraints for 2005, new entities such as the European School of Administration may have to be delayed unless savings are made by launching such bodies.
The amount of staff in most of the institutions has been increasing rapidly to cater for the needs of the enlargement.
The main bulk of these additional needs related to the enlargement are covered in the 2002-2004 budgets, even if a number of measures remain to be taken.
In view of the delays in recruitment procedures, a thorough assessment will be made of the situation in view of the 2005 budget.
We are assuming that the financial impact of expanding the institutions' premises will occur mainly after 2005.
A key question for the 2005 budgetary procedure will continue to be the administrative reforms of the institutions.
That brings me to Parliament (Section I), where several uncertainties relating to the drawing up of Parliament's budget for 2005 need to be considered, such as the current lack of agreement on a Membersâ Statute, the actual outcome of the enlargement-related recruitments in 2004, and developments of several building projects.
At this stage, therefore, we reserve our position regarding the limit of 20% of the expenditure under heading 5.
It is regrettable that the Member States have not yet been able to agree on a Membersâ Statute and it is hoped that progress will be made on this during the course of 2004.
The same also applies to the Statute for Membersâ assistants.
As far as the financing of the European Political Parties is concerned, I think we agree that this expenditure should in principle remain outside Parliamentâs self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 as it is not an administrative expenditure of the institution but an operational one.
However, I am ready to compromise on this particular point and accept the text of Mrs Buitenwegâs Amendment No 8, which leaves open the option of including this expenditure within the 20% ceiling.
In view of the delays in recruitment procedures for staff from the new Member States and difficulties encountered in recruiting especially linguistic staff from certain new Member States, we consider that a decision on making appropriations available for additional enlargement-related staff can only be taken at the first reading of the 2005 budget.
A mid-term plan for building projects is necessary in order to define the level of Parliament's budget in 2005 in view of possible capital injections needed to pursue the property policy.
As regards the functioning of the car service, we need to re-evaluate it to see if it provides a satisfactory service to Members while guaranteeing value for money.
Moving on to Council (Section II), the Council is asked to consider presenting its estimates with the Preliminary Draft Budget instead of its first reading to increase transparency.
Parliament will also continue to monitor the Council operational budget, while respecting the Gentlemen's Agreement as regards the administrative expenditure.
As for the Court of Justice (Section IV), here we note that this institution has, in the last couple of years, experienced higher growth rates in staff than most other institutions.
With regard to the Court of Auditors (Section V), we mention that the Court of Auditors has distributed its enlargement-related staff increase over the 2004 and 2005 budgets.
Finally, as regards the Economic and Social Committee (Section VI) and the Committee of the Regions (Section VII), we ask both committees to pursue budgetary rigour in their estimates, especially in staff requests and building projects, and to improve the cooperation as regards the joint services to fully benefit from the new joint premises.
We expect that the move to the Belliard building and the vacation of the current buildings will take place as foreseen.
A few points did not make it through the vote in the Committee on Budgets.
We present again to the House only the most important of these, on which I would ask for your support.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who is known for his rigour, as those of us who have worked with him in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgets are well aware, particularly when negotiating the issue of European Agencies over a long period of time.
At the moment the usual advocates of budgetary rigour and saving are more necessary and more realistic than ever, because now there is a reduction in the ceiling for heading 5 and I would find it difficult to name any rapporteur who was more notorious than Mr Kuckelkorn for their rigour to carry out these cuts.
Furthermore, I am genuinely curious to see the report of the General Secretaries of the institutions on the estimates of the administrative needs for 2005.
I believe it is going to be a very fortunate and beneficial year for everybody since the Secretaries of the various institutions are going to have to reconcile enlargement and its administrative requirements with the restriction we are going to be faced with next year of the reduction of EUR 140 million in heading 5.
By the way, this rigour which is being asked of the other institutions must also be applied to the Commission and to the European Parliament itself.
Our group, Mr Kuckelkorn, believes it is perfectly possible to remain next year within the 20% limit for the European Parliamentâs budget, particularly after the Council, as a result of the opposition, above all, of the German Government, has blocked the reform of the Membersâ Statute.
Our group has presented and defended amendments in the Committee on Budgets in particular on the issue of multilingualism and its implementation.
We tried this in the 2004 budget and we would be very happy to find now that we have an interlocutor open to dialogue on the possible initiatives our group is presenting.
At the moment the report, voted on in the Committee on Budgets, supports it.
We entirely agree with the rest of the measures in MrÂ Kuckelkornâs report and we are finally left with the issue of the funding of the political parties.
My group would have liked â and we were one vote away from achieving it in the Committee on Budgets â that committee to express its support for including this funding of European political parties within Parliamentâs limit of 20%.
What we did not want with this amendment we are presenting was to have to negotiate the funding of the political parties year after year, which would be the case if we were funding outside the limit of 20%.
Funding them within the 20% limit would prevent this situation and would ensure a quick negotiation by means of a transfer.
We should remember that the code of conduct necessary for this transfer to political parties is due to be finalised very soon.
Nevertheless, because of the opposition of other political groups, and particularly yours, Mr Kuckelkorn, this has not been possible and therefore the compromise solution proposed in the amendment of the Greens/ALE Group seems to us to be acceptable as the only way to avoid jeopardising this transfer, which must be carried out in 2004, in this budgetary year.
Furthermore, with this compromise, with this amendment from the Greens, we would prevent the budgetary restriction of heading 5 from jeopardising the functioning of the political parties during next September, as they themselves warn, which may be faced with serious operating problems of an administrative nature if this transfer does not take place.
I am pleased that Mr Kuckelkorn is prepared to take this compromise into account â to vote for this amendment â and, if this is the case, Mr President, I believe that the rest of the vote on the report by Mr Kuckelkorn will be practically unanimous because, on the rest of the major issues, we fully share his thinking.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Kuckelkorn, for an excellent report.
Next yearâs budget is very rigorous in terms of the administrative budget, as the rapporteur stated.
The fact that this year we shall have ten new Member States and the same number of new official languages makes it all the more rigorous.
The issue of Parliamentâs multilingualism is an enormous challenge.
It calls for a new kind of flexibility in the areas of translation and interpreting.
Nowhere else in the world is there a body that functions so multilingually as the EU institutions.
This nevertheless requires special action and care; otherwise, the multicultural principle could become chaos.
That is why the administration should make a special effort to ensure that the posts are filled and the translation work flows smoothly right from the moment of accession.
In the new environment there will be an increase in retour interpreting.
This could lead to a situation where all of Parliament is dependent on one interpreter who is translating from a less common official language into a more common one.
To ensure the quality of translation work it will be necessary to translate from more than one interpretation booth.
This in practice means making special demands on the âbiggerâ language groups, such as English, French and German, making it necessary for them to be able to translate from more source languages than the other interpreter groups.
A major political issue in recent years has been the adoption of the Membersâ Statute.
It was hugely disappointing that it should have become the subject of internal disagreements in the Council.
The European Parliament, and its current President, Patrick Cox, in particular, had worked very hard dealing with this matter, and, consequently, it was too bad that it was torpedoed.
It is important that the Membersâ Statute is adopted speedily, so that it could come into effect preferably by the start of the next parliamentary term.
This yearâs budget at long last saw the implementation of activity-based budgeting as far as the Commission is concerned.
It allows us to see directly how much each activity costs.
The same activity-based budgeting approach should also gradually be applied to the administrative budget, to the European Parliament, for example.
This way we would also be in a better position to monitor developments in administrative costs and expenditure in different administrative branches.
I would like to wish the rapporteur every success in his work.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Kuckelkornâs report is a preliminary expression of opinion mainly on Parliamentâs budgetary procedure for 2005.
It is unfortunate that the Council could not adopt the new Membersâ Statute.
When the European Parliament itself voted in favour of reviewing its own salary and travel expenses system, it was a big step in the right direction.
It is not morally right to try to cheat on travel expenses, even if it is not actually against the rules of Parliament to travel tourist class for the price of a business class ticket.
As Members themselves were prepared to entirely give up this unjustifiable source of income for the sake of the airlines, it was unfortunate that the Council did not take up the offer.
Germany, France, Austria and Sweden are now to blame for the justified criticism that the public make of the flaws in the pay and expenses system used in respect of Members of the European Parliament.
A problem has also arisen with the Council concerning another matter.
The Council wants pan-European political party support for the European Parliamentâs budget, whilst Parliament would like it for the Commissionâs budget.
If there is Europarty support for the budget it cannot be allowed to impact on Parliamentâs maximum total for administrative expenditure, resulting in forced cuts in other areas.
Then there are also those of us who do not want Europarty support and who will vote against its introduction in this yearâs draft supplementary budget.
Then there is still a good number of Members of the European Parliament who have referred the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a decision.
We are starting to pay for party support for the wrong reasons.
Europarty support blurs democracy.
The national parties of the âbigâ countries can use it to dominate European party decision-making far more easily.
The representatives of the âsmallerâ countries would have a double problem, as they would have to make themselves heard in a Europarty dominated by the âlargeâ nations before gaining a hearing in a European Parliament elected on the basis of Member Statesâ populations.
We must ensure that Parliament retains multilingualism and that personnel selection considers nationals from all countries.
There must also be recruitment from countries other than the new Member States.
Some Member States are under-represented on the parliamentary staff because Parliament has not properly organised staff recruitment competitions.
Parliament must aim to keep increases in expenditure under tight control.
Â Â  â Mr President, this budget for the first calendar year with 25 Member States in the European Union really will be a test of strength.
After all, the Commission's administrative reform has only just recently got up to speed.
The Commission will need to make every effort to achieve sound financial management, a well-functioning information system and fully reliable accounts.
The rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, is right to refer to the possibility of saving costs by inter-institutional cooperation.
Considerable savings could be made if this Parliament were no longer forced to meet in Strasbourg, but this appears legally impossible without cooperation from France.
That is why I would suggest to the Bureau that the Council, or the French Republic, should be presented with the bill for the dual location, which amounts to over EUR 200 million per annum.
Our group emphasises the huge importance of multilingualism in this House.
Parliament should not enhance, but rather undo, the publicâs image of it as an elite club.
Every citizen must be able to follow all public meetings in their own language.
Democracy in diversity is the core task of this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, the procedure of voting without debate, applied to the Haug report on the Communitiesâ own resources, deprives us of a joint discussion, using this report, on the budget guidelines for 2005.
The fact remains that the Haug report and the Kuckelkorn report have one thing in common which deserves attention and which also deserves a much wider debate than we are allowed here.
Both of them start by calling for sound management and rigour.
Later, however, in the report we are concerned with here, we read that, for its own budget, Parliament reserves its position on the 20% increase limit which it imposed upon itself for administrative expenditure.
We also read, in the explanatory statement to the Haug report â and I quote â ânew own resources should be introduced that do not take the form of contributions of the Member States and do not, taken as a whole, increase the tax burden on ordinary citizensâ.
The situation is clear then: the majority of Parliament wants to increase the Unionâs budget, in particular in order to fund enlargement. The European tax is something that is on everyoneâs mind, though in a form that is disguised to a greater or lesser extent.
There is nothing surprising in that; promises have to be funded and resources are not inexhaustible.
I look to the rapporteurs and the Commission to explain how it is possible to increase the European budget without increasing the tax burden on taxpayers except by reducing the national budgets.
If the majority accepts this principle of âcommunicating vesselsâ, governments and finance ministers will have to make it clear to the public which policies and measures funded from the national budget will bear the cost, in a context which is already one of rigour, and of which the Commission claims to be the guardian, inasmuch as it takes action against those States which do not comply with the stability pact.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0081/2004) by Mr GrÃ¶ner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council â Follow-up to the White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth â Proposed common objectives for the participation and information of young people, in response to the Council Resolution of 27 June 2002 regarding the framework of European cooperation in the youth field.
Â Â  Mr President, we have indeed got through the agenda rather faster than usual, but youth has, I think, caught up with us.
Our future lies in young people and one can see how much a society values them by how many possibilities it offers them and how closely it involves them in plans for the future.
A dynamic society must offer its new generation prospects and security, both in terms of material things and social acceptance and in terms of a sense of cohesion.
I am glad to see that the Commissioner, too, took a different estimate of the time.
The White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth saw the light of day in November 2001 after much consultation with all concerned and two long years in which to mature; we do now need to think about how we can keep it alive.
I think that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are all on the right path here.
We need to integrate the 75Â million young people between 15 and 25 in a European Union that will soon include 25 Member States, by bringing young people and youth organisations into the political arena.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and through my work in connection with this White Paper, I have followed the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of years and listened closely to what young Europeans have had to tell us.
My conclusion is that young people want to be taken seriously, and we should not disappoint them by failing to do this.
We have succeeded in boosting youth policy among young people, youth organisations, non-governmental organisations, political representatives in the EU and the Member States.
If we see the White Paper as being about open coordination and mainstreaming, then the Commissionâs communication on the follow-up is more about participation and information.
Young people must be integrated more, and at an earlier stage, so that they can participate in representative democracy at the regional, national and European level.
We particularly need to show our interest in integrating young people now as we approach the European elections, but unfortunately we are discussing this important matter at a late hour in a House that is almost empty.
Young people communicate on the Internet and the Commission has therefore opened a youth portal but this falls far short of what is needed, which is information that is local and has been specifically developed for them.
They need to experience equal opportunities and non-discrimination, for example in youth councils made up of equal numbers of young men and young women.
Where no such councils exist, we need to set them up.
Formal and informal education have to be networked with youth work to a greater degree.
Youth programmes are already allowing hundreds of thousands of young people to meet and these, together with the thousands of voluntary work projects, lead towards social skills and a European outlook.
If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world, we must make every effort to ensure that no young people are excluded.
Those who are considered to be disadvantaged â female immigrants, girls, and young men â and on the fringes of the European Union and of society, are the ones whom we most need to integrate.
Regional cooperation, culture and sport all serve as a bridge to help overcome prejudices and solve the problems of tomorrow.
In November 2003, the Council stipulated some common objectives.
The first evaluation of the new action linesâ implementation will be carried out at the end of 2005 and the Commission will then draw up a progress report on the basis of the reports submitted by Member States.
The first European Youth Week took place last year and was widely supported.
Under the motto âovercoming exclusionâ we are now starting to work on the âYouthâ action programme and in other new areas and are trying to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient financial resources both to meet the growing demands of globalisation and to create spaces in which young people can concern themselves with future European policy.
With the broad synergy that we have achieved between the Commission, Parliament, the political groups and even Member States, we should succeed not only in speaking to young people but also in integrating them.
It is our goal to keep the momentum going, to support young people and strengthen youth policy in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 February, the European Parliamentâs Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport unanimously adopted the own initiative report submitted by Mrs GrÃ¶ner.
That committee was right to adopt the report unanimously, because it is an excellent piece of work.
It is the work of someone who knows young people, who likes young people, and who would like young people to be much more involved than they are at present in this Europe which we are in the process of constructing.
We laid the foundations for this Europe, which we are in the process of constructing for and with young people, with the famous White Paper, which proposed common objectives for two priority areas, namely the participation and information of young people.
Moreover, it was young people themselves who identified these two priority areas as the key elements in any future policy to be pursued both at European Union level and at Member State and regional level.
I welcome Parliamentâs support for the proposals aimed at ensuring that the participation of young people at all levels of democratic life and at developing accessible, appropriate quality information become a reality.
These proposals, as Mrs GrÃ¶ner has said, form part of a broader approach which is aimed at developing projects which are specific to youth policies and at the same time improving the extent to which the interests of young people are taken into account in the context of other policies.
With this in mind, we are preparing proposals for action lines concerning voluntary activities which, as you have quite rightly said, are one of the preferred ways in which young people can become involved and assume their responsibilities as citizens.
Personally, I believe that the creation of a real European voluntary service, with a critical mass and therefore with visibility, will give new impetus to our youth policies.
In order to get there, however, we will also need new funding, because young people are not rich.
We have to help them to put their idealism into practice.
In this sense, the new financial perspectives are the ideal framework in which to find an answer to our questions.
Moreover, I have also suggested guidelines for a future âyouthâ programme funded in such a way as to ensure that it can reach the critical size.
This political communication which I am currently preparing is due to be submitted to the European Parliament before the elections, if all goes according to plan.
I believe, Mr President, that the parliamentary initiatives which have been launched for and with young people provide an excellent response to what we frequently hear at grass-roots level, where the refrain is constantly repeated that Europe does not pay enough attention to youth policy.
Well, I would like to see lots of young people, and lots of those who are responsible for policies with young people as their main theme, read the own-initiative report by Mrs GrÃ¶ner and the European Parliament, so that they can see for themselves that that is not true.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would firstly like to say, on behalf of the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Zissener, that our group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is in favour of this report provided that the principle of subsidiarity is respected.
I believe that participation and information for young people is an issue of the utmost importance and I have always said, since I joined this Parliament, that it is the young who are important, not those of us who are not so young, because they are the future of Europe and it is in them that we must invest and apply all our efforts.
I have a lot of contact with young people and I truly believe that they are much more receptive than adults or the elderly.
We must take advantage of this situation.
According to the new poll by the Eurobarometer for the coming European Parliament elections, an average of just 30% of the population is expected to vote.
This seems to me a ridiculously low figure and we must make a great effort to increase it.
It is not enough for all of us to sit here saying how very worried we are; we must really prove this through action.
It is furthermore clear that we are doing something wrong.
I will tell you an anecdote, ladies and gentlemen, concerning a situation in which I was involved right here this very afternoon.
You are all perfectly aware that 2004 is the European year of education through sport and, although it is directed at all European citizens, it is in particular directed at young people.
Nevertheless, this afternoon I went to see a visiting group of young Spanish students from the south of Spain, from Andalusia, from my region, and in the brief chat I had with them I asked them whether any of them could tell me what European year 2004 was.
Not one of them â not one of the 30 young people in the room â could answer me.
When I told them, they were rather surprised because they all realised it was something directed particularly at them.
This is a sign that perhaps we are doing something wrong and we must correct it as soon as possible.
To do so we need greater cooperation between youth organisations and public authorities.
We must work hard to achieve this and I believe that the report by MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner is an initial step towards providing more information for young Europeans.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of young peopleâs involvement in society cannot be overemphasised.
In the future young people will have greater responsibility as the age structure of Europeâs population alters and the proportion of young people diminishes.
The Commissionâs communication on objectives relating to the participation of the young and providing them with information is an important step forward in the strengthening of cooperation at EU level in youth policy.
It is gratifying that the draft Constitution also recognises the importance of involving young people.
Our rapporteur, Lissy GrÃ¶ner, who with very good reason personifies Parliamentâs youth policy, has once again done an excellent job.
I, for my part, also want to thank the Commission for the work it has done for young people.
The large-scale consultation process that preceded the White Paper relating to youth policy was a considerable effort that eventually inspired youth organisations to work at EU level.
Now we have to ensure that support for the involvement of these organisations continues and that the results of their work are also visible in the Communityâs youth policy.
I am pleased that there was general agreement with my proposal to increase appropriations to youth organisations in this yearâs budget, and the multiannual action programme to finance youth organisations now being finalised is also welcome as it at last guarantees a legal basis for them.
The rapporteurâs call for young people being encouraged to take part in the first European elections of the enlarged EU is of primary importance.
To make young people more active with regard to voting, alternative ways of casting oneâs vote still being developed should now be exploited.
The young are avid Internet users and voting this way could draw more young people to the ballot box.
Although the procedure has many shortcomings in terms of election secrecy and freedom, it should not be totally ruled out.
At least young people might become more pro-active in their voting habits if electronic ballot boxes introduced in a few Member States were located in places which are popular with the young.
Enlargement will highlight the importance of pluralism in the European Union and, likewise, that of intercultural learning.
The future youth programme will make it easier for young people to come into contact with one another and therefore help overcome prejudice.
I wish in this connection to stress that intercultural learning should not just mean investment in cross-border cooperation between Member States.
The Member States of the EU, both the current and the future ones, must provide opportunities for building contacts between young people from the predominant population and those from national minorities.
Europe cannot afford to let nationalism and xenophobia grow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to stress the importance of the renewed attention being paid in this parliamentary term to the 75Â million people aged between 15 and 25, who from 1Â May, will be part of the enlarged Europe.
If we extend the parameters to include those aged 30, this figure will clearly be even higher.
Indeed, in Italy and in other countries of the European Union this is the only age group that actually enters the labour market on a permanent basis.
One basic view is that young adults are no different to adults, but they are adults in a different way.
They therefore have rights and duties, some of which are different to those pertaining to other citizens and some are similar.
On the basis of exhaustive and extensive research, the GrÃ¶ner report proposes a commitment that is also a challenge: to increase the participation and information of young people in politics.
The information that we must manage and provide for them must be clear and specific.
Achieving the participation that we are hoping for will not be easy, but learning to participate and learning to provide information is the best approach to developing the awareness of active citizenship that not all adults are putting into practice.
If we agree that those who do not have a past do not have a future, then the only choice we have is to pass on the founding values of our past to young people, who are our future.
In this way, these updated and revised values will be the seeds for tomorrowâs growth.
We are totally in favour of the European Youth Week because it also symbolises the priority commitment that is being given to a new drive for European youth that can count on several assets, such as intercultural learning, environmental protection, sport and art, to give just a few examples.
We are redoubling our efforts as adults on social exclusion and xenophobia because it is not words but practical deeds and actions that have the greatest educational impact.
Thus, working on young people and for young people also becomes a way to work on ourselves and we should thank young people for this opportunity.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to join with other speakers in congratulating the rapporteur on her work.
As per the title of the Commission's White Paper on the topic, youth policy can certainly be given a new impetus.
I am pleased that the Irish presidency has also taken up the challenge contained in the White Paper and that youth issues form an important element of the presidency priorities.
Indeed, Ireland will shortly host a major conference involving youth ministers and young people themselves, and which will have as its main theme 'young people in politics'.
Colleagues are all aware that in a few short months the citizens of Europe will have an opportunity to cast their votes in the elections for the European Parliament.
Recent surveys of public opinion and interest in the elections are, I have to say, disturbing, particularly the low numbers of young people who say they intend to vote.
After the ten new countries join, the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 25 will rise to 75 million.
Many of these young people will be able to express their political will as first-time voters in the European elections.
The rapporteur identifies participation and information as key areas for development in the context of EU youth policy.
These are both key in the European elections, and we as public representatives have a vital role to play in informing young people about Europe and what it is doing for them, and encouraging them to make their voice heard.
In each of our Member States we need to take a hard look at ways of improving the active participation of young people in political life.
This goes beyond voting in elections, and includes membership of political parties, political movements and various non-governmental organisations.
We must strive to convince our young people that they can make a difference and that they can bring change to our society.
A failure on our part to do so will lead to levels of apathy which will gradually erode all our democracies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is the longest speech I have made as a MEP.
I have never had three minutesâ speaking time, and now IÂ âÂ the representative of the Italian Pensionersâ PartyÂ âÂ have been given this length of time to speak on a report that concerns young people.
I support and agree with the report on the participation and information of young people.
A short while ago, however, when I was listening to my fellow Members speaking about the reports on the budget and other subjectsÂ âÂ I do apologiseÂ âÂ but I nodded off.
In my state of drowsiness two questions popped into my head: Are young people really different to the elderly?
Are the elderly really different to young people?
It is said that young people want love, but old people also want and need love.
Young people want to have money, but old people also want to have and need to have money.
Young people want to travel and dance, but old people also want to travel and dance.
No, there must be some difference!
In 45 years of working for the elderly, I have heard them say many timesÂ âÂ and I regret thisÂ âÂ that growing old is terrible.
As a result, I am sure that the European Parliament has not just thought about young people but also about elderly people and has prepared several different reports and communications for them.
I will have to listen to them all in the final months of this parliamentary term because I am sorry to say that, to date, very few have been presented.
I have also been thinking about other matters.
Is it right to get young people more involved in political life and in the decisions that affect them?
Is it right that young people are the best placed to draw up regulations and laws that concern them?
Are women the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems?
Are old people the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems?
I do not think so, MrÂ President.
The answer that I came up with will surprise you.
I agree that young people must take decisions and have power over everyone and over everyoneâs lives.
How else could I justify the fact my daughter Elisabetta Fatuzzo, at 32 years old, is at this very moment preparing to give a speech on Lombardy television, on the subject of pensioners and the elderly?
This would not be possible if we thought that old people were better at talking about old people than young people are, and vice versa.
I therefore call on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that Europe continues to help young people and draw them closer to Europe so that they are also in a position where they have more say in matters concerning men and women of all ages.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0080/2004) by Mr GraÃ§a Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the role of schools and learning at school in giving the greatest number of people access to culture.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, access to culture is a for the all-round development of any human being.
It is, additionally, an essential requirement of any Western European-style representative democracy, a factor in eliminating inequality and an increasingly important factor for progress and development.
Culture must, therefore, constitute one of the most solid platforms supporting a Europe of the citizens.
It is no longer possible, as Jean Monnet would have wished, to make culture the starting point, which could be a contentious notion at a time when we are concerned primarily with the priorities of economic intervention.
We must instead pick up the baton of culture and meet the challenges set by European integration by celebrating the variety of cultures and the cultural dimension of Europe.
We live in a globalised society, in an enlarged Europe, in a time of various crises, faced with the new, streamlined and stimulating presence of the national identities and traditional cultures of almost 400Â million citizens.
In this context, politicians must give serious attention to issues of access to culture and of constructing a European worldview, an image capable of incorporating differences into its procedures, whilst ensuring that these differences are respected and valued, in a pluralistic, tolerant and dynamic way.

We therefore call on the Members of this House to rethink and revive the role of the school in access to culture, not only in terms of the basic skills that schools can teach and of the key components in each national identity that each Member State feels should be a part of its programmes, but also in terms of Europeâs enormous cultural heritage, in its almost infinite variety of language, literature, fine art, music, theatre, tradition; in other words, everything that provides each of us with our essential mechanisms for relating to and identifying with the world.
Schools cannot, of course, be encyclopaedias, nor should they conform to stereotypical international standards, or merely churn out hackneyed clichÃ©s.
They must offer citizens a major opportunity for access to culture and must inculcate, in everyone who attends school, from the earliest ages onwards, respect, enthusiasm and a taste for cultural expression that can help citizens to reflect on what it means to be part of Europeâs rich panoply of civilisation and culture.
The steps that can be taken towards this end are many and varied and, as far as we are concerned, must begin with specific elements of school life.
This report, in which many suggestions from members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport of every political hue were taken on board, has this very aim: to express the desire, on behalf of Parliament, that we should meet this challenge, because if we do not, European integration will make little sense and will not be worthy of the name.
If citizens are armed with a knowledge of European culture, it will surely be impossible for them to remain indifferent towards the values that characterise it.
It would be a contradiction in terms to comply with the Lisbon Strategy and at the same to pursue the aims of a knowledge-based economy, if culture were limited to the status of poor relative in this area.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and above all its rapporteur, Mr Vasco GraÃ§a Moura, for a clear-sighted report which stresses the interface between schools and culture.
I should like to broaden the scope of the discussion so as to include, as well as schools in the strict sense of the word, the school of life which is the family.
That is where it all starts, and later it continues at school.
I am very happy to see, Mr President, that as always Parliament not only supports what the Commission is doing but also adds to the new ideas being developed by the Commission, thereby helping it to forge ahead.
You are right in saying that we cannot build Europe solely on the basis of the economy and finance.
Europe is constructed on the basis of men and women, and therefore of cultures.
I agree with you in recognising that education systems ought to guarantee that, by the time they complete their secondary education, students possess the knowledge and skills which are necessary for them to prepare to assume their roles as citizens in Europe.
I say âought toâ because the reality is somewhat different, as we are all well aware.
Even though students sometimes learn about their own regional or national roots, they are still a very long way off from learning about the roots of others, the roots of their neighbours.
During a previous debate on the subject of youth, I gave you a figure.
It referred to the Comenius programme, which links together schools in the European Union, so as to enable young people to participate in joint projects, thereby learning about the cultures of neighbouring countries.
Well, despite the fact that two million students took part in this programme, that represents only one per cent of the population of our schools.
We are therefore still a long way from achieving our aims.
We are doing the right thing, but we are not doing enough, and we need to be aware of this.
Our education programmes are therefore trying to respond to the desire of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture, and to the need which lies behind that desire, i.e. that our young people should learn about the real world in which they live.
In this context, our cultural programmes prove to be valuable instruments for making Europeans aware of cultural diversity.
Once again, however, this is not enough to reach all our citizens, or even the great majority of them.
In the world of cinema, there is the MEDIA programme, which also helps to make people aware of cultural diversity through the medium of film, and which is obtaining good results.
I would also ask you to remember the first major pan-European cultural event, Cinedays, the aim of which was above all to teach young people about cultural diversity through the cinema.
There again, it was a good thing but it was not enough.
I should therefore like to say to you that I shall need all your support in order to reinforce this aspect in the financial perspective and in the new programmes which I intend to submit to you shortly.
We are already doing this, though our efforts are a mere drop in the ocean.
In saying that, I am thinking about the Culture 2000 Programme and the RESEO project, which brings together the educational services of the major European opera companies with one aim in mind, to enable children and young people to discover opera through its cultural roots.
I am also thinking about the CLIOH's Workshop, which is setting up cooperation between many European universities with a view to producing teaching material on European history.
Yes, these things exist, but there must be a willingness at national level to make them an obligatory component of history syllabuses and of cultural education.
I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that an initiative has been launched with a view to carrying out a major study to produce an inventory of best practices in bringing together culture and education in Member States, candidate countries and third countries in the European Economic Area.
The next Parliament will have the results of that study at the beginning of 2005.
We are not, therefore, content just to sit and complain.
We are making progress, even though we know that that progress is very limited.
Mr GraÃ§a Moura, you will understand, in these circumstances, that your report comes just at the right moment and is grist to our mill inasmuch as it gives us ideas, it supports our actions, and it points us in the right direction, which will be very useful at a time when, as you know, education and culture are increasingly regarded as major elements in the construction of European citizenship.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to say a big thank you to Parliament and to its rapporteur, for this important contribution towards the future of our young citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I have three minutes to make a speech about the importance of culture for our children and the future of the education systems across the European Union.
As a famous French historian might have commented, : this is not a subject which should be treated lightly.
Commissioner Reding is absolutely right that our own national governments should be encouraged to support the initiative of the rapporteur, supported by the Commission, that when it comes to programmes and projects affecting education, they might consider a certain generosity of spirit and indeed financial generosity towards the programmes that we are commonly working to support.
At the base of this misunderstanding is the notion that culture is purely national.
Of course a part of culture is national, but as the rapporteur points out, we have many identities; we have a local and a regional identity and indeed a European identity.
It is not a historical accident that the rapporteurâs country and my country, England, share the same patron saint â St George.
Unhappily perhaps, this may have something to do with the fact that England and Portugal, allies of old, founded this union in battle â a crusade â in the Iberian Peninsula.
Our children must of course learn about conflict and disagreement and their disastrous consequences, but they should also learn about what brings people together: commerce and trade, for example.
Between England and Portugal there is the cork trade and indeed the port wine trade.
What role do our schools have in sharing the upbringing of the young?
As Commissioner Reding has pointed out, it is not only schools â and I speak as a former teacher of young children.
I was always conscious, however, that the lasting impressions had been made way before school by families; by parents and grandparents.
A minister of propaganda in a European dictatorship said, 'When I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver'.
That sounds as if it is meant to be a flippant comment, but we know what tragic consequences dictatorship brought to human lives in so many European countries.
I would hope that the Council of Ministers, when it next discusses these matters to which the Commission has drawn our attention, will have sufficient generosity of spirit to say that it will increase the education and culture budget â not simply in terms of finance, but in also terms of expertise, interest and political support â and that we will learn about our neighbours and about our common culture and heritage.
Egypt, Crete, Greece, Rome and so on are of course part of England's experience, as indeed that of Portugal, Germany and everywhere else.
But unless our children are given a sound basis of knowledge and understanding, then perhaps later on in life it will become harder for them to gain a successful career and sufficient financial resources.
Sound knowledge, however, may bring them a little wisdom in times of difficulty.
I hope that wisdom may be shared in the Council of Ministers.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ GraÃ§a Moura has submitted a report that shows how the school can indeed provide public access to culture.
As you rightly pointed out though, Commissioner, there is a large gap between the theory that we have before us and the practice in European schools.
In order to close this gap, we need to be more aware that in our changing and complex times, schools play a crucial role in creating cultural openness.
This does not mean that we disregard the national cultural heritage, rather it means creating a wider cultural openness in which we live together beyond the bounds of borders and without hostility having a chance even to arise.
Looking back upon my own school days, I have a very clear memory of a school exchange that took place with Sweden.
At that time, the war had just ended and Germany was not a popular country.
The Swedes were however willing to engage in a cultural dialogue with school pupils from my country.
This left a lasting mark upon me, and I think this is the right way to go about it, so, in the amendments I have tabled â and which have happily been approved â I emphasise that today more than ever before the school is a place of intercultural dialogue.
In my day we did not have any Turks or Italians at school.
Today however, it is quite normal for there to be a mixture of different nationalities and this represents a great opportunity for intercultural dialogue and for conveying values such as respect for others and equality in spite of differences.
This idea is reflected in the report and we must endeavour to see that it is implemented.
These fine words must not be left to stand alone; those who are responsible for the education policy in their country must now make them their own.
Commissioner, you pointed out that families have a part to play here, and this is also something that I have taken up.
It is imperative for parents to work with the school and to have some personal involvement so that the overall concept finds support from everyone.
And finally, I hope that this report will be approved by the majority and will eventually be transposed into policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr GraÃ§a Moura warmly on his initiative in discussing the role of education in relation to culture and its dissemination, and, schooling, being compulsory across Europe, is a good instrument to bring culture, including common European culture, to citizens of the future.
Education can play a significant role in this and make the parents, and with them the children, aware of what culture has to offer.
Europe is not only an economic project but also, above all, a cultural project; what unites us is culture and cultural diversity.
Moreover, I think that it is in the interest of enlargement that the different perspectives of culture are discussed; the accession countries have a different view of our history, and there is still a long road ahead of us before we can all acknowledge and recognise what we have in common.
I would like to point out, though, that education is, of course, a matter of national concern.
We in Europe may be able to make recommendations and provide information about European culture, but it simply is not up to the EU to do as some of us are proposing and force the Member States to include this information in their curricula.
My group will certainly distance itself from that.
I do share Mr GraÃ§a Moura's view that the emphasis within education should not only lie on the academic subjects, but that due consideration should also be given to creative subjects.
In that respect, I should like to stand up for music education, including classical music and opera.
Both boast a long tradition in Europe, but are more or less disregarded in schools.
In addition, access to culture is important.
Children who grow up in families where little is done about culture have difficulties.
Ideally, parents should adopt the role of guides, but schools can also play an important role in this.
I should therefore like to point out that schools should involve the parents.
In that way, education in creative subjects can receive additional support, and far more interest in culture be generated.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for all the work he has done on this report.
I believe it is vitally important to provide greater numbers of citizens with access to culture.
Schools, for good reason, must play a very important role in this regard, although I must also say that I completely agree with the Commission that this is not just the responsibility of the schools.
It is also the responsibility of families.
It is also vital that children have the opportunity to know what surrounds them, both at local and at regional level, at national level and at European level.
This is where we have to be much more involved and play a more important role.
In Spain we often get the impression that children have little knowledge of their national culture, let alone of European culture.
We all know that it is important that children identify with their city, their town, their region and their country, but it also important â without in any way undervaluing what other speakers have said â that children have some sense of identity as Europeans, and this is one of the objectives that we here must fight for.
It is difficult for us to feel European if we do not know Europe, and knowing it means being aware of its history, its geography, its economy, its literature, its philosophy, and also its sports.
It would be very positive if this could be a common subject in all the schools in all the Member States, and also if we could promote student exchanges more so that what they learn they learn .
We often say in my country that a picture is worth more than a thousand words.
I would like to say finally that it is essential that the educational services of museums, theatres, libraries, etc. which are available to the public, are available in more than one official language of the European Union. And if possible in several, so that we can all identify with what we are going to read.
Of course, all of the things we are talking about tonight cannot be carried out unless there is the Community budget to do so, and this is going to be our first great battle and we must fight for it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, what exactly is the role of public schools?
How far does it extend and in what does it consist?
In his report, MrÂ GraÃ§a Moura deals very well with these questions.
He considers the extent to which culture should be taught in schools and also at how far this should be financed and supported.
These issues are, of course, mutually dependent.
I think it is very important to teach culture in schools if we want young people to be aware of and confident about their identity, and capable of becoming active European citizens.
We need to work on this and introduce young people to cultural exchange as early as possible.
We also need to learn how to teach young people about conflict resolution, as this is something that we would expect schools to include in their lessons on culture and is a prerequisite for achieving the goals set in Lisbon which have been mentioned many times already today.
We cannot ignore the fact that European culture and cultural history form the foundation of the common economic area and that we therefore need to invest much more in education than we are presently doing.
The EU average for public expenditure on schools is 4.94% of GDP.
Although in Sweden expenditure is 7% and in Austria 5.75%, these figures are both declining.
It just cannot be right that in many countries, less is now being spent on education instead of more.
I wonder what the culture ministers and government officials are thinking when they lend their support to the goals set in Lisbon and at the same time reduce the means for implementing them.
This is wrong and needs to be put right.
We must, therefore, continue to point out that cuts in the field of education â even in the arts â lead to very serious deficiencies.
After all, if creativity is not taught and not given any room to develop, how can young people learn to deal with the constant changes that will be demanded of them in their careers and personal lives?
The first step should be to increase investment in art, culture and knowledge, not reduce it.
Instead of merely preserving our much-praised cultural diversity, we need to promote it and allow it to enjoy a successful future.
Â Â  Mr President, I must congratulate Mr GraÃ§a Moura because this document is the result of a common conviction, of a professional approach dedicated to culture.
To advocate common learning in schools at a time when nationalist arguments are increasing seems to me to be courageous and worthy of our gratitude.
I say it is worthy of praise because fundamentally, although this document appears to be written with a light touch, it defends the universality of knowledge and wisdom to the hilt.
We also note a degree of rebelliousness against an exaggerated interpretation of subsidiarity.
We in this House argue that education for an integrated Europe does not end simply with the euro or other common economic aspects, but that it must be the result of a sense of belonging, of a common project which must be based on history, on knowing who we are, what our common foundations are and, above all, where the principles and values of our times are to be found and what the thinking behind the united Europe we are moving towards is.
Furthermore, I believe there has been an unbalanced development of the European system.
Common policies have been enhanced every day, but there has been fear of making progress on the creation of common store of knowledge.
Nationalisms â I repeat â with an inbred, small-minded and egotistical interpretation of the administration of knowledge and education have increased the suspicion of the creation of common information, which could be shared by all European educational establishments.
I have tabled an amendment calling for an active policy in favour of re-evaluating our common cultural heritage.
An active and lively policy which helps the weakest and creates common criteria.
Likewise, I have called for there to be information signs in museums in more than one language of the Union, in several languages of the Union.
I think that looking at signs in our own cities and in our own languages is a concept that must be overcome.
I have tabled an amendment calling on the Commission and the Member States to promote research projects on the great cornerstones of European civilisation, such as common law, the history of the institutions, education, forms of co-existence and common rules, social and anthropological practices, as well as artistic expressions.
I believe and advocate that if we study the history of our civilisation and culture or of our institutions we will be able to rebuild foundations which existed, which exist and which unite us.
To put it another way: we are the result of a constant exchange of ideas, of models of life, of solutions and concepts which allow us to say that Europe has been preparing for centuries to be Europe.
Europe has worked hard for a common heritage. This is why it has been so easy to build Europe.
Municipal life, the concept of human dignity, of individual rights, of peopleâs freedom, of the family is the principal social nucleus and of municipalities as the broadest framework of rights and co-existence, solidarity, the concept of the State, they are all European concepts, as well as the concept of secularity.
Furthermore, the very differences which make up what we so often call our cultural diversity demonstrate the wealth of interpretation and ways of living with a single common heritage.
Let us offer young people the opportunity to know all of it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, although education in the Union is the responsibility of the Member States, there are many channels in the European Union for the support of cultural education in schools.
The main ones are the multiannual programmes, such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Culture 2000.
They all encourage cultural creativity and mobility, intercultural dialogue and knowledge of the history of the European peoples.
The learning of languages, something which is closely tied to cultural skills, has an important role to play in Union policy.
In 2001 we celebrated the European Year of Languages.
I am pleased that the rapporteur highlights the importance of knowledge of European history and cultural heritage in his report.
The history of our continent is not only wars and bloodshed but also a fruitful interaction that has enriched our national cultures.
We can see that many artists who have been essential to the identity of independent nation-states have at the same time been important European players.
With enlargement of the Union there will be a need to raise awareness of the culture and history of the new and the old Member States, as the report quite rightly states.
I believe it will strengthen our sense of alliance, as the countries of the Baltic and Central Europe that are now joining the Union are firmly rooted in a common European cultural heritage.
Culture, education and research occupy a central position in the Commission proposal in the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013.
Investment in these is crucial to success in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, but culture and education have a broader function than just economic success.
They create a framework for peopleâs intellectual growth and mutual understanding.
I therefore welcomed the reportâs recommendation that the Commission and the Member States should ensure that in European research programmes encouragement is given to projects concerning the fundamentals of European civilisation such as common law, the history of institutions and education, the rules of coexistence, social and anthropological practices and forms of artistic expression.
I hope that the objectives set in the report are duly taken into consideration when the Commission is drafting new multiannual programmes relating to culture, education and youth exchange schemes.
Similarly, the report contains the ingredients for negotiations among the EU Ministers for Education and Culture regarding common educational and cultural-political objectives.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0017/2004) by Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directives 79/117/EEC and 96/59/EC.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for the intensive work that has been done on the report on the Commission proposal for a regulation on persistent organic pollutants.
I am grateful for the support given by the Parliament and the rapporteur to the rapid handling of this legislative proposal.
I am also very pleased about the effective cooperation between the Parliament and the Council, which makes a first reading agreement possible.
A prompt adoption of this regulation should enable the Community to ratify the Stockholm Convention at the time of its entry into force in May 2004.
Furthermore, the regulation will allow those Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention to do so promptly.
Most importantly, the regulation will ensure that the European Union as a whole can meet its international obligations relating to persistent organic pollutants.
These substances persist in the environment for decades, accumulate in living organisms and travel over borders far from their sources.
Most of these substances are known carcinogens, or are otherwise toxic.
It is evident that global action is essential to tackle the risks posed by these substances.
However, I would like to draw the attention of the Parliament to an important issue raised in the draft report, namely the legal basis of the regulation.
The Commission is proposing that the regulation be based on Article 175(1) â environment â and Article 95(1) â internal market.
In the draft report, it is proposed that the regulation should be based on a single legal basis, namely Article 175(1).
While the Commission can otherwise fully support the compromise reached between the rapporteur and the Council, the Commission cannot accept the change of the legal basis.
The legal basis as proposed by the Commission is justified by the fact that the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 in the proposed regulation â concerning production, the placing on the market and use of intentionally produced POPs â are relevant to the functioning of the internal market.
Furthermore, these particular rules are meant to be transferred to the future REACH regulation on chemicals, which is based on Article 95(1) only.
Â Â  Mr President, to start with, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs here in Parliament, particularly the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, for their sound and constructive cooperation on the POP proposal, and I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Irish Presidency, which is unfortunately not here this evening, for having worked so energetically to get this proposal implemented.
Finally, I also wish to thank the Commission which, despite the disagreement concerning the legal basis, has done a very constructive and valuable piece of work in order to get matters in order.
You will notice that there are a total of 121 amendments to the report, but that is not the basis on which we shall be voting tomorrow.
We shall vote in three blocks, and I hope that Parliament will adopt the first block straight away, thereby making the second block superfluous, and finally vote in favour of the third block.
If we do this, we shall have an agreement with the Council at first reading.
One of the most important things in the report and the agreement is that we have succeeded in amending the legal basis, so that we now refer to protection of the environment and human health instead of protection of the internal market, which were the terms in which the Commissionâs original proposal was couched.
This is an important victory for Parliament on this issue in particular, but also in more general terms, since there is an ever increasing tendency for the Commission to deal with environmental proposals in terms of the internal market.
I hope that the forthcoming Parliament too will stand by the principle that environmental issues must be dealt with as such.
We have managed to get a ban introduced on the production, use and placing on the market of POPs.
We have also managed to get some very ambitious objectives of the regulation introduced, so that unintentional emissions too must cease â at least in the longer term.
This is a complicated matter.
We have, however, made clear references to, for example, the Rio declaration and the precautionary principle, as Parliament wished.
We have achieved a ban on lindane with immediate effect, so that it has been moved from a list of restricted substances to a list of banned substances.
That is also an important victory.
The exemptions that are otherwise contained in the regulation are quite clearly exceptions that must only be applied in quite extraordinary cases, and a high level of scientific evidence is required before they can be applied.
We have had restrictive control provisions introduced for both existing and new chemicals containing POPs.
That too is important, I think, especially since progress is now unfortunately slow in the work on REACH.
We have drawn up provisions stating that all stocks containing POPs must be destroyed and treated as waste.
We have also had some very restrictive monitoring provisions introduced for POP stocks, so that the limit value at which a duty of notification comes into effect has been halved from 100 kg to 50 kg. We have had a number of international commitments drawn up to the effect that the Member States must cooperate on providing technical and financial support to developing countries, so that the latter too will be in a position to comply with the Stockholm Convention.
We have had a number of general provisions introduced, stating that those producing or storing waste must prevent the waste becoming contaminated with POPs.
We have had provisions introduced to the effect that, as vigorously demanded by the Council of Ministers, permanent storage can only be regarded as an exception.
We emphasise that it is an exception that can only be applied if it proves that this is the best possible solution for the environment.
It is not a permanent exemption.
It was our wish that it should not be possible to extend it automatically, and I think that Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council of Ministers and industry, since Parliament listened to the Councilâs arguments.
We listened to arguments from industry in this area, and now we also think that industry and the Council of Ministers â that is to say, the ministers in the Member States â must show themselves to be responsible.
Money must be put into research and development so that methods are continually improved.
The aim is, after all, for the exemptions not to be extended when they are reviewed in 2009.
Time will, of course, tell, however.
It is up to the Council, industry and Parliament to follow up this matter.
We reject the limit values initially put forward by the Council of Ministers.
We believed they were too high.
Instead, we have now agreed that they will be set in 2005 and we shall ensure that a high level of protection is afforded in this area too.
We have emphasised that something must be done to involve the population in the implementation of the POP rules.
Information must also be drawn up that is directed particularly at vulnerable groups, and we have a requirement that infringements of the rules must be published.
When preparing an agreement, there are, of course, also things that are not obtained, and these are things about which I do not really have enough time to say anything.
Perhaps it is fortunate that I only have time to say something about the successes, but I hope and believe that Parliament will adopt this proposal with a large majority.
Thank you, therefore, for your constructive cooperation on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make an initial reference to the issue of the legal basis of this report and to the debate it has given rise to.
I sincerely believe that it would not be the best approach to confront internal market interests and the interests of environmental protection or the health of the citizen's.
What is more, it seems to me a serious mistake and I personally believe precisely the opposite.
I believe we must adopt an integrated and complementary approach, I believe that when we talk about the environment, we must also take account of the interests of the internal market and the possible difficulties it may bring with it and I believe that, when we talk about the internal market, we must take account of environmental interests.
That is sustainable development, that is integration of the environment, the economy and employment and that is what has been advocated in the proposal for issues to deal with at this yearâs forthcoming Spring Council.
I believe that, if we really do not believe in these three pillars of integrated and joint sustainable development, and to the same degree and with the same weight in all our considerations, we would be making political statements with a view to our summits and our communications as Community institutions which are entirely erroneous and false for our citizens.
And I frankly do not believe in this.
I believe in this integrated approach and I am, therefore, concerned much less about the legal basis of the reports than about the real focus of their content and about how cooperation is undertaken between the various Community committees and institutions.
In this regard, and in relation to this report, I would like to say that during the Italian Presidency very considerable progress was made on this Regulation and also the creation of general guidelines on it was provided for.
It was not approved because there was a significant problem in relation to POP waste and in particular the alternative methods for its destruction.
I believe that this issue has been resolved in the new Annex IV(a), which is the outcome of negotiations during the Irish Presidency.
In this regard I believe we should congratulate Mrs Frahm because she has done excellent work in terms of reaching a consensus, firstly amongst the parliamentary political groups and secondly also with the Council, so that we can approve this report at first reading.
That is why, although I am not completely in agreement with her in terms of emphasising environmental aspects over everything else, and I believe we should achieve the balance which is what we in the European Union and the Member States are really advocating, I do believe that it is a good piece of work, I do believe that she has had difficulties reaching agreements on issues such as waste or the specific exemption of the manufacture of dicofol, a substance accepted under very specific restrictions, in an industrial process which is also very specific and which is carried out in a manner which is confined and absolutely isolated from the environment.
I also agree with the revision clause, which states that the Commission will review the very specific situation of dicofol at the end of 2008 and I believe that what is being done with it is to apply, once again, in a reasonable manner, the precautionary principle, making industrial activity truly compatible with the maximum protection of the environment and safety for the citizens.
With regard to Annex II, which lists substances which can be used subject to restrictions, I believe it has been right to maintain the structure of this Annex â I know that the rapporteur was not in favour of this â but I believe that, although at the moment it does not list any specific substance, it does leave the door open to future substances which may emerge and which both the Commission and Parliament, through its approval, believe should be used, produced or marketed under certain restrictions.
With regard to the issue of lindane, I believe that it is very good that it has moved to Annex I as a prohibited substance and that its use may be permitted under certain also very strict conditions, as proposed in the agreement.
Finally, I believe we should stress what I mentioned earlier: compatibility is important and we must never lose the reference of sustainable development with its three aspects: economy, environment and employment.
With that reference I believe that Europe and the Member States can go far.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when I arrived in Brussels this morning, I found I had received a letter from the World Nature Fund, saying that I should soon receive the results of the blood tests I took a few months ago, designed to ascertain which chemicals we have in our blood.
I assume that many of us took this blood test.
This test will probably show that, in common with everyone else, I have a majority of quite foreign chemicals in my blood, and some of them will probably also be such persistent organic pollutants as we are debating today.
The fact is that we know relatively little about what this means for our health and fitness, but we know enough to be concerned.
We have been presented with a series of alarming reports to the effect that different chemicals produce diseases and that they can, for example, affect our ability to have children.
With that as part of the background, this proposal is very welcome, and not only the proposal but, above all, the compromise.
The fact is that this compromise that has been negotiated is a significant improvement upon the proposal presented by the Commission.
I should, above all, like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Frahm for her work.
I should also like to draw attention to a number of points I see as crucial improvements.
The first is the legal basis.
I think that the Commissionâs tendency to treat environmental issues more and more as issues concerning the internal market is very unfortunate.
From an ecological point of view, it is quite irresponsible to proceed in this way.
It also reduces the Member Statesâ opportunities to introduce more progressive legislation.
The EU is in that way preventing countries that wish and are able to take the lead from doing so, and that is unacceptable.
We hope that, when it presents proposals like this one, concerning the environment, the Commission will be influenced by these considerations and stick to the legal basis for achieving environmental objectives.
I also think that the core of the proposal â the clear ban on production, use and marketing â is very important.
It is particularly good that the ban on hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH),including lindane, is included in the proposal.
This reminds us that the EUâs chemicals policy does not in practice work.
We know that it is a very small portion of the chemicals on the market that really have been tested and whose effects are really known to us.
A small part of chemicals policy is covered by this proposal, and we now need efficient, uniform chemicals legislation within the framework of the REACH system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals.
It is a proposal that is now being attacked quite vigorously, but we need to find out what these chemicals entail, even when, as is the case with many chemicals, they exist in relatively modest quantities.
If too many of these chemicals are exempted, we shall be without an effective chemicals policy. I think this work shows that it is only right to take proper decisions when it comes to issues concerning chemicals, and it indicates the way ahead prior to the discussion of REACH.
I wish again to thank the rapporteur.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by congratulating MrsÂ Frahm and perhaps by offering a few congratulations to those of ourselves who participated in these negotiations with the Council.
We have succeeded in reaching an agreement with the Irish Presidency on this regulation and on the implementation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
There were perhaps not so many people who believed we would reach an agreement, but MrsÂ Frahm handled the matter extraordinarily well.
Even if everything that has been achieved is not ideal and exactly what we should have wanted, it is still perhaps the best that could have been accomplished, given what is possible politically.
I am very pleased.
As others have also said, it is important for the regulation now to be implemented as soon as possible, because persistent organic pollutants are in the roguesâ gallery of dangerous chemical substances.
They do not break down, but accumulate in our bodies and in the whole food chain.
The levels are now so high that they are a danger both to public health and to the eco-systems and their functioning.
The objective must be to put a complete stop to the discharges of persistent organic pollutants by banning their production, use and import.
We must therefore go further and, in a number of cases, much further than is indicated both by the Stockholm Convention and by the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution.
This must also apply to the new Member States that are to join the EU in May of this year.
In some cases, requests have been made for exemptions for HCH and lindane, for example, but these cannot under any circumstances be accepted.
I am often very surprised at how difficult it is for the Commission, the Council and perhaps sometimes also Parliamentâs more conservative sector to get things through in relation to protecting peopleâs health and the environment and at the fact that there are repeated delays, postponements and hold-ups.
In this area, the precautionary principle must apply fully, meaning too that new substances must be included on the list for banning or controlling these substances.
When it comes to the legal basis, I do not understand the Commission.
Nor do I understand why there has to be this kind of debate.
The legal basis must be ArticleÂ 175 of the Treaty establishing the European Community because these decisions are being taken in order to protect peopleâs health and the environment.
The whole of chemicals legislation is, of course, designed to do just that.
The fact has also been discussed from Chester onwards that it is because we cannot otherwise protect public health and the environment that we must take sound decisions in terms of a comprehensive and overall view of chemicals legislation.
In conclusion, I think that this agreement with the Council is extremely commendable, as is the fact that we have reached it at first reading, because it is so important that we implement the agreement as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal.
POPs are substances that put the public and the environment at risk, and so we should treat them with care.
With regard to the legal basis, I share the rapporteur's view that we should opt for Article 175 on its own.
This is what we did in the past, in respect of similar treaties such as those of Rotterdam and Basle, and so we should be consistent in this.
The recommendation by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also supports the choice of Article 175.
I am, in fact, curious to see whether the Commission will once again go to the Court of Justice, as happened, to everyone's surprise, with the Treaty of Rotterdam.
Can Commissioner Monti shed light on this?
In addition, the standards of concentration in Annex IV should be laid down as soon as possible.
An empty annex is of no interest to us.
I would therefore ask the Commission to set to work in this matter.
All things considered, I will be backing the compromise package. It successfully addresses my remaining objections to the Commission proposal.
Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Frahm, for the work that she has done.
It was a difficult issue, and one that she has brought to a successful conclusion, in close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs.
Â Â  Mr President, persistent organic pollutants â POPs â are chemical substances that persist in the environment, accumulate through the food chain and pose a risk to human health and the environment.
As these substances accumulate in fatty tissue in animals â including humans â by definition some of us are more at risk than others!
These pollutants are atmospherically transported across international boundaries, far from their sources, even to regions where they have never been used or produced.
The ecosystems and indigenous people of the Arctic are particularly at risk because of the long-range environmental transportation and biomagnification of these substances.
They are largely man-made toxic pollutants produced by and used in a variety of industrial sources, for example, as agricultural pesticides, in wood preservation and industrial chemicals.
POPs include pesticides such as aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, myrex and toxaphene; industrial chemicals such as PCBs and hexachlorophine; and unwanted by-products of combustion and industrial processes, such as dioxins and furans.
Considerable controls already exist within EU policy and relevant directives such as the WEEE Directive, the RoH Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Seveso Directive and various hazardous waste directives.
The proposed regulation before us aims to tidy up existing legislation on the marketing and use restrictions on eight POP pesticides and to make a slight amendment to the PCB Disposal Directive.
These measures will make it easier for states, as parties to the Protocol to the Aarhus Convention, and particularly the Stockholm Convention, to ratify both these international agreements.
48 countries have already ratified the Stockholm Convention, including 8 Member States and 2 accession countries.
Ireland has yet to ratify.
The overall compromise package for this first reading agreement with the European Parliament was approved at Coreper on 13 February, and then by all political groups.
I understand that no further amendments have been tabled.
I congratulate Mrs Frahm on the work she has done together with the Irish presidency and the Italian presidency which preceded it.
The proposed regulation is a temporary measure because in the medium term these substances will be covered by the REACH Proposal.
POPs waste, like all hazardous waste in my own country, Ireland, is exported mainly to Germany.
Germany has substantial involvement in storing POPs waste in salt mines without any processing.
It imports POPs waste commercially for disposal in this way.
To facilitate these operations it has sought provision to allow continuation of this practice, which I fully support.
The issue of the disposal of POPs-contaminated waste has been at the centre of the difficulties in finding a compromise.
There has been much dispute about the methods of disposal: incineration, burial in deep storage in rock or in salt mines and landfill, to name but a few.
Under the requirements of the Stockholm Convention there are two principal methods for the treatment of POPs waste, namely destruction or irreversible transformation.
Under this regulation there are options for the management of low content POPs waste under the provisions of the Waste Framework Directive.
A third option, which applies to POPs waste generally, has also been agreed upon in negotiations between Parliament and the Council.
In cases where destruction or irreversible transformation is not the environmentally preferred option, POPs waste can be stored.
This storage can take place in disused salt mines, deep rock formations and hazardous landfill sites.
All three forms of storage are carefully defined in existing EU legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Frahm on her excellent report and also those involved in reaching a compromise.
As my colleague Mrs SchÃ¶rling pointed out, persistent organic pollutants â POPs â are chemical substances that persist in the environment.
They accumulate through the food chain and they pose a risk not just to the environment but also to human health, causing adverse human health effects.
These pollutants, as has been mentioned, can cross borders: they can end up far from where they originated, and indeed they have been found in areas where they have never been used, so there is a serious threat to the environment here.
The European Community and all the Member States have signed the Protocol to the regional UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on POPs, in 1998, and the global Stockholm Convention on POPs in 2001.
While all Member States have signed both of these, many states, including my own, have not yet ratified them.
I The Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland is setting in place measures to have them ratified, and I welcome that.
While most of the listed POPs are not produced or used in the Community, there is still the problem that legislation does not prevent them being placed on the market.
As Mrs Frahm pointed out, the change of the legal basis is very important in relation to ensuring that this is an issue of public health and the environment: it is not just an internal market issue.
Lindane was a substance used in shampoo to get rid of nits in children's hair.
Many parents did not realise that the continual use of something like that, which contained a serious chemical, affected their children, and many people even within this Parliament have actually used these shampoos.
There was no warning in relation to what the effects would be, and as has been pointed out, little is known about what the long-term true effects are, despite the fact that these POPs have been found in our bodies.
This report is very welcome; the work done on the issue by Mrs Frahm is something for which we must congratulate her.
I am also very glad to hear that the Irish presidency has been very constructive on this issue and in trying to help to get this package through, and that is also to be welcomed.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissionâs proposal really needs tightening up, and toxic POPs should have been gone from our everyday lives long ago.
That will not happen as a result of the Commissionâs proposal.
It is therefore to be welcomed that, in her report, MrsÂ Frahm makes an energetic attempt to tighten matters up, and I support all the rapporteurâs proposals.
A much more radical plan is needed, however, if we are to experience a noticeable phasing out of harmful chemicals, including the highly toxic POPs.
Such a plan, which removes all the superfluous chemicals from our everyday lives, is not appropriate as a change to this regulation.
I therefore wish to submit it in relation to the debate on the Commissionâs proposal on chemicals, known as the REACH programme.
As part of the phasing out of toxic chemicals, action should also be taken in response to the polluter pays principle, established by treaty.
A duty should be imposed on the chemicals in order to finance the monitoring, assessment and remedying of damage caused by use according to the rules, as well as in order to finance the development of alternatives.
The first substance on which it would be appropriate to impose such a tax is PVC.
Investment must also be made in real ecological alternatives, which either already exist or are on the way, as a replacement for most chemicals. These include the pesticides dealt with in this directive.
Just as, in Parliament, we have discussed the labelling of genetically modified products, labelling arrangements should also, in the interests of free consumer choice, be introduced for the many toxic chemicals.
I am sure that the day we label conventional milk âmilk with pesticidesâ, there will be a decisive shift in consumer demand in favour of the organic alternatives.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the PSE Group I thank the rapporteur for her work and also the presidency for its cooperation.
This has been very a useful exercise in achieving a second reading agreement on an important proposal, one which is tackling a persistent, organic and very long-standing problem.
We believe that this report is now a very satisfactory one and we are very happy to vote for it.
I am very pleased that a number of the outstanding issues have been resolved.
The whole issue of the legal basis has now been resolved, and I am satisfied with that.
On the issue of POPs waste, we have come to a pragmatic realisation of the difficulties of completely abolishing waste containing POPs and we think that the appropriate proposal here will meet with the inevitable residual problems that we find with POPs being in waste and in other places.
As regards some of the other issues, such as the problem of stockpiles, and technical and financial assistance, we have all come to reasonable agreements, and the rapporteur can be very proud that she has made a very positive step forward, which I do not think will take long to implement.
The great thing about a second reading agreement is the willingness to take it forward into legislation quickly, which we are all waiting for.
Naming and shaming is something which may or may not be necessary in this proposal: it is already contained in the Aarhus Convention.
This is something we need to revisit, but a point that the rapporteur was right to raise.
The whole issue of compatibility with the REACH Directive is one that we must all have on our minds at all times.
That new proposal on REACH is going to be very important, but it must be comprehensive in its scope.
We must find a way in which we can ensure, for example, that whilst POPs are outside the REACH Proposal, chemicals that contain POPs or might produce POPs as a residue are inside the proposal.
This would be a very important step forward.
It will certainly tighten up any potential loophole that might be created during the time in which we are going to work on that very important proposal here in the autumn.
The PSE Group will be voting for this proposal tomorrow.
We thank the rapporteur for her work, we thank the Commission for its proposal and cooperation, and finally the presidency for its willingness to find a second reading agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to re-emphasise that the Commission very much supports an early agreement on this regulation, except for the change of the legal basis.
The Commission can fully support the compromise package negotiated between Council and Parliament.
The adoption of this compromise package will enable the Community and the Member States to ratify the Stockholm Convention in good time and a resolute majority tomorrow will send a very clear signal.
On the issue of the legal basis, the provisions on prohibitions and restrictions of intentionally-produced POP chemicals will affect the functioning of the internal market and therefore these measures should be based on Article 95(1) of the Treaty.
The fact that these bans or restrictions are introduced in order to protect human health or the environment does not mean that these provisions cannot be adopted on the basis of Article 95.
Article 95(3) states clearly that the Commission may propose legislation concerning health or environmental protection based on Article 95(1) if these measures have any impact on the functioning of the internal market.
Thus it is appropriate that the regulation be based on both 175(1) and 95(1).
Furthermore, it should be noted that the Commission also proposes to transfer the production and use bans from the POPs Implementation Regulation to the future REACH Regulation on chemicals, which is based on Article 95.
If the legal basis were different, this move would have an effect on the option for Member States to adopt more stringent measures.
Therefore, the Commission considered that it was more appropriate to base these provisions on ArticleÂ 95.
Mr Blokland wondered whether the Commission would appeal to the European Court of Justice: I can only draw the Houseâs attention to the fact that the Commission published a declaration in the Council minutes clarifying its position in that respect.
On the point of waste management, which Mrs Frahm, Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo and Mrs Doyle mentioned, it is important to note that the amended proposal clearly stipulates that for waste, destruction or irreversible transformation is a main rule, whereas other waste management operations can be allowed only in specific, clearly-defined cases.
Especially in regard to the high-content POPs waste, the Commission points out that permanent storage or other operations can only be allowed if destruction of the POP content is not the environmentally-preferable option.
This is fully in line with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention.
Moreover, the modified provisions lay down additional conditions and a procedure to ensure that the derogation is not misused.
On these grounds the Commission can accept the compromise.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, and Parliament for this very important piece of legislative work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0056/2004) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1177/2002 concerning a temporary defensive mechanism to shipbuilding.
Â Â  . Mr President, I regret that Mrs Randzio-Plath is not able to be here with us this evening.
I would like to congratulate and thank her for the work which she carried out so promptly and smoothly.
In the light of unfair competition from Korean shipyards and the failure of Korea to implement the provisions of the Agreed Minutes relating to world shipbuilding, signed by the EU and Korea on 22 June 2000, the Commission adopted a twin-track strategy to tackle these unfair practices in the shipbuilding sector.
This strategy involves two instruments: the initiation of an action against Korea before the WTO and the authorisation of temporary and limited contract-related operating aid under the Temporary Defensive Mechanism â TDM â to assist Community shipyards in those segments where adverse effects have been suffered owing to unfair Korean competition.
From the outset, a close link was established between the TDM and the action of the EU against Korea before the WTO.
As these WTO proceedings are taking more time than originally foreseen, and as Korea continues to fail to implement the Agreed Minutes, the Commission now proposes to prolong the application of the TDM Regulation until 31 March 2005, when the final decision of the WTO appellate body is expected.
The TDM Regulation was adopted by the Council on 27Â June 2002.
It provides for contract-related state aid up to 6% of the contract value, benefiting the shipyards hit by the Korean unfair competition.
I would like to underline that from the outset the mechanism was strictly limited in scope and time.
Regarding the scope, only those market segments where it has been demonstrated that the EU shipbuilding industry has suffered adverse effects as a result of unfair Korean competition are eligible for aid: container ships, chemical and product tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers.
As for the timing, the defensive mechanism was to be applied only until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings against Korea, or until the suspension of these proceedings on the grounds that the EU considered that the Agreed Minutes had been effectively implemented.
In any case, the support mechanism was to expire on 31 March 2004, the expected date of conclusion of the WTO proceedings.
The Commission strictly limits its proposal to this extension and does not propose any other changes such as extension of the scope.
I fully agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath that it would be counter-productive to weaken the EU strategy tackling Koreaâs behaviour in the shipbuilding industry at the crucial moment that the satisfactory conclusion of the WTO proceedings is expected.
I am delighted that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs called for the adoption of the proposal without amendments.
I also am grateful that Parliament has accepted that this urgent matter should be dealt with via an accelerated procedure.
This will allow the extension to be adopted before the expiration of the existing instrument.
I would like to conclude by reiterating that the defensive mechanism is an exceptional measure, closely targeted â and I am closely targeting this remark! â at the trade problem with Korea.
I therefore hope that you will be able to support the extension of the mechanism for one year with the aim of restoring normal trading conditions in the international shipbuilding market.
Â Â  Mr President, excuse me for laughing but we are not alone anymore, Mr Monti!
I can see two other Members arriving!
I thought we could have been alone, but another time maybe!
Â Â  Mr President, unfortunately I have to say that it was I who asked to have this point debated, and for one simple reason.
I find it difficult to understand why a temporary â and, I repeat, a temporary â subsidy arrangement must now suddenly be extended.
As rapporteur for Parliamentâs statement on the original regulation, it is fairly clear to me that I asked the Commission for a guarantee that this arrangement would only be temporary.
The Commission assured me of this, as did you too, Mr Monti.
For the same reason, the regulation was also limited in time.
The regulation contained, moreover, a mousetrap clause whereby the regulation would cease immediately in the event of the dispute with South Korea being resolved.
When an expiry date was placed on the regulation, it was precisely because there was no wish to see this arrangement become permanent, regardless of whether or not the dispute with South Korea was resolved.
For me, this was a mitigating circumstance, since at no time have I been convinced that South Korea does in actual fact compete on unequal terms.
On the contrary, I am afraid that this regulation has only helped to distort competition internally within the EU.
I would therefore take the liberty of asking you, MrÂ Monti, whether the regulation is, in reality, on its way to becoming permanent, and whether you do not see this as a backward step in the fight against direct production subsidies.
Could it perhaps be said that a promise has been broken in this case?
I am therefore rather tired of the matter this evening.
Â Â  You are no longer my favourite Commissioner, Mr Monti, but you can change that if you give me the right answer tonight!
Â Â  . Mr President, we are talking about temporary events and I know that being the favourite Commissioner of Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen is at most a temporary situation â it may imply an in and out evolution in this lucky status.
I believe I continue to deserve that status, not only because of the inherent generosity of Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, but also because I believe â and I say this in front of witnesses! â we are sticking exactly to the promise made to you and to others in Parliament.
Why was this mechanism adopted as temporary?
First because the Commission â and I in particular â was totally against the re-introduction of an unlimited, permanent mechanism on operating state aid for shipbuilding.
It therefore had to be temporary.
Temporary means two things; it is not permanent and it must have a logical criterion to define how temporary it is.
The logical criterion there was the reasonable expectation about the duration of the procedure before the WTO.
We might be accused of logical incoherence if, after having proposed this â it was also decided by Council and Parliament â we were now to depart from that logical criterion.
To be more direct, I confirm that this is not by any means meant to be the re-introduction of a permanent mechanism.
