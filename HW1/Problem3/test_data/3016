The following questions must inevitably be asked: who gives us the right, on any pretext, to bomb, kill and trample the fundamental principles of international law underfoot?
How should we describe someone who stirs up tension and conflict between peoples inside countries and then uses that tension and conflict to control and plunder the countries in question?
But, even if international alliances are still prepared to commit such crimes today, the people will soon form their own peaceful front against these criminal policies.
I do not congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lalumiere; I am disgusted by her proposal.
Mr President, the challenge confronting us is how Europe can do more for crisis prevention and management, and the proposals which we are debating are the only way we can achieve that more effectively.
I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid, but also in this area.
I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force, because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience, not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.
I want to address a word to people in London.
It is reported in the newspapers that certain people in London are saying they would end the EU's involvement in the defence process.
To London I say: you cannot do that; be realistic!
You could possibly end the UK's involvement, but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing.
Please face reality.
This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating.
We must try to shape it positively.
I look forward to further debate on these questions, being Parliament's rapporteur on the Rapid Reaction Facility that we will be dealing with later in the year.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs LalumiÃšre, on the report which she produced for our Parliament and in which she managed to strike a fine balance.
Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy.
With unusual drive, the European Council has taken a number of important decisions, of which we have taken note and for which we have given due credit.
The aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the so-called Petersberg tasks.
A decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect.
A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place.
A small-scale NATO is emerging.
In this context, I would like to emphasise two incisive questions, which are a small selection from a long series of matters which are being discussed here today.
The European Union must be able to act autonomously.
This may sound obvious, but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem.
What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO?
There is some confusion surrounding this on both sides of the Atlantic and this should be resolved soon.
Autonomy should certainly not culminate in a political exchange between the common European security and defence policy and the national missile defence, as was suggested recently by an American senator during the NATO Assembly in Budapest.
In summary, the question which I would like to put to the Council is: what is autonomy in this context?
Is action within a NATO context always the first option, as the Americans claim?
Should NATO be given first refusal before the European Union can act autonomously or will the European Union allow itself more room for manoeuvre?
I have the impression that this question is being avoided on both sides of the Atlantic, which will compromise future cooperation.
The second point is about democratic control.
In the Netherlands, there has been a lot of discussion recently about who was involved in what decisions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
This mainly relates to the government.
But if some kind of policy of faits accomplis is already mentioned sometimes at this level, then what about parliamentary control?
Will the common European security and defence policy turn into a cosy intergovernmental get-together or will national parliaments and the European Parliament be truly involved?
Here too, the pertinent question arises as to whether the Council pays any attention to this at all?
Operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved.
The support base required for using the EU military instrument needs to be more extensive than that required for creating it.
Mrs LalumiÃšre' s resolution contains a relevant proposal for tackling the threat of a democratic deficit in this connection.
The government conference can benefit from this.
The least the European Parliament could ask for is to be considered a fully-fledged partner in this very important debate.
It is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the European Union.
The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging.
Many Members, especially citizens in neutral countries, have no say on whether this is what they want.
In my own country the vast majority of people are against the militarisation of Europe, especially a Europe that will have nuclear weapons at its disposal, a Europe where the arms industries are exporting arms to places around the world where there are mass and gross abuses of human rights.
If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world, we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem.
We need to address that.
With respect to the neutral countries, some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence.
We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it, but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out.
Finally, I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing.
If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation, it is incredible to put it up as an example.
I am sure there are good examples, but the RUC is not one of them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several speakers have referred to the importance of the European security and defence policy.
I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy.
Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings in camera.
They must be subject to parliamentary control.
It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments.
It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments.
But everything over and above that, all questions of civil policy, come under the jurisdiction of the European Parliament.
This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House.
The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed.
It was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union, which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd, trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union.
Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency.
I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas.
It would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the European Parliament is the right forum.
We attended the NATO assembly a few days ago, where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union, that the EU had a parliament, that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d' Ãªtre.
I think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this Summit.
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs LalumiÃšre on producing a report which is a fine balance of the arguments and interests involved.
It is a remarkable achievement.
I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals.
It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once, instead of spending years discussing institutions, the European Union has put results before means.
That, as we are already seeing, will drive forward the agenda very rapidly.
If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford, we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and, in particular, defence industries.
We need a strong, competitive European defence industry.
Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector, there is still far too much fragmentation in this area.
We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity.
The Western European Union Armaments Group, for example, moves very slowly on the basis of consensus.
Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent.
We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single, coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate.
That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group.
I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate.
Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports, and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation.
The Commission has a crucial role in this.
The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries: there were two communications.
This Commission has been completely silent on this issue.
It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties.
We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible, and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty.
I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field.
Mr President, considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common European security and defence policy.
The Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard.
However, in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy.
I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff.
If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is.
In the meantime we have to be realistic about what we can achieve and at the moment we cannot talk about operational autonomy for any European force.
This will always be relative to our dependence and reliance on NATO which still owns the essential military hardware and which enabled EU governments to deploy their troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly, we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis.
These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations.
Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks.
The experience of Kosovo has underlined the need for such an initiative and I welcome the fact that it may happen at Feira.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, a common foreign, security and defence policy has recently developed in the European Union which would probably have been unthinkable a few years ago.
It has come about because two main groups of members in the European Union have shifted their position: those who believed that NATO alone was responsible for security and defence, and those who believed that security and defence were not a Community affair and should be dealt with by individual states either neutrally or within a pact.
I think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity.
I also think that, in the final analysis, Article 5, which has been quoted several times today, should represent the common basis for all members of the European Union, even if this can only be achieved gradually.
Kosovo has been mentioned several times today.
I think that too one-sided a view is sometimes taken of the lessons to come out of Kosovo and the Balkans.
In fact, four issues are at stake.
First, prevention, of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of Kosovo.
Secondly, deterrence, of which there was certainly too little in the case of Kosovo, because no common will was visible.
Thirdly, the facility for rapid, targeted intervention.
This functioned perhaps to a certain extent, although the fight about what constitutes the optimum form of intervention blocked a great deal.
And fourthly, the restoration and stabilisation of peace, including after military intervention.
Developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think.
I am particularly thankful that the question of the police and security forces in Kosovo has been raised several times today, because it is essential to establish security by strengthening the presence of police troops.
There is also the question of developing a system of regional responsibility in Europe which does not fly in the face of the United Nations system, as has been maintained time and again, but which, on the contrary, can be incorporated into the United Nations system and into the ideas of the United Nations.
Finally, Commissioner Patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution, perhaps just reforms.
But we should try for institutional revolution.
As far as the institutions to be set up in the near future referred to today are concerned, I am afraid that we will paint ourselves into a corner.
We should not allow too many institutions to exist and the integration of the WEU and the EU forms part of this philosophy.
Mr President, we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO.
This is somewhat disingenuous.
If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey.
Over the past five years NATO has already restructured for the specific purpose of facilitating European action should the alliance as a whole not wish to be engaged.
But this apparently is not enough.
The real desire is to create something separate from NATO.
Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions that we are seeing in European defence budgets, most notably by Germany, demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts.
The amendments we have put forward to the LalumiÃšre resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority, to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged, to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations.
We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets, including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action, to be taken unanimously.
There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate.
Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection.
Mr President, honourable members, for reasons of security in Europe and in order to safeguard the security of others outside the Union who may need our support, Europe requires an independent military presence which differs from the presence which it has by reason of its membership of NATO.
Events in Kosovo and the whole tragic break up of the former Yugoslavia are proof most painful of Europe' s failings within NATO.
One might even say that Europe has entrusted the task of a military presence to the NATO leadership and, at the same time, relaxed its efforts over the years, to the point at which it is now more or less incapable of properly honouring its obligations within NATO.
There is a psychological explanation for this.
If someone, be it a person, a country or a group of countries, considers that it has no initiative to act, it loses interest, neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties, but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily.
Perhaps the most important outcome of the resolutions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon summits is precisely the fact that they have restored Europe' s sense of initiative, giving it the motivation needed in order to accept responsibility, make an effort and honour its obligations.
From this point of view, the draft which we are debating does not constitute a threat to the cohesion of ÃÃÃÃ.
On the contrary, a Europe with its own military initiative will take its NATO obligations more seriously.
It is the only way in which it can take its NATO obligations seriously and reassure the political forces in the United States which object to American armed forces and American resources being tied up in the defence of Europe.
Consequently, Mr President, we must ensure that our immediate decisions are geared towards European unity and the defence of a common border and, sooner or later, that is the point we must reach.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed resolution on a common European security and defence policy is an important signal from the European Parliament in the run-up to the Feira Summit, a signal which points in two directions.
First, a declaration of an independent role for the European Union in both civil and military security policy within a clearly defined remit, as in the Petersberg tasks for maintaining peace and peace-making.
Secondly, a signal to take account of and strengthen the role of the European Parliament in fashioning a common European security and defence policy.
The European Union needs to make up lost ground when it comes to a common security and defence policy if you think that its defence spending does not even equal 60% of comparable spending in the USA and only achieves 10% of the operational efficiency of the USA.
The specific undertaking to create a European strike force no more than 60 000 strong in order to complete the Petersberg tasks calls for solidarity between all the Member States of the European Union.
The lack of any real common foreign and security policy has been exacerbated by the Balkan crisis, which highlighted the weakness of the European Union in this area.
We cannot double the functions of NATO in the area of global security.
We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure.
But completion of the Petersberg tasks must be guaranteed and the principle that security is indivisible must be applied, which is why mutual support, as anchored in Article 5 of the WEU Treaty, must be open to all sides in a revised EU Treaty.
The idea of attaching Article 5 in an additional protocol to a revised Treaty, to which the individual Member States may accede if necessary, therefore represents a reasonable attempt to find a solution.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, honourable members, it is quite right to make crisis management the main objective of European foreign and defence policy.
After all, crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century.
Of course, the current state of the world and the intricacies of the international system also raise other issues and questions which, in my view, form an integral part of the issues and problems which need to inform a specific proposal on European foreign policy.
I should like to congratulate Mrs LalumiÃšre because she has taken a huge step forward in her report.
Not only has she made specific proposals, she has also highlighted the need to find a modus operandi and a modus vivendi for all the means proposed in order to implement European foreign policy.
The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative.
There is no problem with the figures.
It is qualitative.
The problem lies in the content. Having said this, may I suggest, Minister, that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ÃÃÃÃ.
I, fellow members, shall insist above all on the need to find a system, a modus operandi for all the proposals tabled in the House.
Because foreign policy nowadays cannot and must not merely be the product of simple intergovernmental cooperation.
On the contrary, it must be derived by operating a multi-dimensional structure and system within which the parliamentary aspect plays an important part.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year has gone by since the war in Kosovo, and intensive reconstruction work has begun.
An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed.
To avoid similar disasters in the future, we are now taking new steps to establish a common European defence and security policy.
We are doing this in order to join together in creating tools to safeguard the lynchpin of security, namely freedom and peace in Europe.
I am extremely pleased that this process is going on.
Within the framework of the EU' s mandate, this joint commitment is now being carried out and intensified.
I think it is important that the EU should concentrate on what it is good at, namely engaging in trade, developing contacts and taking measures to prevent conflicts. It is also important, however, to create credibility through 'more muscle' and increased ability to intervene in time.
If (as it wishes, and is endeavouring, to be) the EU is to be taken seriously in the world, it must also demonstrably be able to take more responsibility in its own area.
It is therefore important that we should create structures which cooperate with NATO, for it is there that the competence, capacity, leadership ability and credibility are to be found.
The EU has a complementary role, and that is why Mrs LalumiÃšre' s report is so commendable.
This concept is based upon individual Member States' fulfilling the commitments they have made.
Our main role in the European Parliament is therefore to exercise supervision.
I have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the Member States.
These defence budgets are shrinking at the same time as we require investment in restructuring and new hardware.
Since we last discussed this subject, Germany' s supreme commander has resigned in protest, which is as good a sign as any.
If our heads of State and government are to have any credibility in the year 2003, they should not only talk in Feira, but must also then return home and review the responsibilities of each country and the commitments they have undertaken to fulfil.
Mr President, Secretary of State, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order for the European construction process to maintain its vitality, which is a prerequisite for its survival, each point of arrival must also form a point of departure.
Having achieved economic and monetary union, other plans are now being drawn up. We cannot take 50 years to implement these, however.
This is the case with the establishment of an effective common European security and defence policy.
The Member States must address this issue from a European perspective which can be fully reconciled with NATO commitments.
Although this was clearly not our desire, the fall of the Berlin wall has obviously not helped with security and defence in Europe.
We are therefore now faced with the complex situation in the Balkans, which throws up new problems on a daily basis. The lessons of Kosovo show us how not to act and the challenges in the Mediterranean basin are keeping us alert.
After decades of a bipolar world, the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the European Union' s contribution will be decisive.
Peace must continue to be the grand plan of European construction but this will not happen by itself.
We must therefore have effective mechanisms for managing crises using non-military means, for developing and ensuring the compatibility of the military capabilities of the Member States, for mobilising adequate financial resources in the national and Community budgets and for establishing effective decision-making structures.
The choices seem clear, the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive.
Reforms must be implemented, major financial resources and means must be identified, made compatible and mobilised.
The commitment of the Member States is essential.
The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over.
The Feira European Council must be more than an occasion to reaffirm our desires. It must be a turning point characterised by the identification of the necessary financial resources and by the inclusion on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference of the institutional aspects of the Common European Security and Defence Policy.
I congratulate Mrs LalumiÃšre on her work.
- (PT) Mr President, I must very quickly highlight the usefulness of this debate and the importance of all the interventions in terms of better preparing the Council on this issue.
Mrs LalumiÃšre' s report is excellent, particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations.
The report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here.
This report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in Helsinki.
Regardless of certain differences which are evident here in terms of security and defence cultures, and more so in the defence culture than in the security culture, we believe that we all agree on the need for the European Union to rapidly acquire a crisis management capability at either military or non-military level.
We must determine the extent of these mechanisms and the appropriateness of these various dimensions in terms which express the different sensitivities indicated here.
I must mention one specific point which was raised with regard to amending the Treaty on European Union and other possible amendments to this Treaty at this stage in order possibly to enshrine in law the EU' s current military mechanisms. The Portuguese Presidency' s and the Council' s reading of this issue is that there is no need for an immediate amendment of the Treaty and that the provisions of Article 17 are sufficient to cover the current mechanisms.
In any case, the way is clear for future discussion of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive structures.
As for the EU-NATO link, all the concerns expressed about how the creation of a common European security and defence policy may reflect negatively on the relationship with NATO are unfounded.
On the contrary, we believe that this mechanism will allow us to independently reinforce a particular dimension without creating any type of barrier in our relationship with NATO.
Moreover, the mechanisms which we are implementing to link Member States who are in NATO with those who are not and, at the same time, the formulas which we are using to link the European Union in terms of security and defence with NATO partners outside the EU seem to have found the right balance. We hope that the Feira European Council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area.
On the issue of parliamentary representation, we obviously appreciate the sensitivity of this House with regard to its greater involvement in these matters.
However, we believe that this issue of representation precedes that of security and defence and in fact lies at the level of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the well-known claims made by Parliament with regard to its involvement in this wider policy.
This point has been and is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted.
In any case, it is essential, particularly with regard to the national parliaments, to guarantee their association with any future development in this area.
We too share these concerns.
Civilian crisis management has been one of the aspects highlighted by the Portuguese Presidency, particularly bearing in mind the concerns felt within the Council and also expressed in this House about this dimension. The day after tomorrow the first meeting of the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management will take place.
This Committee was specifically created during the Portuguese Presidency.
Finally, on the last issue of the Armaments Group, this group is continuing its work and will remain active within the WEU.
Mr President, it has been an interesting debate.
We have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it, as one would anticipate.
I shall be mercifully brief.
I do not want to come between Parliament and its preprandial democratic duty.
However, there are a couple of points I should like to make.
Firstly, there was some discussion about the sort of institutional arrangements that we need to make, not least in the Commission, to cope with the responsibilities of adequately implementing a common foreign and security policy and, in particular, to ensure that we can play our own role in the non-military aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management.
We need our own crisis units in the Commission, but we should keep that small.
I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no intention of duplicating within the Commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the Council.
Secondly, Mrs LalumiÃšre spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly.
I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions.
It is one of my obsessions in relation to, for instance, MEDA regulation and in relation to the Balkans.
We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans.
We have made proposals about asymmetric trade measures for the Balkans, which are now being considered by the Council and, in due course, will be considered by Parliament.
We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube.
Those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals.
I hope we can get quick decisions.
Unless we can take decisions more quickly, before crises happen, then the question of how quickly we take decisions when crises have actually broken will come up a great deal more frequently.
So in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities.
The sooner we face up to that the better, not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy.
Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report.
I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it.
All of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well.
President.
I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Welcome
Colleagues, it is a great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Australian House of Representatives and the Senate, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery.
I extend a warm welcome to the Australian delegation, which is here to attend the 24th European Parliament/Australia Interparliamentary meeting, taking place here in Strasbourg on 14 and 15 June.
The honourable Bruce Baird heads the Australian delegation, which is composed of three Members of the House of Representatives and two Members of the Senate.
The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament initiated their direct political dialogue in 1981 and over the years this dialogue has encompassed a broad range of issues.
We now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with Australia.
I wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in Strasbourg.
Vote
Mr Perry has the floor on a point of order.
Madam President, outside the door of this Chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet.
I have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but I have objections to what I take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the Hemicycle.
Is this allowed under our Rules?
Madam President, I understand that we will be voting on the amendments to the LalumiÃšre resolution tomorrow and not today.
I should like to point out that there is an important typographical error in Amendment No 39, which Members will have.
It mentions the "President of Canada". This should read: the "Parliament of Canada".
There is no president of Canada.
The head of state of Canada is Her Majesty the Queen, who is also the head of state of Australia.
Calendar of part-sessions of Parliament for the year 2001
Dell' Alba (TDI).
(FR) Madam President, I am tabling a point of order concerning the first vote due to take place, because, I, with forty or so fellow Members, have tabled twelve amendments seeking to transfer all plenary sessions from Strasbourg to Brussels.
These amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible.
I admit that our Rules of Procedure state that we must deliberate on the matter according to the conditions laid down by the Treaties, but I would remind you that, last April, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution, specifically bearing in mind the Intergovernmental Conference that was then taking place, which requested, with a very large majority, that the seat and working centres of the European Parliament should be decided on by Parliament itself.
We could therefore quite easily have voted in favour of our amendments, waited for the results of the IGC and adapted the calendar accordingly.
I dispute the statement that these amendments, supported by many of my fellow Members, are inadmissible.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall just say that the amendments which Mr Dell' Alba has just been speaking about have indeed been deemed to be inadmissible, because Parliament is only entitled to give its opinion on the dates of the part-session as they are presented in the proposal formulated by the Conference of Presidents.
There is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on.
That is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable.
On the other hand, all the other amendments have been deemed to be acceptable, and indeed has always been the case.
(Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended)
Simplified procedure - without report
Initiative of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to the adoption of a Council decision establishing a procedure for amending Articles 40(4) and (5), 41(7) and 65(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders (7217/00 - C5-0216/2000 - 2000/0803(CNS)) (Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs)

Report (A5-0156/2000) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (COM(1999) 594 - C5Â­0016/2000 - 1999/0244(COD))
Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to request that the vote on Maaten report be postponed until July.
Mr Fiori, to make things quite clear, you are therefore asking for the vote to be postponed, pursuant to Rule 146(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
Is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue.
My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding, I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and, above all, for the work carried out by Mr Maaten, who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals, both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary, in an unbelievably short space of time.
I think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time.
There are so many proposals - 120 in all - that I fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other.
We really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name.
With the best will in the world and with the greatest respect for this issue, we must not forget that we really are not under any pressure and we should use the time available to us for careful reflection and review.
Madam President, I must state my opposition to this request to postpone the vote. I do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action.
I know that the tobacco industry lobby is most anxious to prevent this directive and I think that this request is yet another ploy to prevent a vote, which is clearly a matter of urgency, from taking place.
I would remind you that the Council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard Parliament' s views.
If we postpone our vote, the tobacco industry will gain even more time, since the Council will then not be able to state its position until the end of June.
Furthermore, I think that Mr Maaten and the Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have produced a good piece of work.
It is true that many amendments have been tabled and also that in future we will have to make efforts to improve our work so that fewer amendments are tabled in plenary.
As it happens, however, I do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote.
Everything is in place for a vote to be held.
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
I congratulate Mr Maaten and I shall take this opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you that I have received several letters from Members who would like us to respect the non-smoking areas because they suffer from asthma.
(Applause)
Report (A5-0142/2000) by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC and 93/22/EEC as regards exchange of information with third countries (COM(1999) 748 - C5Â­0011/2000 - 2000/0014(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0144/2000) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs,
I. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directives 69/169/EEC and 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions on beer imports into Finland (COM(2000) 76 - C5-0137/2000 - 2000/0038 (CNS))
II. on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 as regards a temporary derogation for duty-free imports of beer into Finland (COM(2000) 76 - C5-0138/2000 - 2000/0039(CNS))
(Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes)
Report (A5-0159/2000) by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the European Parliament resolution on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on historical liabilities resulting from nuclear activities carried out at the JRC under the Euratom Treaty - Decommissioning of obsolete nuclear installations and the management of the resulting waste (COM(1999) 114 - C5-0214/1999 - 1999/2169(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I should just like to point out that I believe that the House has passed an illegal resolution in the vote on the calendar because a four-day week in Strasbourg would only be permitted if there were no additional plenary part-session in Brussels or, conversely, I believe that only if the full plenary week has been exhausted is it legal to hold additional plenary part-sessions in Brussels.
Please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency.
We have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the Treaty.
Because this could result in our holding one-day sessions here and five-day sessions elsewhere.
That cannot be the purpose of the compromise.
Apart from that, it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions.
Mr Posselt, firstly, I am doubtful as to whether this is a point of order and, secondly, bearing in mind that, of course, the Bureau is willing to study everything that is asked of it, if that interpretation were indisputable, the amendment that you are criticising would not have been put to the vote in plenary session.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Parliament' s calendar of part-sessions - 2001
Mr President, I rise to register my opposition to the amendments of my own Group with whom I am out of step, and to similar amendments, which seek to eliminate the Friday sittings in Strasbourg or to break up one of the weeks of the part-session into two distinct part-sessions in order to artificially increase the number of part-sessions in Strasbourg and even to the amendments by Mr Pannella and company, seeking to remove Mondays and Fridays from the Strasbourg part-session or to extend the additional part-sessions by two to three or even five days.
All of these amendments are designed to render the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions, which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, meaningless. They are designed to attempt to eliminate Strasbourg and to concentrate Parliament' s activities in Brussels.
By the same token, and out of respect for the rule of law, I voted against the amendments which seek to cancel the additional part-sessions in Brussels.
It is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the Treaties regarding our working venues, although it is not an intention that I share.
To whittle away, however, at the provisions of the Treaty and the annexed acts is a method that is not worthy of the parliamentary institution.
Mr President, I voted not to work on Fridays in Strasbourg although I am totally in favour of our meeting here.
I decided to vote not to work on Fridays because Friday was inconvenient for almost all the Members.
I would like to make the following point: we put in a lot of time but we work inefficiently and we produce relatively little compared with, for example, the Italian Parliament, which meets less often - it never votes on a Monday and does not meet on Fridays at all - yet produces at least 500 laws every year.
We are constantly wasting time in fruitless discussion and, in particular, with all these votes, resolutions, motions, urgent debates and so on and so forth which, when all is said and done, do not produce any tangible results and undermine the genuine legislative activity which should be the principle activity of a Parliament which is not an advisory body but an organ which adopts resolutions.
Mr President, I am ashamed to say so but I could not stop myself dozing off a couple of times during the votes which have just taken place and only managed to wake up and cast my vote at the last minute.
This is because Parliament' s work is not being organised properly.
I voted for the calendar but I would like to make it clear - as Mr Speroni has just said - that we waste a great deal of time in fruitless activities.
Voting on the amendments to the recitals of all the legislation, even those which merely lay down guidelines, when all is said done, makes it impossible for us to carry out our mandate.
Directives and regulations should be produced and voted upon in Parliament, but Parliament must not waste time in other sorts of debates which could be dealt with by the committees.
Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Posselt and Mrs Flesch have said about this unfortunate vote on cancelling Friday sittings here in Strasbourg.
I take the view that this violates the Treaty and violates the agreement on where Parliament sits.
I am really pleased that the ministers in the Council of Ministers and not Parliament continue to decide where Parliament sits and I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will not change that.
It is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the Treaty refers to session weeks.
Every employee in the Community, hundreds of millions of people, work a five-day week.
Once we have a four-day week for everyone else, because the self-employed already work whenever they want, then we can also say that a session week is only four days long.
I think it is a disgrace, it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I too should like to endorse the statement made by my fellow Member from the Liberal Group, Mrs Flesch.
I would like to add something further.
It is a fact that very few Members of the House are present here in Strasbourg on Friday mornings.
Nevertheless, I think it is scandalous that some Members want to prevent others from working on Friday mornings. What I find even more scandalous is that these Members think - and I have here an e-mail to this effect from Mrs van Hulten to other Members - that when the Friday sitting is removed, it would still be possible, in spite of everything, to register on Fridays, in order to receive one' s salary, even without having worked.
I urge the Bureau to be consistent and to also remove the possibility of MEPs' receiving money for Fridays on which they have not worked!
.
The current practice of moving Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg implies high costs for the European taxpayer, and reduces the effectiveness of parliamentary work.
It undermines Parliament's credibility and political impact.
The solution to this problem would be to concentrate Parliament's work at only one place.
We call upon the Member States to consider a change of the Treaty, allowing the European Parliament to decide upon its own seat.
In order to make this point we have voted for all amendments that aim to reduce the amount of time spent in Strasbourg and increase that in Brussels.
.
I have not missed one day in any of the Parliamentary sessions since the election and, I believe, only two in the previous Parliament.
It is therefore with some hesitation that I voted for the deletion of Fridays from the Strasbourg sessions.
I have come to the opinion that agendas for the Friday sessions have been engineered to fill up the session and are becoming increasingly meaningless.
It does this institution no favours when, on a Friday, there are fewer than a hundred Members debating a resolution which is of no importance.
This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions.
Mr President, I voted for the motion and I would just like to point something out: in Italy, the Schengen Agreement is not always correctly applied.
I refer, in particular, to the systematic border checks carried out by border and financial police on all those who travel from Italy to a Schengen Treaty country by aeroplane, particularly in general aviation aircraft, or what are commonly referred to as private aircraft.
According to the Schengen Agreement, there should not be any systematic checks and there should not be any obligation to present oneself to the Customs authorities or notify them that one is leaving national territory.
I therefore call upon the Commission to take action to ensure that the Schengen Agreement is respected and that the bureaucratic interference of the Italian authorities ceases.
Beysen recommendation (A5-0153/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Beyson report, but this is a classic example of what I was referring to in the vote on abolishing Friday sittings.
In this document, the European Parliament defines the categories of goods to be taken into consideration in the drawing up of statistics on products which cross the borders between one State and another, although it is not clear what purpose this will serve.
Is it so that we know how many sweets have passed from Italy into France or how many tractors have passed from Germany into Sweden, for example?
This seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for Parliament.
Since we are recording the amount of goods which cross the borders, why do we not also record how many people cross from one country to another within the European Union?
But to what end?
We must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well!
Maaten Report (A5-0156/2000)
Mr President, I am totally in favour of this report safeguarding citizens' health, the health of both active and passive smokers.
But when, in the past, have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking?
Only once, Mr President.
'And when was that?' you may ask.
In 1848, during the fight against the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Milan. In order to damage the Empire' s finances, the Milanese managed to reduce consumption of cigarettes.
There we are: we should have written, 'Smoking kills and governments are grateful for their saving in pension expenditure' .
Mr President, I voted against Amendment No 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries.
All cigarettes are harmful.
None do any good.
Smoking is an addiction, indeed a slow suicide, as we have voted, and manufacturers have admitted and known for some time that it causes cancer and other diseases.
I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards.
If we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others.
No man is an island.
All human beings are involved with each other.
I cannot condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens.
Mr President, I wanted to give an explanation of vote stating that I had abstained on much of the Maaten report.
Not because I do not share its health policy objectives, but because I really cannot understand why the Commission and this House wish to pass such detailed regulations at European level, since all they do is destroy our credibility.
When we start regulating the size, colour and position of notices and pictures on cigarette packets, then we are no longer the Europe in which I believe.
I disagree with Newton Dunn; it is not a question of double standards.
But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here.
Other regions must decide on their own regulations.
We cannot have rules which damage exports, with the result that others will then export to these regions.
I hope that we can reach agreements with the Council and the Commission here which contain clear, unequivocal health regulations, but not the sort of details which, in all conscience, we cannot decide in this House.
Mr President, this is just a brief statement to declare that I do not totally agree with the Maaten report either.
Although I am well aware that we have a duty to give consumers all the relevant information regarding the risks presented by the products they use, I do not feel that it is our duty to adopt prohibitionist laws, particularly where third countries are concerned.
The report contains excessive statements which are reminiscent of a certain type of terrorist propaganda which I do not feel would advance our awareness-raising operation, also because whenever we go to extremes in these sectors and these fields we obtain the opposite effects to those desired.
I would stress another point: I come from Italy, which is a Mediterranean country, and I would like to emphasise that the attempt to reduce subsidies for tobacco plantations is a very delicate issue. I would ask the Commission to think again for thousands of jobs are directly or indirectly jeopardised.
There are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry, which we must protect at all costs.
Mr President, I share this explanation of vote with Mrs Cauquil and Mrs Bordes.
In voting in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings and particularly despite the hypocrisy of Member States in their actions to limit smoking, we feel that we are making a stand, within the options available to us, against the right of tobacco cartels to poison the population for the sake of private profit.
The measures that are adopted should furthermore impose the same restrictions, at least on European tobacco companies, when they manufacture their products under licence, or sell their poison, in the countries of Eastern Europe, in Africa or elsewhere.
The behaviour of tobacco companies, which runs completely counter to the interests of society as a whole, mirrors the behaviour of all the large oil, asbestos, arms and agrifood companies, which are prepared to run the risk of harming the population or the environment in order to make a little more profit.
We rejected all of the amendments which sought to reduce the already very limited range of measures that have been proposed or to restrict information on the lethal effects of smoking, because they all serve the interests of the tobacco companies' lobby.
On the other hand, we support the employees in this sector, as well as small tobacco producers, whose income, as well as conversion to useful production, should be financed by levies on the enormous profits of the tobacco companies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ban on any form of television advertising for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Directive 89/552 and the more stringent labelling requirements for tobacco products introduced in this directive illustrate the ambivalent attitude of the European Union towards tobacco.
On the one hand, tobacco crops are subsidised to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year; on the other hand, we are trying to reduce the consumption of tobacco in the Union as much as possible.
This dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of Community policy.
The European Union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand.
There is an irresolvable contradiction between the promotion of tobacco cultivation, on the one hand, and the advertising ban, on the other.
If this contradiction cannot be resolved at Community level, then the Union must fight to help attain a high level of health protection by supporting a reduction in tobacco cultivation at international level.
Mr President, I have voted decidedly in favour of the amended proposal and of the legislative resolution with regard to the new tobacco directive.
It is certainly the case that the texts need to be cleaned up because we have adopted quite a few texts which, according to the rules of lawmaking, do not belong in this directive at all.
Despite this, these texts too are of value because they send out a message. They show that Parliament puts public health first.
Protecting public health is effectively our responsibility.
Even if we harmonise legislation, public health should not be compromised in any way.
Public health is not just any old interest, it is of general interest.
Today, we have proved that we stand for this, and that is how it should be.
- It was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in Parliament today.
More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990.
Despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry, including an attempt to say the process is illegal, the European Parliament will stand firm on public health.
I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling.
Health warnings will take up 40% of the front of the packet and 50% of the back.
The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes, including the tobacco, and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them.
Each individual brand should list all additives, not just the prohibited ingredients.
This must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of 'trade secrecy' .
People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco.
The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes.
We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested.
Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains.
. (EL) No one denies the harmful effects of smoking and no one can object to measures being taken to reduce smoking.
From this point of view, the Commission' s proposal for a directive contains positive provisions.
However, although there is serious doubt as to whether the Commission' s proposals will reduce consumption, they will undoubtedly have a decidedly adverse impact both on Community tobacco producers and on tobacco industries and merchants.
The amendments relating to a reduction in the consumption of tobacco products are no more than a pretext, the sole purpose of which is to reduce budgetary spending (approximately 1 billion euros a year, compared with total tax revenues in the 15 Member States of the EU from the tobacco sector of 60 billion euros a year) and, if adopted, will cause huge and irreparable social, political and financial damage to regional economies, especially in Greece.
Similarly, the abolition of the three-year derogation for the application of the directive proposed by the Commission and the application of the directive both to tobacco products consumed in the EU and to products for export to countries in which the strict provisions of the directive do not apply will cause Greece tremendous problems.
- I welcome the adoption of this report on the basis that it ensures the right to a higher level of public health protection and could potentially pave the way for the eventual eradication of tobacco addiction within the EU in the long term.
If we take the example of the Community's approach to food safety legislation, whereby legislation is based on the principle that consumers have the right to know what they are consuming, then the same principle must apply to tobacco products: smokers should have the right to know exactly what they are smoking and what the effects are.
We as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction.
The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person's health.
- (PT) The debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between Members.
We supported those proposals which, in order to protect the health of consumers, did not endanger jobs by preventing European farmers from continuing to produce tobacco and the European industry from continuing to manufacture it.
As imports are not being prohibited, the American multinationals would be the only ones to gain from a reduction in the production and manufacture of tobacco in Europe.
We therefore voted in favour of maintaining direct aid to income in the tobacco production sector within the European Union, thereby guaranteeing greater compliance with Community preference, in order to reduce the share of American multinationals in the tobacco consumption market and to protect the interests of Portuguese farmers, without public health being endangered.
We also tabled a proposal intended to protect the Portuguese brand 'PortuguÃªs Suave' as we consider that there is no reason to threaten this.
- I voted in favour of lifting the ban on sales of oral tobacco, so called snuff, in the EU.
I totally understand that all tobacco products are dangerous to human health and cause different types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
However, I think that all tobacco products, which may have different levels of harmfulness, should be treated in a way that is compatible with the level of danger they represent to human health.
I also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts.
That is why I tabled an amendment with my colleagues to do the monitoring of health effects by the year 2002 instead of 2005 which was the initial proposal from the Commission.
This proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view.
Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted.
I still think that even if the scientific data come as late as the year 2004, this information will be very important for us Members of the European Parliament, when we create future legislation in the field of tobacco products.
- (DE) I was the rapporteur in this House for the common organisation of the raw tobacco market over 30 years ago.
In the enthusiasm of youth, I hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with.
Had I been listened to then, we would not now be crying over the billions spent on raw tobacco subsidies.
However, I am not trying here to come to terms with the past.
Things are as they are and we shall have to live with them, because tobacco farmers cannot reasonably be expected to be left standing out in the rain after 30 years' common organisation of the raw tobacco market.
We have got them used to subsidies and that has, to all intents and purposes, destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco.
Now the health missionaries in the House want to stamp out the cultivation of raw tobacco in the European Union altogether; this will naturally benefit imported tobacco - which they cannot and do not want to stop - without, of course, making chain smokers give up smoking.
There is no question that a lot of people in the EU and everywhere else in the world die from lung cancer, which hits far more smokers than non-smokers.
But the sort of bans imposing unreasonable demands on the European tobacco industry which the Committee on the Environment has cobbled together with no regard for job losses, especially for women, will not make the citizens of the European Union give up smoking, as the current drastic measures in relation to advertising and labelling have already proven.
The suggestion that EU manufacturers should be required to comply with the same regulations as regards tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes intended for export to third countries is perverse in the extreme.
Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant, but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU, then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses.
Measures such as this would result in the relocation of 12% of cigarette production in the tiny principality of Luxembourg alone.
What is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the European tobacco industry.
One cannot shake off the impression that certain people in the health lobby would prefer to exile smokers altogether.
I am in favour of warnings on packets, but not in favour of a skull which takes up 60% of the surface area.
I am in favour of a targeted information campaign, especially for young people, in order to make them aware of the dangers of smoking to their health. But I am against all the exaggerations contained in this report and am therefore unable to vote in favour of the report as it stands.
- (SV) To impose a total ban on snuff in the EU, at the same time as cigarettes and other tobacco products are permitted throughout the Union, is illogical.
The ban on snuff, which applies in all EU countries except for Sweden, ought therefore to be lifted.
The advantage of snuff is that using it does not affect the environment.
While smoking causes suffering and illnesses even among people who do not smoke, especially among people with allergies, it is only the snuff taker himself who is exposed to possible ill effects.
Snuff is addictive.
The tobacco industry should not, therefore, be allowed to market snuff as something healthy.
The Marketing Directive, which will shortly be banning tobacco advertising within the EU, must be safeguarded and apply to all tobacco products.
.
EPLP Members fully support the main direction of the Maaten Report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco.
However, we believe that there are a number of technical areas which will need to be clarified following first reading in negotiation with the Commission and Council.
The question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report.
Although many Members feel it is part of the whole debate on tobacco and health and should have been included here, we believe that it would be more correctly brought up in reform of the CAP.
.
(FR) Smoking kills: it causes 500 000 deaths every year in the European Union, which is 1400 a day or almost one a minute.
One smoker in two will die, sooner or later, from a smoking-related disease.
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying.
Surely we need no further reason to support the proposed directive in its current form, quite rightly amended by our rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whom I must congratulate on his remarkable work, the broad outlines of which I have supported.
Tobacco is not just like any other product.
It requires specific regulation and it is most apt, in light of recent studies, that the Commission has proposed a revision of the legislative texts in this field.
Although it may seem naÃ¯ve to try to eradicate smoking, I think that we can certainly reduce it considerably by providing the consumer with better information.
We have just declared ourselves in favour, much to my satisfaction, of warnings that will cover 35% of the front and 45% of the back of the cigarette packet.
Personally, I am sorry that most of my colleagues could not be convinced of the impact that photographs on these surfaces would have had.
I supported Amendment No 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16.
To the anti-prohibitionists, who feel that this ban would, on the contrary, make cigarettes more attractive to young people, I would answer with an ethical argument.
Our society has the duty, in certain areas, to set strict moral limits.
It is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here.
This also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular.
Such education must be started at the earliest possible age, and I think that adolescence is an appropriate stage to instil in young people the limits that they must not transgress.
On the basis of ethical considerations, too, I feel it is reasonable to ban exports of products that we consider to be harmful to our own citizens to countries outside the Union.
I voted in the strongest possible terms against Amendment No 54.
Europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets.
During yesterday' s debate, some Members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis, Aids or other infectious diseases.
This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands.
Mr Maaten' s report is a step in the right direction, but is only one step, because the fight for life, for health, is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all.
- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of significantly stricter rules for the tobacco industry, including the proposal that as much as 40 per cent of the space on packets of tobacco products should be taken up with health warnings, compared with the 25 per cent proposed by the Commission.
We are also in favour of no longer permitting any references to 'light' or 'milder' tobacco, as well as of phasing out subsidies for tobacco cultivation within the EU as soon as possible, for this form of subsidy is directly at variance with the EU' s efforts and initiatives to improve public health.
Moreover, we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to Greece.
When it comes to the continued ban on sales of snuff to other EU countries, we Swedish Christian Democrats consider that account should be taken of the unwillingness of these countries to introduce a new product they consider to be habit-forming and destructive from a public health point of view.
Sweden ought not, in the name of free trade and the internal market, to force snuff products upon other countries and peoples if they do not want them.
In the same way, the Commission ought to have shown similar respect for Swedish alcohol policy by having extended and made permanent Sweden' s 1994 derogation concerning private imports of alcohol.
.
As Member for a tobacco-producing region, I would like to express my reservations about the proposal for a 'tobacco' directive.
Nobody questions the validity of its aims: smoking kills 500 000 people per year in the European Union alone.
We must therefore fight vigorously against smoking, just as we must fight unremittingly against drug addiction, alcoholism and all dangerous addictions, whether they are of natural or chemical origin.
In this respect, we can only share this report' s proposals, which seek more effectively to warn, make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption.
Let us even go beyond labelling or limiting toxic substances by making better use than we currently do of the special fund established under the common organisation of the market for tobacco and to which producers pay contributions in order to fund the research and development of less harmful varieties.
On the other hand, however, let us be careful not to destabilise too suddenly, without allowing time to convert, a farming sector that involves 135 000 producers and employs 400 000 seasonal workers, in often very vulnerable agricultural regions.
In this case, there are a few basic principles which I feel must guide our action: we must act fairly against all factors likely to cause addiction, such as advertising and excessive consumption of dangerous pharmacological substances - funded, moreover, from the social security system -and we must ensure that restrictions on tobacco production within the Union are accompanied by the monitoring and restriction of imports so that their effects on consumption are not cancelled out. We must give tobacco growers an adequate timescale in which to adapt their production to the new standards for tar content and we must reject any restriction on subsidies for tobacco production unless we replace them with aid as an incentive for conversion.
In other words, we must ensure that it is not only European Union producers - who supply only 25% of the raw tobacco consumed in Europe - who, without compensation or an adequate timescale, bear the costs of a regulation which is undeniably praiseworthy, but which is too sketchy in the form that has been proposed to us.
.
I wholeheartedly support amendments to the Commission's revised proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU.
The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs, with warnings 40% of the packet size on the front and 50% on the back.
Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that.
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these, half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life.
As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking.
Madam President, I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada.
If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking, go ahead and print them on packs.
I am disappointed it was not accepted.
It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation.
I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals.
They have misled people for far too long.
At present, warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging.
Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice.
The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra light' and 'low tar' .
People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild' and 'low tar' cigarettes are healthier.
This is simply not true.
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes.
This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives.
- (DE) I voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons:
The Commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar, 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries.
This would result in a massive erosion of EU cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs.
This sort of ban benefits no one, because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the EU.
But the jobs will be lost here.
The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban.
It has nothing to do with the internal single market.
The anti-tobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide.
The EU is acting inconsistently, given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of EUR 1 billion.
The EU is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world.
That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries.
The right move would be to promote the work on global uniform production standards for tobacco products already begun in the World Health Organisation.
Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless.
Berenguer Fuster report (A5-0142/2000)
Mr President, I voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding, specifically, financial activities.
But I would like to accompany this vote with two questions: firstly, who inspects the inspectors, and secondly, why does the European Parliament not extend its controls - as I would advocate - to cover all the uses to which the citizens' money is put, including the money used to finance pension funds?
The Members of the Pensioners' Party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent.
I feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection.
Lulling report (A5-0144/2000)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Lulling' s report on beer imports into Finland, but I have to say that I do not agree with these excise duties.
For my part, I would like there to be a free market.
I remember when, at the age of about 21, I worked as part of the crew of a ship which travelled between New York and the Bahamas: whenever I left the ship and ventured into New York City I was allowed to take two bottles of whisky with me, which, as I boarded the bus, would regularly be bought from me at three times the price, for whisky was much more expensive in New York.
Therefore, this trade between one State and another which was caused by different levels of duties was only natural.
If we want to avoid it, we must remove all the excise duties in the European Union.
The rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in Finland in her report, which she considers to be unreasonably high.
She also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions.
In my opinion, the Commission' s proposal is a rather good compromise, however.
According to that proposal, Finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from EU countries in stages by the end of 2003.
Imports of beer from non-member countries such as Russia and Estonia would be limited to six litres up to the year 2006.
Nowhere else on the EU' s external borders is such cheap alcohol available than in those regions that border onto Finland.
In my opinion, Finland is consequently justified in maintaining more stringent restrictions on imports than other EU countries.
Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, Internal Market policy also has to take into account considerations of public health and environmental protection.
Derogations with regard to Community legislation must be allowed if they are made on the basis of higher levels of health protection.
- (SV) Finland has been hit by serious problems in the form of a drastic increase in the amount of beer imported from third countries, mainly from Estonia and Russia.
It is therefore a very positive development that the Commission is now granting Finland a six-year derogation to enable it to introduce a new limit on beer imports from third countries.
Finland is in that way being granted the right to limit beer imports from third countries to six litres per traveller per day up until 1 January 2006.
This issue shows that, in the case of Finland, the Commission realises that private individuals' being more or less free to import alcohol across national borders is not only a trade and tax issue. More to the point, it has to do with public health and with a social policy on alcohol aimed at combating the horrors of abuse.
The Commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the Swedish derogations from 1994 concerning private imports of alcohol into Sweden. While Finland is obtaining a new derogation, the Swedish one is being removed.
In this way, the Commission, together with the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bolkestein, are drastically undermining the tools of alcohol policy, democratically decided by the Swedish parliament and government and consisting of high taxes and a restriction on imports.
Vidal-Quadras Roca report (A5-0159/2000)
Mr President, I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself voting for this report, for it represents, perhaps, the surrender of the European Union to one of the original Communities out of which it grew, namely Euratom: the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
I remember how, when I was a child, one of the books which I found most interesting and which I will never forget bore the title: 'My friend the atom' by Walt Disney. This book explained clearly how our future would be improved by the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
Sadly, today, we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about.
And who was that?
We should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible, although I still do not know who that is.
Maybe you can enlighten me, Mr President.
.
(FR) The purpose of the programme that we have been debating today is to organise the dismantling of the Joint Research Centre' s nuclear installations and the management of waste resulting from their nuclear activities.
I do not have any major disagreement with the basic proposal, but I do have questions about this programme' s budget, and the rapporteur has not provided us with any practical proposals on this.
It is true that he rejected the proposal by the European Commission.
Let us remember that the Commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using, at the end of each year, unspent appropriations from heading 3.
To this end, it would use a 'reception' line under the current sub-section B4, which covers energy, the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment.
This solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research, a point stressed by the European Parliament, but it nevertheless falls short of what is required.
We cannot accept the long-term financing of the dismantling of nuclear activities through a 'miscellaneous' line, of an order which is left to chance.
I must take this opportunity to say that I do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line!
I imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to "take note" of the Commission' s proposal, without actually putting it into practice.
The report proposes that we establish a trialogue between the institutions in order to reach a solution but says nothing about the alternative means for financing that have been suggested.
The most mistaken course of action would therefore be to have the dismantling of these nuclear activities financed by Member States, by methods that still remain to be found.
That would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem.
On the other hand, the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a self-contained budget line.
I am quite aware that it is not the easiest solution, because it involves voting for additional appropriations in the review of the Financial Perspectives.
Nevertheless, we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions, particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity.
In the long term, then, we will have to put pressure on the Council to accept the creation of this self-contained budget line.
In the shorter term, for pragmatic reasons, we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme.
I therefore support the following compromise: in the very short term we set up the 'picking up the pieces' line proposed by the Commission, and initiate the trialogue promptly in order, in the medium term, to achieve a vote for an self-contained budget line.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Special UN conference: Women 2000
The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the outcome of the special UN session on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' .
Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to tell you about the work carried out at the special UN conference assessing the 1995 Beijing Conference and its Action Platform.
The Beijing Conference was extremely important in terms of recognising women' s rights and approving an Action Platform endorsed by 189 countries. It established the content of these rights and approved instruments allowing these rights to be gradually consolidated.
As usually happens with this type of international instrument, it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed.
This assessment was carried out over many sessions with preparatory meetings initially being held within a PropCom.
These sessions made slow and sometimes difficult progress in terms of agreeing on certain aspects on which one group of countries, particularly those which are usually regarded as the most developed, considered that progress should be made. There were also some problems in terms of resistance to the language used, not in the political declaration which was approved earlier, but in the final document which was composed of four parts.
One of these parts concerned the measures and policies to be approved by governments in order to consolidate not only the Beijing Platform but also everything which has been achieved by the various countries in the meantime.
This process was relatively complex as alliances were established between certain countries, particularly from the European Union, and the South American countries with the result that the G77 broke up at a certain point. This prevented the work from being carried out at a quicker pace.
Anyway, to summarise as quickly as possible, important progress was made in recognising women' s rights as human rights. Very positive political statements were made in terms of rejecting any violations of these human rights, eradicating all practices which violate human rights, referring to the Commission on the Status of Women and the optional protocol and combating racism and violence based on racial grounds.
On the issue of violence against women, the satisfactory progress made included the agreement achieved on combating trafficking through international cooperation, with support for actions which are being developed at other levels in the international arena, and also the acceptance by all countries of public campaigns against violence based on the campaign instigated by the European Union on zero tolerance. Also discussed were the issues of poverty eradication policies, work as a factor in ensuring the economic participation of women, the essential need to adopt policies reconciling family and professional life and the need to develop access for women to education and training as a basic instrument in guaranteeing them independence.
There was also, for the first time, a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity, usually associated with the male role, and the need for job-sharing.
On health, the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health. Special references were introduced, also on the EU' s initiative, to handicapped migrant women, elderly women and native women.
The role of men was adequately emphasised, as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies.
Also addressed was the introduction of an issue which was one of the fundamental instruments in the Beijing Platform, namely mainstreaming from the gender perspective. This must be included in all mechanisms on human rights, in the UN Treaties and at the Millennium Summit and represents an extremely important achievement.
As for the methodologies for assessing the progress made by countries in applying their commitments, positive references were also made to measurable and well-established objectives resulting in the type of monitoring which allows a more objective balance to be produced, at any time, than that achieved to date.
Discussions were also held on reinforcing the role of non-governmental organisations in conducting all the policies and as privileged partners of the State in ensuring that the Platform is implemented.
The basic problems concerned what the European Union has already included in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the difficulty which some countries had in accepting the issue of sexual rights and its inherent diversity and the issue of sexual orientation.
In this context, and continuing the strategy defined at EU level of considering that this special conference was not a new conference but an intermediate phase, it was considered that, on these more delicate aspects, the language of Beijing should be used again. The EU took the decision to make a final declaration in which it reaffirmed the progress achieved and its intention to continue fighting to ensure that what for us is already a commitment, given the very constitution of the European Union and specifically Article 13, can be enshrined in future instruments.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to give you the Commission's view on the outcome of last week's extremely important conference in New York.
I want to apologise for the fact that my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, is unable to be here this afternoon.
As some of you will know, she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate.
As honourable Members will also know, she is coming to the committee next week in order to have a full exchange with Members, many of whom will, of course, have shared in the success achieved last week.
Members will be able to follow up any further details in that exchange with Commissioner Diamantopoulou next week.
I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission, by thanking the Portuguese presidency for coordinating the Member States' positions so effectively and for handling the negotiations with other delegations so proficiently under what I understand were occasionally extremely difficult conditions.
We should also thank Parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session.
Members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities made an extremely valuable contribution as part of the delegation.
However, beyond that, they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the Member States and from associated countries.
That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination.
We in the Commission also very much welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution: it is a firm, constructive statement of Parliament's commitment to gender equality.
The European Union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at New York.
Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing.
If we succeeded, it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions.
And succeed, I think we can say, we certainly did!
In a number of areas the outcome document goes far beyond what was achieved five years ago at Beijing - a conference which I remember observing from slightly closer than would have been the case today.
We managed that without having to concede any watering down of the Beijing Platform in other areas.
The document reaffirms women's rights as human rights.
It urges all UN members to sign the CEDAW optional protocol and calls for a strong awareness of gender issues in the workings of the International Criminal Court.
It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds.
While we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the EC Treaty, the presidency made the European Union position clear in a final statement before the General Assembly.
We have new, much clearer language on the state's duty to end violence against women, including domestic violence, and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women.
The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity.
If women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty.
It seems to me, with some responsibilities in this field, inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart.
The document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women.
It also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women, including work in the home, and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments.
It also has something to say on methodology - how, in other words, to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice.
At the European Union's insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators.
Lastly, we welcome the reference to men's role in bringing about greater gender equality for they clearly have a considerable responsibility as well.
The Union is better equipped than ever to deliver on its Beijing commitments with its stronger stand on human rights, gender equality and discrimination.
The Amsterdam Treaty gives the Union increased scope to push ahead with implementation of the Beijing platform for action.
I hope nobody will doubt the Commission's determination to do precisely that.
The effort is of course led by my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but it is an endeavour in which all of us as Commissioners wish to be fully involved.
Mr President, I thank the Commission, the presidency and all my fellow delegates for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed and which has greatly impacted on the conference.
The conference has shown that, over the past couple of years, we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas.
For example, women are taking part in peace talks, improvement has been made in the field of women' s health problems, employment for women has improved in a number of countries and violence towards women has been put on the agenda in a number of countries.
As such, we can trace the progress that has been made, although new problems have emerged in the meantime, of course.
I am thinking of the problem of AIDS in women. In some African towns and cities, up to 40% of pregnant women suffer from AIDS.
There is also the problem of trafficking in women, rape of women during armed conflicts, etc. Consequently, Beijing +5 could not afford to just focus on the progress that was made in respect of decisions taken at Beijing.
Beijing +5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text, which it did, after a hard fight.
In my opinion, we have three tasks within the European Union.
Firstly, as a European Union, we should remain the driving force behind the Member States.
We played this role very distinctly in the past and we must continue to do so in future.
It will be evident from the Fifth Action Programme and the financial resources used for this purpose whether the European Commission is serious about applying the Beijing Platform in years to come.
But it is not only vis-Ã -vis our own Member States that we have a role to play, we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries, those which we as MEPs have brought together in New York.
We have proposed to continue the cooperation with them and asked the Commission, during the screening activities it carries out in the context of the acquis communautaire, to assess the achievements with regard to the Beijing Platform too.
We also have a role to play vis-Ã -vis third countries.
It is dreadful to have to listen to the problems which women face in third countries: genital mutilation, killing if they have been unfaithful or if they had sexual relations before marriage and all these kinds of problems.
It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women.
In my opinion, the aid which the European Union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women.
Finally, I would like to make it clear that I am a Catholic, but an open-minded Catholic.
I was greatly shocked by the news that the Church which I belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society.
It was shocking, mainly because my Church offers so few opportunities to women within its own structures.
Mr President, the European Union brought women' s rights throughout the world to the fore in New York.
They were tough negotiations, which is why the Portuguese Presidency deserves special thanks for speaking not only on behalf of the 15 Member States, but also on behalf of the associated countries, with the exception of Poland, as do the Commission and the Commissioner and her negotiators, who worked together with the Parliament delegation in an exemplary manner.
That is most unusual, so here too special thanks.
And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union.
Our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas.
At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York.
As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that.
But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women' s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned.
We now have specific measures in place in many countries to combat the cruel practice of genital mutilation, the issue of HIV/AIDS was addressed and the role of women in the peace process, ignored hitherto, was recognised as an issue.
The fight against violence was put on every country' s agenda.
Access to capital, the role of men - very important, we would like to see more men taking part in the process - still need to be promoted.
We tabled our document, our report, in New York as an official UN document, another major success.
I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union, Parliament' s progress, are now accessible to every country.
We were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform.
We came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women' s rights.
We want to have a parliamentarians' conference in two years to review Beijing.
We insist on another world women' s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues.
We must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming, equal opportunities for men and women, stars on the world political agenda.
It is in our interest to fight for this.
I think, and this is my personal opinion, that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in Eastern Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I am pleased with the outcome of the Special UN Conference on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' .
In my opinion, all credit for this follow-on from Beijing +5, where the implementation of the action plans was discussed, should go to the NGOs, but also to the European Parliament, which was represented by five strong women, and naturally the European Commission, which, in the form of Mrs Diamontopoulou, was 100% committed to this conference.
Progress has been made, that is for sure, as has already been mentioned by previous speakers.
The distribution in care, actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me.
I am pleased that the participating countries still subscribe to the Beijing Declaration and the action plan.
It is nonetheless unfortunate that only eight countries in the world have managed to meet the essential obligations which follow on from these with regard to equality in education, paid work and a minimum representation of 30% in national parliaments.
It naturally gives me pleasure to be able to say that the Netherlands is one of them, although I am not entirely satisfied with its emancipation policy, or rather, the lack of it, and that Germany, the Scandinavian countries and South Africa too belong to the eight.
But back to Europe.
In my opinion, it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education.
This development merits particular attention from us in the European Parliament.
Not only is education the best way to obtain gender equality, it is also the quickest way and the only way if we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren will not still be grappling with these issues.
We should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation.
The other point I wanted to raise is the opposition from the Islamic and Asian countries with regard to women' s rights, in connection with which they refer to the sharia.
I find it downright disgraceful that we women cannot join forces across the world.
I would ask you to give attention to this.
It is not just the Islamic and Asian countries to which this applies, but also Poland, for example.
Finally, I would like to ask you, as I do not have any hard facts at my disposal regarding the acceding countries, whether it would be possible to analyse the status quo in the candidate countries, ideally as soon as possible so that we can assess whether the situation there has improved.
Finally, I would call for the NGOs, in particular, to be given a key role, because it is they who are promoting awareness, and this is something which needs to be done not only among women, but also among men.
They need to be involved in this process.
At the end of the day, we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions.
Mr President, I am not now asking for an extra minute in the name of equality, however; I shall try to keep to two minutes.
I will join that group of people who just said that real progress was made on many issues at the New York Conference.
Women' s human rights, the trade in women, violence against women, women' s economic rights, the status of civil society: we may be pleased about the progress that has been made in all these issues.
It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that.
We were there as observers, but it is to be hoped that we were also able to influence the way the talks went - at least in some respect.
It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal' s leadership.
This is a promising sign that we will also be able to strengthen legislation on equality within the context of the European Union.
I myself do not remember seeing such single-mindedness, and for that thanks go to the chairman and, obviously, the Commission as well.
The only exception among the candidate countries was Poland, which was not at all interested in supporting the strengthening of women' s rights in the same way as the Member States of the European Union and the other candidate countries.
I would appeal to Commissioner Patten that when enlargement negotiations are being conducted, serious attention be paid to Poland' s compliance with EU legislation on equality and its recognition of women' s rights.
I also think that greater attention must be paid to women' s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries, as it is there that glaring violations of human rights, particularly in respect of women, take place.
I believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years' time.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Presidency.
I did not participate directly in the New York conference, but the reports I have heard, from participants and in other ways, have really praised the European Union as being very much a motor of progressive change.
I think that, happily enough, we can declare the Beijing platform for action a success.
If there is anything which really has had a very secure foundation, it is very much this platform that has been adopted. We saw this from the assessment, showing a host of committed women around the world working not only on a small scale but also on an extremely large scale where, for example, violence against women is concerned.
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet.
I do not belong to any church and come from a country which has now also separated the Church from the State.
I want to thank all practising Catholics who are dissociating themselves from the Vatican State, which is behaving as it is.
If we cannot enter into dialogue with the Vatican State in the future, we shall probably have to question its basis for existence.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the Assembly of the United Nations has once again offered an opportunity to demonstrate the progress made since the Beijing Conference, as well as the problems which remain and which need to be resolved.
Education is still the most effective instrument for ensuring that women can freely exercise their rights and for allowing greater access to positions of responsibility, both in the workplace and in public life.
Knowledge of new technologies has been considered to be of great importance in terms of allowing full participation in the society of the future.
The media is of enormous importance as it can allow women' s voices to be heard, and can transmit an image, without stereotypes, which is committed to society and the quest for solutions to everyday problems.
Women' s health is one of the priorities of the meeting' s final document, with special mention of the spread of Aids, especially in certain areas of the planet, which affects women in a particular way and requires special measures for prevention and treatment.
One of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence, which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation.
Violence against women and girls will be punishable by law, which means that there will have to be legislative reforms in the countries where it is not yet considered a crime.
Poverty particularly affecting women must be eradicated, and this is why the countries which have signed the agreement will send 0.7% of their GDP to development programmes aimed at eliminating what has come to be called the feminisation of poverty.
Globalisation has generated new problems which particularly affect women, such as trafficking in human beings, prostitution and drug-trafficking, which should be combated so that women may live a dignified and free life in conditions of equality.
All these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and, in order to ensure they are complied with, we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years.
The fifth programme for equality promoted by the European Commission must serve to promote the position of women, to eliminate the remaining inequalities, integrating gender policies into all Community programmes.
This meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world.
The European Union' s position, given that it has a higher level of development and, therefore, better conditions for women, must not allow us to forget the situation of women in other areas, where daily hardships are combined with malnutrition, extreme poverty and a complete lack of respect for their fundamental rights.
Mr President, I want to thank the Council of Ministers and the Commission for their respective interventions.
The Women' s Conference at the UN in New York came perilously close to failing.
A small group of Catholic and Islamic fundamentalist countries clearly intended to undermine the progress achieved by women from around the world in Beijing five years ago.
The issues which created the most problems were women' s rights to sex education, free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS.
These issues united certain Islamic and Catholic countries ranging all the way from the Sudan, Iran and Libya to the Vatican, Nicaragua and Poland, which were prime movers in the fight against these rights.
Some countries attempted to quash wordings about governments' responsibility to protect women from various forms of violence.
In spite of the fact that, last week, we were in danger of turning the clock back, we eventually agreed upon a final document which looks ahead to progress on the basis of the Women' s Conference in Beijing and, at the same time, marks out the route towards increased equality in the future.
I should like to point out that the Presidency of the EU, especially the minister Mrs De BelÃ©m Roseira, actively contributed to a successful final outcome, something we would thank her for.
The final document embodies progress in certain respects.
Forced marriages and murders committed for reasons of honour are mentioned for the first time in an agreed international document.
On the issues of rape within marriage, right of possession and right of inheritance, together with the right to asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, the wordings have been strengthened.
Women' s right to equal participation in macro-economic decision-making, together with the allocation of quotas with a view to increasing women' s participation in political parties and parliaments are other matters which are being taken up.
The resolution we are to vote on demands that the institutions of the EU, Member States and candidate States make active efforts to turn the final document from Beijing +5 into a reality.
It is especially important that all candidate States, including Poland, undertake to abide by the EU' s policy on women' s rights.
What are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation.
Mr President, the Beijing +5 Conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the Beijing 1995 action programme.
The women' s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths.
This became clear in New York when Islamic fundamentalists attacked what, in recent years, has characterised women' s demands: an end to domestic rape and violence, an end to the right for men to commit crimes passionnelles and an end to female circumcision.
However, it must, of course, be appreciated - as Commissioner Patten said, moreover - that the Conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women' s rights as human rights.
However, similar positions on sexual rights, sexual health and the self-determination of women have caused an unholy alliance - evident at Beijing - to be formed between Christian and Islamic fundamentalists, including the Vatican, Poland, Nicaragua and a number of Islamic countries.
Furthermore, I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference, and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings, but that there was an absence of tangible, verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty.
I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs.
Mr President, the very positive assessment that we are making today of the meeting in New York, should not allow us to forget that there have been serious deficiencies and great hypocrisy, even within the European Union, which make me want to double my efforts from now on.
An example of this, and this is an appeal to the Council, is the issue of wage discrimination.
It has been demonstrated that, compared to men doing the same work, women receive 50 or up to 80 per cent less. This is not in our legislation.
Nevertheless, it appears that the European Union approves of it.
I wonder if the Portuguese Presidency, before the end of its mandate, could make a recommendation in this respect.
It also seemed extremely important to me, Mr Patten, that in the meeting in New York, when the policy of microcredits was discussed - loans to certain women so that they may be given access to financial autonomy - the countries recognised that these programmes of microcredits had been a complete success.
Why does the Commission and the European Union, given such a positive assessment, not implement these programmes so that the European Union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies?
Please answer me, Mr Patten.
Mr President, the European Parliament' s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries.
Our work has been outstanding in this respect.
I do have reservations with regard to Poland, but precisely because Parliament' s delegation played such a significant role.
Mr Varaut, you are very badly informed. You have made a fool of yourself.
You were not in New York, but I was.
Your information is not accurate. It is not even true.
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false.
I have to refute what you have said because none of it is true.
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, in particular Minister Maria de BelÃ©m, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, for their guidance and coordination work both at the preparatory stage and during the Conference, for this allowed the European Union to make a substantial contribution to the production of the final document.
It has already been said many times: the work carried out by the UN and in New York has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since Beijing.
Women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society' s resources.
The need to continue the fight against all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability and sexual orientation, which are still rife throughout the world, has become clear.
The need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies, from employment to development, from social policies to the fight against violence.
There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women' s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions.
A number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the European Union, particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy.
In this regard, I would like to draw Commissioner Patten' s attention to the Commission' s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with Mediterranean countries.
Poverty affects women more than anybody else.
Therefore, we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development.
If globalisation is to provide new opportunities, it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people, globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities.
Development must be regarded as a project to expand the freedoms which all human beings have the right to enjoy.
Therefore, the need for recognition of rights without any discrimination must be a priority both for us and for the international organisations.
Mr President, the World Conference on Women, which was held five years ago, meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women' s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment.
In contrast to this, I have mixed feelings about the UN Conference which was held in New York last week.
On the one hand, it was confirmed that it is up to governments to guarantee equal rights for women and to pursue sound emancipation policy, and, despite many people' s fears, no retrograde steps were taken.
On the other hand, it was once again impossible to reach agreement on sensitive issues which had not been resolved at Beijing, such as the recognition of the right to self-determination for women in their personal life, including their free choice in pregnancy and sexual behaviour or sexual preference.
This is greatly disappointing.
Actual equality and freedom for women is only possible if all options are open to them and if the traditional family image is not held up to them as the only true one.
Resistance of the kind displayed by governments, diplomats and officials last week, is a form of rearguard action, however.
It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes.
The fight goes on.
The true inspiration which I gained from last week' s conference in New York lay in the power of the international women' s movement which, contrary to popular belief, is as vigorous and alive as ever and is also bolstered by a new generation of young women who, strong and well-informed, stand up for all kinds of issues.
The European Union and Member State representatives showed great commitment during the Conference to the issue of sexual self-determination for women and the non-discrimination principle pursuant to Article 13.
The fact that this did not end up in the final document should not be a reflection on them.
What can, however, be expected of the Council and Commission, is that they put their money where their mouths are in their respective Chambers.
In addition to what we obtained last week, namely reparative legislation on equality in work and professional life, they should produce new additional legislation to prevent sex discrimination across the entire range of social life.
Article 13 offers the opportunity to do so and the Beijing +5 Conference issued an instruction to this effect.
Surely a European Union which, at international conferences, is full of rhetoric on banishing sex discrimination should set about developing effective policy instruments which can attain this goal at the level of the Union itself.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Many friends and women who are colleagues in this Parliament have just pointed out that my name appears as one of those who signed against women's rights.
I want to put on record that I am not against women's rights.
I have always supported women's rights.
It must be an error.
Sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them.
I am sorry about that.
That was not a point of order, Mr Khanbhai.
You mentioned a matter which has not been raised by anyone. There has been no reference during the debate either to your name or to a list of reprobates.
I really do not know what you are talking about.
President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will understand the pride I feel as a Portuguese national at the general acclaim for the Portuguese Presidency' s excellent work in promoting equal rights for women during its term and particularly with regard to the special UN conference on Beijing+5.
The conferences on violence against women, trafficking of women and reconciling family and professional life, together with the UN conference on Beijing+5, are clear examples of the Portuguese Presidency' s involvement in this area.
Anyone at the UN last week, like myself, would know that, in the end, we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document. The difficulties were immense.
I feel that it was both the work of the Presidency and the Commission and the involvement of all the female Members of this House who were there, and who joined with the national MPs of the Fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of Poland, which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work.
Finally, I must say that the European Union has a decisive role to play in this issue.
We must lead the way in defending women' s rights and we must continue the work in this respect. The resolution approved by the European Parliament was greatly appreciated in the UN.
I must thank the President-in-Office for having come directly from Canada to Strasbourg so as not to miss this meeting which is so important to us. I know that, since Monday of last week, she has been constantly dealing with women' s issues both in the USA and in Canada.
Mr President, I must thank the Members for all their compliments on the Presidency' s work. I must also say very sincerely and with immense gratitude that the conduct of this work in this way was only possible because we all - the Presidency, the Commission, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations - cooperated together.
This was also possible because the bilateral contacts which we each maintain, by working hard at them and thereby multiplying their effectiveness, were vital in the end result.
I am extremely grateful to everyone for this.
When I spoke, it was clearly on behalf of all the Member States of the European Union and of all the applicant countries except for Poland.
In the contacts established with Poland, it has been made very clear that accession cannot be exchanged for non-recognition of women' s rights.
The European Union could not take any other position on such an issue. Women will no longer accept their fundamental rights being regarded as a bargaining chip for political issues.
Europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area.
These must be achieved through cooperation, particularly with all like-minded countries, some of which, like Canada, are totally committed to the Presidency' s statement presented at the end of the special conference.
We must take advantage of all these opportunities.
These developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the Lisbon Special Summit, which considered that in Europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion.
In this way the European Union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing, measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made.
I referred to the Portuguese Presidency' s work on the issue of discrimination in the European Union. Portugal is also very pleased that, in the last Social Affairs and Employment Council, a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life.
Women are constantly being penalised because the time that they devote to family life gives employers objective reasons to discriminate against them in wage terms.
Therefore, in my opinion, we have already achieved what was asked of us.
Finally, I must thank the President and the whole House for your kindness and the comments which you have made, and I also thank the Commission for its support.
The Portuguese Presidency is now coming to an end and sincerely hopes that the subsequent French and Swedish Presidencies will continue the work which we have together managed to achieve so that they represent the next stage in the consolidation of women' s rights.
Thank you, President of the Council. We all share this hope.
The debate is closed.
I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, following the intervention by my colleague in seat No 662, here, in Parliament, I have asked for the floor on a point of order because this fellow Member has obviously fallen victim to misinformation or to a misunderstanding.
In fact, the Members of the European Parliament who were in New York as part of the European Union delegation, which comprised 15 people with observer status, were not allowed to speak because, in accordance with the UN' s procedure for extraordinary general assemblies, the Portuguese Presidency spoke on behalf of the European Union.
The Commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session.
Even in the working parties, we were not allowed to take the floor, which was always given to the Portuguese Presidency.
Do not, therefore, put words into the mouths of the Members of this Parliament who were in New York.
In no instance did we speak in an official capacity, still less on behalf of this Parliament, although we did have some useful discussions with the Commission and the Council, with Members of the Parliaments of Member States and associated States, who allowed us to convey our views.
What were banned from these meetings were the positions that Parliament adopted under the Smet/GrÃ¶ner report, and nothing else.
Mr President, Poland' s name has been bandied about a great deal, so I must say that we simply stated that Poland is accepting the acquis communautaire.
If Poland tells us that it is free...
(The President cut the speaker off) I do wish to point out that a fellow Member has accused us, Mr President, and I must be entitled to correct this, otherwise this is not a genuine Parliament.
You may hear my explanation of vote tomorrow, Mr President, if you are going to cut me off.
Mrs Lulling, we have already heard speeches on the matter from the President of the Council and from the Commissioner on the subject of Poland.
You were speaking about a point of order.
Mr Izquierdo Rojo had already replied to Mr Varaut and therefore, Mrs Lulling, you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue.
You have, of course, prompted Mr Varaut to ask to take the floor for personal reasons.
You are quite right, Mr President.
In short, I agree completely with the need for a full debate in this Chamber, even if we do not all agree.
Next, having heard what most of the speakers said on the issue of Poland, I am left in no doubt as to many of the things said in corridors and about the pressure of which I was informed, which was brought to bear on the representatives of Poland, a free State.
To conclude, I have heard many things said about the Vatican, but I can see that Jesuitical thinking, at least, has truly pervaded the European Parliament.
Mr Varaut, we cannot base our debates on corridor conversations.
These are not reliable sources of information and are not available simultaneously to all Members in all languages.
The corridors are there specifically for private, informal conversations, not official debates.
Tunisia - Human rights - EU-Tunisia Agreement
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Da Costa, we are approaching this debate, as we approached the questions we put to the Council and the Commission, aware of the responsibility entailed in our partnership relationship with Tunisia, which we consider will be decisive for the success of the entire Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
In fact, Tunisia is the first country with which the European Union signed an Association Agreement within the context of the 1995 Barcelona Process.
We attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this Agreement, and I would like to make it quite clear that, as far as we are concerned, there is no question about this.
On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region' s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb.
We do not, therefore, intend to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country at all, and it will be more useful if today' s debate serves to bring about renewed commitment on both sides to the values and undertakings entailed in our partnership.
However, in all honesty, I must also say that we are extremely concerned about the human rights situation in this country, particularly because we are convinced that, given the socio-economic and cultural context involved, there is the possibility for substantial improvement in the degree of freedom of the press, of speech, of association and of movement, conditions in prisons and the autonomous exercising of justice, so that the country can move towards full expression of the rule of law.
And this is the moment to do so.
This is why we call upon the Commission and the Council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the Tunisian authorities.
We must not forget that the creation of a free trade area is not the sole objective of the partnership policy, nor, moreover, that the partnership does not just consist of an exclusive relationship between the governments but has to ensure support and due respect for civil society, for the autonomous associations which uphold human rights and freedoms and for the role of women, whose lives in this country are full of sacrifices and who are often at great risk and undergo indescribable suffering.
For our part, we must prove that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is a priority for the Union as a whole and that it is not based on the egotism of those of us who are motivated by the desire to conquer new markets for our goods or obtain cheap labour for our businesses.
It is also based on shared values, on respect for cultural, religious and linguistic differences, and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire Mediterranean area.
Today, may this debate serve to remind us and our partners of all these things.
Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia?
Is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys?
Is it because of the political links with France or the European socialists?
Or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the Middle East?
Or do we see Tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism?
At any rate, President Ali only has the religious fanatics in mind.
He seems to be obsessed by them.
But this concern is more of an alibi than a justification for the human rights situation in his country.
Not only Muslim fundamentalists, but all political opponents are systematically silenced.
Tunisia calls itself a democracy, a democracy without opposition that is, without freedom of the press, without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families.
Tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the European Union which contains a clear human rights clause.
There can, of course, be no question of President Ben Ali' s claiming rights under the agreement but shirking his obligations under it.
If the violations continue, the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended.
Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there?
Tunisia is the first Mediterranean Sea partner with which this association agreement has been concluded.
Given its economic development, it can act as a model for the entire region, but it should then, of course, meet the political criteria.
The European Union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another.
The Association Council must, therefore, look into the human rights situation as a matter of great urgency and draft a democratisation programme.
If the European Union keeps quiet any longer, it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in Tunisia.
Mr President, in March, the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which I am vice-chairman, made a visit to Tunisia, where we observed that, while there has been undeniable economic progress, there exists a democratic deficit in the field of freedoms, particularly in the area of the press and the audiovisual media.
We were also able to observe - and I think this should be stressed - that the Tunisian authorities are aware of this deficit, which they justified time and time again through the need to temper their political openness in accordance with their particular idiosyncrasies and culture as well as the danger to Tunisian society of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism.
They therefore asked for understanding and patience.
I must say that the Tunisian Government has made gestures which indicate goodwill. They made these gestures during our visit and this is reflected in the report which the delegation has presented to Parliament.
In the view of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats and European Democrats), we are therefore holding a debate which is necessary but which should not take the form of an exaggerated and alarmist condemnation, which is often what happens, but which should recognise certain facts which concern us because they affect the areas covered in the association agreement, such as the respect for human rights and democratic principles. This issue must be resolved by means of political and social dialogue, and an effort on the part of the Tunisian Government to implement legislation which will guarantee political pluralism in a real sense and not in a purely formal sense and, above all, provide the necessary freedom so that the citizens can express their opinions and the media can reflect them.
This is the message which this House must send to the Tunisian authorities, who must receive them in the positive light in which they are intended.
To this end, within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must not go into reverse with regard to the aid programmes which must be implemented within the framework of MEDA II.
Education and training in democratic principles are a fundamental element of sustaining a plural and democratic society.
Young people, judges, the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend.
This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate.
It also concerns me that Commissioner Patten, who is present, is not sufficiently sensitive to the serious problems currently faced on the southern side of the Mediterranean, where Tunisia plays a very important role.
Emigration, fundamentalism, poverty and political instability cannot be resolved by pronouncements and good intentions alone.
We need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice.
In any event - and this could serve as a summary of the debate - we cannot restrict our cooperation with third countries to purely trade and economic issues.
To this end, we also ask Tunisia, together with economic reforms, also to make progress with political reforms aimed at guaranteeing freedoms, but with the aid and cooperation which, of course, they receive and will continue to receive from us, at least from my Group.
We also believe that we need a common strategy in the Mediterranean, as the resolution states, and that, together with political, social and security aspects, special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension.
This is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society.
As we say in my country, By talking we come to understand people' .
If one thing characterises the people of the Mediterranean, it is the wealth of their thought and their words, and that, ladies and gentlemen, costs very little.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we start to examine an issue like this we should remind ourselves of the European Union' s general attitude to its external relations.
The EU has a set of values and principles which it naturally tries to promote in its relations and which it tries to use in all areas of its associations with third countries.
Contrary to what may be inferred from one honourable Member' s intervention, the European Union does not act according to geographical position by being more demanding on countries which are closer and less demanding on countries which are further away.
We do not work in this way.
We usually use uniform criteria and, in particular, the idea that it is preferable to open areas for dialogue in order to encourage countries to make regular bilateral assessments of what is causing exclusion factors or misunderstandings.
In this respect, the work of the Council and Commission is totally coherent. In particular, and I do not really need to say this, Commissioner Patten has more credentials than most of us on the issue of respect for human rights.
On the specific issue of Tunisia, I must say that the Council is fully aware of the human rights situation in this country. It has noted all the concerns expressed on various occasions by this House.
Naturally, it has also noted the considerable concerns expressed here today.
The Council has on several occasions emphasised to the Tunisian authorities its concern about the occurrence of certain situations, particularly the lack of general freedom and press freedom in particular.
Human rights issues are frequently discussed, as the speakers have noted, within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area.
At the moment this dialogue is centred specifically on the current reforms of the new press law, the operation and functions of the penalty enforcement judge and the amendments of electoral law.
The possibility of such a dialogue, which Tunisia did refuse for some time, represents significant progress.
During the two meetings of the Association Council which took place as part of our relations with Tunisia and which I attended, the Council reiterated the fundamental importance to relations between the European Union and Tunisia of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, naturally, it used the opportunity to highlight certain specific cases, some of which have been mentioned here.
On a more national note, during the State visit by President Ben Ali to Portugal at the beginning of May, the Foreign Minister, Jaime Gama, had the opportunity to raise with his Tunisian counterpart the human rights situation in Tunisia and in particular the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick. He underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms.
We realise that any kind of action in terms of political pressure can have advantages where carried out through the media.
We believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions.
However, the Council prefers to use the opportunities for influencing the Tunisian authorities more discreetly, and perhaps more effectively, by maintaining constructive pressure on them through political dialogue and various meetings at different levels.
We do not consider it appropriate to initiate the procedures needed to suspend the Association Agreement or to convene an extraordinary session of the Association Council which would probably be reported in the media but which would have no practical effect in specific terms.
Maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far, when and if appropriate, is the right way to proceed in this context.
Despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise, we must accept that there have been positive results.
We cannot ignore, and it would be politically incorrect to so do, the gestures of openness already made by Tunisia, particularly in freeing 600 political prisoners, returning passports to certain members of the opposition and being clearly willing to reduce tensions in the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick, and accepting his specific claims.
The Commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in Tunisia through the MEDA programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect.
Finally, in the Barcelona Declaration, Tunisia, like the other Mediterranean partner countries, signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Within the EU-Mediterranean framework and in reinforcing this framework as we are trying to do at the moment in close cooperation with the European Commission, we are also insisting on the importance of actively promoting the rule of law and the good management of public affairs which constitutes a key area in the dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean.
To conclude, I must assure you that the Council remains committed to promoting and reinforcing in Tunisia, as in other countries with which the EU maintains relations, respect for human rights, democratic principles and fundamental freedoms, and to establishing a true democracy with an open civil society based on a rule of law.
A measured policy is, in our opinion, the best way to achieve these objectives.
The Council will continue to pursue discreet but firm diplomacy and will continue its policy of encouraging all forms of progress towards democracy and the rule of law.
I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters.
As a number of honourable Members have noted, Mr Taoufik Ben Brik's hunger strike is over, but it has had a major impact both on the authorities in Tunisia and on civil society.
It sparked a public debate in Tunisia on the human rights situation in that country.
I want to make it clear that the Commission shares the view of the UN Special Rapporteur who states in his report to the Commission on Human Rights that: "Tunisia still has a long way to go to take full advantage of its favourable economic context and adopt measures designed to strengthen the protection of human rights and, in particular, the right to freedom of opinion and expression".
But how can the Commission and the European Union in general influence Tunisia's rate of progress in this area?
This is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the European Union to Tunisia.
The first, to which my colleague referred, is political dialogue.
This dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on Tunisia's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two Association Councils that have taken place to date.
The Union has made a point of addressing the human rights issues in Tunisia in our many contacts with the Tunisian authorities.
The second instrument is the financing of positive measures in the form of grants from the Community budget for projects promoting the exercise of political and civil rights.
The MEDA programme for democracy, on which Parliament has strong and positive views, has financed training, information and awareness-raising projects for NGOs and for public opinion in this field.
A programme of support for the Tunisian media has already been included in the programming of future financial cooperation with Tunisia and should be the subject of necessary consultations with the Tunisian Government.
As Mr Dupuis reminded us, sustainable economic development and political stability depend, above all, from Russia to the Mediterranean, on strong institutions, not on strong men.
It sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law.
The third instrument is the European Union's option of adopting restrictive measures, the most radical of which would obviously be the suspension of cooperation.
The Commission considers that, before having recourse to any restrictive measures, positive means offered by the partnership should be pursued to the limit.
There is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes.
I would like to explore this further with Tunisia.
Specifically, the Commission wishes to see to what extent the Tunisian Government will implement its promises regarding reform of the press code and facilitating freedom of association.
We also wish to see if our efforts to support the desired reforms by providing funding from the Community budget prove successful.
I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas.
The issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important.
I know that Parliament is aware of the whole picture.
Mrs Napoletano, in her interesting address, pointed out the economic and social progress that has been made in Tunisia.
Others could have referred, for example, to the position of Tunisia on the sharia law.
Nevertheless, there are issues which give considerable cause for concern.
It is best at the moment to proceed by dialogue but, as the House will understand, I do not equate dialogue with being supine.
Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view.
That can be expressed firmly but courteously, as Parliament is doing today.
I want to put the debate on Tunisia in context and to take up a point that was made by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar and some other honourable Members as well.
Of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us.
Today, inevitably, we have to give a good deal of attention to our efforts to rebuilding in the Balkans and, in particular, to prevent further social and political disintegration.
It is a policy in south-east Europe which, I should add, is not irrelevant to stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean.
But if I have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term, it would be, to be candid, our policy in and around the Mediterranean.
What is at the heart of the Union's common foreign and security policy?
It is the projection of stability.
That is the crucial element in our policy in the Mediterranean.
What are we trying to do there?
It is true that we are trying to create, if you like, the Mediterranean equivalent of NAFTA.
But there is more than that, which I will come to in a moment.
I just want to make it clear to the honourable Member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total.
One of the things that most offends me at the moment is that our record in supporting it through development assistance is not nearly as good as it should have been.
For year after year we have only been able to spend 40% or less of what we have committed in the Mediterranean, partly because of absorption problems in the region, partly because of our own failures, which I am keen to address.
I will make this bargain with the honourable Member: if, by the time I leave my job as a commissioner in 2005, our record in closing the gap between commitments and payments is not a hell of a lot better than it has been in the last three years then he can have a contribution to his favourite charity.
That is what I would like to be taken as a mark of whether or not we are committed to making a success of our policy in the Mediterranean.
It is extremely important that we use our existing instruments much more competently, much more effectively.
That is what I would like to be judged on.
I want to repeat: this is not just about creating a free trade area, important as that may be.
Free trade is not the end; free trade is a means to an end.
The end is the creation of an area of prosperity and political stability to the south of the sea that we have shared with North Africa and the Middle East for all these millennia; it is about the sharing of values, as well as the sharing of trade.
It is not about creating hub economies which will make Europeans more prosperous: it is about working in partnership with Mediterranean countries in a partnership of values as well as trade, for the good of people to the south of the Mediterranean as well as those of us in Europe.
