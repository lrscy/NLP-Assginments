That is something we have done within the framework of the OSCD for many years, but the difference between OSCD reports and the open coordination we undertake within the framework of the EU is - and, in my view, should be - that open coordination is more binding and that the countries in actual fact undertake to pursue the common objectives.
In addition, the parties concerned are very actively involved.
I think it would be wrong of us to allow the use of open coordination to escalate to the point of its being used in every possible area.
It is of course a basic principle of EU cooperation that we accept diversity and difference.
It is an advantage that we have many different models so that we can learn from each other.
We must not sneak harmonisation in through the back door in areas where national competence should clearly apply.
That is not something for which we would be thanked.
In the health sphere, there are many areas in which cooperation and common rules are important and necessary, and there are therefore clear rules about this in the Treaty.
Cooperation will develop via the internal market, as a result of that internal market and through other cooperation, such as cooperation on research. As for a common EU policy on residential homes, however, my response is no thank you.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions of the European Union and of the Member States need to pay special attention to health care and in particular to care for the elderly, because health is a fundamental human and social right recognised in international and national legislation.
So it is important to give absolute priority to policies and measures based on an integrated approach which aim to promote health, ensure primary prevention, eliminate health risks, include a high level of health protection and which define and implement sectoral policies designed to eliminate health inequality.
It is also worth highlighting the close relationship between socio-economic measures and health, particularly in the fields of employment, housing, education, transport, income distribution and social welfare.
The emphasis placed on monetary policies, on giving priority to nominal convergence and on maintaining the blinkered criteria of the Stability Pact is leading to restrictive social policies and being used to justify such policies, and it is having a negative impact on public health policies and on health care for the elderly, as has become clear in Portugal.
The Commission communication on this subject, which the report welcomes despite some occasional criticisms, is indicative of the contradictions in social policies.
Despite statements about defending the quality and accessibility of health care, too much weight is given to the objective of achieving financial viability with a view to establishing an internal market in health services and products. This could lead to the liberalisation and privatisation of an essential public service, which health certainly is, whilst ultimately jeopardising equality of access to high-quality health services.
This is an untenable position and it is the main reason why we intend to reject the report before us if it is not revised on this key point, and if the amendments that we are tabling are not approved.
These amendments advocate better quality health services, security and solidarity, and propose new means of financing statutory retirement schemes with a view in particular to extending social welfare contributions to all income, at a rate identical to that levied on wages and salaries.
The challenge here therefore remains that of achieving some coherence amongst those who say that they are committed to defending health care and care for the elderly.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity for debate on this report, on what is an important issue for all our countries.
I am grateful to Mr Mantovani for his work.
Caring for the ageing population throughout Europe will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Member States in the future.
Although, as has already been said, the organisation of health care is a matter reserved for Member States, they cannot do this in isolation.
That is why my group welcomes the cooperation suggested by the Commission, in terms of exchanging information and best practice and developing common quality standards.
The current provision and funding systems for care of the elderly vary greatly throughout Europe, from comprehensive free care with financial risks spread throughout the population to state funding as a last resort safety net.
Drawing comparisons and exploring the care systems within Member States could be a valuable way of highlighting successful solutions.
I welcome the reference in Mr Mantovani's report to social care as well as health care, as the combination of both is an essential element in the welfare of older people.
If those responsible for health and social policy took a real life-long approach to preventing disease and disability and viewed health promotion and prevention as the cornerstone of a 'foresighted policy', in the words of the report, this would not only improve health but would also cut costs.
The reduction in costs would not be temporary or short term, but long term.
For example, we know that older women and people in rural areas experience greater levels of poverty.
In my constituency in Wales, three out of five older people live in poverty.
Most pensioners depend entirely on their state pension or other state benefits as their only income.
More people have long-term illnesses in Wales than in England or Scotland.
These facts are not unrelated.
Some methods of health prevention and early detection of illness are essential.
Hand-in-hand with this is the importance of a multi-agency approach to coordinating care and a multi-sectoral approach to policy-making, to include social, employment, environmental and economic considerations as well as the need to involve users and their families.
The elderly play a very valuable role in our society.
Life-long learning, communication between the generations, voluntary work and similar issues on which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done a lot of work are intrinsically related to this discussion.
Trying to establish a free market of care and treatment and harmonising health care systems has its dangers.
Meeting the Stability Pact requirements, whilst providing the necessary funding for health, welfare and social services, is a major challenge.
Health care, as I said earlier, is the responsibility of the Member States.
The references in this report to an internal market in health services and products reflects the move towards liberalisation.
As has been seen time after time and as we see in the private finance initiative in health services in the UK, privatisation does not improve services or reduce costs, but leads to longer waiting lists, worse levels of care and staff shortages.
My group believes that health care and the care of the elderly is too important to be put at risk by privatisation and the GATS Agreement.
The focus of this report and one of the main issues in this debate must be equality of access.
This means access to care for everyone and securing a local supply of services. GATS threatens this.
I would ask, therefore, for support of Amendment No 6, to call for exemption of health and care services from GATS, ensuring that the very good proposals made by Mr Mantovani - which I hope will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow - can be implemented and services to older people secured for the long term.
Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, for his work, and also to thank the Commission for coming forward with the proposal.
Care for the frail and elderly is a challenge that faces us all and unfortunately it is one that we will probably all face ourselves at some stage in our lives.
How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged.
Health care and care of the elderly, whilst an important part of the overall health system, does not necessarily represent the overall health system.
There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole.
A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country, Ireland.
I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward.
Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs, reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice.
In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life.
The implications of Amendments Nos 1 to 6 run counter to this policy.
I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the 'open method of cooperation' with 'cooperation'.
Also, in the area of private financing for the health service, there must be a risk equalisation element whereby, if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system, they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state, which means covering everyone and all sections of society.
We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for carers, including carers looking after two or more people.
Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community.
We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible.
In providing and caring for the elderly, that will mean utilising new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community.
All Member States have faced the same common issues: how to address the impact of demographic ageing or healthcare systems and expenditure, how to use the new technologies for the benefit of the elderly, how to ensure a better standard and quality of life for the elderly.
Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial.
I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Mussa, for his work on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in tackling issues which were not fully addressed in the Commission proposal, in particular training for health professionals, nurses and those involved in specific expert care for the elderly.
These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani.
That is a welcome move.
There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly.
This year - 2003 - is the year of the disabled.
There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well.
We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year, but also give particular emphasis to those who cannot speak for themselves, and mostly that means the elderly disabled.
We all want to grow old, but we would prefer not to be old.
This is a Dutch expression about the consequences of getting older.
After all, age generally comes with ailments. Ailments which, with proper attention and care, a person can live with.
This proper attention and care involves people. People who provide the necessary hands-on care.
With the support of good policy and the commitment of politicians, this can be accommodated.
Mr Mantovani's report aims to provide the space to do so from a European perspective.
He puts forward a range of proposals based on a great concern about the demographic trend towards an ageing population and the consequences this will have for our health systems.
In addition to expressing my appreciation for the report, I would like to indicate why, in my opinion, his proposals lose sight of the reality of care provision.
The report is brimming over with the politics of good intentions.
Good intentions alone will not, in my opinion, be the mainspring of political and policy-related activities.
Certainly not if Europe would have to be given new powers on such a basis.
Assigning powers to European institutions is a failure to appreciate the fact that care is provided between people at the micro level.
Promoting good healthcare and exchanging good practices are points I endorse.
Also of great importance is the fact that it is made clear that healthcare and care of the elderly must not only be approached from the point of view of what it costs.
Elderly people and patients are more than just an item of expense to society.
The number of new policy-coordinating proposals and inventories will not, in my opinion, promote good care and assistance but will rather impede it.
In my country there is a lot of discussion about healthcare at the moment.
Dozens of rules, procedures and administrative obligations are impeding the work of nurses and carers.
If one thing has become clear, it is that we need hands at the bedside and not at the computer.
If we also have to comply with European wishes in respect of the provision of information, you will understand that there are few hands left over to actually provide the care.
Although many of Mr Mantovani's ideas appeal to me, I cannot endorse his report.
The report misunderstands the position of the concept of subsidiarity when it comes to the role of Europe and the role of the Member States in these areas of policy.
The report furthermore disregards day-to-day practice.
Practice is not waiting for new rules from Europe, it is waiting for people who want to do the work.
You will understand that I do not regard the European institutions and the Convention as being assigned a role in the policy areas of care for the elderly and healthcare.
I therefore support Mrs Lynne's amendments concerning scrapping paragraphs 18 and 20.
This will ensure that responsibility for healthcare and care for the elderly remains with the national governments.
It is there that the parameters are established and a substantive policy can be pursued that enables us to respond to the people's demand for care.
Finally, I would like to point out the importance of interrelationships between people in family, church or home circles.
That is where the care is provided in practice, at the micro level.
It is pointless worrying about care, you have to go out and do it!
Mr President, let me begin by disagreeing with Mr Blokland for once, and I will explain to Hans why later.
I would like wholeheartedly to support the proposal from the European Commission, together with my colleague's, Mr Mantovani's, proposal.
In Europe we all have the same problem.
We all have healthcare that is expanding, certainly financially.
Why?
Because we are dealing with emancipated citizens, citizens who have a different lifestyle, citizens who want more and who want better quality.
We also have facilities that are making healthcare more expensive.
We all want to keep this system under control, but we would all also like to be able to respond to this justified demand on the part of our citizens.
This means we will have to discuss a number of matters with each other, perhaps not with a view to doing everything in the same way but with a view to finding out how we can all learn from each other's experience.
Incidentally, I must now make a critical comment about the communication from the European Commission.
In the Netherlands, healthcare is not financed via taxes but via premiums; the situation is therefore different from what it says in the communication.
I also see that the communication - and this is why I am so much in favour of this open method of coordination - states that in those countries in which only a small proportion is financed via private insurance and the bulk via taxes, the best example in the table being Luxembourg, the per capita cost of healthcare is simply considerably lower.
That is therefore something that we can learn from one another.
What we should also have learned from one another is that Europe actually plays a major role in the field of healthcare already, despite the fact that we have little to say formally.
Firstly via the article in the Treaty in which achieving a high level of healthcare protection is stated as an objective.
Incidentally, Hans, Dutch citizens benefit a lot from this.
Secondly via the deepening of the internal market; we do in fact have a great deal to say about appliances and certainly also about medicines.
So we should - and I would like to ask the Commissioner if she agrees - come up with solutions for the shortages and gaps in order to achieve proper financeability.
In this case I am thinking about the whole range of medicines, for example.
If we were to do something about generic medicines, we would be able to save EUR 500 million a year in our country alone.
I therefore say to the Commissioner: do something about it, start taking targeted action on this point in consultation with your colleague Mr Byrne.
Now to go back briefly to that high level of protection.
The Dutch citizen benefits from that too.
Why?
Because with that high level, we can at least arrange for people to have the opportunity to go abroad for healthcare if care in the Netherlands is inadequate because it is a demand-led system, the last communist system still in existence in Europe.
Furthermore, we cannot declare a certain treatment to be experimental.
No, that has all been tested by the European Court of Justice.
I am convinced that Europe can do a lot, does do a lot and should actually do even more in the area of healthcare, even if it is initially via the open coordination method.
In any event the first reports reveal that we can learn an awful lot from one another.
Mr President, like other Members, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, because I believe it has really been an excellent idea to produce a communication on the needs relating to healthcare and the care of elderly people.
Commissioner, holding this debate is consistent with all this House's concerns about the needs of elderly people, and it is very helpful that Mr Mantovani's report has achieved such a broad consensus on certain very important ideas.
I am one of those people who believe that the dignity of a society is basically measured by the dignity with which it treats its elderly people; I also believe that issues relating to health, rather than being commercial goods, are a matter of rights.
Fortunately, Mr Mantovani's report and the amendments which I hope we will approve tomorrow and others which we will reject - I hope - will highlight these elements, which are fundamental to the future of Europe.
I am pleased that it moves in this direction, that it stresses the coordination elements which the Commissioner has mentioned, that it maintains the open coordination method, and I hope that this is the beginning of a broader consideration, so that it may also reach other elements of our society.
As the Commission has said in some of its documents, Europe - despite its great progress and despite having increased its standard of living and life expectancy over recent decades - still has problems such as the fact that one in every five citizens dies prematurely; the new risks; inequalities and differences on health issues, ...
These problems are not exclusive to elderly people, but they are problems and issues for all European citizens, who are appealing to us, to the politicians, to the European Convention, to finally treat Europe as an area in which there can be competition but also cooperation and solidarity.
The European citizens are asking for it for essential elements of their lives such as health.
I therefore hope that this method of open coordination, this detailed and exhaustive approximation of health needs - but also social needs and the humanisation of the lives of the elderly - and of these problems, is extended in future communications.
I hope that we will have new instruments so that Europe is not just a market, but also a collection of rights and a source of hope, which is what the public are asking us for.
The future of care for the elderly must not be reduced to a sectoral, or even simply humanist concern, and even less so to purely financial thinking or concern for financial viability.
Are these generations an asset to modern society, yes or no?
Do our societies have the means to provide them with a decent future, sufficient means for care, and therefore a high-level retirement worthy of our times, yes or no?
My reply is yes, a resounding yes.
In France today, 40% of people retiring receive less than EUR 1 000 per month.
Statistics indicate that by 2005, 30% will be approaching the poverty line.
So yes, of course, funding for social protection needs to be reviewed.
The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place.
Asking questions about the future of retirement and care therefore equates to making social choices.
How can we address the causes of the debt, how can we increase the number of those participating in the national solidarity effort?
By combating unemployment by means of employment policies or by making redundancies and closing businesses?
I would also like to voice my opposition, as others have already done, to Article 10(c) of the report in particular, which advocates, and I quote, 'the creation of an internal market in health services and products'.
This would open the way for the attitude of pension funds which are more interested in gaining a market share than in worrying about any kind of health policy.
I personally cannot envisage care being distributed according to budget.
Is there not already a risk when, for example, in the United Kingdom, dialysis is no longer funded after the age of 75?
On the other hand, I am sure that social benefits such as those under the French retirement system should be strengthened.
In France, seven trade unions have been asking for this recently.
Their joint platform demands a high-level retirement provision.
They are also calling for demonstrations throughout the country on 1 February.
Lastly, we have the resources to ensure a high-level retirement provision.
As recommended by one of the amendments tabled by my group, we need to study new ways to fund legal retirement systems, in particular by extending social contributions to all financial income, applying the same rates as for salaries.
Lastly, I would like to express my total opposition to increasing the duration of working life in France and in Europe, as recommended by the Barcelona European Council.
Mr President, as a visibly greying member of the population I have a considerable interest in this debate, as do many others in this House.
I have some concern about the climate of it.
I would like to believe that it is genuinely about providing universal high-quality care in a variety of situations and circumstances, but that is certainly not the tone of the debate as it often comes across in a number of our Member States, where it seems to be all about how we can cut costs and find the money to make provisions.
As others have said, that is not the only way in which we should be looking at this issue, if we should be looking at it that way at all.
One way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff.
I am aware that non-medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation.
However, it is all too often very poorly paid, it is often done by women, by migrant women, and the staff are often recruited with difficulty.
It is certainly a boom area for temporary work agencies in the UK.
Yet those workers are then treated as if they are some sort of disposable commodity and as if the work is unskilled, whereas care work is immensely skilled and stressful.
We also need to look at the implications of the current employment policy which not only encourages but actively pushes more people, especially women, into the workforce and away from the caring role they might have fulfilled or the voluntary work they might have done.
I am not saying that women should be forced to stay at home.
I have never believed that.
But it means that we must look carefully at the financial and social support for carers, which should reflect the much larger costs that society would otherwise bear.
We also need to recognise that carers who are in work need leave provision, not just parents.
We need to look at the employment needs of carers.
I am pleased to say that the equal funding is being used for at least one such project involving the UK.
Some of my other concerns also focus on the issue of discrimination in the provision of health care for the elderly.
This is observed in quite a number of Member States.
It is a useful area for comparison between Member States and might at some point be part of another horizontal directive for Article 13.
We mentioned in the debate the issue of an adequate income for older people.
I am very pleased that paragraph 7 of Mr Mantovani's report, quoting the World Health Organisation, talks about health being best served in a more socially cohesive, egalitarian society with a smaller burden of relative deprivation.
People have raised the question of the internal market in health care, not just in terms of cross-border treatment, although, judging by the post I receive, the ability to transfer disability allowances and carers' allowances across borders under Regulation 1408/71 would be welcomed.
It is also an issue of cross-border service providers and increasing provision from third country providers.
As Mrs Evans said, it is not yet clear what impact the future negotiation on GATS will have on service provision and which aspects of health care and other care for the elderly will be put into any EU offer for discussion under the World Trade Organisation's agreements.
It is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included.
It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers.
I agree with Mr Crowley on the issue of risk equalisation in the private sector, to avoid cherry-picking of the purely profitable.
We also need to consider, both inside and outside the Convention, to what extent health care and general care are services of general interest and whether universal and affordable access should be guaranteed in the Treaties of the European Union.
We have to look further at what constitutes goods or services in health and other care.
I am aware that Denmark has already introduced legislation on this.
It would be another useful area for comparison in an open method of coordination.
Mr President, Commissioner, this report is good, the Commission proposal is a good one, and, although you, Commissioner, can be thanked for this, permit me one comment.
I found in the report the word 'Ãberalterung'.
I do not know what that is in Greek, English, or any other language, but in German it amounts to quite offensive discrimination against older - or as the word in question would have it, superannuated - people.
When one is no longer as young and beautiful as you are, but, like me, is in one's seventieth year, that sort of thing causes an enormous amount of anguish.
Let us at last stop using these stupid expressions about the superannuation or geriatrification of Europe.
Even though you can read it all over the media, it is quite simply not true.
Never have there been so many people alive in Europe as there are today and never before has there been such high life expectancy as there is now.
As recently as 150 years ago, average life expectancy was around 40 years, and now it is 80.
Any girl born today has the chance to live to a hundred.
People today have the good fortune to be able, at long last, to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible.
So let us stop talking about any geriatrification of Europe or about its superannuation.
I assume that this has simply escaped your notice.
Please stop talking about people being superannuated.
Let me make another comment.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I tabled a whole series of amendments, all of which were adopted.
I am very pleased about that.
There is one amendment of which I am particularly proud, Commissioner, and it is one that I should especially like to commend to you.
It has to do with something that is a quite splendid addition to what has been achieved in terms of family and social policy - continued remuneration for one week in the year in the event of a person remaining at home to care for a close family member - perhaps a parent or grandparent - who has become ill.
That is the law in Austria, so that any working person can stay at home for one week in the year to care for his or her elderly family members.
I think it is a great thing that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted this amendment.
I hope that we will do the same when we vote tomorrow.
Commissioner, I commend this matter to your care.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the work by the European Commission, the rapporteur, whom I thank, and our European Parliament, whose representatives have spoken this evening, are based on two central facts.
One very positive fact: the human lifespan is increasing constantly while external signs of ageing are decreasing significantly.
Another fact, which is of serious concern to economists and in particular to anyone with budgetary responsibilities: this increased lifespan goes hand in hand with health and care needs, the costs of which are also increasing and will increase considerably over the coming years.
Unless we believe, therefore, that the single market and free competition will solve all the problems in this regard as well, we shall have to be prepared to make significant financial efforts in terms of contributions and taxes, which will of course have to be distributed fairly, in order to guarantee a high level of care for all.
Some, quite wrongly, deny this.
Others find it regrettable; I find it regrettable for them, because they will be old one day too.
Lastly, others, myself included, think and say that we must grasp the nettle.
It is the only way of preventing longer lives from being nothing more than delayed death and ensuring that this increase represents the continuation of a genuine life, not forgetting that experience is also a factor in progress.
This requires quality care and services, adapted to every situation, which necessitates public research for new medicines and treatments, changes in mentality and different priorities for our society and, in particular, public budgets which meet our needs.
Now, at the beginning of a new millennium, Mr President, we all know, and some, even some of us, regret, that we are far from having fulfilled all these conditions and criteria.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Mantovani on his excellent report, which highlights the need to guarantee people's right to high-quality protection against health risks and loss of independence, and the importance of ensuring that that right reflects the challenges of our times, and in particular the demographic trend towards an ageing population.
That phenomenon is the result of low birth rates and increased life expectancy, especially amongst women.
In less than one decade, between 1990 and 1999, the number of women over 65 has increased by nearly 3%.
The effects of an ageing population are being felt at various levels.
In Portugal, for example, if we consider the population of working age, greater longevity amongst women means that since 1995 the number of elderly women has been greater than that of young women.
At the same time, the increase in the number of elderly persons is imposing a greater burden on health care and social services.
The issue we face is a simple and intuitive one. Society cannot be said to be progressing if greater life expectancy is not matched by improvements in quality of life.
So the great challenge for us is to achieve a high level of satisfaction amongst the elderly with their quality of life, while keeping the costs that this involves in check.
This will inevitably make demands on public finance, which plays a key part in expenditure on health in all the Member States.
Even in Greece, the country where public finance makes the lowest contribution to health services, the figure is about 56%, rising to 84% in the United Kingdom.
An ageing population will have a considerable impact on budgets, which will in turn increase public expenditure.
Health care systems in the European Union should therefore be pursuing the objective of being simultaneously accessible, high in quality and financially viable.
Each Member State is responsible for the organisation and financing of its own social protection system.
Nevertheless, this responsibility is increasingly being exercised in an overall context that affects various Community policies.
For this reason, as has already been mentioned, the Barcelona European Council stressed the need to establish and develop closer cooperation between the Member States as regards social protection, exchanges of good practice and information, research, establishing common indicators and standards and the development of health and social services for the elderly.
Lastly, I believe that the Greek Presidency should examine the European Community strategy and action programme in the field of public health, with a view to the next European Council in the spring adopting the use of the open method of coordination and a precise timetable for cooperation between the Member States.
Mr President, we shall not be voting for this report as the rapporteur insists on the need for financial viability, which basically means that we have to restrict the level of spending in advance.
Beyond that, however, how can we talk about the future of health and care for the elderly without raising the problem of pensions?
On the pretext of modernisation, numerous governments within the Union are increasingly attacking pensions and current and future pensioners.
In France, just over the past fifteen years, following various reforms, the level of pensions has decreased by some 30%.
How, therefore, could working-class pensioners, who, even as employees, received insufficient salaries, survive this permanent reduction in their purchasing power without it affecting their health and quality of care?
The report emphasises prevention.
The first step in prevention, however, is guaranteeing acceptable living conditions for pensioners.
We need not only to halt the reduction in the level of pensions, but we also need to ensure that, for all those who have worked their whole lives, retirement does not mean a reduction in their purchasing power.
We must not accept being told that this is impossible and that the ratio of people of working age to those of non-working age does not allow it.
The problem is not this ratio between people of working and non-working age, but the ratio between the considerable profits of large companies, the ever-increasing income of the wealthier classes, and the constantly decreasing income of employees, both when working and as pensioners.
In order to guarantee dignity for pensioners, we must agree to dip into these profits or the income of the wealthy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Flemming's remarks oblige me to say that we should not view this report in isolation from other reports and initiatives, for example, the Lisbon strategy, which also aims towards social cohesion and sustainability, the Commission report on the evaluation of national strategies for adequate and sustainable pensions, or the Streamlining Report on the coordination of employment policy with economic policy.
All these serve the purpose of ensuring that our social security system continues to be financially viable, because that is what is needed.
Demographic changes are relevant to every area of policy and have effects on the social fabric and on the socio-political framework, and so I welcome this report and this debate as helping to increase our awareness of these things.
Action is needed, on the part of all of and us at every political level.
A survey by Eurostat, a few days ago, showed that in 2002 there were fewer births, but more deaths, recorded in the EU.
The number of live births in the EU reached 3.99 million in 2002, which is 0.3% fewer than in 2001.
It is estimated that, in 2002, some 3.68 million people died in the EU, which amounts to some 60 000 more than in 2001.
These figures alone show that our society faces a change which will affect policy on social security, employment, finance and the economy.
There is just one aspect that I would like to pick out - that of care.
In my country - Austria - alone, 540 000 people are at present in need of help and care.
This figure will increase to just over 800 000 by 2011.
At the same time, 84% of all those in need of care - and this is the case in all countries - receive that care from members of their own family.
Only 26% require or receive additional help or avail themselves of it.
Demographic and economic changes mean, though, that the family members who provide care are becoming fewer in number.
The number of people employed in the care field has increased by 5.5%, so the health and welfare sector is creating jobs.
Underdevelopment of many areas of the mobile care and support services means that far from all the sufficiently trained staff can be employed. I therefore demand certain things above all in this context.
Among other things, we should be attaching greater importance to the mobile services and to the services needed to supplement them - hospices, family support, and day centres - and extending them.
There is a need for a build-up of resources in personal environments and for more extensive support both for recipients of care and for their families.
In my view, though, we also need uniform standards of training and professional development, as aid is often required across national boundaries.
The caring professions need a campaign to enhance their image and we have to explore why they are so unstable and why staff remain in them for so short a time.
Care is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we need European standards for it.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)
Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Afghanistan, one year after the Bonn Agreement.
Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now a year since the Bonn Agreement was signed in 2001 and, as we look back over what has already been done and what has yet to be done in order to ensure it is fully implemented, I would point out that this Agreement laid the foundations for a new, modern Afghan state and that there is cause for reserved satisfaction with the progress it has made so far.
Once a transitional authority and administration had been set up, an emergency Loya Jirga was convened and elected a president. A Judicial Commission and an Independent Human Rights Commission have been set up.
A central bank has been established and has introduced a national currency. A drafting committee has been set up as a forerunner to a Constitutional Commission.
A proposal has been adopted for a national development framework, which will be used as a guide for rebuilding and improving the situation in the country. President Karzai has issued a decree creating an Afghan national army, an important step towards Afghan ownership in the field of security and stability.
On 22 December 2002, Afghanistan and its six neighbours signed the Kabul Declaration of Good Neighbourly Relations, in which they agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs; this will do a great deal to foster peace and stability in the region.
Generally speaking, President Karzai and the Afghan Transitional Administration have achieved substantial results and the Bonn Process is on the right track.
During the Petersberg Conference on 2 December reaffirming the commitment to supporting the Bonn Agreement on Afghanistan and inject new impetus into efforts to rebuild the country, a declaration was issued containing a clear reference to the objectives and timetable for applying the Bonn Process, introducing a new constitution and holding elections in 2004.
Both the Afghan Transitional Administration and the international community, however, still have a great many challenges to meet between now and then.
Over the past six months there have been a number of reforms, some visible reconstruction and limited restoration of the balance of power both within the central administration and between the centre and the regions.
Progress needs to be made in these sectors in order to boost the confidence of the Afghan people, which is the key to support for the administration.
The whole idea behind the Bonn Agreement was that transitional arrangements should be based on traditional, local, national and religious structures in Afghanistan.
And every effort must be made to ensure there is proper representation, in accordance with rules introduced by the central administration.
Consequently, the administration will need to introduce even greater order over coming months, keep a lid on hostilities and improve how the institutions function, because otherwise it risks incurring the disappointment of the people, with the risk of their turning their back on the central administration, relaxing in their efforts to meet the demands of the international community and jeopardising the efforts being made to achieve the objectives of the Bonn Agreement.
By definition the administration is fragmented, with its members coming as they do from every corner of the country, which is why it is vital for it to consolidate its efforts and speed up the process to rebuild the country.
One way of supporting the central administration is to ensure that all aid is channelled through it; this will affirm its authority to the entire country and ensure that neighbouring countries and local leaders are on board.
Security continues to be a priority and we feel that all the Afghan groups should be encouraged to solve their grievances in a peaceful manner.
We share the view of the Afghan people that, as long as there is a state of insecurity, the degree of progress hoped for has still not been made.
Rebuilding the country's economy should also be a priority.
The Afghan authorities need to work with the International Monetary Fund and introduce an efficient and cohesive macroeconomic and monetary framework within which stable economic development can be fostered and donors' contributions invested.
As part of this, we need to encourage the Tokyo donors to make the promised funds available through the national investment budget presented by the Afghan administration.
Naturally, Community aid to Afghanistan will continue to be provided on terms dictated by the basic principles and values we subscribe to as members of western society.
Our terms are geared to achieving the aims of the Bonn Agreement and, by extension, ensuring all sides in Afghanistan comply with the procedure set up to achieve peace, a representative government and stability, convict terrorists and stop the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics.
Community aid must be geared to rebuilding a stable nation, improving the food supply and supporting the return of refugees and exiles.
Unless democratic values, pluralism and the respect for human rights, including women's rights, are strengthened, there can be no social or political development in Afghanistan.
We are encouraging the Afghan Transitional Administration, in close consultation with the international community, to establish verifiable benchmarks and timetables to ensure the full implementation of the Bonn Agreement.
The Council has already expressed its appreciation for the role Turkey assumed as lead nation for the international peacekeeping force and we would like to commend Germany and the Netherlands for agreeing to take over the command of ?SAF for the next six months and wish them every success with this difficult mission.
I should like to reiterate the European Union's commitment, in cooperation with the United Nations, to help Afghanistan eliminate the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics through accelerated implementation of reconstruction programmes, including in poppy-growing areas, the development of law-enforcement institutions, and provision of an alternative, better livelihood for the local people.
If Afghanistan is to enter modern statehood, it needs to reform its security, administrative, judicial, financial and social domains.
We welcome the fact that a constitutional drafting committee has been set up to draft a constitution which will modernise the judicial system and protect human rights.
However, we note that the Civil Service Commission is not yet fully functioning.
The European Union is committed to contributing to the work of these bodies.
The Judicial Commission needs to be strengthened if it is to improve the procedural system.
We welcome Italy's contribution here in organising the conference on the Afghan legal system in Rome last December.
We need timetables and benchmarks here in order to ensure the provisions of the Bonn agreement are applied.
Activating the constitutional drafting committee and adopting an electoral law so that elections can be held by June 2004 are immediate priorities here and the presidency will continue to monitor these issues through the European Union's special representative in Afghanistan.
2003 will be a crucial year for Afghanistan and will most likely decide the future shape of the country.
During 2003, President Karzai will need to push through the reforms needed for fast reconstruction and rebuilding, curtail the powers of local leaders, draft a modern, working constitution based on the principles of honest administration, convene a constituent Loya Jirga and start preparations for elections in 2004, so that the Afghan people can realise their aspirations for peace and progress in Afghanistan and determine their own future, free from violence and fear.
We have reiterated the European Union's continued commitment to delivering a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Finally, may I remind you that, in its conclusions of 4 December, the Council invited the High Representative and the European Union's special representative, Mr Vendrell, to follow closely the implementation of the Petersberg commitments and, in cooperation with the Commission, to make recommendations for further actions that the European Union can undertake in support of the Afghan Transitional Administration.
Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity, with my colleague Mr Ionitsis, to discuss progress in Afghanistan over the past year.
As I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee in December, the changes have been in many respects dramatic, and do offer a real chance to build a stable democracy.
But timing is critical; there is - as the Minister properly underlined - a limited window of opportunity which we have to exploit.
Unless President Karzai and his Government manage to strengthen their position throughout the country, then there is a risk that these early gains will be lost.
But before turning to the substantial challenges that lie ahead, I would like to say something about the successes of 2002, successes accomplished in extremely difficult circumstances.
Only a year ago donors met in Tokyo to pledge over USD 1.8 billion for 2002.
Much has since been achieved in Afghanistan.
In the summer, President Karzai was elected by an Emergency Loya Jirga to lead the Afghanistan Transitional Authority; constitutional and judicial commissions have been established; a new currency has been introduced, and the process of recovery and of reconstruction is well under way with increasingly strong leadership from the Afghan Government.
The international community has not only honoured the pledges made at Tokyo, but, not least in comparison with some problems we have experienced in the past, the speed of disbursement has been remarkable.
The track record of the European Union and the European Commission has been, I think one can fairly say, particularly impressive.
By early December, EUR 755 million of the total European Union commitment of over EUR 830 million had actually been disbursed.
The Commission has played a leading role in co-ordinating the European Union effort and we have been actively involved in building up a strategic dialogue on Afghanistan with the United States and other G-8 partners.
I must say that I am very proud of the quality of the EC assistance programme and the speed with which it has been delivered.
It is a fine example of a successful linkage between relief and recovery, and it has been a good test case for the reform of the management of the external service.
It is also fair to pay tribute to the excellent staff we have at the newly set-up EC office in Kabul.
I would also like to pay tribute to the Special Representative, who brings so much knowledge and so much expertise to his extremely challenging work.
In more concrete terms, our development programme of over EUR 205 million in 2002 has helped to finance: firstly, the operation of 238 health clinics and over 450 primary schools as part of the Government's 2002 Back to School campaign; secondly, the clearance of landmines and unexploded bombs from more than 8 000 square kilometres of land; thirdly, the return of some 17 000 key public sector workers, including the return to service of over 2 000 teachers and 2 000 nurses and doctors and fourthly, the creation of jobs.
Through our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes, we are financing over 3 million person days of work this year alone, and I should also refer to the rebuilding of infrastructure.
The Commission, along with the Swedish government and Pakistan, has already started the emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul-Jalalabad-Torkham road and full reconstruction will start next year .
In addition, our humanitarian aid has helped to support the return of over 1.8 million refugees to Afghanistan.
Over EUR 70 million has been spent by ECHO in 2002.
That means that the money which we have spent in total in Afghanistan over the last twelve months, the money which is voted by this Parliament, now stands at EUR 275 million.
I do not think anybody can suggest that we have not played - or are not still playing - our full part so far in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
For 2003, the challenge will be to consolidate this early progress.
The Commission will continue to play a leading role.
We anticipate total development assistance of about EUR 185 million, and there will also be continued humanitarian assistance from ECHO of between EUR 45 and 55 million.
That means that we will be spending in Afghanistan this year, on present estimates, between EUR 230 and 240 million.
Colleagues will recall that at Tokyo on behalf of the Commission I pledged EUR 1 billion over five years in reconstruction assistance.
That is not including the humanitarian assistance figures that I have mentioned, so the total contribution of the European Commission, from your taxpayers' money, to Afghanistan, quite apart from contributions from Member States, will be well in excess of EUR 1 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Some people in the past have derided that sort of work as nation-building or social work.
Frankly, when I look back, I think if we had done more of it in the 1980s and 90s, we would not have the problems that we have had recently in Afghanistan.
Success in 2003 will hinge on three key issues.
First, the need to improve internal security.
Second, the need to ensure human rights are fully respected, including those of women and minorities.
When I visited Kabul last year, one of the most moving visits that I paid was to a school in the extraordinary bomb site that is southern and western Kabul, where young women had returned to schooling for the first time in six years and were sitting in classrooms without blackboards, without textbooks, being taught physics.
I must say the commitment and dedication of the staff, and of those young women, was remarkable: anybody who ever thought that it would have been right for us to stand by and allow Taliban rule to continue indefinitely should perhaps have been present on that occasion.
The third key issue for us is the need for continued long-term commitment from donors and for effective coordination.
The argument about coordination is one which has been extremely well made by Members of this Parliament, and I will say another word about it a little later if I may.
Internal security is critical not only for the future of Afghanistan but also to the delivery of aid.
Aid workers must be able to work without fear of recrimination.
In this context, I would like to express my strong concern about the death of one aid worker, and the serious injury of two others, in Kabul just before Christmas.
I think sometimes we underestimate the amounts of courage and commitment which are required for aid workers working in these sort of circumstances.
President Karzai's commitment at the 2 December Bonn II Conference to form an Afghan National Army is a welcome step forward, as is the recent signing of the Kabul Declaration on good-neighbourly relations.
The Government must press on quickly with the creation of a National Army, but clearly this will not be achieved overnight.
In the meantime, the international community must do everything possible to support President Karzai and to strengthen the Government's position across all regions of the country, including in the fight against opium poppy production.
The Minister has already referred to our concern about this.
If you look at the present UN figures, there is very considerable reason not just for concern, but alarm.
There has been a substantial increase in the amount of hectares under opium production, a rapid increase in the farm-gate price of poppies, a ballooning in the production of heroin with implications not only for surrounding countries, but for European countries, and for the funding of organised crime and terrorism in the region and beyond.
I believe that we have to give far more attention to this problem in the next year or so, a problem which directly affects political authority in Afghanistan itself.
Overall, as agreed at the Bonn II meeting, we need tangible benchmarks to measure progress.
These are critical not only to shape our vision of Afghanistan's future, but to provide support to the reformers within the Government.
This is of critical importance for human rights .
Recent reports highlight the unacceptable situation faced by minority groups, and women, in some parts of the country.
We must secure fundamental change by ensuring that the establishment of the independent Human Rights Commission translates into tangible change on the ground, and that the new Constitution enshrines human rights for all, including women.
Clearly, these issues are vital in view of the general elections which are scheduled for mid 2004.
We also cannot hope to deliver sustainable change without good donor coordination.
We must all continue to give a strong and consistent message to the Afghan Government about the need to tackle internal security, to respect human rights for everyone and to set benchmarks for progress.
I would like to finish by stressing that we must be prepared for the long haul - regardless of other events that may unfold in 2003.
Rebuilding a cohesive state will take time, as will improving the unacceptably low levels of education and healthcare.
I want to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to these tasks.
I paid a first trip to Kabul in May 2002 and will be returning this February as part of a trip to the Central Asian Republics.
I intend to make one of the priorities of my visit the discussion of the better coordination of donor efforts, including the work done by NGOs.
The support received from this House has been very reassuring, especially in helping to secure funding for Afghanistan for 2003.
I look forward to an equally rewarding working relationship with Parliament over the coming year and I want to express my great gratitude for the informed and thoughtful contribution which Parliament has made to the discussion of these issues.
It is sometimes difficult for the international community to focus on more than one or two blips on its radar screen at any one moment.
There is a real danger of us assuming that, because we do not read as much about Afghanistan on the front pages of the newspapers, our job in Afghanistan is, as we would say colloquially in English, done and dusted.
It is far from that.
There is a huge job for us to do in Afghanistan.
There are worrying tasks for the international community in the Central Asian Republics and there are reasons for concern about the situation in Pakistan.
So I hope that we can continue to focus on this work in the years ahead, whatever the tragic distractions may be elsewhere.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, after listening to what you have had to say, I think I can tell you right away that you can count on the full support not only of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but of all the groups in Parliament; I know that because I was involved in negotiating the joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow.
Personally speaking, the date of Afghanistan one year on was four months ago, on 9 September 2002, when I went to Kabul to represent the European Parliament at the ceremonies held for the first anniversary of the assassination of Commander Massoud.
I was privileged to witness the homage paid by an entire nation to the memory of a man who had embodied the spirit of resistance and had so capably defended the values of freedom which he held so dear.
I also noted a marked improvement in the situation in the capital and the surrounding area, as evidenced by the speed with which hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees, who had been forced to flee under the Taliban regime, had returned to their former homes.
In June 2000 I had met them in the camps, where they survived thanks only to the humanitarian aid that continued to reach them owing to the courageous efforts - as you yourself stressed, Commissioner - of the few NGOs that remained in the face of the difficulties put in their way by the ruling regime.
Finally, I was able to see the efforts being made by the provisional government to restore to the whole of the country the harmony essential for the establishment of a lasting peace.
I also became aware, however, of the persistent threat posed by fundamentalist terrorists, who had just taken dozens of innocent lives by setting off a bomb in a market at the heart of the busiest quarter of Kabul.
And then I was struck by the impression of disorder given by the excessive number of international organisations, which were working in the field, it is true, distributing the aid needed to rebuild the country, but with no real consultation either between them or with the authorities or the Afghan people themselves.
In short, President-in-Office of the Council, as you yourself said, I came away with a sense of restrained satisfaction, but I had mixed feelings; I was encouraged by the efforts being made to implement the Bonn Agreements under the aegis of the international organisations, efforts which had brought significant progress; but I was aware that the game was still far from being won; and I was convinced, finally, that everything had to be done to establish the fragile authority of the provisional government by giving it the means to demonstrate its ability to improve the security and economic and social situation of the Afghan citizens everywhere in the country.
What is the situation today?
President Karzai's government continues to work through the transitional administration to promote stability, democracy and prosperity in Afghanistan.
But, firstly, it is still far from achieving all its objectives, in particular because it has been unable to extend its authority over parts of the territory that are still under the sway of a small number of warlords who are refusing to give any allegiance to the central authorities.
As a result, the human rights situation and that of Afghan women has not improved as much as the government would have liked and our Parliament must condemn this situation and call for all the necessary assistance to be given to that end, in particular perhaps by extending the ISAF mandate.
Secondly, the fight against the fundamentalist fanaticism of the supporters of Al-Qaida and Mullah Omar has still not been won.
There are strong grounds for believing that they may still be receiving support from the ''uncontrolled'' areas of neighbouring territories.
That is why we welcome the commitment given by the governments of the neighbouring countries in Kabul last month and call on them to cooperate unreservedly for the complete destruction of the terrorist networks that remain.
Finally, and above all perhaps - as you yourself said, President-in-Office of the Council, and I was glad to hear it - we very much regret the present lack of cooperation between the various players involved in reconstruction.
We call for the creation of a proper agency to provide the necessary coordination.
As you said, if the government's authority is to be established all the aid granted by the international community must pass through that government and, in particular, aid must no longer be given to some of the local lords.
In conclusion, I would like to say to Commissioner Patten that we want the Commission to endeavour, through its own projects, to strengthen the authority and ability of the Afghan Government by making increasing use of the available resources and skills of the national labour force, which are perhaps too much overlooked at present.
Mr President, to those who have been there, who have stood on the mountains, who know the people, Afghanistan is a beautiful country.
The Afghan people are a strong people who deserve our support.
The liberation of Afghanistan by the international coalition against terrorism, against the Taliban and against the Al-Qaida network has fortunately been very successful.
Commissioner Patten has rightly said that this is in no small measure thanks to the efforts of the European Union.
There is a new provisional government, and no fewer than 1.8 million Afghans have returned after what has, for many, been decades of forced exile abroad, and thousands of girls and women once again have the opportunity to enjoy an education in Afghanistan.
At the same time, this success is being threatened by the diversion of some of the very important international players to a new playground - Iraq.
It would be very tragic if the international coalition against terrorism were to allow itself to become divided and diverted towards Iraq.
We now specifically want the international coalition to give us extra support for Afghanistan and to concentrate on it, as it has rightly been pointed out in this context that we could otherwise lose ground.
The Afghan transitional administration, the ATA, under the leadership of President Karzai, has control over the capital, Kabul, with the help of the ISAF, but in reality the warlords still play far too great a role in the various regions of the country such as Herat.
Human rights, women's rights and reconstruction are threatened on a daily basis in these regions.
The first and most important priority must be to extend the ISAF's mandate so as to help the ATA to build up a national army that will cover the whole of Afghanistan.
Starting in February, the Netherlands and Germany will be playing a leading role in the ISAF forces on behalf of Europe, hopefully with a mandate that will actually demobilise the warlords, build up the national army and re-establish authority over the whole of Afghanistan.
The important agreement which Afghanistan concluded with its neighbours on 22 December last year should thus also be given another chance.
Only then will Afghans have sufficient trust, and only then will they have the opportunity to take the reconstruction into their own hands.
Almost two million refugees have returned, and 700 000 are trekking around inside Afghanistan - in other words, they are internally displaced.
That is why it is so very important that we actually give substance to the reconstruction that Commissioner Patten was talking about and that has now begun, with the cooperation of local forces, particularly in the area of education and healthcare, giving priority to women and girls.
Free and fair elections must be held and a new constitution prepared in 2004.
The preparations for these elections are essential, as this is the way to actually establish a broad gender-sensitive, multi-ethnic and representative government.
Tremendous steps have been taken.
A human rights committee has been set up, a central bank has been established and a constitutional committee has been set up, but much ground may still be lost, as General Morillon rightly said.
I therefore very strongly support the view of the Greek Presidency and of Commissioner Patten.
Let us use the substantial amounts we have at our disposal for the coming year, coupled with our effort, in a focused way.
Given everything that is happening elsewhere in the world, we must make a success of Afghanistan now.
That will only work if we maintain this focus during the coming year.
Mr President, may I first congratulate the Greek minister for taking up the Presidency.
We look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months.
The President today commented that our aim must be to bring Afghanistan into a modern statehood.
Women's rights give increasing cause for concern, they are not improving, they are becoming worse.
Facial covering has become mandatory in many parts of the country; the movement of women is heavily restricted.
Virginity is examined on the whim of the police, women are dragged into hospitals and physically examined.
In other words, women are reverting to their traditional subordinate role of being the property of the male.
The Commissioner has already commented that women's rights in certain areas of the country are under assault, but I say this is also happening at central government level.
Women are now forbidden to be presenters on radio or television, which some of them were doing successfully.
I have no doubt that women journalists are also under pressure in the written media.
Under-representation of women has been commented on already, but I would ask you to recall the famous Loya Jirga, which was almost 100% male.
When the deputy Health minister visited the European Commission recently, it was the - male - deputy Health minister, Dr Feroz, who attended, not the Health minister herself, the only senior minister who is a woman.
40% of all health facilities do not have one single woman at any level of their staff, yet it is women worldwide who are fundamentally responsible for all aspects of family health.
The word Afghanistan translates correctly into the words 'the land of sorrow and suffering'.
For women Afghanistan is becoming, yet again, the land of their deepest sorrow and suffering.
Humanitarian aid undoubtedly helps, but just as obviously it is simply not enough.
I warmly congratulate both ECHO and the entire Commission involved in Afghanistan, for their fantastic work.
But if we want to bring Afghanistan into the modern world, the most basic of human rights, equal respect between the sexes, must become, both a hallmark of our aid and a continuing measurement of our success.
It is not so today.
If we look at what Mr Solana identified as the aims of European Union involvement in Afghanistan, women are not mentioned: women's rights are just not there.
Yet if we mean business, this attitude must be tackled, and it is an attitude, a tribal culture in Baluchistan, which has spread around the region.
Why be so squeamish about tackling women's rights?
Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society?
I do not need to quote the Koran to you to remind you that men and women were equal in the Koran from the very start of Islam; it cannot be because of that.
I urge you, alter the priorities of the Council of Ministers, place women's rights high on the agenda.
If we fail on that, then we will have no success at all.
Mr President, yesterday the Greek Presidency stated that the priority under its mandate is to put the motto ''Our Europe'' into effect, and share the future in a community of values.
However, values should not just be described; justice, the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances.
In reality, the more we talk about peace, the more war there is; there is talk of negotiations while troops are being prepared.
When will this duplicity end?
How much longer will bullets kill Palestinian children, suicide bombers kill Israeli citizens, Russian soldiers kill people in Chechnya and the USA kill wherever it thinks it has an interest, and so on?
I shall not give any further examples, since the world is such a big and terrible place.
Is this rhetoric or sentimentality?
No.
I am expressing political and moral outrage, a stern warning against creating a Europe which has a forked tongue, as an American Indian chief once said while his people were being wiped out and moved to reservations.
One year on from the Bonn Agreement and clearly many positive steps have been taken.
The Commission's facts and Commissioner Patten's outstanding analyses, which I shall not dwell on as he read them out very clearly, are impressive.
We all know that in a situation where there is devastation such as this, there are no shortcuts to achieving common interests without destroying specific aspects. We need to develop civilian infrastructure, rebuild houses, roads, schools, hospitals, not allow returning refugees to die from starvation and cold and attack the cultivation or sale of opium but give the population an alternative.
I have personally seen the progress made this year, especially in Kabul - schools reopened, girls studying journalism - but at the same time, I have seen and heard that key figures such as military leaders and the United States have allowed human rights failures, which are still apparent.
I am not just referring to abuse and discrimination against women at work, in the streets, in the media and not just, moreover, in the Herat area - land of the infamous Khan - but all over the country; I am also referring to social discrimination, to favour-based politics and nepotism, applied to everyone, but especially - and the USA is primarily responsible for this - with regard to the supply of arms, aid and political support for military leaders who should be before the International Court.
We need to help the central government, the Ministry of Social Affairs - the Minister for Equal Opportunities, Habiba Sarabi, has appealed to us all to increase aid and support for gender policies and women's policies within the European Commission too - and enable democratic elections to take place in 2004: these are all essential things.
Moreover, it is also essential, as Commissioner Patten said, to extend central power to the various areas of the country, above all separate military power from civilian power and encourage the Human Rights Commission, not just the Afghan one - Sima Samar is a courageous woman who bravely continues her work - but also UNAMA.
I met UNAMA representatives in Kabul who could not travel round the country for fear not only of warlords, but also of marines, for fear of speaking out and exposing human rights violations, in which we were also complicit.
We must therefore carry out investigations for UNAMA.
The passage of time does not, however, help democratic forces: Commissioner Patten also said this, just as he said we are arriving late; perhaps we could have done more in 1980.
Donor countries should pay greater heed to the government, but above all to women's organisations which are saying loud and clear that the warlords' power must be cut off and the country must be reconstructed on the basis of law and democracy, because there can be no democracy if there is torture or massacres such as the one at Mazar-i-Sharif.
Europe must continue to do its part; we cannot take a different path: we must give continuity to our work and our commitment.
Mr President, four months ago we took part in another debate about Afghanistan in this very room, with some of the same people.
I have just re-read the report and must come to the conclusion that a large number of subjects dealt with at the time are regrettably still highly topical, such as the position of women.
To be honest, I have little to add to Baroness Nicholson's impressive arguments on that point.
I do, however, think that the time has come to do more than just acknowledge that the position of women has deteriorated over the past year.
The UN Human Rights Committee, which has a special rapporteur for the position of women, should really go and carry out targeted investigations in places where we all know the position of women has deteriorated, like in Herat, for example.
The time has also come for the international community, including the European Union, to make it clear that aid depends on progress with regard to the position of women, and that deterioration will have long-term consequences.
Another subject that we dealt with four months ago - and this has also been mentioned now by a number of fellow Members - was the extension of the ISAF's mandate outside Kabul.
Kofi Annan has described this extension as a precondition for continuing stability in Afghanistan.
In his response to our contribution four months ago, the Commissioner himself stated at the time, and I quote: the Member States will certainly take note of the comments of many MEPs.
Mr Yiannitsis, I would like to once more ask the question I also put to your Danish counterpart at the time: is the Council prepared to make money and troops available in order to enable this extension to happen?
If not, please tell me; then we will not have this illusion hanging over our heads.
I am convinced that this is necessary, otherwise there will be no stability anywhere at all in Afghanistan.
Why is it so necessary to extend the ISAF's mandate?
That has everything to do with what I would call the perverse return of the warlords.
I again refer to what Mr Patten said on 4 September: we must not use the warlords in the fight against Al-Qaida again.
Regrettably this is still happening.
Some of the warlords are still being supported financially but also with weapons in the context of the fight against terrorism.
This must come to an end.
Otherwise everything we have been discussing here about reforms will simply have no chance at all.
Take, for example, the fact that many warlords and generals are governors at the same time.
This must not be allowed to continue.
This only advances their standing; this really must come to an end.
The position of the ISAF has started to suffer, even in Kabul.
There are increasing numbers of incidents, and the present Turkish commanding officer has rightly warned that this situation will only worsen in the event of an attack on Iraq.
Understandably, there is increasing concern in Germany and the Netherlands, the countries taking over command of the ISAF, that the warlords, together with Al-Qaida, are very likely to use an attack on Iraq to turn people against all Westerners, not only soldiers but aid workers as well.
If the ISAF's mandate is not extended, if the role of the warlords is not diminished, the reforms will simply have no chance at all.
Then the human rights violations will continue and - let us not forget this - the credibility of the international community and that of the European Union will be called into question.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Mr President, we should applaud the action of President Karzai who, faced with countless problems, has set in motion the creation of a new Constitution and the formation of a national army, essential cornerstones for the construction of a secular, democratic and functional state.
The facts set out at the Petersberg Conference are encouraging: EUR 830 million already allocated by Europe, with a tangible impact on medicine and health, education - education which is now finally accessible to girls too - security through mine-clearing and the deactivation of unexploded bombs, agriculture, the restoration of urban areas, the reconstruction of infrastructure and return and assistance for refugees who are at last going back to their country.
There is, however, still a long way to go: many of the funds allocated by Europe are still frozen, and we need a stronger commitment by our countries' governments to the democratic development of Afghanistan.
A key issue for development, in fact, is to expand agriculture, which will take land away from opium cultivation.
At this point, it is clear that not just the Union but also individual national governments, their Ministers for Agriculture, possibly also in conjunction with national farmers' organisations, must help Afghanistan and Afghan farmers with more immediacy to reconvert their crops, with, moreover, the help of specialists and experts in this area.
The terrorism emergency is, in any case, unresolved and Europe must renew its political and moral commitment to helping the secular governments of those Muslim countries that wish to combat fundamentalist extremism.
Members of the various terrorist networks are not only continuing to operate in areas of Afghanistan not yet controlled by the government but, in fact, live and are active in bordering countries and are operationally linked with areas which have become centres for attracting and recruiting others, such as certain areas of Somalia and South-East Asia.
Support for Afghanistan goes beyond the exclusively political or economic principle of international cooperation, and constitutes a very real challenge for the protection of civilisation, the dignity of peoples and freedom now and in the future.
With regard to the issue of women, this is still a vast and ongoing problem, but it is helpful to point out that there are female Ministers in Afghanistan, such as the Minister for Women's Affairs, and that the First Counsellor of the Afghan Embassy in Brussels is a woman who works and actively collaborates with the government precisely in order to improve the status of women.
Finally, we cannot, in this first report on free Afghanistan, forget Commander Massoud and Europe's lethargy when he asked for help just a few months before being assassinated and before the Twin Towers tragedy.
We would therefore reiterate the call on Parliament to award him the Sakharov Prize posthumously, or better still, to establish a Massoud Prize to be bestowed on those who tragically, have lost their lives defending their people and freedom.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to hear certain reconstructions of the facts which - quite rightly - merely skim the surface of the present, while totally overlooking or pretending to overlook the past, the Taliban past, or, as in other contexts, while criticising the actions which may lead to war in Iraq and forgetting the thousands, the hundreds of thousands of people massacred, tortured and exterminated under Saddam Hussein's regime.
I would say to Mrs Morgantini that, while today there are human rights violations in Afghanistan, if we had listened to her and her friends, and the international community had refrained from intervening in Afghanistan, as they were asking us to do, there would not have been any human rights violations in that country simply because there would not have been any human rights whatsoever, just as there were none in the past.
Therefore, these ex post lessons must offset what existed in the past with what, with difficulty, the international community and the Karzai Government are trying, clearly with numerous problems, to establish.
From this point of view I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to something that happened two days ago and that I consider to be of extreme importance: the Afghan Government acceded, it ratified the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court.
This is an extraordinary fact, if you think about it, as things stand in Afghanistan, when many countries - starting with, unfortunately, the United States - are against the Court.
Well, I feel that Parliament should take note and encourage this desire to become a fully paid-up member of the international community, also in this respect, because who knows, in the future the Court could operate precisely to try crimes committed in that country.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the human suffering in Afghanistan has lasted for decades and precludes a cynical approach to these deliberations, although such would be a very tempting option.
It must be clear to us that the years since the Soviet invasion saw a country that was poor in any case progressively smashed to pieces, only then for it to tear itself apart in a civil war, before the Taliban finished off what was left.
The removal of the Taliban regime has now provided the opportunity for reconstruction.
The question arises, however, of to what extent both the military victors and the present government have the authority to achieve real stability and get reconstruction underway.
We cannot fail to observe that the stability needed to get real aid efforts to the whole of the country is not in place.
Are we not deceiving ourselves when much of the reconstruction work is going on only in Kabul?
In Kabul, non-governmental organisations are falling over each other in their efforts to get projects going in that city, the reason being that other locations are too dangerous, and so aid soon becomes concentrated on projects that do not help rebuild the country as a whole.
If, though, it proves impossible to stabilise the whole country, we can organise as many conferences of donors and so on as we like, but we will not get business to put its hands in its pocket and come up with private-sector funds for investment.
The fact is that private-sector funds for investment are forthcoming only when there is a degree of certainty, founded upon both military security and firm legal policies, that these funds can continue to be put to work and that they will not be lost.
I believe this to be a reason why this issue has to be examined in a very critical light, so that we do not end up engaging in the sort of activism that looks good but helps nobody.
The country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly, but it must then be distributed fairly.
It seems to me that there is as yet no guarantee, for example, of the Pashtuns, who make up the majority of Afghanistan's population, having a share equal to that of others in political decision-making in Kabul, or in other beneficial things.
If they do not, it appears to me that there will be a grave danger of a nascent resistance movement that new warlords could use for their own ends, so that, in spring or summer, new internal conflicts could flare up and make it even more difficult to guarantee the entire region's stability, to attract investment, and organise aid - with the country thus ending up in another vicious circle, and with us in a situation in which we can achieve even less.
The fact that soldiers from my own country are working together with others in taking charge of Afghanistan means that I am very aware of the implications when I say that the situation could indeed arise in which these conditions make things far more dangerous for individual soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan than does anything currently being planned in Iraq.
This is also a point of view that it is not wise to express openly.
Even though it is not politically correct to make this connection, I fear that this is the case or, at least, that the danger is real.
Anyone who knows Afghanistan's history will be aware that foreign troops have never felt at home there for long.
When I see how even the United States of America can no longer guarantee the safety of its troops, and how they are now starting to set up camps in certain areas into which they can withdraw at night, it reminds me of other examples.
It is for this reason that I wish to ask you to join with us in considering these facts in an open debate, in order to bring about real improvements on that basis, rather than merely giving the impression that money is being poured away even while we know it will not solve the problem in the long term.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am sure you would understand me perfectly if I spoke in German but, in honour of the Greek Presidency, I shall torment the interpreters with my Greek.
Mr President-in-Office, I fully endorse your presentation of the situation in Afghanistan.
I think we all feel a reserved satisfaction; we all see the continuing shortcomings in Afghanistan and we all know what has to be done over coming years.
You yourself referred to the lack of security, the hostilities and the production and trafficking of narcotics, as did the Commissioner, and I think that the House is in full agreement with the timetable you suggest for elections in Afghanistan and improving the situation in general.
There is no need for me to repeat what we are all agreed on.
I should like to highlight two points which should not be left out of any discussion of Afghanistan.
One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Let there be no misunderstanding: I am behind the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan or anywhere else 100%.
The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies.
It was not the European Union that trained, armed and helped the Taliban through Pakistan.
It was not us who created the forces we are now fighting against.
But the fight against terrorism, the fight against violations of human rights and terrorism against women, the fight for democracy and the rule of law is only a credible fight if it is fought within a framework of respect for human rights and respect for the right to life of people who may be terrorists or criminals.
I should like to add to today's debate on Afghanistan by mentioning two very dark sides to this war.
First, the horrendous allegations about the slaughter in Mazar-I-Sharif.
I think the UN has an obligation both to investigate and examine these allegations closely and to make known and publish the results of their enquiries.
And secondly, we should be ashamed about the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo and other detention camps run by the American military for members of the Taliban who have been arrested and people who have been imprisoned and are being called Taliban.
The European Union should do something about this, it is a disgrace.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for once I have the advantage of not talking about abstract matters but basing what I have to say on a trip that several of us made.
Together with some Socialist members of the European Parliament, I went to Afghanistan in November.
I want to say, Commissioner, that the welcome we received from the European Commission representatives on the spot and the work they are doing there can only increase the pride that you feel for all those members of the European Commission that we met, who helped us to visit the area and meet the political leaders there.
That is the first thing I wanted to say because the European Commission is doing outstanding work out there.
I remember Bonn just over a year ago.
I also remember the priority that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities gave to the necessity of putting across the importance of women's involvement in the process of organising power.
I also remember that in the European Parliament we produced a report on the role of women in armed conflicts, both as victims and as players.
I would like to speak about both at the same time.
We can speak of both at the same time today given what the Afghan population is expecting of Europe.
That is also something I want to stress: we have a responsibility to the Afghan people, who are expecting a lot from us.
Coming back to the position of women, this is a very complex problem, but at the same time what is clear is the need to be precise.
In a few weeks' time there will be an Afghan constitution.
A committee was set up in November to draft one and the nine people on that committee include two women.
But what exactly do we mean when we speak of the place of Afghan women in the constitution?
We hear talk of a return to the 1964 constitution.
I have had a look at the 1964 constitution: it is extremely vague about human rights in general and women's rights in particular.
They are saying the same thing in Afghanistan.
It is all very vague.
We know that no legal text, no constitution since the Second World War, fails to make specific mention of women's rights.
It therefore seems to me to be important, as you said, Commissioner, that we should ensure the Afghan constitution mentions women.
In my opinion, based on the talks we had on the ground, that is not a certainty.
But it is something we must press for.
That is why I am stressing this point so strongly, as I did at my various meetings in the country.
Women's rights are revealing.
They are revealing not only in times of conflict, they are also revealing in terms of the state of a society as a whole.
Remember what Fourrier used to say, that freedom for women was a measure of social change.
Mr President, the danger with foreign policy initiatives designed to counter terrorism following the 11 September disaster is that we are deluded into thinking that in the parts of the world where this strategy has been deployed everything has therefore been resolved.
The reality is, however, rather different.
In Afghanistan, most of the country outside Kabul is still under the control of warlords and regional leaders who continue to commit human rights abuses on a large scale, including torture and the disappearance of Afghan civilians.
Women's rights, as has already been mentioned, are also consistently being violated.
Along with the detention of 600 people without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that Mr Sakellariou mentioned, these are matters that we tend to forget, deluding ourselves that the problems have been and are being resolved.
In Afghanistan, in the Herat province under the governorship of Ismail Khan, the situation has deteriorated.
Whereas once there was a liberal, literary and cultural tradition, women are again being persecuted and barred from education, health care and the justice system.
Even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional autocrats.
Now many regions have reverted to a quasi-dictatorship and reconstruction funds are benefiting regional leaders who are committing human rights abuses politically and financially.
This must stop.
UNAMA, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, must stop funding these offending warlords immediately.
Some of us in the European Parliament recently saw a film by Jamie Doran, the Scottish film-maker, backing with hard evidence the existence of a mass grave in the Mazar-i-Sharif region which might contain the remains of 3 000 prisoners of war, killed and tortured by anti-Taliban forces.
This is an atrocity that members of the American forces witnessed and did not prevent.
I am glad the United Nations and the European Union have now agreed to investigate this alleged crime.
Mr President, the reconstruction of Afghanistan has not, in my view, remotely begun, despite the assurances given in the House today.
The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the burka and have no rights whatsoever, for instance to education or primary healthcare.
It is, in my view, right for the United States and the rest of the Western world to seek to destroy Al-Qaida and eliminate Osama Bin Laden, but so far they have failed.
Much has been made of women's rights in Afghanistan, but as I said , nothing has changed.
I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned.
Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Caspian Sea.
Now the question arises, how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan?
The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq, with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control.
They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells, but Afghanistan is ignored.
In a recent poll in England, 71% were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council.
No doubt as soon as the war begins, other European leaders along with Tony Blair, will bend to the will of the United States, ignoring the views of the people, which says a lot about our democracy.
The Iraqi people have suffered death and destruction for the past eleven years under the United States sanctions, as have the people of Afghanistan.
We have to look clearly at our policy in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Mr President, the situation in Afghanistan is inseparably linked with that in the Middle East, and cannot be considered in isolation from the overheated expectation of war in Iraq.
Those who are trying to establish peace in Afghanistan have to give credible proof of their primary interest in stability and the establishment of democratic structures rather than in the pacification of the region, all the better to exploit its crude oil resources or to build pipelines to siphon off Central Asia's reserves of oil and gas.
Every departure from international law under the cloak of counter-terrorism inflicts grave damage on the legal heritage of the nations, thus imperilling 200 years of work on building a society that promotes civilisation.
If the credibility of the international community in Afghanistan is to be maintained, the least that is required is independent examination of the accusations relating to the alleged massacres in Mazar-i-Sharif and the publication of the results.
In this connection, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency for having made Iraq, and the preparations for war there, core topics, and also to Mr Ionitsis, the Foreign Minister, for having spoken on Afghanistan in very clear and definite terms today.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must not let the crises - which range from North Korea to the Middle East and the unpredictability of the situation in Iraq - distract our attention from Afghanistan.
I therefore welcome the way in which the new Greek Presidency has made Afghanistan a priority issue or has the desire to do so.
Despite the fall of the Taliban regime and the installation of Hamid Karzai as the country's president, the battle for a stable Afghanistan is far from being won.
It is disconcerting to learn that Taliban warriors are again organising themselves, under the warlord Hekmatyar, with the intention of trampling the delicate bloom of constitutional democracy underfoot once more.
It is a cause for concern that the authority of the interim Karzai government extends no further than Kabul's outer perimeter, and the news of resumed opium cultivation is disturbing.
This is, in essence, a race against time, but, amid all our efforts, we must not abandon our support for the political timetable, according to which general elections will eventually be held in mid-2004.
The balance sheet of events to date can be compared to the well-known glass of water, which is either half full or half empty.
At the end of the day, we have to get used to the idea of having to provide, in the longer term, both financial and political support if democratic institutions are to have a chance of being established in this country, ravaged as it has been by war and civil strife that has lasted for decades.
This will of course also require the extension of the mandate of ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force.
I find it difficult to fathom the reasoning behind the announcement that this extension would run only until 2003, but we can welcome the way in which Germany and the Netherlands have declared their willingness to assume command of this force.
What this indicates in general terms is that it is only with much hesitation that Europeans will commit themselves to long-term involvement, and do so in small stages.
Even the many conferences in Washington, Kabul, Bonn and Oslo sometimes tend to give the impression of being sedatives, rather than expressions of an energetic policy aimed at stiffening the resolve to establish democracy in this country.
The demand that the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force be extended, along with the area under that mandate, is a justified one.
To date, alas, it has not borne much relation to reality.
In addition, all the countries bordering on Afghanistan need to cooperate in preventing the Al-Qaida network from regaining strength in the area.
A certain amount has been done about this.
Nor should we entirely abandon the idea of a real reconstruction agency along the lines of that in Kosovo.
Sending another delegation of this Parliament to Afghanistan early next year is certainly a worthwhile thing to do, but it will be meaningful only if policy reflects the insights gained from it.
That policy must include, as a priority, political help with the passing on of administrative know-how.
What is this about, first and foremost? This is about keeping civil and military power separate from each other, it is about preventing reactionary fundamentalist Islamic tendencies in the justice system, and, above all, this is about preventing humanitarian crises.
Mr President, at the invitation of UN mediator Mr Brahimi, I had the privilege of talking to the Afghan leaders at the Bonn Conference.
I was at that time chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and had listened to a representative of the Rawa organisation speaking about the position of women in Afghanistan.
I was consequently able to put to the Afghan leaders the obvious demands that women be included in the provisional and permanent governments and not marginalised in the reconstruction work.
Together with non-governmental organisations, the committee arranged a conference for women from Afghanistan.
We then presented the joint priorities in a resolution adopted by Parliament during the December 2001 part-session.
On behalf of the committee, I requested that the Committee on Budgets introduce a special supplementary item concerning aid for the women of Afghanistan, something which the Committee on Budgets and Parliament in fact went on to do.
Why am I giving you this background information?
It is because I see extremely few traces of it in the joint resolution.
There is no mention of women and their human rights.
It is the Afghan Government's priorities, rather than women's, that are mentioned in the resolution.
Nor is there any requirement that all aid projects should be informed by the dimension of equality.
Women's rights are quickly forgotten in the man's world in which we live.
The strong and pro-active Minister for Equality in the provisional Afghan Government was removed, and the role of Afghan women is now all but totally eclipsed, in spite of the fact that probably two thirds of the population consist of women and children.
I want to ask the Commission and the Council of Ministers how this is to be interpreted. Have women been forgotten again?
Are no demands concerning women being made of the Afghan Government?
Women were victims under both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban.
Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace.
A policy for Afghanistan must be a policy for the majority, that is to say for women and children.
Mr President, I might well continue where my fellow MEP, Mrs Theorin, left off.
It is as if many of the things we take very seriously when we make speeches are not really taken seriously in practice.
Women's rights and legal position are among these things.
Others are international law and human rights.
When the talk turns to Afghanistan, I find myself thinking automatically of those people, including European citizens, who are imprisoned in GuantÃ¡namo.
What has become of their rights?
What legal system do they come under?
None at all.
The United States does not respect international law - of that we are well aware - but nor does it respect its own law.
I find it bizarre that we have a resolution by Parliament that takes no account at all of the fact that a number of European citizens are in a prison camp and that we do not know for how long they will be there, what their future prospects are and what legal system they come under.
I also find this in stark contrast to the fact that, in other situations, there is a demand that international law be complied with.
A very good example is Iraq, which we demand comply with international stipulations and UN resolutions.
In that way, we give people the impression - in Afghanistan too - that there are two standards in this world, namely that which we demand that they themselves uphold and that which we, for our part, are willing to uphold, because it is we who have the power and thus, in our view, also the right to make demands.
Another area in which we face similar problems is in relation to the massacre in Mazar-i-Sharif.
There is quite a lot to suggest that there were American soldiers present.
Some people maintain that they took part in the massacre. There is much, however, to suggest that they were present.
That being said, we are doing nothing to have this matter thoroughly investigated and have the people responsible brought to trial.
I think these double standards are causing us problems.
They make matters more difficult in relation to Afghanistan and the Afghan people.
Why is it so difficult to bring about change?
To arrive in Afghanistan or Kabul is to enter a world that is exclusively male.
Men with piercing eyes scowling at women.
Some men may have changed outwardly, but on the inside they are still the same.
When you wander around the famous Chicken Street in Kabul, for example, you see women in dirty old burkas begging, children begging, men standing around chatting.
We must not forget that there is still a culture of men who think that women should not be educated.
Are there any solutions?
Yes.
In a country in which people have always fought each other, you must involve women, you must put women in a prominent position, and this must be enforced.
After all, can we imagine a society in the European Union which provides healthcare without women, where there is education without women, for example?
This is only one of many examples.
Mr President, we must not forget Afghanistan.
The community of nations has a duty to help one of its members regain full sovereignty, a member which for 30 years has suffered the most from all imaginable catastrophes; foreign invasion, civil war, the communist and Islamist yokes, drought, the implosion of the state and the installation of an international terrorist.
The elimination of the Taliban revealed a country where all the structures of the national state have to be rebuilt, starting with those for guaranteeing external and internal security, that is, a national army and national police force, which are essential if the legitimate government is to exercise its authority in every part of the country.
In a period when the basic units of the army and police are being trained, in a country where the private militias have 30 times as many men as the Afghan army, it would have been prudent to extend the International Security Assistance Force's mandate geographically, especially in the main opium-producing regions that support the warlords.
Together with France, Great Britain and Italy, who are actively involved in training the Afghan army, Europe is playing an important part in this reconstruction work, whose second priority is to rebuild a fiscal and customs administration and dismantle the system of sharing state revenue between armed groups that had come into being with foreign invasion and civil war.
Our states must be active in this field, which is also a priority; they have all the necessary expertise, Mr President.
Mr President, one year on we can take much satisfaction from what has been achieved by the Afghan people supported by the international community, but all this reveals the size of the mountain to be climbed.
It is not going to be a quick fix for Afghanistan.
It is likely that the democracies will have to maintain a commitment for many years to come.
There will be reverses that will place this commitment under severe strain.
We see the scale of the problem when we understand that the writ of President Karzai does not extend far beyond Kabul and a few other towns, and his personal security remains largely in foreign hands.
I endorse the presidency's congratulations to the Turkish armed forces, which took over the organisation and command of ISAF from the United Kingdom last June.
There is a compelling argument for the international peace-keeping force to deploy to key locations outside Kabul until the Afghan National Army is in a position to assume its responsibilities, but such forces will be highly vulnerable.
The fact is that warlords continue to hold sway in many of the more remote areas, and their commitment to peaceful development and democracy is largely non-existent.
They are interested in personal power and the fruits of criminal activity.
They can be won over - but by anyone.
Even more worrying, therefore, is the evidence of an Al-Qaida-Taliban resurgence in border areas with Pakistan, regrouping in camps on both sides of the border in alliance with local mujahedin.
This is in spite of a large American-led counter-insurgency force which operates in parallel to ISAF.
At the moment western military forces are operational in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, as well as in Afghanistan.
There will be fresh demands, not only in relation to Iraq, but in other places as well.
The fact is that all our countries need to generate more military capability and the willingness to use it in concert with America and other allies, along with other instruments.
Afghanistan's neighbours have been enormously affected by the refugee problem, but equally countries such as the United Kingdom have felt the impact.
In recent years Afghans have been the largest single national category of those claiming asylum in the United Kingdom.
In due course these people must go home.
With this in mind I welcome the Council decision of 29 November to adopt the return action plan for Afghanistan, the first application of this programme.
Finally, Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
This is a consequence of activities by the former Soviet Army and more especially by warring factions over the past ten years.
In spite of massive international financial assistance, where the European Community in particular has been a major contributor, only a small proportion of anti-personnel landmines have been cleared and the casualty rate continues to be very high.
Landmines and their suspected presence are one of the greatest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of normality.
We need to find more effective, quicker methods involving local people to overcome the scourge of landmines, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere as well.
This is not just a question of funds, this is a specific practical area where the Commission has a key role to play and needs even more focus.
Mr President, the subject of today's debate is Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement.
What we are in fact debating is several decades of Afghan history, with Bonn as just one stage in an ongoing crisis and, as we take stock, we realise that there is good news and bad news.
In cases such as these it is, in fact, the people who need to take stock, by which I mean that it makes no difference to the people whether the violence is perpetrated by the warlords or the Taliban.
In this sense, our objectives must be to establish a stable rule of law with stable institutions that allow democracy to function and everyone's rights to be respected.
A great deal of costly work needs to be done; more to the point, a long-term strategy is needed.
The question is: do all the forces operating in the area have a common strategy?
We have talked about the European Union, be it of the 15 or 25, but we have said nothing about, for example, Russia's, America's or Pakistan's plans for the area.
Are they with us or do they have a separate agenda, in which case our common objectives may not be so common after all.
Under these circumstances, as we take stock, we see that there is a great deal of cause for satisfaction: the situation is not the same as it was a year ago, but we still need to worry on a number of counts; are we perhaps turning back the clock and will situations return which should not return?
So it might be a good idea to take stock of a few basic facts, such as the increase in crime, the operational limits of the state, whatever form it takes, and where the European taxpayers' money is going.
Because, if memory serves me well, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for example, said that 80% of the money was being used by non-governmental organisations working in the area in order to stay afloat and only 20% was going to the country.
If this is true, the best thing we can do for institutional development, democratisation and stabilisation is to involve as many Afghan citizens as possible.
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, the strategic importance of Afghanistan cannot be overestimated.
A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bulwark against the resurgence of extremism in the region.
One year after the Bonn Conference, it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU's contribution in restoring peace, stability and credible political structures.
Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year.
EU funds have been used to finance health clinics and primary schools, the clearance of landmines, the return of key public service workers, the creation of jobs to combat the opium production that is spiralling in post-Taliban Afghanistan, the rebuilding of infrastructures, clean-up operations in 7 cities and support for the return of the 1.8 million or so refugees returning to the country.
This in an impressive list and the Commission, ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit.
However, on the general issue of aid, it is important to point out that, although the total aid from the international community may seem enormous when compared to other areas in crisis, Afghanistan is at the bottom of the pile when we look at aid given per capita.
The average aid pledges to Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $250 per person, as against $75 for Afghanistan.
The international community should take note of this.
As the Commissioner himself pointed out, investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards.
Given our strong record on aid, I believe we have the moral authority to put pressure on our international partners to translate their verbal pledges into money.
We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction.
The EU has done a lot, but we cannot become complacent or allow the problems of Afghanistan to be sidelined by the prospect of war with Iraq or problems with North Korea.
We have a moral obligation to create permanent peace and stability, tackle the problem of the warlords, improve human rights, especially, as other speakers have pointed out, women's rights, and establish real democracy in Afghanistan.
Much still needs to be done.
The holding of democratic elections next year, the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction.
Mr President, although it was a year ago that Afghanistan's Taliban regime was toppled, there has been scarcely any improvement in the appalling position of women there.
That became convincingly apparent to the first five-man delegation from this House, instigated by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who recently visited Afghanistan - not only Kabul, but also up-country.
The health care system is a disaster, and an Afghan woman dies, either as a result of pregnancy or in childbirth, every 20 minutes.
That is the highest rate recorded worldwide.
The education system had collapsed utterly.
Today, girls' schools are again vulnerable to attacks by fundamentalists.
Most Afghan women are barred from taking up employment, and they have little or no share in political power or in the work of reconstruction.
We had discussions with President Karzai and with many members of his cabinet, and appealed to them in unambiguous terms for the Petersberg resolutions to be implemented only with women participating in the proper way.
The European Union is helping in so far as it is able.
I want to reiterate that the Commission is doing excellent work on the ground, in that - as Commissioner Patten has said - its officials on the ground are playing a very substantial part in nation-building, and doing so with the greatest personal dedication, for which they deserve our especial thanks.
Let us take a look into the future.
I urge Parliament's Bureau to invite both President Karzai and the chair of the independent human rights commission, Dr. Sima Samar, to Parliament with the prime purpose of our discussing with them the preparations for the elections and for the Loja Jirga that is to produce a constitution.
The clear message to a democratic Afghanistan must be that this constitution must, without reservations, give women's rights a solid base.
It is difficult to get back to normality in a country in which, according to one American study, 70% of all Afghan women suffer from severe depression and 65% keep contemplating suicide.
The subject of sexual violence is shrouded in strict social taboos.
We heard complaints from women's organisations to the effect that their work, even in the international organisations, was made extremely difficult by restrictions on women's mobility, including their being prohibited from driving cars or even riding bicycles.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has taken up this issue on many occasions.
We had discussions with the Minister for Women, Mrs Sobrani - the deputy minister, as it happens - and she complained that she received no financial resources for her department.
The lack of coordination leads to friction costs in the work of the NGOs and government offices.
This is somewhere else where we must help.
It is unfortunate that there is still no banking system in Afghanistan, and this is another factor that continues to encourage corruption.
It does, however, give me great satisfaction to learn that there is strong consensus here in this House, within the presidency and the Commission, that the position of women needs to be improved.
Let us, then, set about improving the position of women, hoping for peace and stability in the region!
And the message to our American friends must be: no war in the Middle East!
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish to give a brief but warm welcome to the third year of the D. E. Montemurro National School of Media, from Gravina, in Apulia, which has been awarded the 'Let's Build Europe Together' prize, established by the Italian Chamber of Deputies.
The main aim of this initiative is to promote the involvement of our younger citizens in the debate on the future of Europe.
We therefore offer these young people our congratulations on having gained first place in this competition and we also congratulate them on their attentive involvement in the work being undertaken in the plenary sitting.
Well done!
Mr President, I too have had the unique experience of visiting Afghanistan and seeing the situation with my own eyes.
The first thing that needs to be said is that our staff are doing an excellent job, as you yourself said, Commissioner, and the European Union has a high profile there.
However, a year after Bonn, I think coordination is a serious problem, both in the provision and distribution of aid and, more to the point, the policy being applied.
By which I mean that the European Union is following one political tack and supporting a strong central administration in Afghanistan, while the United States are taking a different approach and sticking to their favourite tactic of divide and rule from the days of the Taliban and the Mujahedin by backing the warlords, who they seem to think have taken their side.
Mr Morillon and Mr Sakellariou said likewise.
Unfortunately, the upshot of this divisive western policy is that entire areas are beyond the control of the central administration and this is precisely what caused the recent surge in the production of opium, which accounted for 70% of world production in 2002.
Women, of course, are still in a dire situation in all sectors.
Blue ghosts continue to waft round the streets of Kabul, with few women daring to risk their lives by taking off their burka.
The Taliban may have lost power, but their spirit still haunts Afghanistan.
In my opinion, there can be no economic or social progress as long as a culture of violence, religious fanaticism and misogyny reigns in Afghanistan.
98% of women are illiterate and economically dependent and 99% give birth without medical assistance.
This sort of soil provides an ideal breeding ground for extremist movements such as the Taliban.
I think the Greek Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, could do a great deal to help by proposing that a European fund be set up and a line included in the 2004 budget especially for women in Afghanistan.
This fund could be used to finance new infrastructures to integrate women into public life.
I also suggest, Commissioner, that we should invite President Karzai to Strasbourg to speak before a plenary session of the European Parliament.
Mr President, there are so many worrying things on the international scene that ought to spur us to action that we no longer know which way to look.
Let us not forget Afghanistan, which today is beginning to look like a caricature, a caricature of the US imperium.
It is clearly a misfortune for any nation to be in a geostrategic or petrostrategic area like the Afghan people are, and this has obviously been the case for a long time.
They have endured the British empire, they have endured the Soviet empire; today they are enduring the US empire, but in spite of everything there is a great difference in the nature of things today because, armed as it is with its clear conscience, the US empire can get away with anything, to the point, for example, of calling a wedding party an armed band and destroying a whole village as we saw a few months ago.
Since 11 September, the country has in fact been a caricature of a clear conscience.
We have not even had the courage - because Europe has clearly abandoned the idea of playing any role other than humanitarian aid - to denounce the fraud of destroying half a country because a criminal takes refuge there.
If one day some hothead came from the US and fled to the US after destroying one of the towers in the la DÃ©fense district in Paris, it would not occur to me to recommend that my government go and destroy part of the United States of America and then appoint a governor there.
I say governor because Mr Karzai is clearly little more than a US governor.
I hope that one day Europe will want to play a part, that Europe will stop following the lead of the US, that Europe will at least stop preventing the Member States from playing their own part.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for what they have told us today.
I too, like other fellow Members, recently went to Afghanistan with a European Parliament delegation and I can bear witness to the truth of the things reported by Commissioner Patten.
Let us not forget that we found a country ravaged by 23 years of war and years of drought.
The progress made in one year since the first Bonn Conference is truly remarkable, and likewise we should applaud the determination, selflessness and competence of our Commission officials in Kabul.
All this is true: schools have been opened, they have started to rebuild some health facilities; valuable work is being done, particularly in terms of supporting the administration.
In this connection, I would like to urge Commissioner Patten not to abandon the aspect of specific personnel training, including for customs officers, which is fundamental.
It is also true, however - and the last Bonn Conference showed this to some degree - that the most committed donor countries are asking the Karzai Government to show more determination.
There has been some criticism: reforms announced by the Karzai Government itself have been delayed; even though a commission has been appointed to draw up the new Constitution, it is being obstructed by religious issues, by minorities, whereas it needs to go ahead, especially with a specific acknowledgement of women's rights too; security is still a serious problem; there is no judicial system and there is no national defence force; an operative police force is still lacking.
All this is true.
The European Union, which has done a great deal, must therefore persevere on these issues.
Lastly - a final word on women's rights - I would like to refer here, to the European Parliament, to the appeal which the Minister, Mrs Sarabi, made to us: each donor country has chosen a specific area of intervention; however, no one has chosen the specific issue of women's rights.
This is an urgent appeal that I am making to the European Union and to us all lest we forget this: there is no chance of making progress or finding a way out of this situation unless women are directly involved in this process.
Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the debate we have had, for the support they have expressed for many of the Presidency's thoughts and proposals and for the Commission's thoughts and proposals, even though they do not come within my jurisdiction.
We have set out a whole series of useful proposals.
I must say that I agree that the role of the administration needs to extend beyond Kabul city limits if there is to be greater stability and normalisation in the country as a whole, that the mission of the ISAF needs to be extended so that it can work along the same political lines and, thirdly, that human rights must be respected, be they women's rights, prisoners' rights or adversaries' rights.
We have a history of respect for human rights for institutional, historic and cultural reasons.
It is a tradition in Europe and we must respect it wherever necessary.
The debate as a whole has shown that what we want to create in Afghanistan, as everyone knows, is a country in which the values of democracy and freedom take hold and the potential for economic development and confidence is realised.
History has taught us that this is a long, hard process in any country and I know of no other country in which such huge changes have come about in such a short space of time.
We, for our part, need to show political determination, we need to provide economic, political and humanitarian assistance, but we also need to be realistic about what we can do, how far we can go, what the prevailing circumstances are, what difficulties the people there face, what balances need to be respected, what values hold sway and how we can provide help in the right direction.
We are still a long way from being able to say that the game in Afghanistan has been won.
We are only a short way down the line and we still have a great deal to do over a very long period of time.
Developments in Afghanistan will be influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external.
We need to look at individual concerns, what is happening with the constitution, what is happening on the humanitarian and numerous other fronts, and we need to take an overall view and apply an overall strategy as to how we can influence developments.
Success cannot be measured by one criterion alone or by a number of individual criteria which we might mention, and several have been mentioned, be they institutional or individual rights or economic progress.
Success will be measured by simultaneous progress on a number of political, institutional, social and economic fronts in Afghanistan.
I will be very brief in responding to a debate which has ranged extremely wide.
Mr Andrews' contribution covered not only Afghanistan but Iraq.
If he had been able to stay until the end of the debate, I would have said that I fear we will have further opportunities to discuss Iraq and he may be able to take part.
I would like to thank Members such as Mrs Fraisse who praised the work done by our officials in Kabul and beyond.
They do have a difficult job.
It is not the easiest assignment to manage our programme there.
I will certainly pass on the commendation of Members.
I would also like to express once again my agreement with Mr van Orden that we are in this for the long haul.
There are no quick fixes in Afghanistan.
We have to go on repeating that.
We cannot simply call what we have done so far success and move on to the next failed state.
There is a great deal for us to do, not least, as Mrs Fraisse said, in helping to create a public service in Afghanistan which will be able to deliver the sort of services we would want to see to the whole community.
The quality of some of the members of the Afghan diaspora who have returned to Afghanistan gives one a good deal of confidence in what could be achieved in that country.
I could mention Mr Ghani and many other Afghans who have gone back to their country to help reconstruct it after the years of medieval ferocity to which its people of Afghanistan have been subjected.
So I can assure Mrs Fraisse that we shall continue to give proper attention to support and training for public services.
We have, more than most other donors in Afghanistan, provided budgetary assistance for the ordinary business of government.
It is not a very attractive, or sexy thing for donors to do.
Donors typically like to have projects and like to have blue plaques on walls and flags over buildings.
But unless there is a decent public administration in Afghanistan, unless there are nurses and teachers and doctors and police officers, men and women, and unless those people are paid regularly, there will not be a government that can extend its authority over the whole country.
So I continue to defend the priority that we give to that.
One would have to be deaf not to recognise the concern the House has expressed about women's rights as part of a general concern about human rights.
I could go through a list of the projects that we are helping to support, such as the park for women in Kabul, but I will merely say that I think the best way of reflecting Parliament's concern is to raise this issue at the meeting of the Afghanistan Development Forum in March, when we should be monitoring progress.
We will emphasise then that this Parliament, which votes this money so intelligently and generously, wants us to ensure that the issue of women's rights is at the heart of the government's approach to development.
Let me just say one other word about donor coordination, because several speakers have referred to that and I only touched on it in general terms in my opening remarks.
I fully agree that development aid to Afghanistan must be used to maximum effect and that effective coordination is critical.
The Afghan Government has now put in place the structures to coordinate donors.
The October implementation group meeting in Kabul agreed to move to a consultative group structure, which is the one that we typically put in place in countries receiving substantial assistance from the international donor community.
We strongly support this initiative.
It should ensure that donors are well-coordinated and that funds are targeted to the priorities agreed by the consultative group.
We have also established an informal European donor forum to help develop a coordinated European Union approach to key issues and meetings and there is also an informal donor network between the European Commission and the Member States, the United States and Japan.
Through ECHO, the Commission has had extensive experience of operating in Afghanistan over the last ten years and has established close working relationships with non-governmental organisations.
As the crisis in Afghanistan unfolded, the key priority was to deliver humanitarian support quickly and effectively, but now looking to the future, it will be important to ensure that all donors operate within the framework and priorities set by the consultative group.
So we are aware of these concerns.
We want to do more about them and, as I said in my opening speech, I intend to pursue this when, God willing, I visit Afghanistan next month.
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2003), by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (PE-CONS 3668/2002 - C5-0557/2002 - 2000/0077(COD)).
Mr President, you are right to say that today sees the third reading of the report on cosmetics, a topic to which - as will be known to most of us - Parliament has now been repeatedly returning over the space of ten years.
By far and away most of the proposals, both in this parliamentary session and in the last one, concern themselves with a ban on experiments on animals and on the sale of products tested on animals.
These areas have been the subject of the most controversy, and, indeed, still are. Both within the European Union and outside it, the most controversial issue was about whether experiments on animals would continue to be permitted in the future in connection with toothpaste and shampoos.
Controversy continued to rage around the issue of whether a product that had been tested on animals could still be sold. It was said over and over again in this House that the only way to prevent tests being exported was to couple a ban on testing with a ban on the marketing - and hence the sale - of the products.
Both in the first and second readings of this seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive, that was the crucial issue, but, both in the competent committee and here in this House, we made the point that cosmetics and cosmetic products are of immediate relevance to the protection of consumers.
We pointed out that, for example, the information on a product's useful life was of importance to consumers, who were to be told for how long they could use a cosmetic product once it had been opened.
That was one of the points on which this House made proposals at first and second reading.
This House's final demand - one that I was happy to endorse as rapporteur - was that hazardous products, those known to be carcinogenic, to affect the reproductive system or to be mutagenic, should not be permitted to be used in cosmetics.
These proposals were what, in essence, our second reading was about.
All of them gave rise to controversy.
Although they passed through second reading by a very large majority, the Commission did not exactly welcome us with open arms.
Today, though, at third reading, we can permit ourselves some self-congratulation, because the conciliation procedure was, I have to say, difficult.
Over the years, I have had direct or indirect experience of many conciliation procedures. In this one, I started out uncertain as to whether we would achieve a compromise.
We did.
The outcome is that a ban on testing cosmetics on animals will be in place - six years after the legislation is adopted. There will be a sales ban on most of the products still containing ingredients tested on animals - six years after the legislation is adopted.
We have also said that there will be a derogation for three tests, the development of alternatives to which is not yet in sight.
The cosmetics industry is not entirely blameless in this.
That so little has been done to develop these tests is partly due to the cosmetics industry having been, in the past, what we might call dozy.
But we are now giving them an incentive, and a certain amount of time, to come up with alternatives.
Let me make it clear that what we have achieved is a compromise, a compromise which, like all others, is not ideal.
I am aware that the cosmetics industry finds it less than ideal, and also that the animal welfare organisations are convinced that more could have been achieved.
I have had to keep on telling our friends in the animal welfare organisations that if they can find someone who can achieve more, they should get them down here and let them get on with it.
My fellow-Members and I have tried to get a workable solution accepted, and so let me conclude by saying that I am grateful to the outgoing Danish Presidency, whose cooperation with us has been excellent, and also to the Commission, which had become cooperative by the end.
Mr Liikanen, I wish it had done so a bit sooner, but at least it was never too late.
I will also express my thanks to our colleagues in the Conciliation Committee, and to all those with whom we dealt during the conciliation procedure.
This all adds up to one of the reasons why I love this Parliament so much, and why I would not wish to be a member of any other.
The cooperation between Members of every nation and political group was open, decorous, frank and supportive to such an extent that I am convinced that you will not find the like of it in any legislature in the world.
It was a joy to work through the night with you until twenty past four in the morning.
It was a joy to achieve this outcome and to have been allowed to be your rapporteur.
So I again want to thank most especially the colleagues who have always, and repeatedly, assured me of their support, even when conditions were rather less favourable on every side.
Madam President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to Members for their interest in this proposal, especially to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, rapporteur, for her constructive work. Also to members of the European Parliament delegation in the Conciliation Committee.
I am happy to hear that Mrs Roth-Behrendt is not only committed to the issue but she even likes conciliations at night; there are very few who take this kind of pleasure in the institutional work.
Because the conciliation is about be concluded successfully, the Commission welcomes this agreement which provides a clear framework for tests on animals in the cosmetic sector.
The solution found offers a genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments.
The solution of making mandatory the use of all alternative methods at the earliest opportunity, and as soon as scientifically validated, is a good improvement for animal welfare and sends a clear political signal.
For the Commission, one of the key elements is the incentive to be given to the development of alternative methods, and the improvement of the validation process.
On that subject, the European Union has to play a leading role in promoting the development of animal testing at international level.
This will be done with due regard to the development of validation within the OECD.
Let me point out, however, that many other important aspects are included.
Firstly, the provisions aiming to improve health and consumer protection, in particular through more relevant information to consumers.
Secondly, the improvement of safety requirements for products for children and for intimate hygiene.
Thirdly, the introduction of the labelling requirement for an after-opening date as well as the labelling of allergenic fragrance ingredients.
All those aspects are clearly of benefit to the consumer.
In conclusion, we have to note that a lot of work has been done to achieve a satisfactory result for everyone and I hope that this important directive can now be finalised.
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations and conclude with a warning.
I congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who has achieved so much over this long process.
Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties, she would not have achieved so much.
It helps sometimes to be a little ignorant of the difficulties.
This proposal puts animal welfare above human vanity, but never above human health.
It sets time limits, graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved, and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected.
I also want to thank the Commission for carrying out its intermediary role, mindful of law and precedent, but also of the strong views of this Parliament which have been echoed here under three different Commissions, for more than ten years.
To come to this final conclusion is an enormous satisfaction for all of us.
My colleagues on the Conciliation Committee expressed the long frustrations of this process in that last marathon session.
It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired.
A new model strip cartoon has just been distributed to Members showing how exciting the work of the European Parliament is, with glamorous young male and female characters.
If there is another edition of this series, it should deal with the long night with Mrs Roth-Behrendt at the end of these proceedings.
I also want to thank the Danish presidency.
One often sees a presidency looking at a problem firmly in the eye, and then running away.
The Danes knew that they could get a deal and they got it - through great skill in my opinion.
This was a deal - I want to say this before going on to a word of warning - that meets Parliament's principal concerns.
It sticks.
It is a signal for action, and not an argument for delay.
The animal welfare organisations which campaigned tirelessly for this outcome should not complain about the compromise that we achieved.
The spotlight is now on compliance, with a provision to find alternative tests, especially in the most difficult areas of toxicity.
None of us should make any apologies for how we came to be in this place today.
I am personally proud of the fact that the rapporteur got us through this procedure and it enhances the reputation of Parliament, not merely for its procedures but also for their effectiveness.
President, this Parliament, by huge cross-party majorities, has made clear that it will no longer accept that animals should be made to suffer for the sake of developing yet more products to flatter human vanity.
It is a moral issue; human health will be protected, because after the deadlines for the end of animal testing, new cosmetic products simply cannot be put on the market until alternative testing methods are in place.
This is the seventh amendment to the original directive; each time the deadline drew near an extension of time was granted to the industry, so incentives to invest in the development of alternatives were removed.
We are today drawing a line that must not again be shifted.
Animal welfare groups are unhappy with the outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council, but I hope they recognise that real progress has been made.
The Commission's proposal has been transformed, there will be a complete ban on animal testing within the EU and a ban on the sale of cosmetics tested on animals outside the EU, six years after entry into force.
Month after month, ministers told us that such a marketing ban would be contrary to WTO rules, but these objections were at last overcome during our middle-of-the-night negotiations.
I pay tribute to our rapporteur Dagmar Roth-Berendt, and I thank our chief lobbyists Marlou Heinen of the RSPCA, Emily McIvor of BUAV, and Charles Laroche of Unilever who presented the acceptable face of an industry many have grown to mistrust.
There are practical steps now to be taken.
In particular the authorisation procedures for new testing methods must be accelerated.
Pressure to develop alternatives must now be put on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, which use the same tests.
The cosmetics industry should recognise the strength of feeling in this Parliament.
The directive permits no postponement of the deadlines, and the Commission must understand that if it comes back in a few years' time with proposals for new legislation to extend the time limits yet again it will meet with a very hostile response.
Madam President, as we all know, it was the issue of a comprehensive and rapid ban on animal experiments carried out in the context of cosmetics testing that was the big issue in this conciliation.
The agreement we reached has encountered criticism from many quarters.
Animal protection organisations, in particular, have criticised it on the grounds that it will take too long to implement the ban.
I agree with that criticism.
I think we could have made faster progress.
It is, however, important to criticise those who deserve criticism.
If it had been the European Parliament that had decided the issue, matters would in fact have proceeded more quickly, and the ban might already have been in place by now.
The fact is that the body that should be criticised in this case is the EU Council of Ministers.
Certain Member States, in particular, did everything to delay the ban.
It is the European Parliament that should have the credit for the ban's being introduced.
The person who definitely deserves most praise in this context is our rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I have rarely seen more energetic, competent and vigorous leadership of a parliamentary delegation in a conciliation, and it felt very good being able to collaborate with Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I should like to thank her for her brilliant efforts.
Madam President, the prohibition of the use of carcinogenic substances in cosmetics in the future is a great success for this Parliament.
We Greens have campaigned hard for this.
While this was a cause close to our heart, we also know that this position could never have gained majority support without great commitment on the part of the rapporteur, who made our demands her own.
So a great deal of gratitude is owed to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, particularly for this position, one that was of enormous importance to us.
It is my belief that the Council at first attempted to wait for a risk assessment, in order thereby to leave carcinogenic substances on the market.
That was utterly unacceptable, and we are therefore glad that the Council has abandoned its 'wait and see' approach, for there is no room in cosmetics for carcinogenic substances.
Not only is it obvious and a matter of common sense that nobody wants carcinogenic substances in face creams, but that is also the view of the Scientific Committee.
We are also very glad that, in future, hazardous ingredients will have to be listed, and their quantity stated, on cosmetic products, and we will certainly have to be very vigilant in monitoring the implementation of Parliament's demand for information on substances hazardous to health to be made accessible to the public, whether that be in a public register or by some other means.
Although it is a bitter pill for us to swallow that the current marketing ban is to be extended by another five years as regards eleven tests and deferred for ten years in respect of three others, this is still a great forward advance in view of the Member States' unwillingness to implement it and of the subsequent attempt at even completely abolishing the marketing ban, which we were successful in resisting.
There are now clear and realistic criteria for the development and marketing of alternative tests, so that Parliament can count this as one of its great triumphs, not only for animal welfare, but also for consumers.
Madam President, conciliation has brought a result which, in the end, satisfies no one.
Animal rights advocates think the text does not go far enough, manufacturers do not think they can keep to the time limits and consumers do not understand what has been decided, especially about animal experimentation, which is at the heart of the directive.
By banning experimentation and the marketing of products tested on animals six years after it comes into force, with no possibility of extension, the directive puts the cosmetics industry's back against the wall and undermines its ability to innovate.
Nevertheless, from the start of negotiations it has been our common desire to put healthy, hypoallergenic cosmetics on the market, to prevent needless suffering to animals and to preserve the jobs, competitiveness and know-how of our high value-added exporting firms.
The cut-off date adopted in the directive will, however, in our opinion mean that the safety of the products placed on the market can no longer be guaranteed - they will not in fact have undergone a full range of tests affording the same guarantees as the tests carried out on animals - European products will be penalised on the markets of those third countries that continue to perform animal experiments, which are the only completely reliable ones today, and there will be a risk of WTO sanctions, since it may regard the ban as a barrier to the marketing of cosmetics manufactured outside the European Union.
It is generally accepted that few alternative methods will be found within 10 years but that the total replacement of animal experiments might be possible within about 15 years.
In my opinion it would have been more realistic to agree on a ban in ten years' time, with an exemption for three types of test, those relating to reproductive toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicity in the case of repeated applications.
Nevertheless, there are a few positive points, such as showing on the packaging how long the products may be used after opening and the possible presence of allergenic ingredients; these specific measures will improve consumer protection.
Finally, I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time, while others, like the 1979 ''Birds'' directive and the ''Habitats'' directive, which is ten years old now, have still not been revised at all.
Madam President, my dear Dagmar, I have to tell Mr Barnier that, when I came into the plenary, I was still in a good mood.
No doubt it is my fault that I have been unaware of your existence in recent years.
At any rate, you have had nothing to say for the whole of the debate on cosmetics, and, if you are going to go away today and say that everything went wrong, I cannot recall you having made any serious or creditable contribution to this debate.
My dear Dagmar, a veritable fanfare of compliments has been sounded in your honour today. It is one in which I am happy to join.
Having done well, you have earned it, and it was our great good fortune to be allowed to spend whole nights in your company - and how many can boast of that?
Every directive has, of course, its pros and cons.
We have not yet slammed the door shut, but I believe that we have made a great advance by saying that the cut-off point will be at the end of a period of time - in 2009 as far as I am concerned.
I know perfectly well from my study of the market economy, Mr Barnier, that industry needs facts and data in order to be able to plan ahead - and there is nothing you can teach us on that score.
Today, industry will go away and take on young people - researchers, doctors, engineers - whose job will be to look for alternatives.
That is precisely what management needs, and that is why this is the right way to go.
Mr Liikanen, you know that, much as I respect you, your office sometimes puts forward wearisome proposals.
Now, though, you are on the right track, and I would like to give you strong encouragement to stand firm when it comes to the question of whether or not all this is acceptable to the WTO.
And stand firm you certainly will, for you know that the whole serried ranks of this House are behind you.
That means, I believe, that another solid success will be ours.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have no need of three minutes.
Europe and her people's representatives have grasped that animals are to be valued in a different way.
I cannot but go along with that, and we will do everything to ensure a respectable and credible reduction in the number of experiments on animals.
That there has to be, yet again, one small category in which such tests must still be carried out, is something that we accept, and that I believe to be necessary, but the great number of them must be brought down, never to increase again.
The victory is yours, Mrs Roth-Behrendt - congratulations!
Madam President, I want to begin by saying a big thank you to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her skilful and very consistent work on the directive. I certainly also enjoyed working into the night with Dagmar.
It looked very difficult at the beginning.
There were a number of Member States and also parts of industry that did everything to block decent rules concerning animal experiments. Thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's and others' stubbornness, however, acceptable results were in actual fact achieved in two areas.
The first of these was in relation to animal experiments.
We are now to have bans imposed on animal experiments and on the marketing of new products developed by means of animal experiments.
Where most experiments are concerned, the ban will apply in six years' time; but, unfortunately, the bans on three areas, or methods, of experimentation will only apply in ten years' time, and then with a risk of the deadline's also being extended.
It might of course be said that both deadlines are too far in the future.
That is also what we have said here in Parliament but, as we know from the negotiations, there were some Member States that simply blocked the experiments concerned being halted more quickly.
