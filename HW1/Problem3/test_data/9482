I should like to remind the Commissioner, however, that we must also consider the following aspects in order to meet these objectives.
Firstly, unnecessary administration and red tape within the European Union must be eliminated.
European institutions must reduce and simplify legislation governing businesses operating in the industrial sector, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
National legislation should play the key role, while the European Unionâs industrial policy should be limited only to necessary coordination and harmonisation.
Secondly, emphasis must be given to supporting and encouraging small and medium-sized businesses in the industrial sector.
The SME sector has provided clear evidence of its flexibility, and the latter is the key prerequisite for attaining a necessary and sustainable degree of competitiveness, both in Europe and on the global market.
This is why I cannot entirely agree with the policy of supporting ânational championsâ.
This approach of supporting the creation of a small number of large dominant companies would obviously tie up significant funding from the EU budget, and would probably violate the principles of healthy competition, without there being any guarantee of it having a positive impact on the competitiveness of such companies.
Thirdly, small and medium-sized companies in the industrial sector need new incentives for further technological development, research and innovation.
The planned programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and others, must, however, be much more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises than has been the case to date.
More structural funds must also be allocated to less-developed regions and the new Member States, in order to enable them to build adequate technical infrastructures with a view to improving the industrial base in these regions.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Vlasto report contains mature and balanced deliberations that mark a new stage in the debate on Europeâs industrial policy, which is currently in crisis.
At the same time, citizens are expressing irrational fears and frustrations, for example in the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
Outsourcing has become a fact of life.
Even though ostensible economic justifications are put forward for this phenomenon, there can be no question that it is harmful to society.
Whenever we discuss outsourcing, however, we must remember that this term covers a variety of practices, including both outsourcing within the EU, which brings advantages in terms of positive synergy, and outsourcing outside the EU, which brings nothing but disadvantages.
What the EU needs is a homogeneous market in products and services that is highly competitive in global terms and highly innovative.
Two types of mechanisms exist for enhancing competitiveness.
The first are simple mechanisms that limit the benefits of the so-called European social model, and the second are complex mechanisms based on intellectual and social capital that serve as a foundation for organisational, technological, technical and market innovation.
Europe should follow the examples of Japan and late-1960s Europe by relocalising, or in other words by bringing modern production activities and capital back to the common European market.
Such relocalisation is urgently needed in order to protect intellectual property, to help Europe regain its lead in the field of know-how, to create jobs and to enhance the competitiveness of European capital.
All these things are possible, but they are dependent on Europe extricating itself from stagnation and bringing about GDP growth of at least several percentage points.
A number of instruments exist that would undoubtedly encourage relocalisation.
Contrary to the views of those for whom the proverbial Polish plumber and bricklayer mean nothing but fear and frustration, these include the full liberalisation of commercial services, as advocated by the Polish socialists.
They also include the establishment of industrial clusters around centres of innovation and the introduction of the principle that all government purchases should be âmade in Europeâ.
An EU directive would need to be drafted on this last point.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrsÂ Vlasto for this report.
It is one of some importance for me, as I myself ran a business in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector for many years.
The experience I gained in this field means that I can take a practical approach to European competitiveness and the SME sector.
It is my belief that the European economy is in urgent need of genuine competition and of developing a better understanding of economic issues amongst the citizens of Europe.
The first of these tasks was enshrined in the Lisbon strategy among the EUâs key objectives, one of the aims of which was to eliminate economic differences between the old and the new Member States.
Businesses from the new Member States, and in particular the SME sectors in these countries, which are both flexible and capable of adapting to changing conditions, offer significant potential for economic development in Europe.
A number of conditions have to be met before this potential can be tapped, however.
These include doing away with existing obstacles to the internal market, of which there are currently around 90, the creation of an environment that is more conducive to SME start-ups and the linking of wages to labour productivity and efficiency.
I believe that employment levels will rise if we create a climate that is conducive to the development of the SME sector, and if we simplify regulations and adopt new ones.
Liberalisation of the market in services will serve as a further catalyst for economic development in Europe, and also represents a source of new jobs.
Furthermore, I believe that public understanding of economic issues must be improved.
People will only stop fearing change and see that change is necessary for improved quality of life if they can understand the economic mechanisms that impact on their lives.
Developing a knowledge-based economy is the only means of enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy.
This means investment in research, development and business-based innovation, as SME development will only be achieved on the back of such investment.
There is therefore a need for education and training systems that reflect the needs of the labour market, and for the idea of life-long learning to gain public acceptance.
This report may well be a key factor in the development of the European economy and genuine free competition.
I will therefore vote in favour of it, and I would suggest that the SME sector be acknowledged as the driving force behind the economy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing takes on particular importance at a time like this, when a large part of Europe is in a situation of economic and social difficulties.
Those difficulties are undermining the European Unionâs competitiveness, and highlight a gap in productivity compared with the United States and Japan, low levels of investment and research and development, low levels of innovation, particularly as regards high technology, and the delocation of research activities.
All of this needs to be addressed.
Over and again, we have said that it needs to be done by relaunching the Lisbon Strategy, but that Strategy will continue to fade away if we do not invest seriously and forcefully in industrial policy.
I must say, Commissioner, that the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is still below expectations.
It seems to be a summary of what already exists, whilst what we need are significant innovations.
This evening we heard that you will present a new communication: we hope that it contains the required innovations.
Choices need to be made in the context of general economic policy, completing the internal market and the reform policies on government administration, and the taxation system and infrastructures.
Aside from that, however, a governance plan needs to be worked on, in order to enable all of the existing institutional levels to interact in cooperation with one another.
There needs to be awareness of the necessity of investing in sectoral policies and in horizontal policies in order to promote small and medium-sized enterprises, which form a substantial part of the European Union.
Finally, the so-called virtuous circles â universities, industrial districts and research laboratories â need to be built and enlarged.
I am talking about innovation âincubatorsâ, which are vital to industrial policy.
In short, we need to change up a gear â as soon as possible â if we want the European Union to become the more competitive and dynamic area that we have outlined as an objective for some time.
Â Â  â Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Vlasto, achieved very broad agreement in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
She has illuminated every corner, but this report â like so many things that we adopt here â lacks the spark that is needed to ignite a new industrial policy.
I should like to say how much I agree with Mr Libicki: the regulatory framework still needs scrutinising, which is why this report, to my regret, will be unable to have the effect that it really needs.
Mr Verheugen said that, as part of the better lawmaking project, the Commission will, in future, say ânoâ more often, specifically to Parliament and the Member States.
He forgot to mention the Commission itself.
You could make a start there, by going through those proposals that have not been implemented for fifteen years, by implementing competitiveness in consumer protection and environmental protection within the Commission itself.
These are starting points enough and, in my opinion, every European measure, as the President of the Commission once suggested, should pass three tests: the cost test, the competitiveness test and the subsidiarity test.
On this point, I agree with Mr HudackÃœ, who said that there should be no regulation in areas for which the nation states have jurisdiction.
The question before us is how Europe decides between competing and cutting itself off.
Does increased competitive pressure act as a fitness programme for Europe's economy or has the old Europe long been economically sidelined?
The challenges are huge.
It is my belief that the core of Europe is too full for international competition and is therefore opting to cut itself off and be sidelined.
That is where we must start.
Europe is under competitive pressure from above and from below.
On the one hand, we are too expensive and, on the other hand, we are not productive enough in order to be able to afford the high costs.
That will only be improved by the new incoming national economies.
The new Member States are bringing us this competition.
That is the important gift of enlargement: more competition and hence a proper industrial policy.
This is what we urgently need, not more new European programmes that get us nowhere and ultimately obscure the regulatory framework.
Â Â  Mr President, I am a believer in three things: the European economy, European industry and the ability of European industry to be competitive.
Unfortunately, however, we often applaud the notion of competitivity, while supporting initiatives which erode that very competitivity.
For instance, the Commissioner has rightly indicated that we sometimes tend to be over-regulated and this adds to bureaucracy and to the cost of production.
Sometimes we are not aware that we are eroding competitivity by our own ideas and legislation.
Recently, we lowered the limit in the Working Time Directive.
This is obviously something which is paradoxical to competitivity.
Sometimes we talk about investments in technological innovation and we are dependent on private-public partnership.
That is the way the argument is put forward.
Europe is not an ideal model for private-public partnership.
We try to restrict research on the basis of vague moral issues.
Finally, as well as encouraging further investment in innovation and research, there is a trend against patents.
We must realise that we have to choose our priorities.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to welcome this refreshing acknowledgment in competition policy and in the debate on industrial policy of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises to jobs and the competitiveness of the European Union.
This acknowledgment in today's debate also shows that every attempt to play industrial policy off against SME policy is wrong, harmful and contradicts reality.
We need industrial flagships if we are to be competitive in the world and we need clusters of SMEs and industrial flagships in order that SMEs may derive competitive impetus from the competitiveness of industry.
While I agree with you when you say ânoâ to more regulation, we must at the same time say ânoâ to the tendency towards more nationalisation, ânoâ to the tendency towards anti-efficiency, ânoâ to the tendency towards despondency, ânoâ to populism, ânoâ to amending legislation, ânoâ to anti-industrialism and âyesâ to more efficiency, âyesâ to the internal market, âyesâ to the four freedoms, which Werner Langen touched on.
Enlargement strengthens the internal market.
The internal market strengthens competitiveness.
That also means yes to the Services Directive.
But that also means a stronger commitment to tax policy.
That means a stronger commitment in the financial perspectives to research, education, growth and employment and to new companies.
For me, this naturally means that we must encourage the best so that we can be there for the weak.
Mediocrity must be driven out of Europe.
The new type of nationalisation in mind must be driven out of our policy.
The apportioning of blame between state and Europe must be driven out in order to allow this competitiveness, this innovation, this research, this will to achieve more through efficiency.
I trust here that deeds will follow today's debate and the announcements made, because that is the only way to achieve new dynamism in the European Union.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in extender oils and tyres (twenty-seventh amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC) (COM(2004)0098 - C5-0081/2004 - 2004/0036(COD)) (A6-0104/2005)
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for having turned your attention to this important but also highly technical issue and for proposing constructive amendments.
We must in fact make every reasonable effort to reduce emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in order to protect health and the environment.
These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances.
According to the UNECE protocol, they are also classified as persistent organic pollutants.
However, these particular hydrocarbons are ingredients in extender oils used in the production of tyres and therefore cause health and environmental problems.
That is why the Commission has proposed introducing harmonised restrictions on the marketing and use of oils containing these PAKs, and on tyres containing these oils.
The Commission proposal will ensure that the internal market in tyres is maintained and that national measures which create trade barriers to the free movement of goods are avoided.
Alternatives to the substances to be restricted are being developed by industry.
In order to give industry the time needed to adjust to the new standards laid down in this directive, the Commission has proposed a reasonable transition period for the transposition of the directive.
Parliament and the Council have tabled a workable compromise package, with amendments on the later introduction of measures and testing requirements and deleting unnecessary exemptions for certain sectors.
The Commission supports these amendments.
I would like to encourage Parliament to accept the proposal at first reading, together with the amendments forming part of this compromise package.
This will demonstrate that the European institutions are willing and able to address such problems without delay.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, today we are debating the 27th amendment to Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in extender oils and tyres.
This is an important development, if you consider that the European tyre industry produces around 300 million tyres annually and uses 250Â 000 tonnes of extender oils, which are incorporated into the rubber matrix and remain in the rubber used for the end tyre.
These oils contain certain quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, as well as persistent organic pollutants.
I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its initiative to extend Annex 1 to Directive 76/769 by the addition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to car tyres.
I consider that its proposal is a very good proposal.
Taking as a starting point the protection of public health and the environment, as well as public safety and the smooth functioning of the internal market, and following consultations both with the Commission and the Council, as well as with the tyre and oil industry and non-governmental organisations, I tried to draft a balanced report, which was amended accordingly by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The main issues which concerned us were the duration of the transitional period for the application of the directive, the method of detecting the toxic substances which would be used and the question of exemptions from the directive.
Following consultations with the Council and in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, a package of amendments was proposed, which has been endorsed by most of the political groups.
As you can see, I have recommended the tabled amendments, so that we can bring this matter to a smooth conclusion at first reading.
In detail and as regards the transitional period, which is considered necessary in order to develop new types of tyres with extender oils which contain the minimum quantity of the substances which concern us, it is proposed that it be extended to 1 January 2010.
We should point out here that, for environmental reasons, we decided to take account of the date of manufacture of the tyre, which is marked on the tyre itself.
That is because the destruction of tyres remaining in stock is also harmful â perhaps even more harmful â to the environment and, of course, we are also helping industry to dispose of these stocks.
The European Federation of Tyre Manufacturers has assured us in writing that it can apply the criteria in the directive to all types of tyres, including tyres for racing cars, aeroplanes and special vehicles and vintage cars, without any risk to driver safety.
We therefore propose that there should be no exemption in the application of the directive.
Today I received three faxes protesting that we should grant extensions.
I have spoken to all three senders and, when I explained the compromise proposal, they appeared to agree with it.
One of them even apologised for his ignorance.
As regards the methods for detecting and defining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Commission has proposed limiting the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene, the substance which will act as a marker for the entire group, to 1 mg per kilogramme or, taking all listed PAHs, to no more than 10 mg per kilogramme.
In the past, industry has used IP 346 method of the Institute of Petroleum for PAC-dimethyl sulfoxide extract, which must not exceed 3%.
Its inclusion has been proposed, given that it is the traditional method used.
So much for extender oils.
As far as the oil content in car tyres is concerned, as ISO 21461 method has been developed in order to detect this type of oils in tyres, it is proposed that it be defined in the directive as an addendum to the Commission proposal.
Finally, the last amendment concerns retreading, on which the Commission proposal contains no provisions. Tread for retreading may not be placed on the market if it contains extender oils exceeding the limits indicated.
To close, I should like to thank both the shadow rapporteurs, for their excellent cooperation, and the secretarial staff of the Committee on the Environment, as well as the Council for its constructive proposals and cooperation, which will allow us to bring this matter to a close at first reading.
Â Â  . Mr President, I hope the Commissioner has finished texting everybody to say that they have got the tyre manufacturers sorted out.
Obviously he has not, as he is not listening to what we are saying.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
It was a difficult and very technical report and required a certain amount of skill.
I also wish to congratulate the tyre manufacturers, because over the years they have improved road safety, the availability of tyres and also the tread and the capacity of the tyre to stick to the road.
That was why I know that my fellow rapporteur had a slight problem with the date 2010.
I realise that he wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal of 2009, but a number of tyres could not be changed for that date and that is why we opted for the date on the tyre.
I am delighted to hear that he has accepted that.
It is good that the Commission and the Council have accepted, because we have come forward with a compromise package for its acceptance.
Particularly in the current climate, after the French and the Dutch votes, people often see the Council and the Commission â the Commission in particular â as aloof from Parliament, the only democratically elected body that represents the electorate.
Mr Adamou quite rightly mentioned Annex I and I am grateful to him for going through all the technical details for something we totally accept and agree with.
This report is a triumph for Parliament and I am delighted that we have come up with a compromise package.
I am just sorry the Commissioner is unable to listen to what we are saying and is too busy texting people.
Â Â  . Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
He has consulted painstakingly and taken due note of the views expressed by all the main players.
In addition, I commend the productive efforts and efficient methodology employed in bringing about full and genuine cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs for all the main political groups.
This has led to the achievement of a compromise package of amendments, which appears to have been widely accepted by most parliamentary groups, the Council and the Commission.
Concerning the substance of the directive, with the compromise amendments, this will to a very large degree achieve the intended aims, i.e., to effect, as soon as practicably possible, a reduction in the emission of carcinogenic tyre debris into the environment to an acceptable level, by restricting the marketing and use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-rich extender oils and tyres.
That would be done by harmonising the rules on the marketing and use of extender oils and tyres containing these toxic substances, thus preserving and improving the conditions and functioning of the internal market, while making sure that a high degree of health and environmental protection is achieved.
Lastly, it should be mentioned that there have, sadly, been a few direct and indirect attempts by some transatlantic tyre manufacturers to manipulate the derailing of the effectiveness clause of this directive.
It is to the credit of the rapporteur and the shadows that fortunately logic and a sense of preservation of the EUâs high standards of safety and efficiency prevailed and such attempts fortunately failed.
That is a good example, demonstrating clearly that unity and common sense will always protect us against the âbig brotherâ approach sometimes propagated by a small number of US industrialists and politicians.
In conclusion, I strongly urge you to vote in favour of the compromise amendment package presented to you in connection with Mr Adamouâs report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the compromise struck.
The fact that most groups but also the Commission, the Council and industry are nearly all of the same mind is the result of sound work put in by Mr Adamou.
Yesterday, I, along with others apparently, was approached by an aircraft tyre manufacturer who informed me that the extensive tests and security requirements to which aircraft tyres are subjected will make it impossible for him to keep to the 2010 deadline.
I assume that the rapporteur and Commissioner have also been approached, and I should like to know whether those objections have any real value.
I would also like to hear from the Commissioner what his opinion is on the matter and whether aircraft tyre manufacturers are now able to meet the requirements of the compromise package.
I was under the impression, from my contacts over the past six months, that that should be feasible, but I am very keen to hear your reaction.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work in support of the Commissionâs policy and the excellent compromise he has proposed.
As the Commission line is broadly acceptable, Parliament should support it without watering down the issue to any greater extent.
The legislative initiative under discussion is a natural extension to the directive that was drafted in Parliamentâs last term and in which we laid down limit and target values for impurities in the air and PAHs for 1996.
As we now decide a suitable timetable and limit values for PAH emissions passing into the rest of the environment, we have a challenging task before us.
PAHs are everywhere and they occur as multicomponent blends.
In international toxicology assessments several carcinogenic compounds have been identified among PAHs.
PAHs do not dissolve in water, they accumulate in the food chain, and they return to the carbon cycle when released into the environment, thus causing lasting damage to nature.
Accordingly, we should agree common testing procedures in order to bring emissions under control swiftly.
For a long time now development and testing work has been conducted on tyres, and, indeed, the first tyres containing a safer oil are already on the market.
Traffic, in which the tyres that are used and the limit values for their extender oils we now want to regulate, is in itself ecologically problematic.
Traffic emissions are one of the commonest and worst spreaders of PAHs into the air we breathe. It is from tyre debris in particular that large quantities of compounds in the form of small particles are released into the environment.
A particular problem with tyres and extender oils is benzopyrene, which, unfortunately, is very often used in these products.
This PAH is the best-known and worst carcinogenic substance.
We must now define sustainable limit values which will reduce emissions of benzopyrene into the environment to a minimum, at the same time recognising the necessity of extender oils in the tyre industry.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dangerous substances used in the manufacture of tyres for various vehicles.
Because of their toxicity, we are today debating their restriction.
We have before us a compromise which will probably be accepted tomorrow by a large majority.
Happy though I am when we avoid ideological debates on technical issues and adopt slim directives in a short space of time, there are a couple of minor but important aspects that we have overlooked.
A proposed amendment, which I jointly initiated and which was originally accepted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, aimed to obtain an extension to 2012 for certain urgently needed technical applications.
These were exceptions for armoured, fire brigade, rescue and other special purpose vehicles.
The number of applications is extremely minor and the damage to the environment negligible.
The original exemption for aircraft tyres, to which no time limit was originally attached, was also buried in the compromise package.
On this point, Parliament is about to take an irresponsible decision.
The aviation sector operates at physical limits, which is why the safety aspect must not be compromised and must even come before environmental aspects.
Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres.
I fail to understand how the Council could totally disregard this aspect, especially as the European Aviation Safety Agency was not consulted and there has been no follow-up assessment on it.
I am not in favour of more bureaucracy, but in such a safety sensitive sector as aviation, more careful attention should have been paid to the risks, especially as this is what we do with other regulations in the environmental sector where we often rush past the target.
I have received a letter from the European Cockpit Association, which represents 34Â 000 pilots in Europe and expresses great concern about this.
I wish to highlight this, because the pilots certainly cannot be suspected of engaging in industrial lobbying.
I would like to know from Commissioner Verheugen whether he is aware of this problem.
As I see it, this compromise is unacceptable if this aspect is disregarded.
Â Â  Mr President, 20 years ago an eminent health pathologist warned that she had never examined a cancerous tumour that did not have chemicals from the benzene family in the active reproducing cancer cells.
Cancer has become the new Black Plague.
In the Middle Ages half the population of Europe was destroyed.
They did not know the source of the bubonic menace and were unable to halt it in its deadly tracks.
There is no excuse for us; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from.
We make tyres with them, but we also create them when we burn waste.
The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators, some for toxic waste, be created in my country, thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water, air, soil, plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc.
Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators, especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give my views on the questions raised by Mr Blokland and Mr Krahmer, both of whom address the same problem, that being whether there is any guarantee that the requirements applicable to aircraft tyres will be met by the year 2010.
The reply to Mr Blokland's question is in the negative; no tyre manufacturers have contacted me, nor would I have advised any of them to do so, for they would have received the same reply that I am giving you now.
The Commission has examined the problem carefully.
We have received a formal statement from European tyre manufacturers to the effect that the technical requirements of this directive will also be met by the year 2010 for aircraft tyres.
That is therefore also my reply to Mr Krahmer, whose concerns about the safety of aircraft I fully and completely share.
I also think that, as far as the composition of tyres is concerned, tyre manufacturers are rather more qualified than pilots.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Oral Question to the Commission on the Regulation on the Community Patent and related legislation, by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs (B6-0242/2005)
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Gargani, for whom I am deputising, sends his apologies.
He had to return to Italy on urgent family business.
However, as we are very pressed here today, I shall not talk to you for eight minutes.
I do not consider that this issue requires it.
Allow me therefore to say a few words on the purpose of this issue.
A few months ago, we sat together under the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and decided that, as we are having problems â and I use the word advisedly â with a whole series of proposals for legislation in the field of intellectual property rights, it might perhaps make perfect sense if Parliament as a whole were to address this question once more and take this opportunity to discuss this once again with the Commission and â at a later date perhaps â with the Council.
There is no doubt whatever as to the crucial importance to the European economy of our introducing a permanent single patent in Europe.
I recall our resolution on the Lisbon process.
I recall the resolutions which we adopted on this and initiatives in previous years.
We here always took the view â almost right across the political divide â that the European patent had a particular worth and is of crucial importance, including within the framework of the Lisbon process, if we are to be able to guarantee the competitiveness of the European economy with the economies of other regions of the world.
However, I will not conceal the fact that some of us â and I in particular â were very concerned at developments in the Council.
We know that the Council is considering creating a patent which must be translated into all the official languages of the European Union; however, this is as yet unfeasible because unanimity is required and the consent of all the Member States has not been forthcoming.
Such a patent would be extremely expensive.
It would not be competitive, nor â if it came about â could it ever be converted back into a normal, proper patent.
Everyone knows that English is the language that matters and plays an absolutely dominant role in technology and in the granting of patents and that translations into other languages are basically superfluous, achieve nothing and just cost money.
Once such a language regime has been created, there will be no getting away from it.
That is the experience in the European Union and that is also the consequence of how legislation is usually passed here on such issues.
Against this background, I am very concerned as to whether we can and will ultimately get a patent that really can meet the specifications that we have set, including within the framework of the Lisbon process.
In addition, there is the fact that such an expensive patent would ultimately discriminate against medium-sized businesses, because the few large companies which exist â and they will be not only European but also, above all, non-European companies â will register their patents throughout the Community under this new European patent, while small and medium-sized enterprises â and they account for 70% or more of all patent holders â will be unable to do so because of the costs involved and will have to rely on small, inferior, national patents and regulations under the European Patent Convention.
This second-class society in patent legislation cannot be what we want in the European Union.
Given the blockade in the Council and the risk that, if this blockade is lifted, an inferior patent, an inferior patent regulation will emerge, the question which arises is this: what does the Commission â which has the right of initiative and the monopoly on initiatives â propose in the way of possible new initiatives to kickstart this again and perhaps still attain the noble objective of the Lisbon resolutions up to the point at which we have a European patent.
The second issue which concerns us and which played a considerable role in the report at the time by a 'green' colleague, Mrs Mercedes Echerer from Austria, is the question of collecting societies.
We in the Committee on Legal Affairs addressed collecting societies on various occasions in the previous legislative period, both within the framework of directives in which they played a role, and in the Echerer own initiative report.
We came more or less unanimously to the conclusion that it is necessary, when acknowledging the role of collecting societies, both in the decision-making processes of these companies and in fee structures, to achieve an adequate degree of transparency both for the benefit of users and in the interests of the holders of the intellectual property rights.
We know that the Commission is considering this and has already carried out or is already carrying out a follow-up assessment with a view â and this was also announced in the Commission's legislative programme â to submitting a specific proposal for legislation during the course of this year.
However, I now hear from the Commission that the question of whether there should be a recommendation or whether a directive is needed is still open.
I would welcome information from the Commission as to what is happening.
We know full well that the 'market' at issue here is not of the same order of size as in other cases, but it is nonetheless of importance to the development of the European single market that we clarify this question, ensure there is reasonable transparency in this sector and perhaps also take initiatives in order to facilitate the cross-border use of copyrights.
There are at last thoughts and activities in this direction also.
We would be interested in hearing what the Commission intends to do about this.
Â Â  Mr President, the main outstanding problems which have so far prevented the incorporation of the Councilâs common political approach of March 2003 into the final text of the Community patent regulation concerned the time limit for finding translations of the claims of the patents and the legal effect of these.
Efforts have been made in the Council and at bilateral level to settle these points.
Despite substantial agreement between the Member States on this issue under the Irish presidency, none of the solutions discussed has won unanimous support.
The Commission has already invested a lot of time and effort in work on this file.
While I am prepared to make one more attempt to reach agreement on the Community patent in the future, I will only do so when I believe the conditions to be favourable.
However, alongside the Commissionâs work on this issue, we also need all supporters of the Community patent to speak out strongly in favour of this initiative.
As to the collective management of copyright, my services are currently carrying out a thorough impact assessment in preparation for a possible Community initiative.
The overall aim of such an initiative will be to ensure the more transparent and efficient cross-border management of collective rights in Europe.
This should provide commercial users, broadcasters, webcasters or other online service providers with better access to information about the scope of the repertoire licence and the applicable terms and tariffs.
A more transparent management of copyright across the European Union should help stimulate more use being made of copyright content which fosters the development of new attractive services and the technology that is used to provide such services.
The initiative will take due account of a consultation of stakeholders and of the recommendations of the report written by a former MEP, Mrs Echerer, on collective management of copyright and related rights.
There is no blockage in the legislative process in this area.
As far as enhanced cooperation is concerned, any support from the Commission for such an initiative in the field of industrial and intellectual property would depend on its impact on the economy and society and its added value compared to the existing situation.
Moreover, legal issues, such as those arising from the extent of existing Community competence, would have to be taken into account.
Â Â  . Mr President, the question of the Committee on Legal Affairs covers two aspects.
The first, I would say, is the linguistic aspect, which Commissioner McCreevy has referred to, and I would add that things cannot perhaps be simplified as much as my colleague, Mr Lehne, did in his speech.
Apart from the technological domination of one language that has almost a monopoly, the European Patent Convention recognised other languages, and other languages are also recognised in the European Union Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market, based in Alicante.
I have the impression that it is possible that up to a particular level, certain languages may have a degree of recognition, in accordance with the use of patents in those languages and the operation of national patent offices.
I therefore believe that the issue must be clarified and that, as Mr Lehne has said, the Commission could undoubtedly help to find a formula to get us out of this .
With regard to the second aspect, relating to collective management companies, the fear may be that a Commission proposal, for example, taking the radical approach of the Bolkestein Directive of total liberalisation, could end up removing any possibility of effective protection of intellectual property rights.
At the moment, we have a series of national systems for protecting intellectual property and a simple liberalisation could lead to authors losing their protection, in other words, replacing the system consisting of a series of national markets relatively well protected by their national management bodies, with a system in which there is no type of protection, could put authors, designers and inventors in a difficult situation.
I would simply like, therefore, to call on the Commission, when drawing up this proposal, not to make the same mistake as the Bolkestein proposal, which, as we know, has today even been one of the elements used to argue against the approval of the European Constitution in the referenda, but rather to seek a system that links the need for harmonisation in this field with the protection of a basic service, the protection of intellectual property and of artistic and literary creation.
Â Â  . â Mr President, without doubt, the debate on the Community patent is of no small significance in terms of the European economy.
In any case, there is one effect which must not be underestimated: as long as patents continue to be as expensive as they are now, much of their protective function is lost; patents can even block rather than foster innovation.
However, when we see, from the other side, that the need for diversity and the fostering of diversity are entrenched both in decision-making processes and in the minds of Europeans, then it will be hard for us to simply leap this hurdle.
I therefore think that we here in Parliament must pay special attention first and foremost to the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are inseparable from the competitiveness that we urgently need to support, and on which subject, Commissioner, I have heard little from you.
At present the situation is untenable.
Naturally, this also applies to the question of copyright.
I would point out here that the approach so far, compared with intellectual property rights, is no longer adequate, especially in the field of art â the performing arts, music, and so on â on the Internet and in view of all the changes here.
People are saying that we cannot make criminals out of a whole generation who simply download whatever they can from the Internet with no sense of wrongdoing.
Besides, it is our duty to make a strict distinction between this and software patenting, because the blurred relationship between the European Patent Convention and national case law has created a problematic situation, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we must, of course attach great importance to the issue of the Community patent and related legislation, so as to ensure that we do not undermine innovation and that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not adversely affected.
We feel it is wrong to create a Community patent at any cost, as this indeed undermines the interests of small and medium-sized countries, with regard to both the language arrangements and the role of the national institutions and national patent agencies.
This is, of course, quite apart from our concerns as regards any case of patents affecting key areas such as life, natural heritage, software and medicines, and which often only serve the interests of the multinationals.
As for the language arrangements, as mentioned in this House, we do not feel it is right to provide for the use of only a limited number of languages.
This goes against the principle of non-discrimination between companies and creates a genuine directory of main languages.
Accordingly, a precedent is set and the use of all of the official languages is put at risk.
We therefore feel that the best way of defending micro-enterprises and SMEs in all Member States is to uphold the principle of non-discrimination between countries and companies and, especially, in terms of the language arrangements.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0112/2005) by MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea and amending Regulations (EEC) NoÂ 2847/93 and (EC) No 973/2001 [COM(2003)0589 â C5-0480/2003 â 2003/0229(CNS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, let me express the Commission's any my personal satisfaction with the method and the quality of the work done to tackle the challenge of developing adequate management measures for our Mediterranean fisheries.
It could not be taken for granted that the deadlock on this matter during the term of the previous European Parliament could be overcome.
The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise.
Members of the European Parliament have shown their ability to listen to the spectrum of views that have been voiced on this important question.
Parliament's opinion, which I hope will be adopted today, is a good starting point for the work to be carried out in the Council and I hope that the European institutions will be able to deliver the new regulation shortly, in the interests of our fishermen and of fisheries and the marine environment of the Mediterranean.
The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal.
I am happy to be able to inform you that we can accept 22 of the 34 amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries and other Members.
Nine amendments of the 22 accepted, and in particular Amendments 2, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26 were part of a compromise package agreed with the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Fisheries.
The compromise is not perfect in all details.
Nonetheless a delicate balance of quite different views has been achieved without compromising the effectiveness of the proposal.
Let me turn to the other amendments tabled to the report before us.
The Commission can also accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 24, which introduce new elements that either reinforce our proposal or make the timing of the introduction of certain measures more gradual.
The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 1, 3, 4, 19, and 27 to 34.
In particular, the concept of responsibility of nationals of Member States is already enshrined in the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy and should be maintained here.
Amendments 1, 3 and 4 cannot therefore be accepted.
With respect to Amendments 19 and 33, which ask for the insertion of provisions for financial support for temporary fishing bans and for fishermen affected by the prohibition of certain fishing gear, the Commission believes that these proposals are not appropriate here, either because there are already rules on these matters under Community legislation and/or because these issues are to be dealt with in the framework of the European fisheries fund proposal.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 27, which could dilute the significance of setting a minimum landing size for the species covered by the proposed regulation.
In the absence of a minimum size, there would not be any incentive for fishermen to avoid the areas of aggregation of juveniles or undersized organisms or to improve selectivity as regards fishing gear and practices.
Moreover, the common market for fisheries products calls for a harmonised minimum size.
A strict correspondence between minimum size and selectivity of prescribed equipment is rarely possible, particularly in multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, as is the case in the Mediterranean.
Moreover, some minimum landing sizes are set for species caught, mainly with fishing gear and practices that are not regulated in this proposal and where selectivity is essentially left to the fishermen themselves.
As far as Amendment 28 is concerned, the same is not clear.
The deletion of paragraph 3 would mean that whitebait fisheries would be completely forbidden.
The Commission's aim is instead to keep them within a clear regulatory framework of national management plans.
The Commission cannot therefore accept this proposal.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 29, because a 30% increase in the height of the nets would increase fishing effort for small pelagic species, against scientific advice that calls for no increase in the fishing effort targeting this resource.
Moreover, since purse seines may be used to catch demersal species in coastal areas, we should avoid authorising large purse seines that could touch the bottom in coastal areas where protected habitats, such as Posidonia beds, occur.
The Commission is however open to regulating this type of fishing gear by differentiating between purse seine fisheries for small pelagic species, demersal species and tuna. Each category should follow different rules.
I hope that further refinement will be possible within the Council.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 30 and 31.
It is widely recognised that management of fishing effort should be one of the main management tools in the Mediterranean.
Establishing the maximum overall dimensions for certain small-scale fishing gear is a way to address this.
The huge number of fishermen using this gear makes it indispensable to set maximum dimensions to avoid further increases in size which would result in insuperable walls of nets that impede free movement and migration for several species.
Small-scale fishermen should also contribute to conservation.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 32 and 34 for different reasons.
The list of species in Annex VIII to Council Regulation 1039/98 requested by AmendmentÂ 32 contains species which are either not present in the Mediterranean or which can be caught by bottom-set nets and anchored floating nets in coastal areas.
It is therefore undesirable to include the full list of species here.
In fact the rationale of Article 7(2) as mentioned in Amendment 10 is to list a group of species which are caught offshore in midwater, or close to the surface of very deep waters and which, when they occur in the catch of a bottom-set gillnet or entangling net, are clear signals that such a net is a drift net rather than a bottom-set net.
This provision is the only way to enforce the large pelagic drift net ban.
Nonetheless, the Commission is open to a large list of species if there is evidence that certain species cannot be caught by real bottom-set nets but only by drift nets.
Amendment 34 suggesting a derogation for vessels smaller than 18 metres would gravely weaken the enforcement of the large pelagic drift nets ban.
This amendment is based on the assumption that Article 7(2) addresses a type of surface gillnet targeting tuna.
This assumption is not correct, since such nets cannot be classified as an anchored floating net or bottom-set net as defined in Article 2(9) and (12) respectively.
In conclusion, may I express the confidence that, with the help of the European Parliament, we can put before the Council an improved Commission proposal, which should facilitate its position vis-Ã -vis the Council.
All Mediterranean fishermen and the marine ecosystems that they exploit need urgent and effective fisheries management.
The adoption of a new, more effective and specially tailored European Union conservation policy for Mediterranean fisheries will also foster more ambitious steps within the multilateral framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.
As you are well aware, fishing effort has been increasing in many areas and the exploitation pattern is still not satisfactory.
In order to guide Mediterranean fisheries towards sustainable exploitation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, the European Union, which is the biggest fishing power in the region, needs to set a good and credible example.
A more effective Community management framework is needed to recover the full production and productivity potential of the Mediterranean in the interests first of all of our fishermen and also of other European citizens that want to benefit from the richness of the Mediterranean.
In concluding my speech, may I once again thank the rapporteur, as well as the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their excellent cooperation on this matter.
Their proactive cooperation has indeed provided us with a substantial input that will help ensure sustainability for fisheries in the Mediterranean.
Â Â  . â Mr President, through this report, for which it has been my pleasure to be rapporteur, we finally have the opportunity to produce a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean, eleven years after the first attempt to impose order by means of the technical measures regulation, Regulation No 1696/94.
This is therefore a crucial moment for the fisheries sector in the area, and for having made it possible for us to reach this moment, I must fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Joe Borg and Director-General JÃ¶rgen Holmquist â who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward â their services, with whom I have worked on a daily basis, and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have been wise and generous enough to give up many of their local sectorsâ demands, sometimes despite strong pressure, in order not to deprive the whole Mediterranean sector of common management rules.
With everybodyâs involvement, we have been able to unblock the Commissionâs initial proposal which, perhaps because it was drawn up too quickly, had opened up apparently insoluble conflicts with the national administrations, with the sector and with this Parliament, which, as you will remember, rejected the proposal by means of the report by Mr Lisi.
In order to get out of this , I proposed to the Commission that we work in unison on a common text on the points on which there was the greatest controversy, with a view to achieving a joint compromise acceptable to Parliament and the Commission which we would then present once again to the Council of Ministers.
The Commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a yearâs work, this is what we are presenting to the House today for its approval.
It may not be as ambitious a text as many of us would have liked; perhaps no one got everything they wanted.
But we have all lost a little so that we may all emerge winners, because, if there was one thing we all agreed upon, it was that the situation of fishing in the Mediterranean could not remain at the mercy of a minimal regulation, which complicated more than it resolved.
If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply.
This working method has also allowed us to avoid leaps into the dark with no scientific or logical basis, and certain contradictions in the initial text which led to the outright rejection of the proposal.
For example, we introduce rationality and consistency into the regulation of the depths and distances from the coast within which it is possible to fish in such a biologically-, economically- and socially-sensitive sea.
For the first time, dredges are regulated, the way is opened for the use of more selective meshes â such as square mesh for towed nets â and considerable progress is made on bringing mesh size into line with the minimum sizes of species.
Furthermore, with regard to the Commissionâs maximal initiative on bans, minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of highly migratory species, it has been agreed firstly to attempt to get the regional fisheries organisations, such as the GFCM and the ICCAT, to produce these regulations, since this fishing is also carried out in the Mediterranean by third-country fleets and it does not make sense to impose restrictions solely on Community vessels.
Nevertheless, if within a period of one year, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities, stemming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds.
With regard to the content of the report, I would finally like to stress the effort to provide greater protection for species by means of minimum sizes, with the only temporary exception of hake, where we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal to lower the size to 15Â cm â which we have maintained until 2007, when the traditional size of 20 cm will return, coinciding with the proposed increase in mesh.
Furthermore, for the first time, the size of sardine is regulated, sizes that had disappeared from the Commissionâs proposal are recovered, such as the size of clam or striped venus, and reasonable increases in size are introduced for other species, since the ultimate objective is to move closer to the scientific recommendations in the Mediterranean as well.
Mr President, having once again called upon this House to approve this report and, in particular, the compromise reached with the Commission, I shall end by expressing my hope that the Council will fully accept this new proposal, which is the result of this compromise between the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vezâs excellent report in terms of its content and how it draws the strands together, describes the specific character of the Mediterranean more effectively than the Councilâs proposal.
Such a specific character means that, although the objectives of the Communityâs management of fisheries must be the same throughout the EU, the means for achieving them must be adapted to the specific features of fishing in the Mediterranean.
Doing so would take account both of the various biological, geographical and legal circumstances of the region, and of the aim of utilising the experience and skills of fishermenâs organisations operating in the Mediterranean.
One specific feature is small-scale coastal fishing.
The majority of fishing vessels in the Italian fleet is less than 12 metres long and therefore we cannot disregard the difficulties that will be faced in converting them for other kinds of fishing â something that is greatly desired by the Community.
Small-scale coastal fishing must not only be defined but also safeguarded, and, in the case of reconversion, higher levels of compensation and incentives must be dedicated to it, in order to avoid creating serious socioeconomic problems for the sector as a whole.
The proposal also specifies the role of the Regional Advisory Council, a body expressly created to promote the direct involvement of fishermen, and the vehicle for bringing first-hand experiences to the decision-making process, in order that Community legislation is increasingly in line with reality and the problems of the fisheries sector.
We greatly welcome the role of the regulation for the Mediterranean in introducing common rules, but for this very reason all the non-European countries bordering the Mediterranean need to adapt their legislation to the stock conservation policy.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the position of the European Community at the heart of the large organisations regulating fishing, in order to make the main international forums such as GFCM andICCATmore aware of Europeâs fishing tradition.
Finally, MrÂ President, I would also like to draw attention to the centrality of research, inasmuch as the basis of any good policy consists of the quality and depth of knowledge of the factors in play.
From this perspective, the specific character of the Mediterranean has always been a problem: over and above the quantity of research, the problem lies in the discrepancy between research and the specific knowledge requirements of an effective management policy.
That is why we need to insist in future on the coordination of scientific research and its applicability to the action plan.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must first of all thank MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vez for the excellent work she has carried out, and also the Commission for the sensitivity shown in taking account of what happened in the last parliamentary term, when Parliament had maintained that the Commissionâs proposal could not be amended.
Respect and a degree of humility on both sides have enabled a compromise to be reached.
It has been possible to reopen a debate with the fishing organisations.
We have succeeded in preventing the Mediterranean from becoming marginalised in comparison with other seas, subject to a host of obligations and bans, amounting merely to a policy designed to penalise.
Whilst appreciating the fact that the regulation represents a step forward and useful mediation, however, we believe that, even now, it retains an approach that is still linked â albeit to a lesser degree - to a model of fishing suited to the northern seas.
The northern seas are characterised by highly industrialised and single-species fishing, and they have a completely different marine biology to that of the Mediterranean.
That is the reason for the long-standing debate â in committee and with you, Commissioner â on various minimum sizes, which we would have liked to fix more decisively: sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean.
Equally, it is difficult to dictate overly specific limits on fishing gear, since an artisanal activity, carried out by small fleets, varies from country to country partly according to the kinds and variety of traditions.
With the implementation of this regulation, we would like to aim at an objective that is rarely achieved: a basin-wide policy, that is, a global approach.
That of course involves paying attention to the management and conservation of fishery resources, to anti-pollution efforts and also to the safeguarding of jobs.
I would like to point out, Commissioner, that 80% of the fishing carried out in the Mediterranean is small scale and takes place in regions that are mainly located within the area of the former Objective 1: areas experiencing extreme social hardship, high rates of unemployment, and, in many cases, deprived of social support.
I believe that particular sensitivity towards maintaining employment levels is a joint mission for the Commission and Parliament.
We call on the Council to accept this proposal and to take into due consideration the quantity and quality of the work that it has made possible.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, on her hard work on this legislation.
I wish to make some general comments.
Fish, as everybody knows, is an important source of healthy human nutrition and is, quite rightly, much sought after by the consumer.
It is also a major source of income for thousands of fishermen and other people involved in the fishing trade, including many small, medium and large businesses.
The seas provide this fish, but uncontrolled fishing practices will eventually diminish supply and kill off the fishing industry.
It is thus imperative that measures to manage the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are legislated for and implemented as soon as possible.
This is especially so with respect to the Mediterranean Sea, where stocks of many fish species appear in many instances to be at threshold levels.
That is why this legislation is so urgently needed.
However, legislation becomes significant not when it is approved on paper, but when it is implemented in practice.
This is a major weakness, especially with respect to fishing.
Observation, surveillance and action to ensure application of the rules is unfortunately inadequate in many, if not in most, cases.
Out there on the high seas, things are not as they should be.
Gross violations are committed daily by those who bend the rules or just disregard them altogether.
So the first point to be made is that much needs to be done to verify implementation of the legislation.
The second point concerns the scientific data available to us.
This information is essential if we are to understand and properly assess, for example, fishing stocks, breeding grounds, migration patterns and catchment methods.
Are our present scientific data reliable?
Unfortunately, it would appear not.
It is thus of the utmost importance to direct efforts at getting accurate fishing data, free not only from scientific error but also from external manipulation aimed at boosting personal profits rather than fish conservation.
Last but not least, I refer to the diminishing species of the small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises of the smaller Mediterranean Member States like my country, Cyprus.
Already disadvantaged by being a small island at the periphery of the EU, half occupied by Turkish and British troops, Cyprus is now facing the very real threat of having its fishing industry completely destroyed.
A few hundred fishermen who have been carrying on the centuries-old family tradition of fishing around their island are now facing annihilation by the bureaucratic and, it seems, heartless dragon of Brussels, acting in conjunction with faceless international commissions whose main concern is to satisfy the interests of the big multinational companies and powerful governments.
So vessels from all over the world fish freely around Cyprus, but the Cypriot fishermen cannot do so because they are being strangulated by ridiculously low quotas.
Take tuna, for example.
The EU has a quota allocation of about 18 000 tonnes per year and the Commission in its wisdom has, for some years, considered giving Cyprus a quota of just 5 to 10 tonnes, instead of the 500 to 1 000 tonnes needed.
The Commission blames many factors, such as previous years undeclared or erroneous catchment statistics by the Cyprus authorities, but these are just excuses.
The fishermen of Cyprus âŠ
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted that we were able to adopt this compromise.
I wished to congratulate MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vez, who has accomplished a difficult and delicate, but nonetheless urgent, task in order to regulate and make provision for sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean, a sea that is itself threatened by extremely problematic developments: various types of pollution, decreasing resources, and threats to biodiversity.
I am delighted at this compromise for a number of reasons.
Firstly, it sets out in a particularly clear manner which fishing gear is authorised or banned; it lays down the parameters for drift nets, mesh sizes, the minimum size of fish, deep-sea trawling and so on. Equally, it ensures that European policy with regard to other seas of relevance to us, whether in the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea, is coherent.
It was essential to equip ourselves with tools and policies for managing the fishery resources in the Mediterranean.
It is also a fair compromise, allowing the majority of the countries concerned to find an effective balance between what one set of countries or another has had to accept or refuse in order to reach this compromise.
There remain, however, a number of issues to resolve which have in fact been raised by the previous speakers.
One is the management of the entire Mediterranean basin, since we are only talking about the Member States of the European Union in this compromise.
It is advisable, in fact, to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish, within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin.
Further problems relate to bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species, or types of fishing such as purse-seine fishing, carried out for the purposes of aquaculture and involving practices that present an increasing number of problems.
This compromise regulation does not directly target that type of fishing, but it is understandable how artisanal fishermen who feel themselves targeted by this regulation find it unfair that no further regulation is imposed on a developing method of fishing that creates huge problems for the preservation of ecosystems, given the means by which it is carried out.
Finally, I will repeat what Members have said regarding the need for the European Union urgently to conduct a much more active research policy on the Mediterranean.
However, we do not have a large amount of the information and data which would enable us to fine-tune these policies and these tools.
Equally, I believe that monitoring and implementing them depend on the political will of the Member States to enforce this new regulation.
That is what the debate hinges upon.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not accept the proposal on the exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources because it is unscientific.
It tries to focus solely on taking measures to ban the use of fishing gear throughout the Mediterranean, whereas it is common knowledge that the burden on this sea's ecosystem is an extremely acute problem of marine pollution, as the result both of the careless use of pesticides and industrial pollution in general.
We know full well that the composition and fishing potential in the Mediterranean are different, due to the different conditions which prevail and interact, resulting in different degrees of eutrophication and, consequently, of sizes of catch.
That is why we emphasise that the levelling down approach taken in the proposal, which generalises reductions in their output, will have different consequences from one fisherman to another.
When the above generalised bans are applied, they will have tragic consequences for certain areas.
That is because, on the pretext of protecting fish stocks, the proposal reduces the fishing capacity, resulting in the immediate reduction and disappearance of income from fisheries for small and medium-sized fishing operations and, ultimately, a mass exodus from this occupation.
The result of all the above measures being proposed will be the mass destruction of fishing communities and the abandonment of entire geographical areas, while aquaculture will hasten to cover the fishery deficit which is expected to be created and its interests will be strengthened for the benefit of large monopolies operating in this sector.
Thus, the role of capital in fisheries will become stronger and its previous social and other historic characteristics will disappear.
The monopolisation of fisheries will be reinforced, as will the profits of business groups, to the detriment of small and medium-sized fishing operations, the workers and the grass-roots classes, with painful consequences for the marine ecosystem and the environment in general.
We believe that the policy of managing fishing capacity and the development of fisheries cannot be comprehended separately from the interests of small and medium-sized fishing operations.
We consider that the development of fisheries must, at the same time, respect the ecosystem and the potential of each area, as well as the broader interests of the local society and economy, far from and contrary to the ambitions and interests of big business.
All this must be incorporated into a more global plan which, using cooperatives of fishery producers as a lever, will make the most productive use of individual fishery potential.
Within this framework, appropriate technical measures can be assessed and imposed which will be scientifically substantiated and will be considered necessary in order to maintain fish stocks, safeguard the productive potential of each area ...
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the concern for preserving the fishery resources in the Mediterranean is completely legitimate.
It is indeed necessary to preserve a rich and diverse environment and essential food resources for future generations.
Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential.
Of all the living creatures populating this planet, there is, however, one that has not only duties but also rights. I am referring to human beings.
The regulation submitted to us presents a compromise, the intention of which I certainly understand: it is a compromise not only between the different sovereign nations that make up Europe, but also between the ways in which the environment is used and conserved.
However, Amendment 10, tabled by our rapporteur, directly affects a Mediterranean fishing activity that is traditional to France, the .
This is an ancient fishing technique, specific to the French Mediterranean, in which bluefin tuna are caught using an anchored surface net.
My fellow Members, be aware that, by approving this amendment, you will be signing the death warrant of 1Â 200 jobs directly and indirectly linked to this activity.
On the ground, there is incomprehension, as well as legitimate anger.
For years, fishermen in this sector have made significant efforts, particularly with regard to protecting cetaceans, in order to limit the impact of their activity on the ecosystem.
Their accidental catches are now only residual.
Scientific studies show that this method of fishing is one that respects its environment.
I know that this compromise has been difficult to reach, but I appeal to the Commission, the Council and especially the French Government.
What are a few extra days of negotiation compared with the distress of 300 families and an entire region?
What weight will the argument regarding the compromise package carry, and that of Pandoraâs box, which should certainly not be opened in France, where public opinion is increasingly aware that Brussels is out of touch with the reality of peopleâs lives?
Let us not forget that 80% of fishing in the Mediterranean is of an artisanal nature, so why should we always favour the remaining 20%?
MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vez, Members, reopen the negotiations in order to save these jobs!
Commissioner Borg has just informed us that he refuses to approve our AmendmentÂ 34, on the grounds that ArticleÂ 7(2), on which our amendment is founded, is based on a classification that does not correspond to the text.
In my opinion, that is a matter of legal quibbling that concerns the detail of what the Commissioner and his services must regulate, but does not take account of the basis of the amendment, namely the protection of fishermenâs rights, which the amendment must crucially ensure is respected.
With this in mind, I call on you to vote against Amendment 10 tabled by our rapporteur, whom I nevertheless congratulate on the tireless work that she has carried out, and I call on you to vote in favour of our Amendment 34.
On behalf of the fishermen whom you will save, I thank you.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after long and arduous negotiations, begun not much less than two years ago, we have reached a compromise that only partially satisfies our Group.
We are delighted, for example, to see resurrected potential financial support for the biological standstill, even if the new European Fisheries Fund is not considering it.
Important matters remain on the table, however, which, in our opinion, are at odds with the interests of fishing in the Mediterranean.
A further example: we believe that, given the importance of the whitebait sector, that species can be put on sale on condition that it is caught with statutory gear.
That is why we have tabled AmendmentÂ 27, which we hope will be adopted.
We have stressed the specific character of Mediterranean fishing a number of times: it is essentially coastal and small scale, a type of fishing that is part of culture and which, in addition to passing down a centuries-old tradition from generation to generation, constitutes a vital source for the economy, particularly in an area â let us not forget â of extensive socioeconomic degradation.
We therefore believe that points 3 and 4 of Annex 2 must be taken out, the intention of which is to regulate and standardise the technical features of small-scale gear, which, precisely because it is linked to a specific type of fishing and to specific coastal zones, cannot by its very nature be the subject of regulatory enforcement.
We congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vez, and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna, but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen, who, up to now, have only been required to observe bans and limits, whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, fishing is nothing short of essential for the survival of the human race: more than one billion people live on animal protein or its by-products.
As regards catch potential, according to the experts, we are reaching the limit and it is therefore right that the European Parliament and the Commission are attempting to put a limit on fishing, to manage catches in a sustainable way and to stamp out destructive forms of fishing.
Fishing and aquaculture, however, represent one of the principal activities of the Union.
The European fisheries market is ranked third in the world after China and Peru.
In France, Greece, Italy and Spain approximately 100Â 000 fishermen and tens of thousands of fishing vessels are involved in the fisheries sector.
The European fleet â which is an artisanal fleet, as the statistical data show â consists primarily of vessels lighter than 10 tonnes.
The essentially artisanal character of our fleet and our fishermen is therefore obvious.
Citizens thus expect the European Parliament and the Commission to strike a balanced position, reconciling economic and ecological needs.
Similarly, the protection of fish stocks must be more strictly based on scientific information than is the case at present, but we must also actively involve fishermen in the management of fishery resources and liaise with the environmental world in order to raise awareness and call attention to employment issues.
We therefore call for the gradual application of the new regulations.
Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vezâs report, on the whole, puts ...
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to say firstly that the work carried out by the rapporteur ââ in this case, Mrs Fraga ââ and by the Members of the Committee on Fisheries, is above all an example of cooperation, as the Commissioner pointed out, and it sends a very positive signal in terms of the future co-existence of the two institutions.
I am convinced that this can only increase the credibility of this common policy within the European fisheries sector.
The cooperation ââ which, as I have said, was close and effective ââ between the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga ââ who has done a magnificent job ââ and the Commission services, has allowed us to come to this House today with a compromise acceptable to the majority of Parliament, and with a clear message to the sector, which under no circumstances must we break or spoil.
The most important thing is that this cooperation should allow us to unblock a situation which had become unsustainable; unsustainable for the Community institutions, of course, but above all for a sea whose resources have been regarded as over-exploited for some time, but which, owing to its special characteristics, has remained in a permanent state of exception, and it is now time to put an end to that.
The Mediterranean is a different kind of sea: national waters are more limited than in other areas of the Community, fish populations transcend areas and are shared, the general characteristics of the activity are different â there is above all a small-scale fishing fleet and a high proportion of fishermen fish on a part-time basis â there are many small landing sites, etc. I have only mentioned a few of the characteristics that make the Mediterranean a different kind of sea, but the objectives of the CFP are the same in the Mediterranean as in other Community waters: we must guarantee that live aquatic resources are exploited in a way that allows for sustainable environmental, economic and social conditions.
In addition, therefore, to the structural and market measures defined in the CFP that are already being applied, the conservation policy must be implemented in the Mediterranean in a similar fashion, as well as the regulations ââ which must be improved and developed ââ the harmonisation of minimum sizes and technical measures ââ which must be absolute throughout the European Union and effective throughout the Mediterranean Basin ââ and effective control â which must resolve a problem; the sale in a Member State, which is all too frequently Spain, of illegal fish originating from another Member State, because that illegal fishing damages both parties: the State that is selling it, because it damages resources, and the State that is receiving it, because it damages prices and, above all, damages the faith of the fishermen in the management mechanisms.

I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my hope that we will all benefit from the vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I question whether the EU really is interested in achieving the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources.
It is a contradiction that this is what the EU recommends in the report, at the same time as having fisheries agreements with countries in, for example, Africa.
These third-country agreements contribute to overfishing of the oceans and impair many developing countriesâ ability to build up profitable fishing industries themselves.
A recently published report by the Swedish National Board of Fisheries criticises the EUâs third-country agreements.
The criticism is based on the fact that none of these agreements promotes sustainable fishing and that they are also implemented in a way that does not comply with the FAOâs code of conduct.
A number of non-governmental organisations share that view and have pointed out that the agreements predominantly affect coastal communities badly.
If the sustainable development of fishery resources really is a priority issue for the EU, the latter must not only advocate measures in the Mediterranean, as in this report, but also recommend and implement a radical review of its fisheries agreements with third countries.
In this report, Parliament has altered the Commissionâs proposal, which does not promote sustainable development, in favour of the fishing industry.
The EU should not work on issues concerning fishing.
Issues of this type should be dealt with at regional and sub-regional levels insofar as that is possible.
Those issues concerning fishing that presuppose international cooperation may usefully be dealt with within the framework of international bodies in which national special interests are not as marked as is the case in the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to underscore once again my satisfaction at the manner in which Parliament has cooperated on this important dossier.
Our shared objective is to achieve sustainability of fisheries in the Mediterranean.
We owe this to our fishermen and also to the maintenance of a sustainable marine ecosystem to be able to support this activity.
Through a constructive dialogue, we have explored the avenues to finding some technical solutions to what before seemed to be intractable difficulties.
I would like to underline that the aim of the proposal is to create a conservation plan for the Mediterranean.
We achieved this through finding a balance and we have instituted measures to protect small-scale fisheries in particular.
For example, fishing for bianchetto continues to be allowed in our proposal, but with selective gear, not with trawls.
With the advent of the new Parliament and when I took office, I had to decide what to do regarding the Mediterranean proposal.
It was decided at that time that rather than withdrawing the original proposal, we would leave it on the table, but adopt a flexible approach.
That is exactly what we did and, to this effect, we have worked very closely with the Fisheries Committee.
We have taken on board the amendments proposed by the Fisheries Committee as a package.
We have also taken on board a number of other amendments from individual MEPs.
Consultations have been carried out in an extensive manner with representatives of the sector for the Mediterranean, both by the Fisheries Committee and by the Commission.
We are discussing with the Member States with a view to having the proposal adopted as early as the June Council.
We are making significant progress and we can accept certain other amendments to sensitise the regulation even further to the specificities of Mediterranean fisheries, but without forgoing the fundamental principle of sustainability.
We, the Community, have a responsibility to set a credible and strong example.
We will continue to work with our partners in the Mediterranean Sea to convince them of the need to adopt measures along the same lines as ours.
We have set up the Medisamac as a forum, bringing together most Mediterranean littoral States.
We have strengthened the GFCM to be able to use it as a tool to achieve common standards, and we are working to establish a regional advisory council for the Mediterranean, which will work further in this direction.
The Community has to set an example.
It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean.
Once the regulation is adopted, we will work within the GFCM and with individual third countries through our very good relations with them on all fronts, based now on partnership and neighbourhood, to adopt measures on the same lines as these and to have a level playing field for the Mediterranean.
In conclusion, my appreciation goes to all of you, and in particular the rapporteur, for her tireless work.
You have come up with a proposal that I will clearly defend in the forthcoming discussions in the Council.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Mr President, I feel you have been unduly strict with us today.
I know this is Thursday but, as the secretariat will confirm, there is plenty of time left over from our groups' speaking time.
My group had nine minutes and I used only four.
Your comment that people have planes to catch is not applicable, because we have to be here until this afternoon.
There is voting at 5.30 p.m. and if some MEPs want to go home early ...
Â Â  No, MrÂ Matsakis, I am not giving you the floor for that.
I am here to make sure that the speaking times, which have been very rigorously scheduled, are adhered to.
You are well aware of how things work.
I have experience of what happens on Thursdays at 1 p.m., when people come and say to the Presidency that so and soâs speaking time has not been adhered to.
The speaking times are not scheduled just for the sake of it.
This is the European Parliament, and the speaking times are not unlimited.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0157/2005) by MrÂ Freitas, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme [COM(2004)0764 - C6-0245/2004 - 2004/0268(CNS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Freitas for this report, as well as for his interest, participation and input in the Committee on Fisheries.
I would also like to thank the President and the members of the committee for its expeditious examination of this proposed regulation.
This will enable the European Community to pass a clear signal to the AIDCP at its Annual Meeting beginning on 13 June 2005, that with the adoption by Parliament of this proposal from the Commission, the European Community is well on the road to completing the necessary internal procedures to becoming a full member of this organisation.
I am pleased to accept a number of amendments suggested by Mr Freitas, notably Amendments 2, 3, 5 and 6.
In particular, these amendments will increase the transparency and simplify the understanding of the content and reasoning behind the need for this Council decision, which will enable the Community to fulfil its international obligations to become a party to regional fisheries organisations where they exist and to defend Community interests in the global fisheries.
This will also enable the Community to be at the forefront of these organisations and enhance the leading role that it has constantly played in the operation of regional fisheries organisations.
I am not, however, in a position to accept the remaining proposed amendments, with the exception of Amendment 4, which I can accept provided that the phrase âand its certification schemeâ is deleted.
I will comment on the certification scheme later with respect to other amendments.
I find difficulty in accepting the other amendments for the following reasons.
This proposal relates to the approval of AIDCP, whereas Amendments 1, 9, and 11 focus heavily on a secondary issue of the AIDCP, namely, the tuna tracking and verification system, which is already EC law.
Amendment 10 requires that future changes to the tuna tracking and verification system regulation follow a certain process, in contradiction to the appropriate comitology provisions within the regulation.
This regulation is already in force and changes can be made to it as and when necessary.
Amendments 7, 8, and 12 relate to the issue of AIDCP certification and consumer information.
Again, such amendments are not helpful in this instance since the issue of whether the Community accepts AIDCP certification is still being considered by the Member States and, pending such a consultation, the Commission has not adopted any fixed position.
The inclusion of any reference to certification is premature and could prejudice the internal debate that still has to be concluded.
Furthermore, the issue of certification is not one of the objectives of the AIDCP, nor is it included in the general measures of the AIDCP Agreement, nor in the application of the AIDCP Programme itself.
This is a secondary commercial economic interest that is a consequence of the implementation of part of the AIDCP, and not a core element.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have suggested a balance that I believe can be struck between the conservation of eco-systems and the social and economic interests of the fisheries sector.
Although such a balance will be difficult, it is often an attainable target, as evidenced by this compromise.
As rapporteur of this proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme, I was delighted to see that it is possible to coordinate strategies that can meet the interests of fishermen and of all of those involved, while ensuring that eco-systems can be preserved.
The programme on which this Agreement is based, and which the Community intends to conclude, has three key priorities: firstly, to monitor the abundance of dolphins and levels of dolphin mortality linked to tuna fishing in the area covered by the Agreement; secondly, to study the causes of dolphin mortality during fishing operations, whilst at the same time promoting fishing techniques and gear capable of minimising these effects; and thirdly, to study the impact of various fishing models on various species of fish and other creatures in the pelagic ecosystem.
In order to accomplish the objectives, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), which is coordinating this programme, is proposing to put in place a range of measures, among which I should like to highlight the implementation of sustainable fishing quotas for tuna caught in the Agreement area and the presence of on-board observers during each fishing trip.
As they are aware of the importance of conserving fishing stocks, the vessel owners and fishermen have developed fishing techniques that are less harmful to the target species and to the by-catch concerned.
It is important to emphasise that the efforts led to a reduction in the by-catch of dolphins in the Agreement area as a result of purse-seine fishing from around 150Â 000 in 1989 to 1Â 500 in 2002.
As well as playing an important part in preserving dolphin communities in this region, this Agreement has also helped to preserve the ecosystem as a whole by preserving communities of other species in addition to dolphins, such as sharks, turtles and other aquatic animals often killed, thanks to the use of different fishing gear specially designed to catch these species of tuna.
This demonstrates the high level of selectivity achieved thus far and goes to show the value of this programme that the Community is seeking to sign up to.
In addition to the technical measures involved, the programme encompasses a âdolphin-safeâ certification scheme for products caught without any harm being done to dolphins.
Let me stress the point that this certification can only be awarded to products where no dolphin â or other species not being fished â is harmed.
The issue of certification has been extensively debated in the UNâs Committee on Fisheries and Food and Agriculture Association and in the European Commission, which, as I understand, is in the process of drawing up a communication on the issue of eco-labelling.
This is a very important subject, which is worthy of debate, because in the case of tuna there are a number of non-governmental organisations that have, sometimes less than transparently, influenced the trade flow of processed tuna products in the EU.
I therefore feel, Commissioner, that following discussion in the Committee on Fisheries, this was an important time to raise awareness among the Commission and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries of the fact that the European Union needs to regulate the issue of eco-labelling, and it was to an extent with this in mind that some amendments were tabled.
I feel that there must be a public body in charge of this process, although private firms and non-governmental organisations can be partners prior or subsequent to this process.
For the entire certification process to have the highest possible credibility, however, there must be a public body in charge.
For these reasons, and in line with the guidelines of the common fisheries policy, I believe that this programme deserves a favourable opinion from Parliament with regard to the conclusion of this Agreement by the EU.
I should also like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Fisheries, and I am grateful to the members of that Committee.
I also wish to thank the scientists, the organisations, the Commission, of course, and non-governmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, which attended a mini-hearing that I had arranged.
I feel that this mini-hearing helped to convey the importance of this programme and to show that it is possible to have Agreement between fishermen, scientists and politicians on such an important issue.
It might also serve to show the EUâs future role, as I said, in a good light, as regards this Agreement, by safeguarding its content, and throughout the eco-labelling process in the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent work on this report.
As we know, it concerns the 2 billion dollar tuna industry.
We all eat tuna and we are all familiar with the wide range of dolphin-friendly labels that appear on tuna cans and jars.
These labels have, until now, been unregulated, confusing and often misleading.
This initiative seeks to change that.
The Freitas report shows why the governments of 15 countries in Latin America and Central America have joined with the EU and the US to support the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (AIDCP).
The eastern Pacific fleet targets large, mature yellow-fin tuna that swim beneath schools of dolphins, sometimes 20 000 strong.
If any dolphins are caught in the tuna nets, up to half a dozen hardy fishermen with diving equipment jump into the nets to herd the dolphins to one end, where they jump to safety over the cork lines.
Only when the last dolphin has been freed is the net hauled on board.
There is no by-catch of any kind associated with this method of tuna fishing.
Trained government observers are on board every tuna boat; vessels are licensed only if they have no record of violations; skippers must be trained and qualified; and by utilising that exhaustive system, dolphin deaths in the eastern Pacific have been dramatically reduced from 350Â 000 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1 600 per year at present.
Of an estimated population of over 10Â million dolphins in the eastern Pacific alone, this is really insignificant.
That is why Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund support this fishing method in preference to others where there is a large by-catch.
EU support for the AIDCP label has posed a significant threat to some NGOs, which have hijacked the international tuna industry and become its de facto regulators.
One Californian NGO, in particular, has become enormously rich by receiving a payment for every can of tuna carrying its dolphin-friendly label.
The fishing method that this NGO supports may well be dolphin-friendly, but it causes the death of tens of thousands of sharks as well as leatherback turtles and even young, immature yellow-fin tuna, which are tossed dead back into the sea.
It is outrageous that this organisation now holds the international tuna industry to ransom, threatening to blacklist on their website any supermarkets that refuse to sell cans of tuna carrying their dolphin-safe labels.
Members of this House have even received hostile, threatening and aggressive e-mails from the organisation this week.
Their days are now numbered.
The AIDCP label received unanimous support in the Committee on Fisheries and I believe that it will be supported by the majority of Members of this House today.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I support this report by Mr Freitas and think that the European Parliament should give a positive response to the report, the proposal for a Council decision and the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation programme known as the AIDCP.
I think that dolphins would vote for it if they could!
The goal of the AIDCP is progressively to reduce incidental dolphin mortalities in the tuna purse seine fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
The aim is to reach zero levels through the setting of annual limits and the long-term sustainability of tuna stock in the agreement area.
I also welcome the fact that the WWF and Greenpeace are supporting and promoting the agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme because it is a legally binding instrument that consolidates the results of an effort of interested governments, the tuna industry and the environmental community that, in less than 20 years, has led to a dramatic reduction of the mortality of dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
More than 100 000 dolphins were killed in 1986 but thanks to this scheme fewer than 1Â 500 were killed in 2004.
The AIDCP has established two systems: the tuna tracking and verification system, and the dolphin-safe certification system.
Many of us like to eat tuna and European consumers consume over 530 000 tonnes each year.
Most consumers would like to know that the tuna we eat has not resulted in dolphin by-catch deaths.
The accuracy of some supermarket dolphin-safe labels has been questioned and according to the WWF the AIDCP systems for tuna tracking and dolphin-safe certification together represent at present the only programme that can guarantee consumers that the tuna labelled as 'AIDCP dolphin-safe' has in fact been caught without killing or seriously injuring dolphins.
These outstanding results are obtained mainly through a system of independent observers on board, which is the only system that guarantees the coverage of 100% of the fishing trips by large tuna purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a set of stringent technical and operative requirements.
The new label which will be introduced in the EU now guarantees consumers that no dolphins have been killed.
People's purchasing power has won the day.
The international fishing community has now woken up to the fact that consumers will not accept unnecessary deaths or damage to our environment in the food and fisheries industries.
I urge colleagues to support this report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Freitas for his constructive work on a report that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support.
Industrial tuna fishing threatens not only tuna fish stocks but also other species, of which the best known is the dolphin.
The Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme came about because a very great many of our people wanted to prevent dolphins from dying as a result of bad fishing methods.
Now that we are making sure that the agreement is implemented in our legislation, it is important for these objectives to be attained.
As my fellow MEPs have described, the work has so far been quite successful.
AmendmentsÂ 9 and 11 â tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the committee, where they were supported â are important for ensuring that consumers are not taken in by labelling.
A reference to ArticleÂ 3 of the Regulation of 2003 is important for also informing everyone who fulfils the conditions about the correct labelling requirements and ensuring that no one can fecklessly take advantage of these.
This is something to which MrÂ Stevenson referred.
We cannot forgo mentioning that, for this is Parliamentâs opportunity to express its will to you as you continue to negotiate.
We must also evaluate the dolphin-safe methods, which can be improved so that they do not harm other species.
Log sets kill sea turtles and many other species.
I know that the AIDCP has embarked upon work to improve these methods.
It is important for us constantly to monitor developments and use the best possible methods.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as well as questioning the legitimacy of the EU entering into the International Dolphin Conservation Programme instead of individual States, I would also question whether the EU can be trusted to make the right judgment.
Let us consider the facts.
The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities.
Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen, now, thanks to Brussels, struggling to survive, while Spanish fishermen, for example, seem able to flout the rules at will.
Consider, too, the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP.
Then there is the fact that one million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the North Sea every year.
Not only is it hugely wasteful, it is also damaging the ecosystem.
Evidence, indeed, of the law of unintended consequences.
The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa, which allow European factory farming boats, not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins, to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish.
So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland, destroying local wild animal stocks.
These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege.
It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists.
Why, after all, should the EU listen to experts?
Vessels participating in this programme are allowed a dolphin mortality limit.
Explosives and speedboats are commonly used to scare dolphins and the programme even allows the deliberate killing of these animals, with over 1 400 observed dead last year, according to the Earth Island Instituteâs âDolphin Safeâ programme.
If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue, it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling.
After all, we in Britain have made some good decisions.
We stayed out of the euro zone, our Prime Minister has probably dealt a mortal blow to the proposed Constitution, but, instead of following good practice, the EU seeks to sign up to a questionable agreement, simply to attempt once more to justify its own dubious international status.
It shows, yet again, that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to take my turn in congratulating Mr Freitas on his exceptional report on dolphin conservation.
May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Fraga on her report on the Mediterranean.
These are thorough reports which respond to the current situation, in order to ensure that we shall have seas with fish in them both now and in the future.
May I also take this opportunity, while we are debating dolphins, to mention an incident which took place in my country.
What happened is that, after a storm at sea at the end of May, a kilometre-long net was found abandoned in the northern Aegean, which had been tossed around by the storm for 10 days and which, when it was noticed, had already caught dozens of dolphins and dozens of rare cetaceans which are threatened with extinction.
This was an ecological disaster which came to light and was discovered, because there are others which we know nothing about.
I should like to point out that the area of the northern Aegean is a rare and important marine habitat, because the River Evros flows into it, the waters come from the Dardanelles and, within the framework of protection for all seas, we must also pay particular attention to the Aegean.
This unfortunate incident proves yet again that the environment has no borders.
Broken nets spread death and this should worry us.
I should like to say that it is our duty to protect the environment and the report by our honourable friend moves in that direction, which is why we should all vote for it.
Finally, I should like to express to everyone a view which should prevail among us.
It is our duty to protect the marine environment.
Our children have a right to be able to fish in it also.
We have an obligation to leave fish in our seas for future generations.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Freitas, who has done an excellent job, as we have recognised ââ no amendments have been presented ââ and also my colleague, Mrs Stihler, who, representing the Socialist Group, has done an excellent job as shadow rapporteur.
Nevertheless, I would like to express a few humble opinions that may be a little discordant but which I believe may add some things that have not been said.
Firstly, the main reason for the European Community to be involved in the IATCC and the AIPCD stems from the presence of the European or, if you like, the Spanish, tuna fleet in the Eastern Pacific, where it has been fishing since 1975.
I say this because, in the explanatory statement in MrÂ Freitasâs report, the justification appears to be based on other reasons and not on the presence of our fleet in the Eastern Pacific.
Our fleet fishes in the Eastern Pacific and it has, of course, never fished with dolphins, because a Community Regulation prohibits it: Council Regulation No 850/98 of 30 March 1998, Article 33.
Since I believe it may be useful to this House, I would like to say that the AIPCD has been created as a result of a specific problem involving the United States fleet, and subsequently the Mexican fleet, the Venezuelan fleet and the Colombian fleet, the only ones which, together with El Salvador, currently fish with dolphins.
I believe that this is something that we, as Europeans, can be pleased about.
We, who have been fishing in that area ââ as I have said ââ since 1975, participate in the AIPCD despite the fact that our activities have nothing to do with the true objective of this agreement, because we do not fish with dolphins.
The EU signed this Agreement, the AIPCD, on 26 April 1999, it communicated that decision to the trustee of the AIPCD, the United States of America, by means of a verbal note on 8 June 1999, and at that time, the Council considered that signature and that provisional application to be the first steps to its subsequent approval by the EC.
Although, for technical reasons, the Community could not join the IATTC, the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain to accede to the IATTC Convention on an exceptional basis.
That accession took place in Guatemala in 2003.
The decision foresaw that Spain would participate in IATTC decisions in line with the Community position and in close cooperation with the Commission, which guaranteed the Communityâs effective participation in the IATTC.
I am therefore of the opinion ââ and this is an opinion ââ that the report must call ââ perhaps the Commission could enlighten us in this regard ââ for the definitive ratification of the AIPCD by the European Union, and not its accession to this Convention.
I would also like to make a comment on Amendments 11 and 12. At no point does the Regulation talk about the âdolphin-safeâ label; that label, as such, does not exist.
What Article 3 of the Regulation does contain is a series of definitions which include what is understood by ââdolphin-safe tunaâ.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I believe that we perhaps need to be a little more realistic about the issue we are discussing.
Â Â  . Mr President, once again I wish to thank this House, and in particular the Committee on Fisheries and its rapporteur, Mr Freitas, for their cooperation.
The objective is a shared one.
It is important for the Commission to enhance its role in regional fisheries organisations in supporting conservation measures that are put in place not only in European but also in international waters.
Membership of the organisation will help us attain higher standards as regards by-catches of cetaceans.
Since the establishment of the AIDCP, the by-catch of cetaceans has dropped from 150 000 to 1Â 500.
This in itself is a great success and worthy of support.
The rapporteur and other speakers raised the issue of eco-labelling.
Firstly, the option of the AIDCP âdolphin safeâ certificate by the Community is currently being examined by the Member States.
In addition, the Commission will be adopting a proposal on eco-labelling within a couple of weeks, which will clearly feed into the process of considering whether to adopt the AIDCP certificate.
The communication will set out three options for consideration: retaining the status quo, having a mandatory Community-wide label or setting minimum criteria.
At this stage, the Commission is leaning towards the third option, and we look forward to a constructive debate with Parliament and the Council.
In conclusion, I wish to assure you of the Commissionâs and my own personal commitment to continuing to work towards minimising discards and by-catch, especially of cetaceans.
I count on the support of this House, so that we can work together in achieving improvements in our current practices and methods.
With regard to the ratification process, I have taken note of your comments, and the ratification will probably take place in the near future.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0125/2005) by MrÂ Åry, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social inclusion in the new Member States (2004/2210(INI)).
Â Â  . âI am delighted that such broad consensus, encompassing virtually the whole political spectrum, has emerged among the political groups in Parliament concerning the report on social inclusion.
This is no coincidence.
It is because we are barely a year into enlargement and there is no doubt that an increase in momentum, in both social and economic terms, would definitely be in the interests of the Union.
In this regard, speeding up the process of social inclusion is by no means an issue of secondary importance; the facts show clearly that the new Member States lag behind, to a much greater extent than the old ones, in this area and therefore have a great deal of catching up to do.
I think we all agree that we do not want a two-speed Europe, a Union where the social protection system is highly developed and of a high standard in one half, while in the other half, it is as full of holes as an Emmental cheese and eroding further, year on year due to government financial difficulties, government budget constraints, restrictive measures and similar difficulties.
If such a situation were to arise, then there really would be grounds for concern about social dumping, which we all regard as undesirable.
This is why it is important in the period that lies ahead to make genuine progress, perceptible to everyone, in the field of social inclusion.
This is the only way we can prevent other social groups in the new Member States from falling into social exclusion.
If this were to happen, it would have negative consequences in terms of labour market stability, economic output and social cohesion and would give rise to a whole range of other problems.
The report is a kind of inventory of the prevailing problems and it paints a fairly accurate picture of the processes currently under way.
As regards disadvantaged sections of society, it covers almost every social group affected, focusing particularly on the situation of older people, women, minorities that suffer discrimination â including the Roma â as well as homeless people, people suffering from addiction-related problems, people living with disabilities, children at risk and immigrants.
It places particular emphasis on the close links between the provision of education and training opportunities and improved prospects for the disadvantaged citizens accessing them.
In the short time-frame available to me, I would like to continue by highlighting just three of the cardinal issues of the report.
The first key element is that it is crucial in terms of our future prospects of catching up to recognising the particularly close link that exists between job creation and the economic policies promoting it, and the social systems that represent the primary pillars of social inclusion.
It follows logically from this that social inclusion policy can only be successful if it goes in tandem with, is based on and builds on, an appropriate economic policy.
If we fail to ensure that the two are in harmony, failure in the social sphere will be inevitable.
The second key element in fact is a structural problem.
I am thinking here of the indebtedness of local authorities, which has recently accelerated to a dangerous degree and is closely connected to the fact that local authority finances have been unable to keep pace with the expansion of their social duties.
This is not a problem that is exclusive to the new Member States; it is a familiar phenomenon in the old Member States too.
Of course it is perfectly logical that governments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, should try to address the majority of problems at local level and the reasoning that most information is always available at local level is perfectly valid.
For this to work, however, financial resources need to be provided and this has unfortunately failed to happen in recent years.
As a consequence, we now find ourselves in a situation where, for example â if I may cite an alarming case in point â the combined local authority debt of the four âVisegrÃ¡dâ countries has now exceeded the psychological barrier of 10 billion euros.
Debt on this scale certainly gives grounds for common reflection at the very least.
For my third point, I would like to refer to the matter of cooperation.
It is true â and the report does not dispute this â that social policy is an area of national responsibility of Member States.
And so it should be.
However, the ability to exercise national competences is by no means impeded by exchanging good practice and sharing information; furthermore, it is in the fundamental interests of all of us.
Alongside serious problems, we need to see that there are hosts of good initiatives, innovative ideas that point the way forward and successful projects.
Why should we not share these with each other?
Unfortunately, the situation at present is that the new Member States pay too little attention to each other and so in most cases, things that could potentially be common treasures, stay hidden and others are unaware of their existence.
Appropriate institutional frameworks for this are lacking too.
So, in my opinion, these are the three main areas in which we need to make substantive progress.
Allow me once again to express my thanks to the political groups and to my colleagues for their highly constructive and helpful support throughout the process of drafting the report.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission congratulates Mr Åry on his excellent and comprehensive report on social inclusion in the new Member States.
It is a very timely and helpful report, which should significantly strengthen our efforts to promote social inclusion across the Union.
Most of the points and policy priorities recommended in the document are very much in line with, and reinforce, the Commission's own analysis of the situation.
The report is also very useful as it draws attention to a number of issues that require greater emphasis and more effort from Member States and the Commission.
The importance of tackling poverty and social exclusion and building a more inclusive Union was reinforced in the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Brussels.
The social inclusion process will operate in parallel with and complement the Lisbon agenda, focusing on economic growth and employment.
In that way our efforts in the areas of economic growth, employment policy and social cohesion can reinforce each other.
The ongoing mid-term evaluation of the EU's social inclusion process will, towards the end of the year, lead to a communication proposing new integrated and streamlined common objectives and working methods for the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion.
The points raised in your resolution are a very valuable contribution to the current evaluation of the process.
We will take them into account when we prepare our communication.
We have been making significant progress on several issues raised in the report since the Commission and the new Member States prepared their joint memoranda on social inclusion in 2003.
I should like to mention two of them: harmonisation of statistics and the exchange of learning.
You rightly emphasise the importance of harmonising poverty statistics and criteria defining poverty.
There has been very good cooperation between the national statistics offices and Eurostat in developing our new statistical instrument, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC.
That will certainly help us monitor progress across the Union.
As regards the exchange of good practice, the new Member States have been playing an increasingly active role in the current Community Action Programme on Social Exclusion.
The proposed new Community Action Programme (Progress) will, from 2007, allow us to further extend the exchange of learning and good practice.
Another important issue raised in the report is increasing the resources available for social inclusion matters.
In this regard responsibility rests primarily with the national authorities.
However, the Commission put strong emphasis on ensuring that the use of European social funds is closely connected with the goals indicated in the national action plans on employment and social inclusion.
As clearly stated in the resolution, improvement is required in almost all the dimensions of social life.
At the same time, most new Member States are undergoing difficult economic reforms and many are faced with high levels of unemployment.
There are also significant budgetary constraints, which limit the room for manoeuvre for social policy.
We have to be realistic and bold in addressing these major structural issues.
Ensuring economic and employment growth will certainly help to increase social cohesion, but investing in social inclusion and human capacity is an essential complementary element in supporting sustainable employment and economic progress.
The report will help ensure that we continue to have a strong social inclusion process.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of the joint memorandums on social inclusion by all of the new Member States and by the Commission marks a clear political commitment aimed at putting the fight against poverty and social exclusion at the heart of every national policy.
Parliament supports and upholds this step.
Our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls in particular on the Commission to succeed in outlining a common policy in the form of a common theme, a clear policy shared by all of the Member States.
In order to do this, the European Commission has to consider the appropriateness of choosing the open method of coordination, which is clearly unable to fully achieve the assigned objective; make sufficient funds available for the project, in order to make the citizens and residents of the new Member States more involved in the European project; carry out an evaluative across-the-board analysis, refocusing on the failure to respect civil liberties, access to fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, and facilitate the task of preparing any sanctions that may be needed; highlight more clearly the problems relating to access to the law and justice, with a more detailed analysis of migration patterns, distinguishing between immigration of third-country nationals and the situation of other ethnic or cultural minorities; review the existing division of responsibilities between the Union, the Member States and the regions, and propose means of institutionalising the âbest practiceâ approach; ensure access to the legal system for vulnerable groups and minorities; unify, streamline and simplify the emergency procedures and resolve the remaining problems regarding stateless or other persons in difficulty who continue to be denied citizenship or the right of residence.
As a result of these efforts concerning fundamental rights, the European Union can develop towards achieving a greater level of justice and shared civic values, which are the foundations of the social Europe that we all hope and pray for.
Â Â  . The report on social inclusion in the new Member States highlights a wide range of new challenges.
The rapporteur has identified these challenges very clearly, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work.
Poverty and the related problem of social inclusion have a specific dimension in the new Member States.
This is not only because the poverty threshold is considerably lower in absolute terms, which means that poverty is ultimately more severe than in the 15 old Member States; it is also because poverty takes on special forms for the women of these countries.
All sources indicate that single parents and older women are the most likely to face a greater risk.
The opinion of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality therefore highlights extreme forms of poverty and an absolute shortage of comparable and reliable data.
However, there is a very dangerous phenomenon that seems to be emerging, and which has been overshadowed by data on the adult population, namely the high risk of child poverty.
Although analyses indicate that poverty affecting children is often more severe and that the number of children facing the risk of poverty is increasing, exact figures are not available.
University research conducted in 2001 estimated that the risk of child poverty in the old Member States exceeded that of the adult population by as much as 14%.
A national report on youth policy which was published in my country yesterday states that the proportion of children facing poverty is 30%, or as much as 40% for those in single families.
It is impossible to ignore the correlation between this figure and the alarmingly high number of early school-leavers: 14% of girls and 18% of boys in Europe in 2004.
Ladies and gentlemen, poverty is generally said to have a womanâs face.
We should perhaps modify this generalisation: poverty has a childâs face.
When considering implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Inclusion Strategy, we should bear this in mind.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is clearly a very real problem of social exclusion for many people in many of the new Member States.
This report highlights some of the problems and some of the causes.
It also pinpoints some of the solutions.
However, what is so impressive is that this report does not come from an MEP from one of the old Member States, lecturing the newcomers on what they should do to catch up; this rapporteur comes from one of the new Member States.
He writes with passion and knowledge about the problem, because he understands what needs to be done, because he is not afraid to pinpoint failings in his own country, and because he cares.
He is a perfect example of one of the many talented MEPs who have joined this Parliament following enlargement.
He is right to flag the need for better education and right to raise the importance of increased funding by central government in this regard.
He is also right to talk about improving labour mobility, because unless there is more flexibility in the labour markets, the economies cannot fulfil their growth potential and the funds will simply not be there for governments to spend.
There is a lesson here, too, for older Member States.
Finally, I welcome the wisdom of the rapporteur and I congratulate him strongly on his report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by thanking our colleague, Mr Åry, for his excellent report.
I would remind the House that the report he has drafted on social inclusion in the new EU Member States, which we are today discussing together, was approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by a majority of 32 votes to 4.
The result of the vote is, then, a clear demonstration that we all, across the political spectrum, recognise and acknowledge the urgency of problems relating to social exclusion.
Nonetheless, we are not unfamiliar with this finding.
We all know that representatives of European governments and countries came to the same conclusions at the Lisbon summit in 2000, when the war on poverty and social exclusion was made one of the central topics and conditions for modernising the European social model.
Despite certain hesitations, this view was also confirmed at this yearâs spring summit in Brussels.
Looking at the results achieved during the last five years, it is clear that the war on poverty and social exclusion is nowhere near over, and that considerable efforts and resolve will be needed even after 2010.
The European Commission has undertaken a truly difficult task in comparing the state of social exclusion in the 10 new Member States.
These countries differ not only from each other; fundamental differences also exist between the regions within them.
Although there is still room for elaborating and harmonising common indicators that would most faithfully reflect the actual situation in these countries and, at the same time, enable us to discover examples of new practices, this action by the European Commission is undoubtedly a step forward.
I would like to use this occasion to call on its representatives to cooperate as closely as possible in the future and to make use of the resources and knowledge of non-governmental organisations and social partners.
I would also like to mention the fact that although the report that we have before us today describes and endeavours to compare the situations in the 10 new Member States, we must not forget that the threat of poverty and social exclusion is faced by every EU Member State, albeit not to the same degree.
The opinion is often expressed that social partners, and in particular trade union organisations, should be closely involved in all measures in order to help solve the problem of social exclusion; indeed, the question of whether they should take over the functions of state and local authority has even been considered.
Such opinions are no more than an illusion, however, at least in the meantime.
The restructured trade unions in the new Member States are in a difficult situation; they are subject to pressure, they lack the necessary structures and they do not have effective tools available to them.
Mr Åry is well aware of this, as am I, since we have both worked in trade unions.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what one might think, todayâs debate on the report on social inclusion in the new Member States is very much linked to the urgent issues we have been discussing since the start of this part-session.
I refer to the Constitutional Treaty and the Financial Perspective.
An understanding of the most complex social problems faced by the Member States and a desire to solve these problems would render moot many of the arguments put forward by those who voted against the Constitution.
The reason for this is that many issues relating to EU enlargement were either misrepresented to these voters or misunderstood by them.
The Åry report is thus concerned with solutions to problems that have a direct bearing on the EUâs future.
Our debate on this issue, and the majority by which the House adopts the report, will prove that we are aware of the significance of this problem, and that we know it involves banishing the spectre of social dumping from the European Union.
What is more, the fact that the goals of competitiveness and social cohesion as enshrined in the Lisbon strategy are complementary rather than mutually exclusive is emphasised.
This was why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlined the importance of economic development in facilitating social inclusion during its debates on the report, and indeed the Commissioner also stressed this aspect of the issue a short while ago.
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Åry on the way in which this report has been drafted.
I am delighted that the aforesaid Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted it by an overwhelming majority.
Improvements could perhaps have been made to the way in which the proposed amendments were incorporated.
In fact a number of the amendments I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were ignored, even though they would have improved the report without making any fundamental changes.
The report we are debating today is an excellent one, and my group will vote in favour of it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, my Group supports the report on social inclusion in the new Member States and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Åry, on his report.
I wish to make some comments about the process of EU integration.
In the majority of the new Member States, the only social stratum benefiting from EU accession is the national, economic and political elite.
As can be seen in the report, the gap between rich and poor has become wider.
For example, in my country, Latvia, a recent opinion poll showed that 84% of the population thought that their standard of living was much better ten years ago.
The national, economic and political elite is mostly responsible for the current social disintegration in their countries.
However, because they have ignored the unfavourable changes in the new EU Member States, the EU institutions must bear part of the blame.
The social instability in the new Member States is endangering political stability and economic growth not only in those states, but also in the EU as a whole.
This is the result of a number of mistakes made by EU institutions during the enlargement process.
One such mistake was to ignore the fact that in two Baltic States, Latvia and Estonia, a significant part of the population is stateless.
These so-called âaliensâ belong to national minorities, and the fact that they are deprived of political rights promotes social exclusion and means that persons belonging to minorities cannot compete on equal terms in the labour market
Unfortunately, yesterday, during the vote on the amendments to the report by Mr Moraes on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies, the recommendations that these people should be given the right to participate in local elections and granted freedom of movement within the Community were removed as a result of the amendments tabled by some political groups.
This totally ignores the EU's own recommendations made in 2004 as part of the enlargement process.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, since we are discussing social inclusion, we should not forget that around 150Â million EU citizens have an income of less than 75% of the EU average.
Two thirds of these people live in the new Member States.
On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his accurate depiction of this complex problem, the solution to which is to slash the number of areas of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.
The latter are frequently interrelated, and are sometimes passed on from one generation to the next, which is a point I should like to stress.
All our strategies and debates will be worthless unless they achieve certain goals.
Firstly, they must make it possible for rapid assistance to be provided to those who need it.
This is an important albeit short-term goal that requires appropriate funding.
Secondly, they must eliminate poverty, which is the main cause of social disintegration, or at the very least greatly reduce it.
This is a long-term goal, and in order to achieve it we will need to boost the economic regeneration of the new regions, thus mitigating the scourge of unemployment.
Today I should like to pay tribute to all those working to achieve these goals throughout the EU, especially in the 10Â new Member States.
I should therefore like to thank local governments and NGOs, including in particular Caritas, as well as social welfare institutions and philanthropists for the work they do.
I should like to thank those who create new jobs.
If I may, I should like to dwell upon just two issues in detail.
The first of these is the family.
Demographic indicators are causing alarm bells to ring, and assistance for families raising children is a necessity rather than generosity on anyoneâs part.
We need to find the right solutions.
Secondly, there are over 45Â million disabled people in the EU.
They should at long last be made to feel that they have the same rights as any other EU citizen.
Finally, there is also a moral dimension to the issues under debate.
It is far from easy for a man who has eaten his fill to understand a man who is hungry.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Åry report is a valuable document that highlights the ongoing social disintegration of the new Member States.
The post-Communist countries have experienced so many changes and transformations over a short space of time that our heads are still spinning.
One-time Communists quickly found their feet in this new situation.
After plundering state coffers, they metamorphosed into businessmen or remained in politics.
The weakest in society, and by this I mean whole social classes, have been the least able to find their bearings in the new set-up.
Workers have lost their jobs and found themselves in debt after being deprived of their means of production and their markets.
Health care is no longer accessible to everyone.
The welfare state has downed tools, and citizens have discovered they have been left to their own resources overnight.
Polish citizens do not have much faith in their own politicians.
Instead, they place their trust in the EU and pin great hopes on it.
More money is needed to achieve our ambitious goals of social inclusion, job creation and the promotion of entrepreneurship.
This is a strategically important stage of the debate on the EU budget, and the Commission and the Council should not forget that every euro invested in the new Member States remains in the EUâs pocket and amounts to investing in the EU itself.
Â Â  The debate is suspended here to leave time for the vote.
The debate will resume this afternoon.
Â Â  The competent Italian authorities have communicated a request for the waiver of MrÂ Marco Pannellaâs parliamentary immunity in view of criminal proceedings before the Rome District Court.
In accordance with Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the request has already been referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has competence in this area.
Whilst a debate on the communication in question is not planned, I believe that it is appropriate to give the floor, albeit very briefly, to MrÂ Pannella.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I asked to take the floor to raise a point of order, in accordance with Rule 6(2), to which you have referred.
I wished to inform you and the House that this request for waiver, of which you have notified us, must be reconciled with the fact that Parliament already turned down the request for waiver of immunity almost unanimously on 10 February 2004, hence a year and a half ago now.
We have established that the decision was duly communicated to the competent Italian authorities by both Parliament and the Italian delegation on 23Â February 2004, and that it was published in the Official Journal of 22 April 2004.
This new request â which will once again waste our time â therefore demonstrates that, in addition to spaghetti in clam sauce, we also export âclam justiceâ everywhere, which is not always palatable.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Pannella.
The competent committee will certainly be able to give its opinion on the merits of the case.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, I may perhaps be a bit late in calling halt, but this is an important question relating to Amendment 15 to paragraph 27.
This paragraph discusses the abuse of children in Africa by UN troops, and the amendment asserts that the UN did not do enough to investigate it.
For a start, that has nothing whatever to do with the reform of the UN, and, moreover, what it says bears no relation to the investigations the UN is carrying out.
I believe I just saw that a majority supports our amendment aimed at deleting this paragraph, and I would ask you, if at all possible, to check this again.
Â Â  MrÂ Laschet, I do beg your pardon.
I certainly appreciate the merits of the matter but the procedure does not allow me to put to the vote again an amendment that has already been put to the vote and rejected.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Laschet is quite right.
Our group joined with the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in voting for this paragraph to be deleted.
You said that the amendment failed; it was in fact adopted, and the paragraph was deleted.
You have come to the wrong conclusion.
The motion was carried, and this paragraph has therefore been deleted.
Â Â  MrÂ Leinen, I will confirm it â I am obviously always willing to double-check, inasmuch as nobody is infallible: it seems that the groups wished to vote, Members did not raise their hands, the vote was carried out and unfortunately I had to acknowledge the outcome of the vote.
No recount was requested and I cannot set a negative precedent on the voting procedures.
I am the first to regret this but I have to proceed with voting time.
Â Â  We believe that it should be up to individual Member States to adopt positions on possible support for the agreement on the conservation of dolphins.
This is not an issue that should be dealt with by the European Parliament.
Â Â  . As the report says, SMEs account for over 95% of the enterprises in the Union.
They therefore play an important economic and social role and consequently deserve greater Community support.
Just as in previous reports, however, the emphasis is placed on measures which, under the guise of working towards competitiveness, in reality act against the interests of micro-enterprises and SMEs and work in favour of the large corporations, the large economic and financial groups and the multinationals.
For example, we disagree that the ongoing âstructural changeâ in the EU is beneficial and to be encouraged.
Thousands of jobs are on the line and âchangeâ of this kind has enormous economic and social ramifications.
Whereas the rapporteur notes that the analysis of âstructural changeâ is incomplete, she also says that there is no indisputable data on relocation and confines herself to suggesting that the Council should commission a report.
The truth is that large numbers of relocations are happening, with disastrous consequences.
More effective measures must therefore be taken to prevent rising unemployment and worsening standards of living.
Â Â  .â European industry is undergoing major hardships at the moment.
In actual fact, it is subject to a formidable scissor effect between, on the one hand, the unilateral opening up of the European markets to unrestrained global competition and, on the other, the dogmatic policies of the EU: a policy of competition that prevents any European champions from emerging and prevents support for new activities that the market alone would not be able to bring to the fore; and regulations in every field, which increase the constraints and costs, and the list goes on.
What is becoming of industrial competitiveness when we see 1Â 200 pages of the REACH Directive on the chemicals industry, a genuine regulatory monster, none of which anyone understands, apart from the fact that, as it stands, it risks increasing the number of business closures and relocations and sounding the death knell for European research in that sector.
Not all of MrÂ Vlastoâs proposals are bad.
However, the major fault of his report is to consider ultraliberal globalisation as an inescapable reality and as fundamentally beneficial and only to see solutions, as usual, in more Europe.
By straying in this direction, the European Union has, until now, only succeeded in creating unemployment, poverty, disappointment and rejection.
Â Â  . European industry is undergoing structural changes, due to international factors, but more so for internal reasons.
Apart from the first phase of coal and steel, the EU has turned its back on its industry, despite it being a source of jobs, economic growth, services, skills and know-how that no developed economy can afford to underestimate.
The EU must therefore channel all its efforts into a consistent and proactive policy towards its industry, a policy that can both anticipate structural change and develop a sound and competitive industrial base.
European industry has no choice but to invest in its strengths, such as its human potential, its capacity for innovation and its SME-based entrepreneurial fabric, thereby setting itself apart from its competitors.
This support for industrial policy involves balanced development that maintains social cohesion.
We must not lose sight of the impact of recent relocations on the regions.
Structural funds such as the European Social Fund could be channelled into supporting socio-economic and industrial retraining in the worst affected regions.
One solution would be to create synergies between businesses, universities and research centres, thereby providing a lasting foundation for industrial activity in a given region.
Â Â  . In MarchÂ 2005, the Council carried out a review of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), with a view to making it a more flexible and streamlined instrument.
The Council opted to place the emphasis more firmly on the âGâ of Growth than the âSâ of Stability, in light of the current economic recession that the EU is experiencing.
The SGP thus became more politicised.
This review fell short of what was required, however, for a number of reasons, of which I shall highlight two.
Firstly, reform was only needed because some Member States chose, consciously or otherwise, not to observe its rules.
Worse still, the EU laid down rules that, quite apart from not being implemented, led to a lax and scarcely credible sanctions process.
The Member States are both the judge and the defendant, and would rather fail to implement the SGP than impose sanctions on one of their peers.
Being responsible for monitoring the process, the Commission must be granted powers to impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance.
Secondly, any sanction must act as a deterrent and not solely as a punishment.
Imposing a non-compliance fine on a Member State with budget difficulties is counterproductive.
Other sanctions should be put in place, such as suspending ECOFIN voting rights.
Â Â  .â This report has provided the opportunity for a productive collaboration between the three European institutions and industry, resulting in an agreement on environmental needs.
Agreement was reached on a fundamental point, the withdrawal of harmful PAH substances and the introduction of safer alternatives.
The European Parliament has agreed to grant industry an extra year in order to meet this objective and authorises the sale of existing stocks of which there is not, in the end, a very large quantity.
We have here a case in which environmental ambition has boosted research and is enabling this industrial sector, and therefore employment, to be strengthened and the quality of products to be improved.
It is therefore possible to draw a conclusion at first reading.
Â Â  . As I said in my speech in plenary, this reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is woefully inadequate.
What we really need is to suspend the SGP and to make a complete break from the economic guidelines in place in order to create the macro-conditions to revitalise the economy and to create more jobs.
That is why we advocate a genuine Growth, Employment and Social Progress Pact.
A further reason why we voted against was that the rapporteur seeks to involve the European Central Bank and proposes that the Commission should carry out financial auditing on the Member States.
This is a perfect example of a report that loses sight of the underlying reasons behind the ânoâ vote on the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ in France and the Netherlands, and of the need to address the peopleâs concerns.
Â Â  .â The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact proposed to us now is only marginal, but it is no less important as a consequence.
What is regrettable is that it will have taken eight years in order to realise that the rise in deficits did not come about solely on the basis of the disastrous and completely arbitrary figure of 3% of GDP, but also as a result of ârelevant factorsâ: continually weak growth, ageing populations, the consequences of the botched enlargement of the EU or of unfettered globalisation, and so on.
It was about time.
That is not enough, however.
The Europe of Brussels has just spent the last ten years sacrificing millions of jobs in adhering to dogmatic quantified targets (3% of GDP for government deficits, 60% for government debt or, again, a maximum inflation rate fixed by the European Central Bank at 2%).
It must now make employment and the prosperity of its people its primary objective, to which all, absolutely all, other objectives must give way, whatever may be the views expressed on the matter by the Frankfurt Bank, the zealots of pure and perfect competition or those of completely unrestrained global free trade.
Â Â  We are unsympathetic to the EU having to provide financial support to the fishing industry in connection with biological recovery periods.
That position does not mean that we support the Commissionâs proposal.
We are well disposed to individual wordings in Parliamentâs report, for example to the effect that measures relating to highly migratory species are to be laid down by regional fisheries organisations.
We are voting against the report as a whole because we do not believe that the EU should work on fisheries issues.
We recommend that regional fisheries issues be handled through cooperation between the countries concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, this report does not solve any problems whatever; it only serves to aggravate the ones that already exist.
It repeatedly pleads for new legal immigration, while most Member States do not know how to address the problems this already brings with it, such as the level of unemployment and crime among certain groups of immigrants, which is significantly higher than in the indigenous population.
Nor can we avoid the conclusion that large groups of immigrants deliberately choose not to integrate.
Even if we were to adopt a thousand reports like the Gaubert report, containing new repressive measures against Europeans who avail themselves of their right to free expression of opinion in order to voice their dissatisfaction with the situation, it would not make the slightest bit of difference.
This is talk for talkâs sake, and it will come as no surprise to you that I have voted against the Gaubert report.
Â Â  â Mr President, if broad swathes of the European public have problems with mass immigration, what this indicates is not that they are xenophobic, but that the immigrants in question are poorly integrated.
Consideration of the facts makes it clear why this is so.
Let us take note of the fact that Germany has at least 3.5Â million Muslims living in it, some of them for 40 years, who can still scarcely speak any German.
Let us also take note of the estimates according to which, in a few decadesâ time, half the inhabitants of France and, quite possibly, one third of the population of German cities such as Stuttgart, will be of the Islamic faith.
Let us perhaps give some thought to the regions of Italy in which illegal immigrants are responsible for one third or even one half of all criminal offences.
Let us consider how, in Spain, home to over a million Muslims, calls are even now being made to allow Cordoba Cathedral to be used as a mosque again.
All this is evidence that these immigrants are very poorly integrated.
It is essential that they should not only learn the languages of the countries to which they come to live, but also assume as their own the culture and history of their new homelands.
If they fail to do so, the European states will, in a few decadesâ time, have no idea whatever of their own identity.
Â Â  .
Given that the entry of economic migrants lies at the heart of any immigration policy, a joint legal framework must be created and integration policies must be stepped up, setting out basic common principles as regards the integration of legal immigrants.
Three key axes must therefore be put in place:
- the promotion of legal immigration, as part of a global and horizontal approach, commensurate with each Member Stateâs actual capacity; special emphasis must be placed on working in tandem with countries of origin and transit, not least by means of information campaigns.
- effective integration of immigrants, with reception and integration policies that must take account of the each Member Stateâs characteristics and historical ties.
A range of common rights for all migrants in the EU should be drawn up, yet we must not lose sight of the fact that excessive âgenerosityâ in granting further rights, such as the right to vote, may result in more resistance and be the source of unwanted xenophobia.
- resolutely combating illegal immigration; attempts must be made to put a stop to illegal immigration, if possible in the country of origin, and to problems relating to the economic exploitation of migrants.
All forms of trafficking in human beings must also be prevented, and punished where they do occur.
Â Â  In order to avoid constructing a Fortress Europe, it is important for us not to create a uniform European asylum and immigration policy.
Each Member State should be free to conduct, if it so wishes, a more generous policy in this area, something that is impeded if the Member States are hamstrung by common EU standards.
The June List cannot, therefore, support the report.
Â Â  .â This report is, at one and the same time, monumentally trite, untrue, inept and propagandist in its pro-immigration stance.
Trite statements appear in recital M, in which it is pointed out that a change in the migration policy of one Member State affects migration flows in other Member States.
Those are only the obvious consequences of the Schengen Agreement and of an area without borders!
That does not, however, prevent MrÂ Gaubert from calling, in paragraph 32, for mass regularisation operations in connection with immigrants.
The illogicality and irresponsibility of this report do not end there.
After having called for the potential of immigration to be fully optimised and having reaffirmed the right of non-nationals not to be turned back at borders, to access the labour market and to participate in public and political life, the report points out that all of these policies must fall within the framework of the principles of solidarity and shared responsibilities laid down in the Constitutional Treaty!
Is it necessary to point out that that text has been buried by the twin ânoâ vote of the French and the Dutch and by the fact that the British have put it on hold?
The pro-immigration lobby should come down from its ivory tower and start to listen to the voice from below, the voice of the nations.
Â Â  .â This report, aimed at âorganisingâ immigration and promoting âintegrationâ, is a classic of its kind, coy about the causes, blind as to the consequences and completely dictatorial as to the solutions to be applied to these issues.
In the face of an ageing European population, matched by a continuously low birth rate and a forecasted decline in the active population of around 20 million between 2005 and 2030, the rapporteur, as a right-wing Member but also as the leader of an âanti-racistâ organisation, plans to introduce additional immigration, which will penalise our economy and weaken our national cohesion.
With its aim of âbuilding an intercultural societyâ, that is to say, one organised around ethnic or religious considerations, European policy is out of touch with social and economic realities or the experience of minority groups and is potentially a source of conflict.
In order for immigrant groups to be integrated, they must show a greater desire for this to take place and make the necessary efforts to assimilate.
The European demagogues choose to overlook the need for a boost to the European birth rate and for a family policy worthy of the name and the urgent need to adjust our labour market to demand in order to curb unemployment.
Finally, the report fails to address the issue of a radical form of Islam taking root on our soil, with all of the consequences that that entails for womenâs rights, security and democracy.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of MrÂ Gaubertâs report on legal and illegal migration and integration of migrants.
We are, however, aware of the fact that parts of the report concern an area covered by TitleÂ IV of the EC Treaty and do not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmarkâs position.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, last night I fell asleep thinking about how I should vote on the Bowis report on patient mobility in the European Union and I dreamt of the gorgeous Italian blonde, Elena, who was complimenting me precisely at dinner.
She was saying to me: âWell done, Carlo.
Your proposal to facilitate tourist travel in Europe for all pensioners has been approved.
Obviously, they will have to go round every hospital in Europe, but you cannot have it all in this world; you have to make do and therefore vote in favour of the report.â
Could I refuse to follow the advice of gorgeous blonde Elena?
No, and consequently I have voted in favour.
Â Â  We chose in the final vote to vote in favour of the European Parliamentâs own-initiative report on patient mobility.
We did so because we think that the text of the resolution as a whole expresses our view of healthcare.
There are, however, parts of the European Parliamentâs resolution that give expression to certain supranational ambitions, unacceptable to ourselves, in the area of healthcare.
Each country is responsible for its inhabitantsâ healthcare.
When the latter are temporarily in another EEA country, their European Health Card entitles them to unplanned treatment there.
That is an arrangement of which we approve and that appears to operate well.
People are entitled to influence the way in which their tax money is used.
If patients are freely to be able to choose healthcare in another Member State and have it paid for by their own countryâs taxpayers, that principle is threatened.
We fear, moreover, that such an arrangement would be very expensive and favour wealthy patients at the expense of the most vulnerable ones.
We also believe that issues concerned with healthcare should not be dealt with in the draft Services Directive.
Â Â  . The report by Mr Bowis on patient mobility and healthcare developments seeks to ensure the patientâs right to seek timely treatment in another Member State, if this is not available in his/her own country or not within a reasonable period of time.
We therefore broadly welcome the report, although it falls well short of what is required and is even contradictory in some areas.
The rapporteur believes that the Member States are responsible for arranging, funding and providing medical care and health services, although he does not mention health professionals and settles for vaguely stating that it is the Unionâs responsibility to guarantee public health.
The report also stresses the priority of maintaining and ensuring unrestricted and universal access to the public health service in any EU country, although it is not entirely clear who is going to pay.
A further salient point is that health services are intended for people in need and cannot therefore be compared with goods offered for sale; this should therefore not be included in the general services directive.
Â Â  As matters stand, EU citizens are entitled to receive healthcare in other Member States and to have the cost of it reimbursed to them in their own countries.
This is regarded as a natural part of the internal market.
We welcome a uniform framework that clarifies the right to seek healthcare in another EU country.
We are thus well disposed towards the Commissionâs communication on patient mobility (COM (2004) 0301).
Parliamentâs report deals with areas other than the measures required for achieving satisfactory rules governing the ability to receive healthcare in another EU country.
The report deals with everything from telemedicine to EU research on patient mobility.
We have thus chosen to vote against Parliamentâs report as a whole.
Â Â  . Patient mobility is a complex issue in view of the differences between national healthcare systems and medical care traditions.
Patients must nonetheless have the right to seek timely treatment in another Member State if this is not available in their own country or not within a reasonable period of time.
