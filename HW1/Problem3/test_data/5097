What is at stake here is ability of the EUâs ports to compete, being as they are crucially important as nodal points in the trans-European networks.
We all share in the task of making these ports more efficient, and so I ask you to accept the outcome of the conciliation procedure and endorse it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the House and the Conciliation Committee for their work in relation to the proposal for a Directive on access to the port services market.
Allow me in particular to thank the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, MrÂ Imbeni, and the rapporteur, MrÂ Jarzembowski, for the hard work they have undertaken on such a complex issue.
The House is being asked to vote on a compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee.
I would like to say very clearly that the Commission supports this compromise; although I know that certain honourable Members are opposed to it, I would like to ask you to reflect before rejecting this compromise.
I believe this compromise is essential to European transport policy.
This compromise does not mean a complete liberalisation of port services, as I have heard throughout the previous debate.
Far from it.
All it means is a small degree of openness so that certain types of service can be carried out by means of self-handling, that is to say, only using on-board personnel.
Ladies and gentlemen, every day we talk about wanting transport which respects the environment and which is sustainable, that we want to promote short sea shipping, so we cannot then vote the next day against a measure which is going to facilitate the development of this type of transport.
What I would like to say to you is that we must be coherent with the proposals we make.
The proposal we are voting on, particularly in the form it now takes following the discussions in Parliament, following Parliamentâs amendments, following the negotiations with the Council, is a very balanced and very moderate proposal, but it can clearly serve to promote maritime cabotage, something which is essential to guaranteeing a sustainable transport system in Europe.
We have had three years of negotiations and I simply believe that rejecting this initiative would cause very serious problems for transport policy in the coming years.
I would like to remind you of some of the aspects of the text which will be put to the vote on Thursday.
The initial proposal was limited to rules applicable within a given port.
Well, Parliament firmly insisted on the need to address the issue of competition between ports and this point, which the Commission accepted, has been corrected in the final text, in agreement with the Council.
The Commissionâs initial proposal referred to self-handling with on-board and land-based personnel.
It is true; we opened up the issue of self-handling for companies with land-based personnel.
Parliament raised two types of issue: one, the social guarantees to prevent social dumping, an issue which the Commission accepted, and two: restricting even further the margin of this self-handling and reducing it to on-board personnel.
At the moment we are only talking about on-board personnel.
It is obvious that this self-handling by on-board personnel is going to function with short distance transport.
It is not going to function with the great trans-ocean forms of transport because of the type of goods transported and the type of ship used.
We are therefore talking about something that is key to the development of short distance transport.
Parliament's position is therefore maintained and self-handling has been restricted to on-board personnel. And, furthermore, with the social guarantees I referred to earlier.
In the initial proposal pilotage was considered a commercial service subject to all the rules.
Parliament proposed its exclusion and in the end we have reached an agreement which means a degree of openness with regard to pilotage.
But, let us make it very clear that we are not liberalising the piloting service.
What we are talking about is, for example â and once again we are talking about cabotage and short sea shipping â the captain who uses a route on a daily basis, or two or three times a week, who knows the route perfectly, being able possibly to obtain authorisation not to require pilotage.
We are talking about a measure which is key to short sea shippingThis is not going to affect trans-ocean traffic in which the ship docks at the same port once, twice or five times a year.
This issue only affects those ships which have regular routes, that is, once again, the issue of short sea shipping.
I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission has been enormously flexible throughout this discussion.
We believe that some of the measures proposed by the honourable Members have improved the texts â I have not referred to them, because they were not controversial.
Others, which raised or reflected problems, even of a political nature, we have tried to balance as far as possible.
What remains in the end is the minimum, but it is a vital minimum, and I would like to insist on this point, vital in order to be able to promote cabotage, essentially cabotage within the European Union.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask for your support, for your vote, for this compromise proposal which was reached the other day in the Conciliation Committee.
I would like once again to thank Mr Imbeni and of course Mr Jarzembowski for their work throughout this time.
Â Â  Mr President, today, with the report by Mr Jarzembowski, whom I should like to congratulate on the lengthy efforts he has made to bring us to this point, we are essentially doing no more than what we did when Parliament called for postal services to be opened up to competition, railway services to be opened up to competition and air transport to be opened up to competition.
It would be strange if this Parliament, which has been at the vanguard of opening up these services, came along tomorrow and said, for incomprehensible reasons â to me at least â that there must be an exception from this long line of action to open up all these services to competition and that the exception was port services.
At the end of the day, as Mrs de Palacio said, numerous positions expressed by Parliament were accepted during discussions with the Council.
Pilotage services, which are an exception, self-handling, which has been restricted to on board ship, competition between ports, where basically Parliament's position was accepted, while the Commission â at the beginning of the procedure at least â was against.
Protecting employment rights, where there is an express provision in the directive that we cannot have a lower level of protection than that which exists in each Member State.
Consequently, I at least honestly fail to understand why certain people continue to oppose what we have achieved which, it should be pointed out, does not make industry absolutely happy, especially the shipowners, who wanted something bolder.
I, for my part, think that this compromise which we have before us serves the interests of industry to a certain degree in that there are other service providers â it breaks the monopoly and there is greater choice â and it serves the workers, because in this way new companies are being created and new companies mean new jobs.
Consequently, it is a step forward, which is why we must support the outcome of the conciliation and vote yes.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one can have the same goals, Commissioner, whilst nevertheless pursuing them by different means.
German ports, at any rate, are currently enjoying impressive growth, and doing so without this directive.
Things can evidently go the other way.
This week, this House has had the great opportunity to make it clear that, far from us being the Councilâs agent, our primary obligation is to people, citizens and workers.
Let me remind you: at second reading stage, all of us in this House, by very, very large majorities, joined together in calling for three important things: we wanted the portsâ financial relations to be made transparent and put on a regulated footing, and that has, in part, been achieved.
We wanted pilotage services in shipping not to be just any port service like tugboats or mooring, subject to the prevalent great economic pressure that there is in ports, and not to be subject to competition but committed to safety.
Being a special public task, pilotage services do not belong in this directive, but we have not managed to keep them out of it.
One very important point is that we wanted self-handling to be restricted to the ship and its crew, but with discretionary approval and with decent conditions in terms of social security and labour law.
Let me quote once again: âSelf-handlers shall be treated in the same way as other port service providers.
To this end, self-handlers must adhere to the same standards of social protection and possess the same vocational qualifications as other service providers in the same, or a similar, port system.â
That is what the Council rejected; that is what we failed to achieve.
We cannot, then, describe this as a fair compromise; it is more like kow-towing to the Council.
If, then, you want the pilots, who guide ships safely into our ports, to continue to have obligations in terms of safety and the environment, then you have to reject what has come out of this conciliation procedure.
If you want to deny social dumping a foothold in our ports, and want instead to enable qualified workers to operate under good social conditions; if you want social harmony to be maintained in our ports, then you have to reject this directive.
I am all in favour of looking at these compromises to see if the glass is half full or half empty, but, in this instance, the glass is not half-full of water; it contains just a few drops for Parliament, and I can tell the Council that it cannot be in Parliamentâs interest to start by taking up a firm position and then being satisfied with little.
This is not just about the matter in hand, but also, in this instance, about our conception of our parliamentary function.
That is why I strongly urge â as does my group â that we reject the whole thing.
Â Â  â Mr President, after two and a half years of debates, amendments, demonstrations and votes until well into the night, there is now a compromise proposal before us.
Not everyone is pleased with it.
The result is a step forward in the European maritime sector.
I should like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for the fact that he has still achieved a certain result.
It will not have escaped anyoneâs attention that this topic has unleashed strong emotions; that is quite clear from the dockworkersâ demonstrations here in Brussels, and even in Rotterdam.
I should like to touch upon those demonstrations.
The demonstrators have made good use of their democratic right to inform us as MEPs fully and effectively.
I welcome the idea of demonstrating to press home a message.
However, it is regrettable if this degenerates into causing destruction, disturbance, threatening people and suppressing other views.
I have first-hand experience of the uncomfortable feeling one is left with if one adopts a stance that deviates from theirs.
This is very unfortunate.
As a result, people are forced into excessive action and mudslinging.
Despite this, something has been achieved â a legal framework that allows for clear and transparent relations between ports, authorities and service providers, with transparency in the use of public funds to finance ports and the agreement to draft a clear guideline on the reconcilability of state support with European law.
Pilotage services have been included after all, together with the option of self-handling, which, to my mind, is too restricted.
Shipping companies have acquired more entrepreneurial room, which they need in order to secure a good return on investments.
More room means growth and employment.
More jobs, that is the best social policy, in general.
In Parliament, we have very little say in the quality of the work.
We should, therefore, not turn this into our ambition.
In the Netherlands, where a great deal of port work is done, progress is being made and industrial peace has been reasonably limited.
In order to remove the concerns surrounding the enhanced self-handling possibilities in shipping companies, quayside service providers and trade unions, I have received written pledges from both the Social Affairs Minister and the Transport Minister, our former fellow MEP, Mrs Peijs, that they want to create new policy to put strict guarantees in place to ensure that Dutch labour law is observed in the ports.
Pledges of that kind should also be possible elsewhere.
In short, we are making progress, and the Liberals will be predominantly voting in favour.
Â Â  â Mr President, seagoing shipping and ports offer more scope for abuse than many other businesses.
They involve the handling of cross-border flows of goods between different states, not only within the European Union but also across the entire world.
Those countries do not only differ in terms of legislation, but, above all, in terms of reward of labour, working conditions, safety and the extent of environmental protection.
Such differences are eagerly seized on by those who see social dumping and environmental pollution as ways of winning a competitive battle.
For many years in seagoing shipping, we have known the phenomenon of flags of convenience, whereby ships of European owners are given a registration in a developing-world country.
As a result, they pay lower taxes, need not comply with many rules and can hire crews at developing-world salaries.
Enterprises in ownership of EU citizens compete with each other through the international jungle.
The fact that to date, that jungle in the European ports has been kept outside of the door as much as possible is no coincidence.
Without extensive battles fought by trade unions and without local port companies, ports of convenience would have taken root a long time ago.
These are ports with an ever-lower level of pay, safety and environmental protection; ports that can offer only temporary jobs, which are dirty and unsafe and, above all, attract unskilled labourers; ports where much of the work can be done by people from the developing world who are not admitted to Europe for other on-shore work.
In a competitive battle of this kind, ports that service a common hinterland will destroy each other.
The winner will always be the most anti-social, the most environmentally-unfriendly, the most unsafe, and consequently, the port of greatest convenience.
If the European Union wishes to harmonise rules for port labour, these must be geared to eliminating unfair and dangerous competition per group of ports that serve a common hinterland.
This problem is particularly acute for the ports surrounding the North Sea, from Dunkirk, in France, via the Belgian and Dutch ports to Hamburg, in Germany.
Railways, rivers and canals connect those ports with largely the same industrial areas and with cities brimming with consumers.
For a long time, those ports have been trying to steal each othersâ customers by means of large government investments, low rates and a great deal of stealth.
In the previous part-session, this Parliament stated that something should, in fact, be done about this by means of a port directive, one that would offer the highest level of protection for registered and qualified port labour across Europe, and which would prevent shipping accidents as a result of faults during loading, as happened with the Danish freight ship in February.
A port directive of that kind would be in keeping with a number of recent environmental measures of the European Union that are aimed at making it more difficult to dump shipping waste and freight residues at sea and, in time, at keeping away single-hulled tankers from European ports.
Instead, the Commission has proposed a directive that leads to the opposite.
By hindering, or reducing, existing protection of registered port labour against unfair competition at Member State level, this competition is only set to increase.
Maybe the port handling costs of goods will be reduced as a result, but these only formed a negligibly small part of the production costs in most cases anyway.
Parliament corrected these plans both at first reading two years ago and at second reading in March.
Admittedly, this correction did not go as far as the trade unions wanted, and scope for abuse remained, but the parties involved with different interests appeared to be able to live with this to some degree.
That is no longer the case since the Council of Transport Ministers refused systematically last summer to adopt those corrections.
During conciliation, the parliamentary delegation initially appeared determined to persist in the view previously adopted by Parliament.
This applied not only to the groups of the Left, but I also heard this from Christian Democrats and Liberals.
On 29 September, most of those objections had suddenly evaporated.
In exchange for a further study into competition and a text which juggles with the words âmayâ and âmustâ, eight of the fifteen Members have surrendered what Parliament had achieved.
The fact that a directive is coming into being was suddenly more important than its exact content.
The ultimate proposal is very reminiscent of Spanish and Italian acts concerning monopoly ports with a small hinterland around the Mediterranean.
The application to other parts of Europe will lead to more industrial disputes and abuse, particularly in the North Sea ports.
On various occasions, port labourers in the present and future Member States have made it clear in great numbers that they find this unacceptable.
Under these conditions, the directive is counterproductive and should therefore not be adopted.
This proposal should be rejected on Thursday.
Â Â  â Mr President, much as I should like to thank the rapporteur, the Commissioner and others for the work that they have done, it has not yielded the desired outcome.
The Green Paper on ports was clear, because it was determined to tackle competition among ports, particularly unfair competition and the implications of this unfair competition on the environment when new terminals are built.
Ultimately, we ended up with a directive on competition in ports and the opening up of markets to new service providers.
Examining what has come out of the conciliation procedure, we have to say that the balance is not favourable.
It does not include the compulsory authorisations that had been requested for new service providers with regard to social, environmental and other requirements, such as safety.
A definition of self-handling is missing, because reference is made to own crews, which leaves plenty of scope in current labour relations at most ports.
Enough has been said about pilotage.
Transparency too, so adulated by Mr Jarzembowski, is in our view, a step forward, but it does not come close to what we had previously asked for.
All in all, the proposal is unacceptable, certainly bearing in mind the ILO treaties with regard to poor working and labour conditions, and safety.
There is a considerable risk of these ports turning into ports of convenience.
Taking all views into consideration, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance reject this compromise as a proposal that fails to strike the right balance.
Liberalisation is not a panacea and, as Mrs de Palacio suggested, rejecting the proposal does not pose any problems whatsoever to others.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise obtained in the conciliation committee in September no more satisfies us than the previous readings did.
In view of the very close vote â eight votes in favour and seven against â we are not alone.
MrÂ Jarzembowski has, however, brought all his considerable powers of persuasion to bear.
Although we were automatically in agreement with the search for increased efficiency in order to face the challenge of becoming competitive in a globalised economy, we did not want this to be done in any old way, with a single and final objective: the total liberalisation of port services.
Technical, social and environmental security must in fact remain the objective to be preserved, whatever the reform implemented.
Now, if pilotage has been, on the surface of it, preserved from unbridled competition, the freedom given to each state seems to us to be too great and to contradict the notion of public service, a characteristic that the services in question are acknowledged as possessing, whether by the states themselves or by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Where self-handling is concerned, social and environmental security could, in the same way, be impaired by shipowners directly employing their own equipment and their own staff, who would be inexperienced, untrained and employed on a casual basis.
It is unlikely that employeesâ social protection and the constraints of optimum security count for very much faced with the search for financial profitability obtained through cheap labour.
Whereas the whole chain of services â pilotage, mooring and unloading â requires professionals skilled in these types of activity so as to avoid any risk of accident, self-handling would involve a levelling down of the services provided, as well as of professional qualifications and environmental security, and would also entail a social cost linked to job losses.
In conclusion, we reject the creation of ports of convenience and self-handling at terminals.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Flanders, thousands of Flemish dock workersâ families are anxiously waiting this week to see how next Thursdayâs vote on the liberalisation of port services will turn out.
In Flanders, thousands of people are anxiously waiting this week to see whether they will have a job in a few monthsâ time.
That, and nothing else, is the bottom line of the report we are debating again today.
The fact is that, for thousands of Flemish dockworkers, liberalisation in this context means nothing more than unemployment and social misery.
By blindly believing its own ideology and ignoring any serious consultation with the parties involved, the Commission proves once again that it could not give a damn about the subsidiarity principle with which the prophets of the âEurope of milk and honeyâ have bombarded us since Maastricht.
Indeed, in the context of this issue, the Commission is tampering with traditions which, for decades, have made the name and fame of the Flemish ports across the world.
With Thursdayâs vote on this report, Europe is at risk of wiping out tens of years of social peace in the Flemish ports in the name of an ultra-Liberal ideology, which is at risk of creating the opposite of what it intends to do.
The liberalisation of particularly energy and rail transport has shown in Flanders, for example, but also in Great Britain, that it can also adversely impact on competition, job quality and the provision of services.
Liberalisation of this kind could have pernicious consequences for our ports, their competitiveness, their employment and their provision of services.
However, it is not too late.
I hope that on Thursday, all MEPs, whatever group or persuasion they belong to across the political spectrum, will consider the precarious situation of the dockworkers in Antwerp, Zeebrugge and Ghent, but also in the other European ports.
I therefore hope that there will be a massive vote against this report.
Â Â  Commissioner, you began the debate on the by explaining to us that the maritime environment was an area of uncontrolled freedom, a kind of jungle that needed to be subjected to rules.
What was the case where security was concerned is, unfortunately, all the more the case in the social sphere.
We all now know that crews are particularly mixed, both in terms of nationalities and also of social and geographic origins.
In these conditions, self-handling amounts to introducing the social jungle of the maritime sphere into our ports.
Naturally, the problem it presents is basically one of monitoring compliance with the social rules of both the recipient country and the port.
Who will argue convincingly that, because they have stepped out into a port at which their ship has just called, two Filipinos, three Malays, two Argentinians and one African engaged in self-handling will respect the same social rules that apply in the country in which that port is located?
Naturally, that is how dock workers â and not simply dock workers but also dock work companies throughout Europe â have realised that the desire was now to engage in competition through social dumping, that is to say by resorting to the social break-up of an entire profession, whether it be public or private.
That is why we cannot agree to set the fox to mind the geese.
What is necessary, rather â and all the populations would understand this â is that a genuine assault be made upon the anarchy that prevails when it comes to flags and crews reduced to slavery and that it be ensured that all of the rules are applied, rules that are totally circumvented by the majority of countries in the International Maritime Organisation which, as everyone knows, are pirate countries, no less than the shipowners who are nationals of them are pirates.
If the ability existed to restore order and also to harmonise the fiscal and social conditions in all our own countries â and this is valid not only in the maritime sphere but also in that of heavy goods vehicles â then, certainly, a directive such as this would acquire credibility, and it would then be possible to talk about fair competition.
Unfortunately, it is, rather, a form of social break-up that you are proposing to us and, in these conditions, we cannot take the risk.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, thank you for the work that you have done, but I will not support the compromise, because I see this compromise as lacking an essential link, namely that authorisations should be used in EU ports.
We had approved this in Parliament at second reading, but it is not included in the compromise.
A competent authority is entitled to apply for an authorisation, but it is not required to do so, and I see that as a key issue.
Both at first and at second reading, I worked hard to improve the article on authorisations, even with the help of the Commissioner in a number of areas.
Both at first and at second reading, we managed to improve this licensing system.
Despite this, Mr Jarzembowski, I have a feeling that we could have gone a little further during conciliation, and that we perhaps should have spent all of our time creating a better text on that score too.
I am, in any case, in favour of free port services.
In my opinion, everyone should be able to offer their services there, but these free services should be counterbalanced by a licensing system which should be regulated in such a way that we can make our own demands in the areas of environment, public services and, last but not least, social legislation.
In the Flemish ports, relations among dock workers, employers and dock installations have deteriorated a great deal over the past eighteen months.
Whatever the result of next Thursdayâs vote may be, this worsening situation will need to be addressed with or without a directive.
I would therefore ask everyone involved to gather around the negotiating table in order to discuss the future of our ports and to ensure that it is not jeopardised, with or without a directive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, this is, indeed, not the first time that this directive has been debated.
I continue to think that it is a liberal directive that has one sole priority: the reduction of costs, to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services.
Indeed, the major problem lies with self-handling.
Even with self-handling restricted to on-board crew and always assuming that, as remains to be seen, this will have no effect upon the social legislation of the Member States, shipsâ crews or specially taken-on workers will, as you pointed out, be able to carry out loading and unloading operations in place of current qualified staff.
Whether one likes it or not, self-handling amounts to allowing social dumping, even if it is now accompanied by references to security and to staff being qualified.
Such a system would be dangerous to people because it would permit practices prejudicial to security: insufficient qualifications, ignorance of the locality and of instructions, a lack of understanding of the language and insufficient training.
Any shipowner would, in this way, be able to call upon cheap labour, which would be dangerous for the ports and their environment.
This problem also affects professions other than dock work, particularly those of the inshore and other pilots excluded in the first version and those connected with towing, which are subject to constraints in relation to the port authorities.
I would add that, because the Council did not hold back the authorisations that had to be requested by the owners before having recourse to self-handling, the result will, as my fellow MEP MrÂ Savary said, be the introduction of the law of the jungle into the whole sector.
Uncertainty is in this way being brought to bear upon all the qualified staff who until now have contributed to port security: the dockers who fulfil a very important economic task in difficult conditions by preserving security; and nautical services such as inshore and other pilotage services, universally recognised as services of general interest.
All these sectors should be considered as essential partners contributing to the objective of maritime security and sustainable development.
The proposal submitted to us cannot but have serious social consequences in the ports, and where employment too is concerned.
There has been no genuine consultation of the interested parties.
We are today being asked to vote in favour of a text that is rejected by all the professionals working in the ports.
This is, it has to be said, a curious conception of democracy.
Yesterday evening, here even in Strasbourg, employee representatives again met the groups to explain to them their points of view and to sound the alert.
I think we must not remain deaf to this alert.
These people have arguments we have to listen to.
In conclusion, I am anxious, finally, to say that I think it is impossible to reflect upon this directive by removing it from the context of our debates on maritime security.
Our Parliament has come out in favour of a temporary committee of inquiry on the .
We have had a lot of discussion in this House of the various measures in favour of maritime security and, Commissioner, you have put forward rational proposals.
Personally, I never forget that, in the various meetings I was able to have on the French coast, all the maritime professionals always insisted, following the damage caused by the , that security began in the ports.
You spoke about coherence.
Having said that, I find there is incredible incoherence in taking, on the one hand, positive measures concerning maritime security and, on the other hand, effectively destroying these with the decision on self-handling.
In the interests of security, employment and the sustainable development of the European ports, we have to reject this document.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our ports are of enormous importance to our prosperity, and they form the linchpin for world trade.
Unfair competition among ports should therefore be avoided, and we can imagine a directive to this effect, but it has not been drafted yet.
However, the fight should not lead to a lack of security, social dumping and environmental pollution in ports.
Self-handling that has been proposed in this forum, even in its watered-down version, constitutes a serious infringement of this.
In this light, the European Parliament would have liked to make self-handling dependent on a real compulsory authorisation and omit the pilotage services from the competitive battle.
It is therefore very unfortunate that neither the CouncilÂ norÂ the Commission acted upon the compromise that was struck in Parliament.
Despite two and a half years of discussion, the camps are diametrically opposed to each other.
We are in favour of a breach in social tradition in our ports.
After the ships of convenience, we are now also being faced with ports of convenienceThis fear is not only present among port workers, but also among those who are concerned about social peace in our ports, which is being jeopardised by your directive, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
This push for liberalisation is currently presenting more risks than benefits in our ports.
We will therefore vote against it, and do so emphatically.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much identified with Parliamentâs position at second reading.
If I compare this with the end result of the conciliation procedure, it is evident that the agreement with the Council focuses on elements other than those regarded as the most important by Parliament.
By accepting commitments concerning studies into competition, we have actually attained competition within ports.
This exchange is anything but fair.
This agreement is an unfair distribution of joys and burdens across employers and employees.
Other transport sectors have demonstrated the need for minimising the risks in the area of social maladministration.
This has not happened here, although there is a need.
I take the view that a general authorisation obligation would serve this purpose much more effectively.
Given our aspiration to adopt sustainable transport policy and systems for businesses, staff and society alike, I am thus unable to support the result that the committee is tabling here today.
Â Â  Mr President, the truth is that, as has been quite rightly pointed out, we have dedicated two and a half years of work on an important and critical issue which, as we can see, inspires great passion.
I am genuinely surprised by today's debate, because it appears that we are pitting the social Europe of the nineteenth century against a form of capitalism and the Mafia activities of the Chicago of the 1920s in our ports.
And in fact what we want is precisely the opposite.
This is the twenty-first century.
We want a modern and effective social Europe.
We want sustainable ports, which are competitive and able to provide an alternative to other types of transport.
What we are being presented with does not give us this of course, but it is a small first step, much less than what many of us expected.
That is the Europe I believe in.
The Europe of the nineteenth century, the Europe which reflects the Chicago of the Twenties, is not my Europe.
Perhaps some people want that.
Perhaps that is what some people want to maintain.
Naturally, we are not going to support it and we are going to vote in favour of conciliation.
I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on having maintained the objective of modernising our ports, the will of the rapporteur and the will of certain parliamentary groups which have defended, despite the absolutely unacceptable pressure they have received from certain workers in European ports, the modernisation and competitiveness of our ports.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, there is a world of difference between the words âmustâ and âmayâ.
The Directive that is now in front of us following conciliation states that ports may introduce a system of authorisations, and then, in particular, for ports doing loading and unloading work themselves.
The Jarzembowski report, which we adopted earlier at second reading, still states that ports introduce a system of authorisations.
A significant part of the compromise text differs from the text adopted at second reading.
The difference between âmayâ and âmustâ has significant implications for ports and dockers in Europe.
A non-compulsory authorisation system promotes unfair competition, which can harm quality of employment in the ports that do have a good authorisation system.
Surely that was not the intention of this liberalisation.
Second-class ports would remain, and the unfair competition resulting from this could harm quality of employment in the well-organised ports.
One point has always taken priority in my party, the Dutch Labour Party, and that is our minimum.
The scenario of ports doing loading and unloading themselves must be well regulated by means of a good authorisation system that applies across the board.
This was conceded in the conciliation procedure.
There is now to be no compulsory authorisation system for self-handling.
In short, genuine harmonisation on a key issue such as ports doing their own loading and unloading is out of the question, as a result of which there can be different regimes in different ports.
It has thus become a bad example of liberalisation.
It is remarkable, however, that the EU is able to lay down detailed rules for all and sundry in many situations, but has proved unable to do so in this case, where job quality is concerned.
We have to explain that once again to those people whose interests are at issue here.
It will surprise no one, therefore, having heard my speech, that my group has no choice but to vote against this directive.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank MrÂ Jarzembowski for his hard work regarding this matter.
The proposed compromise is a cautious step towards opening up the market in port services and increasing transparency in ports.
The compromise is not the best possible one, but is nevertheless an acceptable solution.
Including pilotage services within the scope of the directive is problematic, especially in areas that are sensitive in terms of safety at sea and the environment.
The compromise honed in the conciliation procedure is, however, acceptable in this respect.
It is important to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of ports as transport hubs in the development of the transport system throughout the Union.
Opening up ports to controlled, healthy competition and increasing their transparency will improve their competitiveness and levels of efficiency, which will increase the use of combined and maritime transport.
Maritime transport is vital for overseas regions and it offers a more environmentally friendly alternative in congested areas.
This compromise is a cautious step in the right direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat amazed.
You, Commissioner, have argued that we will, by means of this directive, influence transport policy towards sustainability.
I would very much like to remind you what sustainability means.
It was specified at GÃ¶teborg that sustainability is an equilateral triangle of the economic, the ecological and the social.
Let me just ask you a simple question: in what way were you promoting sustainability when, by means of this directive, you are jeopardising safety in ports?
It can make for worse damage to the environment and does nothing to improve the protection of it.
In what way are you strengthening the social element when you allow self-handling, which means that the shipâs crew, who have been travelling on it for so long, now, in addition, have to load and unload it?
Qualifications and the reduction of working time do not come into it.
Mr Hatzidakisâ argument that new jobs will be created is crazy.
I beg you, if the same jobs are done by people who already have other things to do, that reduces jobs rather than encouraging the creation of additional ones.
It also goes against the Lisbon agenda if we want to achieve full employment by 2012, but keep going in the opposite direction.
I have to tell you in all honesty, Commissioner, that I really would have expected you to look at these aspects from the right angle.
What you said was completely one-sided, and, as you said, it indicates that you want to let liberalisation advance.
If that is what you see as your objective, then it is in order for you to just say so.
Then it will be perfectly clear that we can never find a common denominator, because, for you, liberalisation means nothing more than cutting costs in the economic sphere.
You may well claim that it is about that, but I do not, and nor does my group.
Turning to the port workers and the pilots, you have, in the course of the debate we have had â and MrÂ Jarzembowski knows this too â met some of our expectations, but not others.
At the end, after the conciliation process, absolutely none of the people affected are on your side â none whatever!
Yesterday, we were again visited by the port workers, whose 21Â 000 signatures make up an extraordinary amount for this occupation, and you do not even take note of it!
That means, I believe, that this directive, rather than promoting safety and social standards and thereby putting competition on a single footing, is achieving the precise opposite.
For that reason, we can do no other than reject it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we do want more transport by sea, but not if it is unsafe.
As many speakers have already said, this Directive is indeed bad news for dockers, because there are no minimum social standards that are enforceable throughout the EU.
In fact, this is a bad example to the world.
We as Europeans are always trying to outdo others with our social standards.
If this is adopted, however, we shall be promoting negative globalisation and social disintegration.
Anyone who thinks that the present text still presents a chance of putting a brake on the downward spiral is mistaken.
That will soon become clear, because competition between ports is ruthless.
Without strict conditions, self-handling will be the kiss of death for ordinary dockers.
This text is bad news for pilots, too.
On the contrary, we want more compulsory pilotage.
Risks are ever-increasing on account of the shipping routes becoming busier, and also of maritime personnel being less well trained.
The off the Flemish coast was a chilling example of this.
There have also been more thanÂ 60 near collisions.
There must be more competent pilots on board, therefore.
To make savings on this is to make savings on safety, and to play with lives and the environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if the European Parliament is to be taken seriously, it must stick to its previous decisions and vote against the outcome of the conciliation.
None of the important changes adopted by Parliament at second reading of the Commissionâs proposal can in any way be found in the conciliation document.
For example, the right to demand on a national basis that collective agreements be adhered to has been completely disregarded.
Furthermore, liberalisation now also extends to include the pilots.
If Parliament votes in favour of the proposal, the shipowners will interpret it themselves and be free to decide at whim whether to use seamen or port workers, just as entrepreneurs and shipowners will be able to sit loose to hard-won rights and collective wage agreements.
Both will be free to choose whom they want to work for them, and they will be able to use unorganised and underpaid labour for loading and unloading ships, rather than use well-trained port workers who, through agreements, have secured their entitlement to the work and to proper conditions.
The consequence will be unemployed port workers, together with ports of convenience consonant with our now seeing ships sailing under flags of convenience.
Liberalisation is also partly responsible for undermining port security at a time when major investments are otherwise being made in securing the ports against terrorism.
In Denmark, it is not only the case of the 1Â 500 or so port workers that is on the agenda.
It is the Danish model for agreements that is in danger.
That is the principle involved in how far the EU should go in harmonising, and intervening in, wage and working conditions.
It is quite conceivable that other groups of workers will be up for consideration.
It is therefore important for a line to be drawn in the sand.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has been made to waves, and these are still lashing my part of northern Germany, rising indeed to a great height, and it is difficult to speak in just about 120 seconds about an issue that will affect the structure of our European ports and coasts as a whole.
I am fundamentally convinced of the advantages of creating a clear, open and transparent common legal framework.
I am convinced that competition between ports demands the continuation of a purpose-built framework and of certain rules, not least for the sake of the workers and of our environment.
This, then, is the great objective towards which we are progressing together.
Members of this House, led by the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, have got seriously stuck in to the readings and have framed a large number of amendments to make the objective a clearer and fairer one.
A conciliation procedure is not a walkover, and I know from experience that you never come from one with a full bag of goodies.
Nonetheless, we have to rigorously examine what has come out of conciliation, and each of us must carefully consider whether we can be satisfied with it and whether we can defend it to the people back home.
As I see it, the Council has moved far too little.
It is the Council that must take responsibility, and I have to say that I am particularly thinking of the German Government when I say that.
On Thursday, then, will be the hour of decision.
Every one of us will have to face questions: What is now the real situation as regards balance?
What about compensation payments and adjustments?
Let me remind you of Article 12.
I have to concede that, time and time again, I find myself admiring Mr Jarzembowskiâs negotiating skills, but, even so, in this instance, I cannot forget the interests of many small ports, coming as I do from Cuxhaven, which is one of them.
Some global players may be satisfied, but I am not.
I do not want to leave it to the nation states to sort out the compensation payments in a way that is as yet unclear, particularly as nothing has been laid down.
That may be just a point of criticism, but it is a decisive one.
I admit that I am still struggling with the directive, and with myself, but will the people at home understand that?
Â Â  Mr President, we are debating a proposal for a directive the content of which is ambitious.
I wonder whether we all agree on the importance of ports in terms of organising European transport.
I believe not, that everybody has a different approach.
Mine is that ports are fundamental to the organisation of European transport, and I am not referring to maritime transport, but to transport as a whole and, essentially, road transport.
One of the questions arising from this organisation of maritime transport is â this question has been asked here â whether or not it is sustainable to try to regulate and liberalise ports.
When we talk about whether it is possible to operate a sustainable transport system it is clear that, if we do not accept that one of the conditions for the sustainability of transport is a huge increase in the capacity of ports, we are moving in the opposite direction.
I would therefore argue that it is absolutely essential that ports take on an infinitely greater role than the one they play at the moment, and that the environmental contribution of that transformation would be so immense that it would allow us to a large extent to resolve the great over-burden, the enormous insecurity, which is much greater than anything that can be resolved in the field of ports, and the great pollution which is currently generated by other forms of transport.
But we are divided on a directive which in theory pursues a reasonable objective, decided on by Parliament, which is to liberalise the various transport sectors.
I have defended Mr Jarzembowski on numerous occasions, saying that he is a constant, determined, efficient and intelligent Member of Parliament, but, on this occasion, I must say that his approach as rapporteur has been erratic and, as a result of this constant change in position, we have come to a situation of genuine confrontation in relation to a directive on which Parliament should be united.
I would therefore ask that, if this directive is approved tomorrow, we continue to improve it, and that, if it is not approved, we begin to work on the next one on the basis of all the information and with greater realism than we have demonstrated so far.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to explain why, tomorrow, I shall vote against the compromise proposal from the conciliation committee.
The amendments adopted by Parliament during its reading of the report were a serviceable compromise between those who want a total liberalisation of port services and those who think we should take account of our workers.
Unfortunately, little remains of Parliamentâs amendments, which means that European port workers will face an uncertain future if the compromise is adopted.
If we accept the compromise, port workers will lose their jobs, simply because seafarers on ships calling at EU ports have been allowed to handle cargoes.
In that way, the EU will lose a large number of jobs.
We do not want ports of convenience, just as we do not want ships sailing under flags of convenience.
In Scandinavia, we have seen examples of port workers refusing to handle goods from ships on which the working and wage conditions were not in order.
Now, an attempt is being made to get rid of this solidarity by means of a bad piece of EU legislation.
Those campaigning for liberalisation say that not so many people are in any case employed on modern ships and that the Port Directive will not therefore mean fewer port workers.
It is, however, precisely because there are not especially many people employed on modern ships that we should leave it to the competent port workers to ensure that cargoes are handled properly.
Parliamentâs demand for certification has, moreover, been squeezed out of the wording of the directive in the course of the conciliation committeeâs work.
We are now therefore opening the door to poorly trained labour that may jeopardise port security.
When we talk about security in EU ports, there are two considerations to be borne in mind, namely the security of people who work in the ports and the security of the goods handled.
I myself come from a seaport in Denmark, and I am very familiar indeed with the problems. We have solved them by cooperating with the larger neighbouring ports.
We divide up the amount of goods and, in that way, ensure optimum use of the different ports, at the same time as preserving free competition.
I would call upon everyone to vote against the compromise, for where would the unemployed port workers go?
What training opportunities do they have?
To my fellow MEP, MrsÂ Langenhagen, who was in some doubt as to how she should vote, I have to say that she should vote according to her conviction and not follow group discipline.
It is too bad that group discipline is allowed to decide these matters.
There is, therefore, only one way, namely to vote in accordance with oneâs convictions.
If, moreover, the port workers are to be given help, we can give it them by voting against this bad document from the conciliation committee.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I cannot agree with the aspects approved in the conciliation meeting between Parliament and the Council with regard to the Directive on the liberalisation of the port services market.
I find it unthinkable that anybody should be prepared to risk security in airports by establishing private free competition and more than one service provider for air traffic control.
Similarly, I believe that for reasons of port traffic safety, pilotage, towing or mooring, or even loading, must be provided by a single body, providing each service, which guarantees adequate coordination of all its staff.
In this regard, it is notable that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already approved a law in the Spanish Parliament which allows for self-handling for this type of service on the part of any shipping or brokering company and takes it for granted that this crazy liberalisation will be approved by this European Parliament.
I hope this is not the case and that the Spanish legislative is more prudent in the future and does not move forward âlike those from Pozasâ, as we say in Bilbao.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Directive on port services, in its current form, is difficult to assess.
The European Commissionâs aim was the liberalisation of port services, but little of that remains.
A drawback of the proposal was the risk of social dumping arising.
Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, has been working actively towards eradicating the problems with the proposal.
Such legislation as remains is evidently the maximum achievable, even though there is room for improvement.
I asked myself, therefore, whether I should support this result or not.
If I compare the result of the Directive with the status quo regarding the legislation on European ports, I conclude that it is better to adopt this proposal than reject it.
In a nutshell: it does have its advantages, and the risk of social dumping is slight.
In addition, the Member States are able to take effective measures to prevent problems, where that is still necessary, by means of legislation.
In the Netherlands, a ports act is to be tabled, which will improve the situation for Dutch dockers.
The main advantage for European ports is the existence of a legal framework that enables clarity and transparency in relations between port authorities and service providers.
I also welcome the recognition of pilotage services as specialised services.
I attach great importance to transparency in the financing of ports, which plays a necessary part in the creation of a level playing field with regard to state aid.
I see this Directive as the beginnings of European legislation in this field, and envisage that, given productive dialogue between all the interested parties â port authorities, service providers and workersâ organisations â we can continue to work on improving the legislation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give my express support here to those fellow Members who said earlier in this debate that one of the important reasons that this Directive â this compromise â is unacceptable to us is the whole arrangement regarding self-handling.
The fact that the compromise gives the Member States freedom of choice as to whether or not to introduce authorisations for self-handling â this form of subsidiarity â makes the whole authorisation system a hollow shell â this much is now clear to everyone.
After all, if a Member State is not obliged to introduce an authorisation system, pernicious competition will inevitably follow, which will have a negative impact on working conditions, on the social protection of dockers, on safety in ports.
Shipowners will very quickly seek out those ports that do not have an authorisation system.
By that I do not mean ports in Italy, because they have an authorisation system, nor those in Spain, because they, too, have an authorisation system, but ports that have a rather casual approach to job protection and safety.
I think that, if we want to open up port services to competition on the internal market, we must firstly and most importantly lay down rules for social and ecological etiquette that apply to all countries without exception.
Secondly, there is the fact that this Directive gives the Member States free rein to cast pilotage services, too, onto the market.
That is going much too far, in my opinion.
Pilotage services have an essential safety function.
This compromise will be responsible for pernicious competition via social dumping, and unsafe working environments in our ports.
In addition, it is a slap in the face for all those dockers who have demonstrated against this Directive several times and who, furthermore, just this morning handed our own President of the European Parliament more than 20Â 000 signatures to make it clear that they disapprove strongly of this Directive.
I therefore call on all those fellow Members who are still in two minds â from the Netherlands or Italy, perhaps â to reject this Directive, this unsatisfactory compromise, and to set to work on a satisfactory arrangement, one benefiting not only the ports, but especially the dockers.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, although the outcome of this conciliation procedure differs from the Commissionâs initial proposal, it is still quite negative.
We cannot, therefore, support the text that has been proposed since, in addition to its emphasis on liberalisation, its position on the issues of self-handling and pilotage is far removed from that advocated by Parliament.
In fact, on the basis of this position, by means of what is known as âself-handlingâ, the shipping company could provide one or more port services for itself, provided that it uses its own seamen and equipment.
Furthermore, the proposal does not stipulate that authorisations shall be compulsory, and the Member States would find it hard to restrict these activities, except in special cases.
This situation will cause serious problems for the job stability of port service workers, will hamper the coordination of interactive on-board and on-shore operations and will help to create conflict and a breakdown in solidarity between the established workforce in ports and ships' crews.
Safety problems might also arise for facilities and workers, since the seamen might not be familiar with the specific characteristics of the port.
Parliament had suggested that pilotage services should be excluded from the scope of the directive, but the conciliation text states that the competent authorities may, for reasons of public safety, recognise the mandatory nature of pilotage and maintain the service themselves or award the service directly to a single provider.
This means that pilotage might also be undertaken on a self-handling basis, with the potential consequences for maritime and environmental safety that this entails, and this is something we cannot accept.
With the various options given to the Member States for imposing more restrictive rules if they wish, there is a possibility that, in future, we will have ports of convenience, in which everything, or almost everything, is permitted, with the inevitable consequences for competition between ports and for maritime safety itself.
Hence our vote against this proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be rejecting this Directive, as it is high time we created a social Europe as well as an economic and financial Europe.
We must call a halt to all the practices that result in the subordination of social rights, health, safety and wellbeing of workers to the laws of an ill-considered liberalisation.
For that reason, the Verts/ALE Group says a wholehearted ânoâ to this Directive on ports.
Dockers in Antwerp, Rotterdam, and also Hamburg or Genoa must be given the guarantee that ships will be unloaded in a professional, safe manner throughout the EU under pay conditions that are not pushed down by social dumping.
Since there is to be no compulsory system of authorisations, the balance is abundantly clear.
Parliamentâs requests at second reading were not met.
Hence, the European Parliament must now also reject the Directive in its entirety.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the points of view in this dossier are well known.
This week, the European ship has to decide which port to enter.
To liberalise or not to liberalise, that is not the question as far as I am concerned.
What is important is how we liberalise and whether we do it humanely.
The Conciliation Committee came to an agreement on this, and I admit that some of the sharp edges on which people can get hurt in a liberalisation process have been filed off, including by limiting self-handling to seafaring personnel.
It is just unfortunate that it was not just that little bit more, then I, too, could have reconciled myself with the text.
As has already been said repeatedly by fellow Members, there was indeed a majority in Parliament in favour of imposing compulsory authorisations for service providers and self-handling.
The word was âmustâ.
Unfortunately, Parliamentâs lead was not taken, and the agreement did not move on from âmayâ.
If the Member States diverge in the way they use the possibilities they are given, there is of course a risk of distortion of competition.
The fear of distortion of competition in itself can also lead to lax regulation.
We do not like that idea, and therefore I do not agree with this draft text.
We know that StÂ Nicholas is not due until December, but I sincerely hope that we can prevent the dockers from being left holding the baby, or in this case Black Peter, as early as this week.
I have sympathy for those who earn their living in the ports.
I shall therefore be voting against the draft.
Whatever the result of the vote, I should like to address the Belgian dockers with the following request: do not in any event rest on your laurels, as not even the rejection of the text will mean that your problems are at an end.
You know that a discussion has been underway for some time on the question as to whether the Belgian ports act â known as the âMajor lawâ â is in accordance with the treaty rules on the free movement of services.
I strongly advise you good people to take control in this sphere in good time, before others have to set to work on it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the debate they have both facilitated.
I think that this European Parliament should be proud that every point of view has been heard and every point of view considered.
The original text was, quite rightly, heavily opposed and indeed heavily amended.
It looked at ports through the wrong end of the telescope. Rather than competition between the ports it focused on competition within the ports â a little like single market legislation to increase competition within a supermarket rather than between supermarkets.
It failed to tackle unfair state aids or the lack of transparency of accounts.
In particular it threatened the successful United Kingdom model of ports, some of which, in my region, are amongst the busiest and indeed I would say the most successful anywhere in the world.
To be fair, some of these deficiencies have been addressed, but conciliation failed to successfully address many key concerns.
It failed to exclude self-handling or to ensure compulsory authorisations â the 'must or may' issue â and it failed, in particular, to exclude marine pilots from the scope of the directive.
However, this is not about what is in it but rather what is not in it.
There was no real action, in my view, to tackle transparency or unfair state aids.
This Parliament should also be concerned that there is no consensus either within Parliament or with society outside.
I am aware of the wide range of views, both for and against.
However, I am concerned in particular that we do not have the support of port workers themselves.
British Labour MEPs are also very concerned that important British groups are objecting to this proposal, and we should all be concerned when British marine pilots and, in particular, British ships' officers are recommending that this proposal be voted down on safety grounds alone.
I said at the beginning of the process in 2001 that this proposal should be rejected and sent back to the Commission.
Given that our key concerns remain, British Labour MEPs are going to be consistent.
We owe it to British jobs, the future of investment in our ports and above all safety to reject this proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, by rejecting the text that has been proposed to us on port services, I am expressing my personal opinion but I am also acting as a mouthpiece for the objections that have been expressed by a large number of trade union organisations.
This project, known as self-handling, will allow ship owners to carry out any port service using their own personnel and equipment.
It also opens the way for all sorts of abuse by the crooks involved in maritime transport.
Indeed, the directive does not of course force ship owners to pay their personnel the current salaries of dockers, nor even to respect labour legislation.
Ship owners can make workers, who are taken on without guarantees, work for low pay and subject them to whatever working conditions they want.
This will result in secure employment in port areas being axed and an increase in the number of workers with insecure jobs, who are badly paid, over exploited, inexperienced, with all the threats that this entails for the environment and safety.
We reject this directive.
Its enforcement would threaten all those that earn a living from port services; it would increase the risk of accidents and pollution.
We also reject it because it puts workers from different professions âÂ seamen and dockers â into competition with each other âÂ in order to make conditions harsher for both groups, for the sole benefit of ship owners.
Opening up port services to competition stems from the same retrograde mindset as opening up rail transport, air traffic control, postal services or telecommunications to competition.
We are opposed to it.
Port services, like all services used directly or indirectly by the entire population, should be public services and protected from damage such as competition and the race for profit.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have just one minute, and I intend to use that minute to say that I do not under any circumstances wish to contribute to Europeâs obtaining so-called ports of convenience.
I must therefore vote against the Conciliation Committeeâs joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services.
I am not opposed to either economic liberalisation or liberalisation of the regulations, but I do not consider the intention of the directive to be present in the proposal now being tabled.
The intention has already been erased.
I do believe, however, that what remains may lead to social dumping.
In the Nordic countries, we have worked for a long time to bring about good rules and working conditions in shipping and to resist social dumping.
It should not be profitable to register ships in countries other than their own or to employ people under bad conditions.
Competence in the ports and the safety of those who work in them must be guaranteed.
By rejecting this proposal, the European Parliament is defending workers and the social and labour law regulations governing port workers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ deÂ Palacio, a great deal has been said and, frankly, I would like to ask all the Members a question.
We are talking as if, by adopting the compromise text before uswe are running the risk of plunging from paradise to purgatory, if not even to hell, where port services are concerned.
Frankly, without the directive that we are about to vote on, there would be nothing stopping the individual Member StatesÂ âÂ as has been the case thus farÂ âÂ from adopting national legislative measures to open up the market in port services without any legal framework.
I am one of those that have fought hard and I remain convinced that authorisation should have been made compulsory.
We did not succeed in obtaining this, but we do have a directive that refers to subsidiarity, to what the Member States could have done, however, and that lays down reference criteria for authorisation which fully protect social, security and environment rules.
Of course, this is true if an individual State wants to make authorisation compulsory.
Without the directive, however, the Wild West would have been a lot wilder
We all know what the initial proposal was and how it was worked on.
We all know the limits that were set for self-handling,the provisions that we abolished, those which provided for a type of Wild West without any regulations for new ports, for new sections of ports or for port sections not open to commercial services.
These are the reasons why, for example, all the workersâ unions in my country, ItalyÂ âÂ CGL, CISL, UILÂ âÂ are asking us to adopt the compromise text.
We are not going from paradise to purgatory.
As regards what individual States could have done, I have the feeling that we have not yet reached paradise, but that we have probably climbed up from hell to purgatory.
Â Â  Mr President, purgatory is just as painful as hell, but you do not stay there permanently â I am told.
The key issue here is the self-handling at EU ports.
As somebody who comes from an island Member State which exports 90% of its production, I am deeply concerned at the lack of mandatory authorisation included in this directive.
It must be painful for the Commissioner and Mr Jarzembowski to see such wide-ranging opposition to this proposal as there is here today.
However, they should withdraw this proposal, return to the drawing-board and ensure there is mandatory self-handling which would provide for prior authorisation and would include criteria relating to employment, the social aspects, professional qualifications and environmental considerations.
There is no way around this.
Therefore I appeal to you to show common sense and return to the drawing-board.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian system of port services is functioning to everyoneâs satisfaction. Neither the port authorities, nor the employers, nor the dockers are looking to change this system.
It was achieved via social dialogue and, if necessary, is adapted via social dialogue to the situation of the various other Belgian ports.
This social dialogue offers employers a guarantee that their requirements, too â as regards employment, social services, safety and quality â will be included in a social agreement.
One result of this system is that the port of Antwerp is number one in conventional loading, and that is the most labour-intensive loading activity.
Antwerp has earned that ranking despite the fact that its dock work is perhaps a little more expensive than in other ports, but, on the other hand, this dock work is very productive, very safe and of excellent quality.
The shipowners are not demanding a different system.
How is the EUâs involvement perceived by the Belgian port authorities, the dockers and the Belgian politicians?
In the first place, they do not see in it any improvement for them.
The reverse is true.
They are seeking in the Directive possibilities of preserving the present system as far as possible via Belgian legislation.
Secondly, they find that all of this is being arranged a long way from their home territory.
They are accustomed to proceeding via social dialogue. Thirdly, they believe that the Directive was based on the ports where the regime is least strict, where poorly organised, poor-quality dock work is carried out.
Commissioner, the correct procedure would have been to subject European port activities to compulsory authorisations regulating the most important elements in the field of the social framework, safety, training, organisation of work and environment.
A compulsory system such as this would have not only made self-handling possible, but also offered guarantees of a stricter operating procedure in all the European ports.
The ports that already have effective regulations and a safe system are actually being penalised in favour of the much laxer attitude of other ports.
We should have gone in the opposite direction.
For all of these reasons, I shall be voting against the Directive: out of conviction.
I am a confirmed European, but, in this dossier, European intervention is moving in the wrong direction.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a parallel has repeatedly been drawn between the problem of ports and port services and the problem of airports and airport services, and the issue of security has been raised as a crucial reason for rejecting the current text, essentially security relating to the issue of pilotage and also with regard to the issue of self-handling in general.
I would like to say that I believe it is a mistake to compare air traffic with self-handling.
I do believe it makes sense to compare openness and competition in port services with that in airport services.
At the time, this also provoked all sorts of arguments and it was said that it was going to jeopardise security in airports.
This has not turned out to be the case.
On the contrary, what we have seen has been greater activity and more opportunities for everybody in airports.
Liberalisation has been proposed and today aircraft maintenance services in airports are liberalised.
At the time it was said that this would pose enormous risks in terms of aircraft safety.
There are currently companies which resolve certain issues themselves.
Other companies, on the other hand, employ third-party service providers.
There are various possibilities, and this reduces costs for aviation â and the honourable Members are the first to benefit, as are all we citizens of the European Union â and none of this has meant an undermining of security in aviation.
What we have had is more activity, more employment and more opportunities.
And that is what we are proposing.
Air traffic is equivalent to maritime traffic.
On the entry to the majority of large ports, there is maritime traffic, which is controlled by means of totally modern systems.
We are not talking about liberalising and implementing the various controls of maritime traffic in ports, nobody is proposing that.
Let us not mix up things which cannot be mixed up.
Let us make comparisons which make sense.
The liberalisation of the aircraft maintenance service has not in any way undermined the security of aircraft.
Is any port authority, or any government of our countries going to take a decision which suddenly means that a ship hits a jetty or fills airports with inappropriate waste or that there is an accident?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are operating within certain frameworks which guarantee the viability of a liberalisation of this nature, which allows greater competition and port activity, greater opportunity and capacity for ports, greater development of cabotage and therefore greater development of maritime traffic, in order to decongest other types of transport which are currently completely congested.
What is so worrying in Belgium?
It has the legislation left by the previous Belgian Minister in relation to ports.
They are not going to have to change it.
They may have to make some modifications.
And they will have to justify why pilotage, self-handling, is carried out.
The reasons for which self-handling can be restricted are âsafety considerations or requirements resulting from environmental rulesâ (Article 10), amongst others.
Furthermore, Article 16 states that âthe provisions of the present Directive shall not in any way affect the national rules in the field of professional qualifications and training requirements, employment and social issues provided that they are compatible with Community legislationâ.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether we have read the same text.
If we look at the issue of pilotage, it also says that â we know that pilotage has a very important component and that it therefore requires certain types of supplementary guarantee: âthe competent authorities may recognise the obligatory nature ...â.
It is true: they will be able to.
If there is really a security risk, do you believe that any national authority is not going to recognise the obligatory nature of pilotage?
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are talking about risks which do not exist.
Another issue is the pressure from the dockersâ unions.
This is another matter which is politically very important and is very respectable, I do not doubt, but let us remember that we are talking about pressure from a specific group, it is one of the examples always used in certain economics and sociology books, because they have been very well organised for a very long time.
What we have is a problem of pressure or of relationships with these unions.
That is another matter, ladies and gentlemen.
Do not mix it up with security problems, however.
Let us not talk about something which is not the case.
I could accept you saying to me: âthere is a political problem, we need the support of the unions, they are against it and we cannot vote for itâ.
I would have no objection.
I would say that that is politically entirely understandable, but do not tell me that it is a security problem.
It is not.
At least I believe there is no such problem, ladies and gentlemen.
It is not a security problem, but a political problem.
Let us call things by their name and therefore take on, each and every one of us, our responsibilities.
Because I believe that if we deal with this political problem involving the dockers â which I believe not to be justified because there will be more work for them and more opportunities in our ports if we approve this directive â we will be able to achieve greater efficiency in our ports and this is crucial in order to promote cabotage.
How are we really going to develop more cabotage in the European Union if we do not improve the performance and efficiency of our current port services?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a deadlock here which is preventing us from going any further and we need this cabotage.
In the next 10 years we need European cabotage to increase its capacities by at least 40% because anything which does not go by sea will go by road.
We also need the railways to increase by 40%, but cabotage must take up at least 40%, even a little more, in order to take the burden off the roads.
Ladies and gentlemen, the dockers are very respectable, I agree.
However â and I would ask you once again to reconsider the issue â it is not a problem of security we are discussing here, but a problem of union forces.
We are currently dealing with the problem of a form of transport which is genuinely sustainable over time, an efficient form of transport which we need in the European Union for our competitiveness and also for our citizens and for the development of all our countries and for the improvement of the environment.
Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Whatever the result is, we will continue working once again and I will continue to count on your support, as I do generally in relation to all the initiatives I present.
â The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is Question Time (B5-0414/2003).
We will take questions to the Commission.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, on 12Â December 2002, the International Maritime Organisationâs (IMOâs) diplomatic conference adopted a new Chapter XI-2, on special measures to promote maritime safety, as part of the IMOâs SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) Convention, together with a new code named the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), which seems to be of fundamental importance to the establishment of a global maritime safety system.
On 2Â May 2003, the Commission presented the European Parliament and the Council with a Draft Regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security.
The purpose of this draft is to introduce these new instruments into Community law, together with the necessary interpretative provisions.
On 9Â October 2003, the Council (Transport) unanimously adopted a general approach to this draft.
The European Parliament will abstain from voting on it at first reading on 19Â November 2003.
In view of the evident progress made with the work by these two institutions, the Commission hopes that this document will be adopted as quickly as possible so that the Member States are given the opportunity, by no later than 1Â July 2004, to fulfil the international obligations into which they have entered within the IMO.
1Â July 2004 is also the deadline for vessels flying flags other than those of the EU Member States.
The IMO has no intention of granting more time in which to implement these measures.
In common with the United Statesâ authorities, the Commission agrees with this analysis.
In accordance with the relevant regulations of the ISPS Code, it will therefore be possible for any vessel that, after 1Â July 2004, does not comply with the safety arrangements laid down in these international instruments to be refused access to any port in a state that is a member of the IMO.
Â Â  Mr Nielson, there was a long debate about this earlier this morning and you must accept that there is very little time between now and 1 July 2004 for all ships and ports to comply with the requirements of the ISPS Code, especially with the lack of total clarity at the moment.
The financial risk to businesses that cannot comply with the code is enormous.
What about flags other than European flags?
Even if our own Member States comply, could there not be a substantial risk that many other ships will not be complying by then and will not therefore be allowed into European ports?
Has the Commission tried to make any assessment of the impact on European and even world trade if there is not full compliance by 1 July 2004?
Â Â  . â Having had the opportunity to listen to the previous debate, I feel confident that the necessary changes will be manageable within this time.
Ultimately we will face the problem that it is one thing to have the right to deny access to our ports for ships that do not comply, but that, at the same time, the global spread of this whole idea will be a very strong disincentive for ships under other flags to continue to flout the standards.
Thus it is a highly meaningful and necessary thing to do.
Â Â  . â As announced in the Internal Market Strategy: Priorities 2003-2006, the Commission is presently analysing whether there is scope for improving the efficiency and performance of the water sector.
This analysis focuses in particular on how the current competition and internal market rules should be applied to this sector.
The Commission does not wish to rule any options out at this stage, including the possibility of further legislative measures.
As part of its fact-finding, the Commission has sent detailed questionnaires to current and future Member States with a view to gathering information on the legal and administrative rules and requirements within which the water sector operates.
The Commission has also held informal discussions with regional and local authorities, business and citizens' organisations, and enterprises involved in the sector.
The analysis is still ongoing, so it is too early to draw conclusions.
Once the analysis is complete, the Commission will, of course, present its findings and set out its views on any possible additional steps to be taken, in full respect of Treaty guarantees for services of general economic interest and of environmental provisions.
Â Â  â It may perhaps have escaped your notice, Commissioner, that in Austria this issue has for some years now been a cause of immense commotion, which has resurfaced in the last few weeks.
All the provinces, all the parties and also the major daily newspapers are in agreement; rebellion is everywhere in the air.
Water, as you know, is life.
Austria is still a very agricultural country, and if you so much as hint to a farmer that his water is going to be taken away from him, then war is on the cards.
I cannot imagine Austria ever agreeing to the liberalisation of the water supply, and I hear similar things from other countries, such as Germany and the Nordic countries.
Will the Commission, in the face of this vehement resistance, seriously rethink the liberalisation of this area?
Â Â  . â The line is that the options are open.
We are analysing this at the moment and I think it is futile at this stage to speculate on conclusions.
Â Â  . â The Commission has long shared the view that there was an urgent need to explore ways of offering rapid access to protection without refugees being at the mercy of illegal immigration or trafficking gangs.
That is why we commissioned the study on the feasibility of processing asylum claims outside the European Union against the background of the common European asylum system, published in December 2002.
The study analysed the possibilities of the Europe-wide use of protected entry procedures in regions of origin and examined how such procedures could allow a non-national to approach a potential host state outside its territory with an asylum claim and be granted a permit to enter that country.
The Commission has since noted, in its communications of March and June 2003, that protection capacities in the region of origin need to be consolidated and protection requests dealt with as closely as possible to needs.
This might involve regulating access to the European Union by establishing protective entry schemes and resettlement programmes.
Such measures could also facilitate more orderly arrival in the European Union.
The Thessaloniki European Council asked the Commission to explore all parameters, in order to ensure the more orderly and managed entry of persons in need of international protection into the European Union and to examine ways and means of enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin.
Before June 2004 we shall be presenting a comprehensive report suggesting the measures to be taken.
Meanwhile, the current presidency hosted an experts' seminar in Rome on 13 and 14 October which further explored the European Council's mandate, focusing in particular on resettlement and protected entry procedures.
The advantages and disadvantages of the methods of dealing with protection discussed there will be further examined in the report called for by the Thessaloniki Council, which I just mentioned.
The Italian presidency intends that the November Justice and Home Affairs Council should adopt Council guidelines based on the conclusions of the Rome seminar, in order to provide the Commission with the necessary political guidance to prepare the report we shall be producing next June.
Parliament will be asked for its opinion after the report has been published.
Â Â  â Thank you very much for your answer.
The problem with the current regulations governing asylum applications lies not with the regulations themselves and with our letting in too many refugees because, in Europe, we have both the resources and a moral responsibility to receive people in need of protection.
Instead, the problem is the people smuggling through which unscrupulous traders entice people to try to make their way in by unlawful routes.
Our own regulations, which make it difficult to apply for, and obtain, visas, also mean that there are more and more traffickers in human beings.
That is not how we should arrange matters.
The Council has also produced inhumane proposals for border forces and for free zones in third countries where we should keep refugees seeking asylum. That is not something of which I approve.
I believe we should have an arrangement that strengthens the asylum procedure.
One method is contained in the proposal that has been submitted by the researcher Gregor Noll and about which I have put my question.
It is a proposal I believe is well worth examining.
I should like to ask the Commissioner what advantages and disadvantages he sees in the researcherâs, Gregor Nollâs, proposal that asylum should be sought in the EU countriesâ embassies around the world.
It would be interesting to hear the answer to that question.
Â Â  . â I share your view that it is quite clearly necessary to develop an asylum system that prevents those in need of international protection from being victimised by criminal gangs.
One of the ways to address this objective is to enhance protection in the region, and to allow people to ask for asylum in the embassy of one of the Member States.
As the honourable Member knows, some Member States are already doing this.
Resettlement schemes are already ongoing in at least five Member States.
We are now studying experience gained in this area to identify the advantages and disadvantages involved in order to make a proposal to allow all Member States to use the same scheme.
I hope that in the June 2004 report I will be able to put forward concrete proposals in this respect.
Â Â  â On 16Â January 2003, the Commission announced its authorisation of the â distribution system called âSupplier of Choiceâ.
This authorisation was given after made amendments to the original âSupplier of Choiceâ draft presented to the Commission.
A summary of the amended âSupplier of Choiceâ had been published in November 2002 in the Official Journal and interested third parties were called upon to present their comments.
As MrÂ Corbett stressed, when the Commission authorised the âSupplier of Choiceâ, it committed to monitoring the market and reserved the right to reopen the case should changes in the factual or legal situation as regards any essential aspect of the agreements lead it to modify its present view.
The Commission intends to fully make good its commitment.
It will therefore continue to supervise use of the âSupplier of Choiceâ in order to ensure that Community competition rules are respected.
To this end, the Commission will pay heed to any business that claims that these provisions have been violated and that their business has suffered as a result.
Despite the fact that it has already received some information regarding the specific use of âSupplier of Choiceâ, the Commission does not yet have all the details in this regard.
This is why the Commission intends to use the powers given to it by the regulation on the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty in order to collect information that will allow it to adopt a position on the issue, in full knowledge of the facts. In the weeks to come, therefore, requests for information will be sent.
When the Commission has examined the information that it has received in this way, it will decide what action to take regarding the case in question.
Â Â  While I thank the Commissioner for his reply, perhaps he would tell us how many formal complaints he has received in recent weeks from within the diamond sector about the supplier of Trisystem?
I welcome the fact that he is going to look into this in detail and gather all the relevant information.
May I invite the Commissioner to take account as well of the remarks made by the chairman of the De Beers company itself, Mr Oppenheimer, in a recent address to the Harvard Business School alumni conference held in Cape Town.
Mr Oppenheimer stated, and I quote âwe make no pretence that we are not seeking to manage the diamond market, to control supply, to manage prices and to act collusively with our partners in the businessâ.
May I suggest to the Commissioner that this is a remarkable admission to make.
It was made in March 1999, just a few months before the launch of the supplier of Trisystem.
May I invite the Commissioner to take account of this admission when he investigates the best-known world monopoly still in existence, which has still not been investigated by the Commission using its competition powers.
Â Â  . â As regards MrÂ Corbettâs last remark, I will take the liberty of drawing his attention to the fact that the Commission, and, in particular, this European Commission, has begun to pay close attention to these issues.
As regards the question relating to complaints, I can say that the Commission has indeed received complaints regarding the âSupplier of Choiceâ, that will be looked into according to the standard procedures that the Commission follows in applying Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
As regards the number of complaints, MrÂ Corbett, as well as their origin, of course, the Commission considers that the principles of good administrative management impose on it an obligation of confidentiality regarding precisely their number and origin.
Of course, if a business that presents a complaint to the Commission considers it appropriate to make this public, then it is fully entitled to do so.
â As the author is not present, Question No 37 lapses.
Question No 38 by Claude Moraes (H-0660/03):
Subject: Reconstruction of Iraq
Could the Commission please detail the current situation of its assistance to the reconstruction of Iraq?
Â Â  . â As Parliament is aware, the Commission communication adopted on 1 October 2003 proposed that EUR 200 million from the European Union budget be earmarked for reconstruction assistance in Iraq in 2003 and 2004.
I am glad to say that, with Parliament's help, this pledge was announced at the Madrid Donors' conference on 24 October 2003.
A successful conference, raising more than USD 33 billion from over 70 countries was only the first step towards reconstruction.
I remind you that the Commission communication set out four elements that are essential to the success of the reconstruction process: improved security, measures towards a political transition to an Iraqi government, the establishment of a multilateral umbrella for reconstruction, and cooperation on the part of Iraq's neighbours.
We have seen progress on three of these elements, but on security considerably more progress is needed for rapid implementation of the Commission's assistance for reconstruction to proceed.
For 2003 we have two goals: to help bridge the transition from the humanitarian phase to reconstruction, and to support the UN in fulfilling its mandate under Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1511.
The EUR 40 million we have proposed for 2003 is therefore intended to provide for assistance to flow as rapidly as possible to support Iraq via the UN and its specialised agencies.
I can report that, building on the work done to date by ECHO, a first package of EUR 29 million has been set aside for the UN's work in water and sanitation, health, education, employment and income-generating schemes: all areas in which the UN has been active and where the UN's 4000 local agents are still working.
This should be ready for disbursement to the UN by early December 2003. A further EUR 11 million will be committed by the end of 2003 to support the UN's work on local and regional governance, civilian administration, legal and judicial reform, the media and human rights.
In addition, we have set aside EUR 2 million â on the horizontal demining budget line â to help address the huge problem posed by land mines and unexploded ordnance in Iraq.
In 2004 the International Reconstruction Fund facility proposed by the World Bank and the UN in Madrid should be established.
We therefore expect to channel the lion's share of the EUR 160 million proposed via this facility to support areas such as social safety nets, institution- and capacity-building, macro-economic management, the strengthening of Iraqi civil society and the protection and promotion of human rights and democracy.
How the Commission decides to divide allocations between the UN and the World Bank will be based on the sectoral experience and comparative advantages of the two organisations.
This will, however, also depend on whether conditions in Iraq have in fact improved and on the prospects for implementation by UN bodies, NGOs and Iraqi ministries.
The reality is that there are still many difficult question marks.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that very comprehensive answer and congratulate all those in the EU who have come to the aid of the Iraqi people at a very difficult time.
I have two brief supplementary questions.
One is to ask the Commissioner's view on how he sees the aid emanating from the Madrid Conference fitting in with our other aid commitments, particularly in areas in Africa and elsewhere where there are conflicts which receive less media coverage but in which people are still suffering.
How does he see those conflicts being resolved?
Secondly, what is his view of the implementation of existing humanitarian aid during the humanitarian phase?
Is he satisfied with that aspect, given the political pressures from individual Member States on the whole approach to Iraq?
Â Â  . â Firstly, on a positive note, the rigid manner in which we allocate money to different geographical envelopes means that money is not being moved from somewhere else into Iraq.
The EUR 200 million is money that has, so to speak, been 'vacuumed-up' in the neighbourhood.
Thus we are not taking money away from what we can and should do in Africa because of what we are doing in Iraq.
The question of what we do in other conflicts is a big question which we do not have time to go into today.
As to the second supplementary question, I can report that of the total EURÂ 100 million for humanitarian assistance to Iraq mobilised for this year, we have made a detailed commitment for about EUR 70 million, and expect that most of the remaining money will be committed towards the end of the year.
In terms of actual spending and implementation, we have, in spite of all the difficulties, been able to stick very closely to the plan and expectations.
It has to be noted that the actual work we are doing there is carried out by local people working for us or for the organisations we use as implementing agencies.
We are still able to do something meaningful, but keep a low profile for obvious reasons of security.
However, looking at things on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis, the humanitarian effort to date has been a wonderful achievement.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to take this opportunity provided by the Rules of Procedure to ask precisely the questions that I tabled previously.
What is the Commissionâs position on the requests made by the occupying powers in Iraq and on the serious situation Iraqi society is now experiencing?
What measures does it consider should be adopted to support the UNâs action in Iraq?
Â Â  . â It follows clearly from the previous response that we see the United Nations and the World Bank as our main partners in delivering assistance to and also for reconstructing Iraq.
We are not working hand in hand with the occupying power.
The transitional authority is there and it also has responsibilities for security, law and order and so on. This authority, therefore, is part of the background within which everyone in Iraq must work.
As I said, however, the partners through which we are channelling money are primarily the United Nations and the World Bank.
Â Â  â As they deal with the same subject, questions 39 to 45 will be taken together.
Press reports have recently stated that Member States have been faced with importersâ court actions challenging Member State moves to recover duty on suspected settlement imports which Israelâs customs authorities have maintained are eligible for preferential treatment.
Since Community law requires the importing countryâs authorities to accept the legally-made determinations of the exporting countryâs authorities, is the Commission confident that the Member States can sustain duty recovery against importersâ objections by relying on the fact that Israelâs verification answers fail to satisfy the Member State customs authoritiesâ requests to specify the locales in which the products in question were actually produced?
Has Israel taken the position that its customs authoritiesâ verification answers are sufficient and must be accepted under the Agreement?
In the plenary debate of 4 September 2003 on the 'Application of the EU-Israel Association Agreement' the Commission was asked why it has not notified the Member States that the definition of territoriality that Israel applies to determine the origin of all its exports under that Agreement is illegal.
Commissioner Nielson replied that the Commission had already done what was asked when it published a notice to importers in November 2001.
In that notice the Commission confirmed that 'Israel issues proof of origin for products coming from places brought under Israeli administration since 1967'.
Did the Commission also confirm 'the existence of certain substantial errors in the application of the Agreements, to the extent that the validity of all preferential certificates issued by Israel are put in doubt'?
Does the Commission consider that it has provided information to the Member States that raises doubts about the real origin of all products exported by Israel?
Does the Commission consider that the notice to importers of November 2001, the information at the disposal of the Member States regarding settlement products and firms, and the provisions of ArticleÂ 32 of the Association Agreement provide the Member States with sufficient legal and technical means to reliably deny preferences to imports of settlement products and products that contain substantial amounts of settlement-produced components and materials, including products that are commingled with essentially identical products originating in Israel?
Will the Commission recommend the introduction of new cumulation provisions in the Association Agreement with Israel in connection with the implementation of pan-European cumulation while Israel continues to treat the settlements it has established in occupied territories as falling within the territorial scope of the applicability of its agreements with the EC?
Will the Commission recommend the introduction of new cumulation provisions in the ECâs trade-related agreements with Israel and Jordan in connection with the so-called âQualified Industrial Zonesâ while this remains the case?
Is the Commission aware that prior to the November 2001 notice to importers, Member States failed to recover duties after receiving verification answers from Israeli customs confirming that the products in question were produced in settlements and reiterating Israelâs determinations that they were entitled to preferential treatment?
Has the notice to importers eliminated the possibility that such failures to recover duties might reoccur?
In determining the origin of all products it exports to the European Community, in issuing proofs of origin and in verifying their validity, does Israel ever distinguish between production carried out in settlements established in occupied territories and production carried out in the territory of the State of Israel?
Under the EC-Israel Association Agreement as it is currently being implemented, can the real origin of any product exported by Israel be determined?
In the plenary debate of 4 September on the âApplication of the EC-Israel Association Agreementâ the Commission was asked why it had not notified the Member States that Israelâs definition of territoriality is illegal. Commissioner Nielsen replied that the Commission had already done this in a notice to importers issued in November 2001.
Has the Commission indeed confirmed to the Member States that Israelâs customs authorities apply an illegal definition of territoriality to determine the origin of all products exported under that Agreement?
Has the Commission confirmed to the Member States that Israelâs customs authorities do not distinguish between production carried out in settlements and production carried out in the territory of the State of Israel whenever they issue proofs of origin?
Does the Commission expect the Member States to check the origin of all imports from Israel?
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission recalls that, according to its terms, the EU-Israel Association Agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel.
Therefore products obtained in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment when entering the EU and proof of preferential origin issued by Israel for those products cannot be accepted by the Communities customs authorities.
In a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in November 2001, the Commission informed the customs authorities of the Member States and European importers that Israel issues proof of preferential origin for products coming from places brought under Israeli administration such 1967.
As a follow-up to that notice, the customs authorities of the EU Member States are screening all imports from Israel in order to identify the unlawfully issued proofs of origin and return the proofs of origin concerned to Israel in accordance with the verification procedure provided for in Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement.
The Israeli replies, in the context of these verification procedures, do not distinguish between production in the settlements and production in the territory of the State of Israel.
According to Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement, entitlement to the preferences is refused if there is no reply to the request for verification within ten months, or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the proof of origin in question or the real origin of the products.
It falls within the competence of the national customs authorities to determine, for each and every individual consignment, whether, under those provisions, the elements of fact and law allow refusal of the preferential tariff treatment.
Refusal of the preference gives rise to a customs debt which the customs authorities of the Member States must recover, since, under Community law, they are responsible for the collection of the custom duties which are the Communities' traditional own resources.
The EU takes every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of the imports of products from the Israeli settlements and considers that this issue should be resolved before amending the EU-Israel protocol on rules of origin for the extension of the pan-European cumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries.
As to the creation of qualified industrial zones in the EC's trade relations with Jordan and Israel, the Commission is at the stage of carrying out a technical analysis and no conclusions have been drawn.
If an additional question is put forward here, asking why the Commission has not formally proposed the arbitration procedure which is part of all this, I would respond by saying that arbitration is, indeed, a possible measure planned in our Association Agreement in case there are differences in interpretation.
Nevertheless, the Commission has so far taken the necessary steps to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community.
In this regard, it should be noted that launching this procedure requires the unanimous assent of the Member States.
Â Â  I am not satisfied that the Commissioner has given a full reply to all the questions.
Clearly â and he acknowledges this himself â it is the Commission that is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and, therefore, the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
What the Commissioner has said is that he is leaving it up to the Member States to pursue those areas where preferential access has been granted illegally.
Bearing in mind that it is the Commission that is ultimately the guardian of the Treaties, what steps is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States fully apply all these criteria?
As previous speakers on this issue have indicated, the individual Member States have not implemented the criteria properly.
What action is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States are properly applying the laws in this regard?
If they are not, what action is it taking to penalise them?
Â Â  . â I anticipated the question by expanding my initial answer to make it clear that unanimity is required in order for the Commission to use the next instrument available as a legal follow-up.
That is the answer I have to hang on to.
That is what describes the situation.
Â Â  There is another solution.
The Commission could notify the customs authorities that instead of using a very incomplete list to identify which of the goods may come from settlements and which may come from Israel, they should send all the Israeli goods back and ask Israel to verify all the goods that are labelled 'made in Israel'. Would the Commissioner be prepared to do that?
Â Â  . â One way would be to pursue this problem in a manner that is legally sound and efficient.
Another way would be to go for an all-out escalation, which the step mentioned here would definitely look like.
I do not see that happening in the foreseeable future.
Â Â  In fact, I am referring back to MrÂ Cushnahanâs and also to MrÂ SandbÃŠkâs questions.
Among other things, I asked the Commission if it really does provide the Member States with sufficient legal and technical means to identify goods that are entering illegally.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his suggestion for the next question because it would be interesting to discover which countries, for example, instead of requiring observance of the agreements, are endeavouring to ensure that the agreements and the interests of the European citizens are not respected.
Â Â  . â I do not have a list of those countries.
This must be followed up in a careful manner.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Nielson, the rules of origin are very clear, but the problem is that they are not respected by Israel.
For years, Israel has continued to treat illegal settlements established in occupied territory as if they were within its own territorial limits.
Even when the formerCommissioner MrÂ Marin was in charge of these issues, there were discussions with the Israeli authorities.
That goes back six years and nothing has changed.
This is why there are several of us asking you to act and to tell us what you intend to do.
Are you, for example, going to ban all new provisions on the cumulation of origin in trade agreements with Israel or not propose any at all?
Are you going to name any Member States before the Court of Justice?
These are the questions, to which we would like you to give clear replies.
Â Â  . â I certainly share the concern about how this matter is developing.
I would also add that I find it quite ironic and a great contradiction to be erecting a wall across what is purported to still be one entity in terms of origin.
I do not think it is possible here to move on to a detailed discussion of the steps that might be envisaged, but this exchange of questions and answers does clarify the issue.
Â Â  MrÂ President, misuse of rules of origin must result in repayment of duties.
If this does not take place, we shall have not only a fiscal, but also an ethical problem.
My question is as follows: has the warning notice to importers had any effect on the Member States that have a rather casual approach to the rules of origin?
After all, we are shaping a common market, and access to that market has to be properly regulated.
Â Â  . â I do not have any statistics to show how this looked before the message was sent to the Member States, or how it looked afterwards.
We know that the problem remains, and that is enough, in my view.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I, too, subscribe to the analysis of the fellow Members who spoke earlier.
Two questions remain, as far as I am concerned.
One is that we spoke about a technical analysis.
Am I to conclude from this that that technical analysis will provide more insight into the origin of the products?
Is it possible to say when that analysis will be finished?
I should also like to reiterate the question as to why the Commission does not bring a Member State before the Court of Justice if it is clearly in breach.
After all, it cannot be said that we do not have the necessary measures.
There are always measures in place to declare Member States in breach.
Â Â  . â The remarks I made on technical analysis relate to the creation of qualified industrial zones in the European Community's trade relations with Jordan and Israel.
I concluded those remarks by saying that the Commission is now at the stage of carrying out a technical analysis.
No conclusions as a result of that have yet been drawn.
The work we are doing in this respect is likely to fuel our determination as we move ahead.
Â Â  When does the Commission expect the final conclusions to be drawn?
Â Â  . â The precise answer is that I simply do not know.
Â Â  . â The Commission considers that addressing developing countries' debt problems is an important means of achieving the Community's development cooperation policy objectives.
The Community is actively participating in the current Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative with more than EUR 1.6 billion pledged up to now: EUR 680 million on its own claims as a creditor and EUR 934 million as a donor to the HIPC Trust Fund.
The Commission would also like to recall that this participation represents much more than the minimum required by the HIPC initiative.
Indeed the Community, as a donor, is a major contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, accounting for almost 25% of the total resources.
Over and above its expected participation as a creditor, the Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million for the settlement of all the special loans that would remain due from least-developed ACP countries, after they have benefited from the full application of the HIPC terms.
It is also worth noting that most of the EU Member States have announced their intention to cancel 100% of the bilateral debt, beyond the HIPC terms.
This means that any further debt cancellation in HIPC countries will relate largely to multilateral institutions, non-Paris Club official creditors and the private sector.
At this point in time, it is also clear that the HIPC initiative has to be considered as a first important step towards long-term debt sustainability and that it will not be sufficient to ensure the beneficiary countries meet the Millennium Development Goals, especially in countries badly affected by HIV/AIDS.
Moreover, the adverse economic effects of HIV/AIDS are now much more clearly recognised than they were when the HIPC initiative was launched, and the Commission agrees that it must consider HIV/AIDS when also discussing long-term debt sustainability.
In the framework of the EU-Africa dialogue, the issue of Africaâs External debt has been part of the agenda since the Cairo meeting.
The Commission has followed up actively the discussions between the Chefs de file (France and Germany) and the African Union representatives.
At the latest ministerial troika meeting of the EU-Africa Dialogue, held in Rome on 10 November, which I attended together with the Irish Foreign Minister, it was agreed that discussions and the corresponding report of the issue of Africa's External Debt should be prepared as a matter of priority and that the experts meeting within the enlarged Troika should be held in the first quarter of next year.
Finally, the Commission has recently launched, as an element of the EU-Africa dialogue, a study on debt relief beyond the HIPC initiative, with the main objective of providing a solid base to assess the situation after the full application of the HIPC initiative.
This study should provide key elements for shaping, in coordination with Member States, the Unionâs future debt policy.
The Commission expects to be able to share with Parliament the results of this study by early next year.
I would add that the complexity of doing something with multilateral debt is much larger and makes anything there much more difficult politically in terms of burden sharing internationally, compared to the handling of bilateral debt.
Most donor countries that take their responsibility as a donor partner seriously have in fact more or less cancelled all the outstanding bilateral debt.
For the Commission it is important to note that our share of all this as a creditor is very limited, basically because we are a grant donor and do not lend money to our partners.
Â Â  The Irish Government is currently the only EU government currently 100% in favour of the cancellation of the poorest countries' debts.
Unfortunately, that government does not seem to be very prominent in promoting that policy, even though it was adopted back in July 2002.
Many people and organisations would like to see this policy promoted during the Irish presidency.
We would also like the Commission to support this.
In the UK, the British Jubilee Debt campaign are trying to mobilise politicians to support this.
When we talk in Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation about trying to help developing countries, it has been recognised that cancelling the debt would be one of the most sensible ways of ensuring that we can actually help these countries.
The debt is grossly unfair.
These countries are being exploited under false pretences.
The only way forward for any just society in this day and age should be to promote the policy that the Irish Government has endorsed.
We would like to see that happen during the Irish presidency and we would like to see the Commission come on board too.
Commissioner, you have not given any guarantee that you would support this policy.
If, for example, we can get the majority of the Member States to support this policy and to adopt it, then of course we would like to see the Commission support it as well.
Â Â  . â I tried to explain this.
The bilateral debt is relatively easy for the donors to manage; it is their own decision.
The Commission is not in a position to tell individual Member States what to do.
We have played a crucial role in the most difficult area, namely taking meaningful action on the multilateral debt, and in doing so we have gone far beyond our role as a creditor.
What Ireland is doing is fine.
However, I have to say that in 1995, when I was the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, we announced something similar for the least-developed poor countries.
My hesitation about broadening the scope of debt cancellation to, for instance, middle-income countries, is based on the consideration that if we do that we will take money from the least-developed and poorest countries and give it to countries that are relatively much better off.
That is not so easy to do in practice.
What Ireland is doing is commendable and it might inspire other countries to do something similar.
However, the Commission cannot tell Member States to do that.
Â Â  . â Under the Cotonou Agreement, good governance is recognised as a fundamental element of the ACP-EU partnership and as an area for support in the framework of our development cooperation strategy.
The total amount earmarked in the 9th EDF National Indicative Programmes for support to projects and programmes in the field of governance represents around EUR 640 million, corresponding to about 10Â % of the overall allocations for the national indicative programmes.
Part of these allocations can be mobilised for projects aimed at strengthening the capacity of the parliaments of ACP countries.
A total amount of EUR 38.5 million is already committed, within existing governance programmes, for specific actions of support to the parliaments of ACP countries.
In addition, two new financing proposals, focused on support to ACP parliaments, are scheduled for approval this year: one for Madagascar (EUR 1.9 million) and one for South Africa (EURÂ 10 million).
The delegations will be made aware of the possibility of supporting specific activities designed to increase the awareness and information of national parliaments on the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, if requested by our partner countries.
In addition, the various programmes geared towards strengthening the trade negotiation capacities of the ACP, including the ongoing EUR 10Â million and EUR 20 million all-ACP facilities for WTO and economic partnership agreement negotiations, are also relevant as regards the promotion of training and awareness in relation to the role of parliaments in these matters.
We are encouraging members of national and regional parliaments to participate in various trade-related workshops, seminars etc., organised in this context.
The Commission has already contacted the European Parliament in the past with a view to helping them build up a network of ACP parliamentarian correspondents in order to enhance their involvement in trade matters.
We are interested in doing everything possible in this area.
The 9th EDF financial protocol provides EUR 4 million to allow for the participation of parliamentarians from ACP countries in the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which is a key institution of the Cotonou Partnership.
A new financing agreement is currently under consideration, using the entire allocation under the current Financial Protocol.
It will provide this support over a period of two-and-a-half years.
The strengthening of the structure of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which now includes three thematic standing committees, necessitates additional financial resources to allow for effective ACP participation.
To take into account these additional needs, the European Commission intends to propose a decision of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers to increase funds for the JPA to an amount of around EUR 6 Million, in accordance with Article 8 of the Financial Protocol.
All these initiatives should make it possible for national and regional parliaments to access some of the resources needed to ensure their effective participation in cooperation.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for a comprehensive and wide-ranging answer.
It is always good to hear that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is receiving much-needed extra funding considering the new work â with the committees in particular â that we are engaged in.
Would you agree with me, Commissioner, that support for parliaments is an area of our governance and democracy activities which has been somewhat neglected in the past?
For instance, for the country strategy papers, I can find no evidence that parliaments were consulted in any meaningful way, although civil society and NGOs were quite rightly involved.
Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians are really thirsty for information, particularly on the EDF and on following the EPA negotiations.
I am interested in the fact that some countries are already putting into their national indicative programmes a priority for parliamentary training and capacity-building, but out of 78 countries, if we are honest only a handful have made that kind of priority clear.
I would like to know exactly how we can encourage national authorising officers and others to make this priority clear so we can ensure that accountability of parliamentarians is part of the process that we are engaged in.
It seems to me that they do very little challenging of the executive in terms of questioning, financing and so on.
I would also like to ask what exactly you suggest that we, as parliamentarians, can do in cooperation with the Commission to ensure that governments make parliamentary activity more of a priority.
Â Â  . â It would be difficult to find a better organised lobbying group to promote exactly that than the institutional Joint Parliamentary Assembly itself.
If you cannot do it with the help of those friends, then I might not be able to help you either.
My worry is more related to the weak character of the inclusion, consultation or real participation of parliaments in the debate at national level, and in the decision-making process regarding national strategies.
It is a great step forward that we are investing so heavily in engaging civil society, but to create a civilised society, parliaments are necessary, otherwise NGOs tend to see themselves as neo-governmental organisations because they have been hurt and parliaments â and especially oppositions â are kept in the dark.
I keep returning to this in my discussions.
I always make this point when I am informing our ACP partner countries that now we have this ability to fund NGOs, civil society and non-state actors.
However, the role of parliaments should not be forgotten.
We have similar views on this and we should continue to help each other in this work.
Â Â  It is stated that in the second part of question time each Commissioner will answer for half an hour.
The poor Commissioner has spent more than half an hour on this section and I suggest we now move on to the third part of question time.
Â Â  â I agree with you.
You cannot move onto the third part.
You are aware that the custom is for the third part not to be replied to orally and, in fact, the Commission does not bring replies.
We therefore had to distribute the available time between the Commissioners present.
Since Mr Monti has spoken for less time, MrÂ Nielson is very kindly speaking for longer.
This is the custom in the House, it is common law. It is the precedent which is always applied.
Furthermore, the Commissioner is replacing MrÂ Patten. That is why he is speaking for longer.
Can the Commission rule out the possibility of EU funding also being used to subsidise organisations in developing countries which in another area of their work participate in programmes employing abortion as a means of population planning or even involving compulsory abortions?
Â Â  . â I apologise if this is getting boring, but the notion of the college means that I can speak on behalf of all my fellow Commissioners if necessary.
In reply to Mr Posselt, the specific formulation of the question means that a categorical answer could be ambiguous.
However, I can say that in selecting the beneficiaries for Community funding, the Commission considers and assesses the main activity for which the funds are requested.
Generally, the Commission funds clearly-described projects and programmes.
I would add that compulsory abortions â to which the question refers â as a means of population planning is not seen as a feature in the work of any of the organisations the Commission is funding.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have a quite specific supplementary question for the Commissioner.
There are recurrent debates in this House about what precisely is meant by the expression âreproductive healthâ, and that also features in our choice of organisations.
I just wanted to ask you, Commissioner, whether the expression âreproductive healthâ includes abortion or excludes it.
Â Â  . â We are not able or willing to add or subtract anything from the internationally-established Cairo consensus.
This also covers the discussion Mr Posselt is trying to push forward.
As part of this Cairo consensus, it is clear beyond any doubt that coercive abortion as an instrument of family planning is explicitly rejected.
We can play around with this and say that abortion occurs for different reasons: it could be voluntary, and take place after counselling.
Maybe Mr Posselt will see that as something to oppose and take up politically.
However, the Commission is sticking to the Cairo consensus: that is the basis on which we work.
We are extremely careful to ensure that we do not walk into uncertain territory, precisely because of the sensitivity of this subject.
You will have to take my word for it, MrÂ Posselt, that we are very careful about sticking to the balance and substance of the Cairo consensus.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissioner stated that the Commission is very cautious in its relations with reproductive health programmes.
How will the Commission, however, ensure that women in less developed countries also enjoy an essential human right, the right to make decisions about their own bodies and the right also to make choices regarding abortion?
In other words, how will the Commission support NGOs that protect such alternatives as these and their projects in developing countries?
I think it is very important that women in less developed countries also have a right to abortion and a right to consider it an option.
Â Â  . â That is precisely what this whole problem is about.
The Cairo consensus defines, as a result of a huge international discussion, the balance in the policy.
That is why we talk about reproductive health and sexual rights, and it is quite a big theme.
We support governments and organisations within the UN system and others which are indeed assisting women to protect their rights and safeguard their lives in any area relating to reproductive health.
I would not like to make any choices on this matter.
It is necessary to maintain a balance and I am proud of the work we are doing in this field.
Â Â  â Several Members have asked for the floor, but only two supplementary questions can be asked and I am allowing them in the chronological order in which they were requested.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to put another question to the Commission.
Are there programmes designed to support women who do not want to have an abortion?
Â Â  . â There is a big misunderstanding here.
Abortion is not seen in any of the organisations we are supporting as an instrument in family planning.
Abortion has to do with a woman's situation.
There is a human rights element to this choice.
Women must be supported whatever the choice they make, but that is why this is cumbersome and is very demanding on resources.
Â Â  . â According to preliminary reports during the repetition of the local elections in the Himara region on 16 November, a number of irregularities and incidents took place.
Apparently those events have not allowed the normal conduct of democratic elections in the area and of course the Commission regrets this.
The Commission is currently waiting for further information on these events and is attentively following the handling of the situation by the Albanian authorities.
The Commission will take any step it considers appropriate following a detailed analysis of the situation.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
As you said, unfortunately the irregularities â which provoked my question in the first round â were repeated during the elections in Himara the other day, with a real orgy of violence, injury, bombings against candidates and so on. I am delighted that, as you said, the Commission will be following the situation attentively in order to take suitable steps within the framework of any cooperation between Albania and the European Union, especially as the Greek minister for foreign affairs, Mr Papandreou, presented the matter to the Council yesterday, albeit somewhat belatedly and after the event, and Commissioner Patten fully shared his concerns.
Â Â  â This is not a question, Commissioner.
I imagine that you take note of this statement.
I would like to thank you for the almost 60 minutes you have spent with us this afternoon.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order and by way of follow-up to MrÂ Newton Dunn's point of order, I have been sitting here listening with great interest to what Mr Nielson has said, but had a specific question to put forward in part three.
Since you invite oral questions for Commissioners for parts one, two and three, why is it that after the second half hour we did not revert to the first question of part three?
Why is it that those of us with questions one, two and three in part three will not receive oral answers?
I find it a discourtesy to colleagues.
If our turn is never to be reached, we should be told to put down a written question to the Commissioners.
If we can only have answers from the Commissioners who are available on the day â Mr Monti and MrÂ Nielson in this case â then why invite questions to any Commissioner?
Why have a section, under other questions â part three â which should have had half an hour, and then ignore it?
I fail to understand this, and with respect find it a discourtesy to colleagues.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a lack of courtesy.
As you will appreciate, I have had to read the Rules of Procedure, Rule 43, the annexes, the guidelines, the precedents, the history of Question Time, the casuistry and I can assure you that the second part is dedicated to specific questions to Commissioners and they take up one hour, which can be divided between three or between two.
When the Commission classifies the questions in the third part, this means that they are not going to be replied to orally.
If you believe it to be appropriate, and you probably do, we can send out a circular explaining it.
There are questions in the second part which are not replied to either because there is not sufficient time and this is not a lack of courtesy.
I would insist that the third part is not scheduled to be replied to orally.
I would state this clearly and it has always been the case.
I have had to study this very carefully and for the benefit of the Members, so to speak, we have discussed it in the Bureau and if necessary I will produce some written comments on the Rules of Procedure and I will send it out.
But it is not a lack of courtesy.
In any event, I am very grateful to Mr Newton Dunn and the honourable Member for having raised the need to clarify this issue. In fact in the Commission there are no specific Commissioners who come to reply to questions in the third part, there are Commissioners who come to reply to the questions put to them and they therefore come to this sitting.
As for questions of special importance, they are in the first part, classified in a different manner.
Finally, having explained this, I am at your disposal in case there is any other explanation to be given in writing.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 91 will be reply to in writing(1).
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes the work of the rapporteur, MrÂ Mussa, and the members of the two committees involved, who have managed to reach unanimity in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on a comprehensive and high quality report.
Fighting cancer has been one of the Commissionâs major public health priorities.
Each year cancer is diagnosed in about 1.6 million Europeans and kills around 950 000 people.
Estimates suggest, however, that the lives of about 75Â 000 Europeans could be saved annually if best practices of cancer screening were made available to all citizens across the European Union.
Even more lives could be saved by extending these recommendations to the acceding countries.
The Commissionâs proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening and Mr Mussaâs report show a clear sign of shared commitment to that end.
The purpose of this proposal is to make recommendations for mass screening programmes on a sound scientific basis.
It aims to achieve further reductions of cancer-specific mortality in all Member States by establishing general principles of best practice, as recommended by cancer experts.
In addressing these questions, we must however remember that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care fall under the competence of the Member States.
That is why the Commissionâs proposal addresses the issue through a Council recommendation.
However, I should stress that these issues are essential preconditions for the success of any screening programme.
The proposal foresees a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes, on the basis of information to be provided by Member States, no later than the end of the third year after the date of its adoption.
This report will be used to consider the need for further action.
In the follow-up the Commission will take a particular interest in the two main areas of the scientific developments.
First, the new tests which would improve or possibly even replace recommended methods, such as combining the pap test with testing for infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses or in other words, HPV testing, and, second, the new tests for cancers in other organs, such as PSA testing for prostate cancer.
Thank you again for your continued support on this important public health issue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have made a valuable contribution to the drafting of this report, which is important in both scientific and social terms.
As I have already had the opportunity to reiterate on other occasions, I believe that public health should increasingly be treated as a matter of primary importance in European policies, not least in view of the forthcoming enlargement.
This recommendation is the first step towards the harmonisation and coordination of policies regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
Sadly, cancer is the main cause of death in industrialised countries, affecting patients, families and operators themselves.
The socio-economic impact is therefore enormous, not just in terms of the cost of treating and supporting patients but also in terms of the emotional strain involved.
In addition to the human tragedy, the situation causes a continual decrease in the proportion of the healthy population whose productivity and know-how are the mainstay of European society.
We can deduce from the most recent statistics that the average age of onset of these diseases is getting lower and lower: the younger the patient, the more aggressive the disease.
Thus, the possibility of treating cancer undeniably depends on how early it is diagnosed; besides, late diagnosis of cancer requires aggressive and invasive forms of treatment, which are costly and have a high psychological and social impact.
Although the Member States are responsible for health policies, through their national health systems, it is unthinkable that such an important prevention campaign, in both the social and public health spheres, should remain a national or regional project dependent on the economic and cultural potential of each country.
The impact of this disease on society should be borne and coordinated at European level, guaranteeing equal opportunities for treatment and therefore good results across the board.
The current capacity for radical treatment in oncology seems to depend more on the opportunities for prevention, based on epidemiological and etiopathogenetic knowledge and early diagnosis, rather than on surgical techniques and radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. For example, we might take the example of gastric carcinoma, for which the five-year survival rate ranges between 95% in patients with an intramucosal carcinoma to less than 10% in patients with an advanced invasive carcinoma, despite therapy.
On the one hand, a correct and adequate screening needs a maximum capacity for identifying even the smallest lesions (sensitivity) and a good capacity for distinguishing them from benign lesions (specificity) and to ensure that the diagnostic investigation is non-invasive for the patient and itself entails an almost zero risk of damage, since the procedures are, by definition, carried out on asymptomatic individuals, who are only potentially ill.
Of course, the new instruments for early diagnosis, before being offered at European level, should be examined and validated carefully by means of trials.
Last but not least, the excellence of âgood practiceâ in screening should be checked by analysing the mortality figures collected in all Member States and preferably entered in a European databank.
Financial resources must be mobilised to increase the number of diagnostic centres and ensure that the workload entailed in screening does not jeopardise the quality of the testing or increase waiting times, which would lead to a deterioration in the quality of care for patients already suffering from cancer.
It is therefore essential that European action is organised on four fronts: firstly, information and health education for European citizens; secondly, carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth; thirdly, periodic checks on the quality of screening; fourthly, research into the applicability of new screening methods.
This recommendation will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease.
The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming etiological fact that one European in four has or will have a malignant tumour in the course of their lives.
Finally, in addition to European-level screening there ought to be guidelines for the treatment of diseases.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, something like one in four Europeans die of cancer, but thousands of people could be saved every year if high-quality early detection programmes were in place in every Member State.
We all know that.
That is why I very much welcome the Commissionâs initiative in recommending to the Member States that they introduce screening, the need for which is confirmed by scientific evidence.
I see it as absolutely scandalous that, for example, only eight Member States have to date started to offer national programmes for mammography screening to all, even though, according to WHO, this cuts the mortality rate by up to 36%, and even though the quality guidelines for this were presented as long ago as 1992.
Commissioner, I regret that I cannot avoid issuing what is both an appeal and a warning.
If we are to really take this Council recommendation seriously, you cannot at the same time allow all the screening networks to be forced to close down their operations.
At the end of the day, it was the work of the European Cancer Networks that led to this Council recommendation.
If you, the Commission, want to have real credibility in the fight against cancer, then you have to find a permanent place for screening in the new action programme on health.
We must not allow a recurrence of what happened this year, when the word âcancerâ no longer appeared in the action programmeâs work plan, which â as you know all too well â eventually, and inevitably, resulted in support for all the screening networks being discontinued.
Commissioner, we will still, in future, need the European networks to draw up new guidelines and improve existing ones, for only by these means will we achieve equally high standards of screening across the EU.
In addition, though, we need the networks to support the new Member States, where, as is well known, action is even more urgently needed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, let me begin by thanking MrÂ Mussa sincerely for his flawless cooperation with us all.
The figures speak for themselves.
One in four people in Europe dies of cancer.
The suffering caused is enormous, not only for those hit by the disease, but also for their families and friends.
As terrible as cancer is, however, it is possible to survive it.
That does mean, however, that the disease must be detected very early, since that leads to a considerable reduction in the number of deaths from it.
It has been demonstrated that there is a link with the screening programmes, and that is why it is so important for us MEPs, too, to hold detailed discussions on reports such as this, based on sound data supplied by the Commission.
I must also compliment the Commission on the report it presented.
I should actually recommend that the Commission circulate that report widely. It should be compulsory reading for all policy-makers, because it reveals that preventive action saves lives.
The European Union has an enormous task ahead of it.
We must ensure that the available expertise is not wasted.
I therefore concur with MrsÂ JÃ¶nsâs words a moment ago on the cancer networks.
We must also keep innovating.
That means that we must not just persist with old, classical tests.
Combining a number of things that, according to this report, have been proved or are currently being proved, will enable us to do a much better job.
I am thinking of not only the HPVÂ test, but also the test for prostate cancer in Luxembourg and the test for colon cancer.
Given that we also still have a European research programme, of which health forms a major part, we can do a good deal more for European citizens, particularly if the Commissioner and all of us really put this at the heart of our policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Karin JÃ¶ns for her work in this area.
Karin recently visited Scotland to talk to the Eastwood constituency Labour party's cancer care group.
They became interested in cancer care issues when one of their members died from cancer.
They saw at first hand what cancer can do to someone they know and care for, but, most importantly, they decided to take action to improve the care cancer patients receive in their local community.
Everyone knows somebody, either directly or indirectly, who has been or is being affected by cancer.
One in four Europeans will die of cancer.
Among men, lung and stomach cancer are the most common cancers worldwide, and for women the most common cancers are breast and cervical cancers.
If we are going to tackle one of the biggest causes of death in the EU and the world, cancer screening is a critical tool in our battle against the disease.
According to the World Health Organisation, we know enough about the causes of cancer to prevent at least one third of all cancers, cancers that are largely preventable by stopping smoking, eating healthy food and avoiding exposure to carcinogens.
For those who are affected, detection is critical and screening is essential.
The earlier cancer is detected, the better the survival rate.
The proposal to have mammography screening for breast cancer for women aged 50 to 69, faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer in men and women aged 50 to 74 and pap smear tests for cervical abnormalities between the ages of 20 and 30 are steps in the right direction in securing the health of Europeans and they should be welcomed.
As Amendment 33 suggests, we need to look at the promising new screening tests currently under evaluation, especially the HPV test and a test for prostate cancer, as well as considering mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49.
We must rely on clinical evidence and evaluation to back up recommendations for the acceptance of new tests.
Sadly, although I am supportive of HPV tests, I cannot support Amendment 34.
As soon as the tests are complete, I look forward to us recommending the full inclusion of this process in screening tests.
However, screening cannot be seen in isolation.
Cancer networks and cancer registries are also vital in monitoring the impact of screening the population and changes in incidence and survival and mortality.
Public education and information are essential.
If you look on the Internet and type the word cancer, you will get 18 600 000 hits.
E-health and communication are essential in the world that we live in.
In conclusion, the recommendation before us today will help us in the battle against cancer.
Too many people in Scotland, Britain, the EU and the world, die from this disease.
