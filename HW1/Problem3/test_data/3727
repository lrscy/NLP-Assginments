on humanitarian aid for Goma.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it never rains but it pours, but this especially applies to the distressed population in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Not only have they suffered under conditions of war for years, resulting in numerous refugees, and occupation by neighbouring Rwanda, their plight has now also been compounded by volcanic eruptions.
Recent tragic reports confirm the miserable situation the population is in.
The short dry season has started and a blanket of heat has descended on the country.
There is toxic dust, and toxic vapours are emerging from the lava.
The population has no firewood and uses the heat of this lava stream for their cooking fires.
You understand that this is a miserable situation involving a city which - at least in part - is reminiscent of Hiroshima in terms of destruction.
The section of the city that was not affected by the eruption lives its normal life, insofar as this is possible under these circumstances and under the occupation.
This means, therefore, that it is very difficult to distinguish the real victims from the others, and it is currently hard to tell who is suffering the most.
This is a report which I have also found confirmed in a recent communication by the Bishops' Conference which complains about the fact that the rations supplied are, in fact, insufficient, while the food supply is adequate; that a large section of the city has been razed to the ground but that it is hard to tell who are, in fact, the people who have really been hit.
Surveys have been carried out, but the results of these are yet to be confirmed.
Fortunately, a stream of international aid has been set in motion, and the European Union has played a prominent role in this.
I feared that, in my speech here, I would have to pass on a few complaints, for they are obviously brought to my attention.
For example, I hear that all aid has to go via Kigali, and that the situation is being taken advantage of there.
On the other hand, I have been told that Kigali airport is the most convenient in terms of freight handling, and that aid is no longer being hindered at the moment.
I know that aid has been supplied by the Democratic Republic of Congo to Bukavu and that it has to leave from there. However, that aid is labelled as aid from the Congolese population, and the occupying forces therefore do not allow the goods to be distributed.
I therefore want to put your minds at rest in a way, but the measures announced by the European Parliament are absolutely vital.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would actually like just to further underline Mrs Maes' impressive description of the sufferings of the population, but I also wish to address a few other aspects, which perhaps have rather more to do with organisation and also with the political environment.
Organisational matters first: we hope that ECHO, the European Union with its aid, will no longer be hindered by anybody and will be able to get aid to the spot as quickly as possible.
We also hope that this applies not only to the city of Goma, but also to the area surrounding it, including Bukavu, where there are also refugees, and Rwanda and Burundi too, where refugees are also scattered.
We must give this aid, and quickly, to all those persons affected.
That is my first point.
The second point is that this again throws the spotlight on the weakness of the organised state and on its absence in the Congo.
The peace process needs to be firmly supported as soon as possible.
We have to help the various parties to see reason as soon as possible in order to facilitate reconstruction in the Congo, so that administrative, and also democratic, structures may be restored and so that this great country's descent into chaos may be halted.
A great task is before us, and the exemplary aid we are currently able to provide is perhaps an incentive for the various participants in the conflict to listen to the European Community and avail themselves of our mediation.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I of course agree wholeheartedly with my two fellow Members.
As you know, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in Goma, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is believed to be the most serious in central Africa for 25 years.
I would firstly like to pay tribute to the people - numbering between 300 000 and 500 000 - who initially fled Goma, but who are now returning because they are committed to their hometown.
We must bear in mind that this is a humanitarian and ecological disaster, which has occurred at a time when 80% of the farm workers had finished sowing their wheat and corn.
We must bear in mind that it is the most fertile agricultural land that has been buried beneath lava, which has flattened houses and destroyed public buildings, particularly those housing NGOs.
What is more, this tragedy has happened in a climate - as the previous speakers said - of violence and conflict in the Great Lakes region.
As well as this tragedy, I think that we must now fear, because of the lack of clean drinking water, a spate of epidemics, cholera and dysentery in particular.
We already know what this type of epidemic can lead to, particularly after the so-called 'tropical' genocide in which 50 000 people were killed in the same region of Goma.
There has even been an explosion - we have seen pictures of it - in a petrol station.
We have seen people looting and others leaving with jerry cans on their heads, going in search of petrol.
I think that all this is also contributing to the climate of insecurity, which we must tackle.
Although we can now welcome the fact that, as Mrs Maes said, the European Union has been quick to play a very active role on the ground, and that humanitarian aid has finally reached Goma, certain questions have, nevertheless, been raised and I think that we must try, along with the Commissioner, to provide an answer.
First of all, in 1977, the same volcano began to erupt.
It is deeply regrettable that houses were rebuilt on a volcano, whose embers were still so active.
This was one of the questions raised in Goma, but I am raising it here because of all the other similar situations throughout the world.
Houses are rebuilt in areas where similar disasters have already happened.
Furthermore, I think that this tragedy must encourage everyone to respect the requirements drawn up for the 'ten-year action against natural risks' and that the European Union must play a greater role in this.
Finally, we must seize this opportunity to compel all political forces, and particularly those that are at conflict, to guarantee that help is provided to displaced people and refugees.
The Commission and the Member States must play a more active part in the international ten-year action that I mentioned.
Lastly, since cooperation between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo is now being resumed, I think that we must push our partners to bring an end to conflict and to establish a fair and lasting peace.
I think that, at the very least, these conditions are necessary if we want to stop the same conflict from happening again.
We must bear in mind - and this is my final point - that other disasters can happen; we know, for example, that Lake Kivu contains huge methane resources and that the lava which is flowing into these waters risks is causing many other problems as well.
I thank the European Union for having taken swift action, but I would like to stress that we must step up our work and, through this, we can establish a fair and lasting peace.
Madam President, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano has demonstrated two realities which present a challenge to the whole international community in general and, specifically, for the European Union as well as the countries of the region.
The first reality is the extreme poverty in which thousands of people live, not only in this eastern region, but in the whole of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a poverty which is aggravated all the more by the war which has been devastating that country since 1996.
Figures have been presented: it has been said that more than 300 000 people need assistance, that 30% of the population is homeless and that 12 000 homes need to be rebuilt.
In this respect, the resolution we have approved this week, which establishes links between emergency aid, rehabilitation and the development policy, has been very timely.
The second reality is the hatred which has been brewing up between the people of the east and the neighbouring population of Rwanda, a hatred which has been demonstrated by the rejection by the people of Goma of the hospitality offered by Rwanda and the massive return of this population to their homes, which have now been taken over by the volcano, despite the risk of further eruptions.
These two realities should lead us to come up with a European Union strategy and action which involves us in this region.
It is clear that a good reconstruction policy is required for Goma, as well as a policy on forecasting possible new eruptions and control of the Nyiragongo Volcano.
Nevertheless, none of this strategy will achieve effective results unless the foundations for a democratic system in the country are consolidated, as well as a broad social consensus which guarantees stability and peace.
But that will be of no use unless there is confidence in that stability throughout the region.
It is therefore important that this inter-Congo dialogue which is restarting in South Africa in Sun City puts an end to this conflict.
We also believe it is important to organise a regional conference which reconciles the countries of the Great Lakes region and brings back the confidence which has been lost to its various peoples.
The resolution we are presenting is a collection of desires, principles and strategies which we wish to see applied in order to deal with the eruption of the Nyiragongo Volcano, without losing sight of what was said previously.
We support the global plan for 2000 managed by ECO and we ask that this plan, which is very important for the African region, and for the achievement of the objectives previously expressed, be speeded up and that this aid does not arrive late, which has unfortunately often been the case.
I should like firstly to respond to Mrs Maes' comment by referring to an ancient Greek saying: "ÃÃ­ÃŒÃ² ÃªÃ¡ÃªÃ¯Ãœ Ã¬ÃœÃ±Ã©Ã¡ ÃÃ°Ã¯Ã­ÃŽÃ¡Ã©".
That roughly means "one bad thing can easily lead to many others".
I am afraid this is the case in Congo.
The Goma office of the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office was directly in the path of the lava flow.
But a four-man team of ECHO experts, including disaster response and water specialists, was on the ground to assess needs within 36 hours of the eruption.
ECHO Flight, the Commission's humanitarian air service based in Nairobi, has been made available, bringing in the United Nations Disaster Assessment Team, volcano experts and other key personnel.
Joint assessments conducted by ECHO and the agencies on the ground resulted in the announcement of an emergency decision on Sunday, 20 January.
EUR five million is covering the immediate needs of 100,000 people. That is about one-third of the affected population.
Operations are focusing on four main areas: water and health, shelter and non-food items, food, and coordination and logistics.
The head of ECHO's Africa Unit visited the region from 30 January to 1 February.
The mission confirmed that urgent needs were being met and that effective coordination was in place.
What are our next steps?
First, the immediate emergency is now being managed by the agencies and resources already available.
Further in-kind donations and the introduction of new agencies should be coordinated with the agencies already on the ground, to avoid potential duplication.
After careful appraisal of the options, efforts should now begin to focus on balanced, medium-term assistance with resettlement of the homeless and the rehabilitation of essential social infrastructure.
Finally, concerning Mr Sylla's main point, the high media profile of this disaster should not distract our attention from the scale of the humanitarian crisis caused by five years' conflict in Congo, already ECHO's biggest customer - EUR 32 million in 2002.
The Commission would stress the need for an early and peaceful solution to the conflict through the implementation of the Lusaka Agreements and the Inter-Congolese Dialogue.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

Guantanamo Bay
Madam President, Commissioner, what has been going on in Guantanamo Bay?
That section of the European intelligentsia whose approach is still marked by naÃ¯ve optimism and which still believes that, after 11 September, we can respond to violence without using violence and to war without using weapons, has spoken out about the conditions in which al-Qa' ida fighters, captured in Afghanistan, were transported to Guantanamo Bay.
Let us try to imagine what would happen if, in the light of the tragic experience of the revolt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the Americans had not taken all the necessary precautions to enable these fanatical fighters to be safely transported; fighters who, for years, have been trained to seek martyrdom by carrying out acts of the most mindless violence.
Had they not been treated in this way and had they simply been collectively transported by aircraft, they would have become unbalanced and uncontrollable.
What is going on now in Guantanamo Bay?
All eyewitness reports testify that the prisoners are being treated well and that the injured are receiving all the care needed for their recovery.
So, why is this urgent resolution now being tabled, given the wave of solidarity that Parliament voiced unanimously after the attacks? The only possible reason is so that we can, in the name of fine principles and grand sentiments, distance ourselves from the war that the Americans are continuing to wage against international terrorism.
No, ladies and gentlemen, this war cannot be waged by applying international conventions, which were approved at a time when we needed to protect fighters engaging in traditional battles, and when civilians were not an automatic target, as they are now.
The war waged by terrorists against defenceless people renders all the Geneva Conventions null and void.
The essence of the war against terrorism resides, first and foremost, in collecting information, the aim being to prevent further attacks by infiltrating groups in order to destroy networks which, as we all know, still exist on our territory and in the United States.
This is what the Americans are trying to do at Guantanamo Bay.
We can only congratulate them on their efforts.
That is why our group will not be associated with the joint resolution tabled by other groups, but we will table our own resolution, which, in essence, calls for a revision of international law so that we can adapt to the conditions of the new era that began in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.
Madam President, military manoeuvres and Guantanamo analyses aside, mankind is on trial now, as are our willingness and ability to sustain a world in which the rules of law agreed a priori will prevail, because only then will we retain the moral and political right to judge everyone else who is indifferent to or tramples international rules of law underfoot, be they terrorists, the Taliban, anyone at all.
The European Parliament cannot demand any less than what is being demanded by various legitimate voices in the United States, at the UN and even in the European Union. By Mr Powell himself, by Mr Robinson, even down to Mr Solana.
The world cannot be governed by the law of the Far West, including Texas, or by the customs and habits of the town of Leeds.
Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands.
Because otherwise we shall end up, Madam President, with a world in which what we see is tragedy rather than cinema.
Ladies and gentlemen, and I appeal here also to my fellow Members on the other side of the House, when we rally against the death penalty, we are not defending the wretched crimes of some murderer or rapist.
We are defending ourselves, our perceptions and our culture.
It is for the same reasons that we are calling for the prisoners at Guantanamo to be treated as required under current international law or even American law, which cannot of course be limited to members of the Taliban who are American nationals.
This sort of discrimination is unacceptable even in the jungle.
Madam President, this resolution seeks to emphasise the essential point that the fight against terrorism, which will be long and hard, must be conducted as far as is possible in compliance with international law and the Rule of Law.
This call comes both from United States society and this House itself, which I hope will adopt the resolution.
With regard to the al-Qa' ida fighters held at Guantanamo Bay who were taken prisoner in Afghanistan, there are two problems.
The first is that of their detention, in that there are disturbing International Red Cross reports on the conditions in which they are being held.
The second is the legal status of the detainees: there is some uncertainty regarding this but the fact that John Walker, an American citizen, is being tried by a civil court while the other detainees are being tried by a secret military tribunal is there for all to see.
This is unacceptable.
General Morillon may well be right when he says that the Geneva treaties need to be updated, in that the Convention provides for the status of prisoner of war but, where such status is uncertain, provision needs to be made for the existence of prisoners of an undeclared war, for there is no reason why they should have fewer guarantees or receive less care in terms of respect for human rights as far as detention conditions are concerned.
The resolution also makes the important request that the United Nations Security Council set up a court responsible for Afghanistan, so that both the issue of the legal status of the prisoners and that of the detention conditions can be addressed.
In endorsing this request, we will be taking a very sensible step which will also help to advance the fight against terrorism.
Madam President, we have all seen the pictures from the base at Guantanamo Bay of the prisoners with their orange-coloured overalls.
The issue of how they are being treated has given rise to international concern.
We have protested in the European Parliament, and we are not alone in having protested.
Most countries - except, for once, Cuba where the base is situated - have in actual fact protested.
The fact that there have been no protests in Cuba may possibly be due to the fact that the Cubans are pleased that the focus has been shifted from the way in which they themselves treat their prisoners there, but that is not perhaps a subject for discussion right now.
There is some confusion about the legal status of the prisoners at the base at Guantanamo Bay, and this issue needs to be clarified by a competent court.
Such a court could be set up by a UN Security Council resolution.
Irrespective of what crimes and evil acts the prisoners at Camp X-Ray may have committed - and which we would vigorously condemn - the prisoners must be treated in accordance with international and humanitarian standards and principles.
Until such time as their legal status has been established, they must be regarded as prisoners of war.
The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Graham Watson, said yesterday in the House that we are actually in favour of a review of the Geneva Convention.
It would be good if newer and more modern rules could be established that could be applied to prisoners and to acts of terrorism in situations in which, as Mr Napolitano said, there has been no declaration of war.
It would be good if the whole Parliament could support this.
This Parliament supports the United States and the international fight against terrorism.
We have shown this very clearly through our vote earlier today.
When democracies engage in such a fight, they must however show respect for human rights and legal principles.
I therefore share the concern expressed by my fellow MEPs where the military courts are concerned.
It is unacceptable that just one Taliban - an American Taliban, John Walker - should be brought to trial before a civil court when others are to be tried before military courts.
We require that there be common rules and that everyone be treated in the same way and be given ordinary legal rights and legal protection in civil courts.
It should nonetheless have been possible to avoid a large part of this debate if the United States had ratified the protocol concerning the International Criminal Court so that there had been a permanent court in which people who had committed acts of this kind could also be brought to trial in accordance with international rules.
I would really urge the United States to ratify that protocol.
Madam President, Parliament must deplore in no uncertain terms President Bush's military order permitting the secret trial of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay by a military commission, which may adopt its own rules of evidence, judge and pass sentence.
This is outside American jurisdiction.
As has been pointed out by other speakers, the only American al-Qa'ida member so far captured is to be tried in a court in Virginia with full legal representation!
This military order breaches all provisions for a fair trial as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the US is a party, such as the presumption of innocence, choice of counsel, impartial and timely hearing, and the right of appeal to a higher court.
The US Government has introduced a category of unlawful combatants, an unknown term in international law, while refusing to grant the suspected al-Qa'ida fighters and Taliban troops captured in Afghanistan the status of prisoners of war.
These concerns have been highlighted by renowned lawyers throughout the world, who contest the legitimacy of forcibly taking those now detained in Cuba out of Afghanistan without any extradition order, as well as their status as combatants, and calls for them to be treated as ordinary criminal suspects with all associated rights.
We must also take into account the fact that some of these people, who are merely suspected of being al-Qa'ida supporters, have been deported from Bosnia to Guantanamo Bay.
The reports of ill-treatment of prisoners is absolutely shocking.
Nobody can deny what we have seen for ourselves on television, including reports that they have been shackled, hooded, sedated during transfer and their beards forcibly shaved.
This sensory deprivation is something that was criticised in Ireland in the past in relation to prisoners in Northern Ireland - even by our own government.
Yet everyone is turning a blind eye to what is happening in Guantanamo Bay.
We have to speak out in the interests of international justice, respect for human rights and respect for the Rule of Law.
America should abide by those international covenants as well.
Parliament would do very well to speak out and send a very clear message that we do not agree with the policy they have adopted.
Madam President, I fully support the USA in its handling of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay.
It is fully in the interests of Europe's citizens that the American security forces be allowed to interrogate these suspects.
This would not be permissible were they classified as prisoners of war under the 1949 Geneva Convention, since POWs are only obliged to divulge their name, rank and number, whereas unlawful combatants - their correct classification, in my view, according to the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Geneva Convention - can be interrogated.
I have to say to speakers on the other side of the House that a declaration or non-declaration of war is an irrelevancy under the Geneva Conventions.
The US needs to interrogate these individuals as it is an essential part of the worldwide struggle against terrorism.
The decision by the US to classify them in this way is, therefore, not vindictive but practical and necessary, but it exposes the inadequacy of the anachronistic international jurisprudence in this area.
Furthermore, it is my belief that many of these individuals are so dangerous that they would not have hesitated to attack their own guards.
If they became aware that one of their fellow detainees was likely to crack under interrogation, they would have made efforts to kill him as well.
The only possible alternative - beyond the physical restraints which were placed upon them, both in transit, when they might well have bitten their way through the avionic cables in order to down the planes, and on land - would be the use of high doses of intramuscular tranquillisers which, although effective, would have carried significant risks to the detainees and would have required medical and nursing personnel to accompany them.
There is no evidence that the Americans are treating them cruelly or inhumanely, and we should support them rather than engage in speculative and ill-informed criticism.
My concern is twofold: firstly, as regards what will America do with those it does not file charges against who, if returned to their own countries of origin, may face torture and death for reasons of unrelated Islamic militancy; and secondly, with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution, which suggests a role for the international criminal court, which has yet to get off the ground?
Unfortunately, as well-intentioned as this may be, my understanding is that certainly domestic terrorists, rightly or wrongly, are excluded from the Rome Statute provisions, but it may be that international terrorists could fall under its remit.
This is not clear at present.
I have a number of additional concerns about the ICC, such as command responsibility, which blames military commanders even if they had no knowledge of the crimes committed, and also the fact that amnesties and peace and reconciliation processes would become more difficult to achieve between belligerents.
Nevertheless, this whole area of jurisprudence ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, regardless of their situation, today millions of people have seen in the media the degrading conditions in which the prisoners have been transported and have seen on television the humiliating conditions they have been subjected to inside and outside the sadly famous cages.
It is not simply a question of condemning the attitude of the United States authorities, but also of rejecting the shameful comments made in the initial days by the base' s military commanders.
Some of them, in very bad taste, showed disdain and racism towards the prisoners.
A superpower which is not just a military, but also a civil, power should, in my opinion, set a proper example of respect for human rights, even if two twin towers had been destroyed for each of the 50 states of the Union.
Whatever happens, they should always show full respect for human rights.
Nevertheless, I hope that 11 September has not numbed American public opinion so much that it has become blinded and cannot react in a decent a dignified fashion within the United States itself.
In any event, many Europeans are prepared to remain vigilant, to remember that it is essential to maintain our values and principles in this war which we must wage against terrorism and fanaticism.
Or are we going to be prepared to renounce the values we claim to defend at this point in European construction?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that those who consider themselves the guardians of western culture, those who give the rest of the world lessons in democracy have proven to be the guardians of barbarianism.
We see them imposing embargos on Iraq, where they have killed thousands of children.
We saw them in Yugoslavia, together with their friends on this side of the Atlantic, killing civilians, flattening infrastructures and destroying the environment.
Barbarianism is a fundamental aspect of imperialism.
Mistreating any person is a crime.
Mistreating prisoners of war is an even more serious violation of international law.
And let there be an end to the discussion as to whether or not the detainees in Guantanamo are prisoners of war.
If the Americans were waging war on Afghanistan, then they are prisoners of war.
If the Americans were not waging war on Afghanistan, then the detainees have simply been kidnapped.
And they have been transferred to occupied territory on the island of Cuba on purpose, as a serious provocation to the heroic people of Cuba.
The Americans are making no secret of what they are up to with the backing of their friends, and unfortunately some of their friends are here in this Chamber.
They want the whole world to know what is in store for anyone who falls into their hands.
But, ladies and gentlemen, however terrible their barbarianism, it will not stop the march of history.
The people will see to that.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Gerardo Galeote, signatory, together with General Morillon, of the PPE resolution on this issue.
I have arrived late for this debate, but I have had time to listen to some speeches and I believe we should return to the basic issues.
I believe there are three basic issues: firstly, terrorism is the great threat to the Rule of Law and to open and democratic societies today; secondly, the United States and Europe share the same vision, the same social organisation and, of course, the idea that respect for human rights is the very cement of our organisation.
Thirdly, we must clearly state that, if the European Union flies any flag, it is the flag of respect for human rights.
On this basis, we clearly can and must raise our voices and, rather than ask, say, because asking would mean believing that the prisoners in the GuantÃ¡namo base are not being treated in accordance with humanitarian principles and the truth is that all the indications suggest that they are.
I am not going to enter into the argument about whether or not the Geneva Convention applies to them.
We in the European Union must say that, in the case of any doubt, the principles of the Geneva Convention must be applied, but that the Geneva Convention itself lays down a legal basis to resolve all those issues which may endanger the security of the organisation or the prisoners themselves, while a judicial tribunal establishes whether they have the right to protection under the Geneva Convention or not.
So far, Mr President, I have the impression that they are being treated absolutely correctly and that therefore this debate is unfocused.
This has probably been an error in terms of European public opinion - if not in terms of American public opinion -, a public relations error, because the truth is that it has been the United States itself that has published these photos which so offend our sensibilities.
We must clearly continue, and we will continue, to be vigilant, but always on the basis of the idea that we are fighting this war together.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is it that differentiates a Taliban-style regime from a democracy?
I believe it to be, above all, respect for constitutional legality.
Whatever the temptations to deviate from the path of constitutional legality, the fight against terrorism can only be carried on if the Rule of Law and also, above all, international agreements are respected.
The USA, then, should not even give the impression that that it does not regard international agreements, the Geneva Convention, and so on, as binding when it comes to the treatment of terrorist suspects.
That is also the reason for our resolution.
Let me take this opportunity to say something else.
The lady who spoke before me said that Europe and the USA have the same vision.
That is, unfortunately, not entirely true, as the fight against terrorism in which the Americans are currently engaged is not, from our point of view, a very effective one, although it is a fight against terrorism which, as such, we all support.
I might just say that the Americans had a highly ambivalent, not to say, sometimes even tolerant, attitude towards terrorism when it suited them, but, following those first fearful seconds on 11 September, they have, unfortunately, again left the path of multilateralism and of the quest for allies.
I do not want to defend any of the regimes of North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which differ greatly from each other.
Yet this simplistic way of lumping all these regimes together and making them out to be an axis of evil in fact demonstrates that the US government, despite Secretary of State Powell's very honourable attitude, is unfortunately taking an approach that does not effectively combat terrorism.
We know, for example, that there are several groups in Iran that are not very keen on going down the same road as President Khatami, his foreign minister, and his government.
We are also aware, though, that there are powerful forces in Iran in favour of going down this road, and I therefore believe that, no matter how unequivocal the fight against terrorism, we have to make it clear to the Americans that their way of fighting goes against constitutional legality and is not very effective.
Mr President, the Commission notes the various concerns expressed by many honourable Members at the legal implication of the United States decision to deny these detainees prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention.
We have all seen the photographs taken of prisoners detained at the United States military base in Guantanamo and have read reports about their treatment.
Despite the uncertainty about their formal status there has been no proof that the prisoners are not being treated humanely.
This has to be the fundamental question.
The European Union has a long-standing ongoing dialogue with the United States on human rights issues and in the field of justice and home affairs.
In the majority of cases there is agreement between the European Union and the United States.
But where we disagree, for example on the death penalty, we put our case and discuss our differences frankly.
I agree with those honourable Members who believe that this issue strengthens the EU's argument in favour of the establishment of an International Criminal Court.
We will continue to pursue this line of argument with our United States counterparts.
The European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Guantanamo.
We will do it carefully and will not hesitate to raise this issue bilaterally with the United States whenever appropriate.
I would like to conclude by repeating what Mr Patten has already said in the Tokyo Conference of donors for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Our main concept is justice for events, and this is the precondition to win peace as well as to win the war.
The case of Grigori Pasko and the closure of TV6 in Russia.
Mr President, it is an honour for a small group to be allowed to open the dance, as it were, and I would like to do so by saying that without freedom of the press, democracy cannot flourish.
The case of Grigori Pasko must make that clear to us.
It is a heavy blow to the freedom of speech in Russia, to a country born of perestroika and awoken by it.
It takes us back to the suppression of the free expression of opinion during the Soviet era.
Hence our criticism of it, for the accusation is still founded on the secret martial laws of the Soviet Union, which are not recorded even by Russia's Ministry of Justice.
In them, military personnel are forbidden to talk to foreigners.
They cannot even go shopping any more, as for a long time many of the traders in Russia have been from other countries.
That is why we have appealed to Mr Ustinov, the State Prosecutor-General, to review this case without delay.
We call to mind the case of Alexander Nikitin, whose appeal took sixteen months, especially bearing in mind the fact that Gregori Pasko is extremely poorly accommodated.
There are not even windowpanes in his cell, and that in winter.
Gregori Pasko does not want a pardon.
I wish to point out to the Commissioner that there are remarkable false rumours circulating about that.
This is not about an admission of guilt.
He is in the right!
He is within his rights to use freedom of speech.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner to tell Mr Patten that this topic must at last find its way into the discussions between the EU and Russia!
Mr President, certain Members of this House, and certain forces, tend to apply more stringent standards to a small country such as Madagascar, which we will be discussing shortly, than to a large country such as Russia.
We are, though, obliged to do the very opposite.
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and has a special partnership agreement with the European Union, so, on human rights issues, we must apply stringent standards to this country even if it is a powerful one and partnership with it is in our own interests.
The Russians signed up to stringent standards when they joined these organisations, and now they must meet them.
What has been done to Mr Pasko is therefore wholly unacceptable.
Mr Pasko is a person who has acted in the interests of the people of the European Union, Russia, and its Asian neighbours in warning of dangers menacing the Russian people and all of us.
As a Russian democrat, as an environmentalist, and as a human rights activist, he deserves our support.
He campaigns for freedom of opinion and constitutional legality in Russia, and so, in contrast to those who are trying to silence him, he is a patriot.
This case in particular, then, obliges us to speak plainly and to demand that Russia's secret laws, martial laws, and military courts should disappear and that Mr Pasko be set free, not by being pardoned, but by the utterly unfair and unjustifiable charge against him being withdrawn.
There is one other thing we must say loud and clear. There is a need to create the conditions in Russia for the restoration of nationwide independent media.
The closure of TV-6 is a scandal that cries out to heaven, and stands out as the conclusion of a coordinated policy engaged in by the Kremlin and by President Putin himself.
I therefore ask you to support this motion for a resolution.
Thank you, Mr President, in my country, we often say that it is beyond anyone' s comprehension.
I was very much reminded of this phrase during a recent incident at the Russian Kultura channel.
In a programme, the presenter recommended a recently published book on the position of intellectuals under the Stalin regime.
He had deduced very subtly that the publishers must have thought the time had come to reflect on almost forgotten survival techniques.
This is a discerning way of ridiculing the Kremlin' s authoritarian press policy.
However, the penniless directors at TV-6 have little to smile about these days.
Last month, their channel was taken off the air by judicial order.
In that way, the last, national, private channel, with its own independent reporting, disappeared in Russia.
More than half of the Russian population were able to receive the TV-6 programmes.
From now on, these citizens will have to rely on the two public channels, ORT and RTR, to provide them with information.
In short, the forced closure of TV-6 certainly spells a decline in the Russian press landscape.
The present draft resolution is therefore right to point this out.
Has TV-6' s fate now been sealed for ever?
No, for, next month, the Ministry of Press Affairs will decide on a new licence for Channel 6.
There is therefore a chance of this independent broadcasting channel being given a new lease of life.
Interestingly enough, the day before yesterday, it received public backing for this from the right and the left political opposition camps in the Russian Federation.
This option is definitely not the Kremlin' s preferred choice.
The leaders in Moscow much prefer the idea of turning Channel 6 into a special sports channel.
In their view, this also fits in perfectly with Putin' s new campaign for national fitness.
Whether watching television for hours will indeed produce a healthier nation is very much to be doubted.
With a view to the desired de-politicisation of society, however, it is an effective instrument.
This draft resolution also makes reference to the case against the military journalist Grigori Pasko - with very good reason.
The obvious link between his case and the closure of TV-6 is that both rest upon a shaky legal foundation, something which is not compatible with the fundamental principle of the Rule of Law in the Russian Federation.
This is one of President Putin' s basic principles, which we gladly share with him.
Given the expressions of endorsement conveyed by Russian society to Grigori Pasko and the editors of TV-6, there are surprisingly many more like-minded Russians.
This sober resolution is a welcome affirmation for them and is designed to ensure that justice prevails for Gregori Pasko personally and that press freedom in general is protected in Russia.
Mr President, Mrs Schroeder mentioned the case of Mr Nitikin.
The two cases involving Grigori Pasko and Igor Sutyagin are more or less identical.
Although Mr Pasko was sentenced in 1999, the Kaluga regional court has only recently acknowledged that there was no legal basis for his imprisonment.
He is still in prison.
This illustrates the Russia of today, Russia under Mr Putin, the Russia of Mr Putin' s friend, Mr Oostlander, who had us vote on a report on Russia - which I voted against - and in which we approved substantial funding of programmes for the media and for freedom of the media, for an independent judiciary and for the protection of the environment.
At almost every part-session, however, we have to remark upon the fact that, in these areas and in many others, things in Russia are not working.
This is the policy of the European Union. In other words, we are funding the fight to protect the environment and, at the same time, we have to fight to have environmental protesters released from prison and so on.
This is a ridiculous policy.
It is obvious that Mr Prodi' s concerns do not go much further than Gazprom and gas.
We all know this and I urge those who tabled texts to include a small oral amendment.
I also urge the Commission to express its strongest opposition to the Russian authorities.
I do not think that this is a matter for the Council alone.
Moving on, it is most shameful that we are not spending enough time discussing the situation in Chechnya.
Not a day or week goes by, however, when there is not an article on Chechnya in our newspapers.
I urge you to read the latest article by Mrs Politovskaya in 'Courrier International' magazine.
What is happening in Chechnya, which is still part of Russia, even though it should not be, is absolutely atrocious.
Of course, there are no pictures like those taken at Guantanamo Bay; there are no pictures but the situation is obviously much worse.
Madam President, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the cases of Grigori Pasko and the closure of TV6.
Against the background of our joint efforts with Russia to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has repeatedly made clear that it expects Russia to act in accordance with the values that it committed itself to respecting when it entered the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
These basic principles, including free and independent media, necessarily constitute an integral part of our partnership, underlying the strategic partnership that we are building.
Besides legal considerations, editorial freedom in Russia has suffered a number of setbacks in recent months.
This is a worrying development.
In addition, the Pasko case raises concern due to the dim and unclear circumstances surrounding his trial, including the lack of any public incriminating evidence.
At any rate, we will continue to use all CFSP instruments to support the causes of independent media and editorial freedom in Russia, including by raising all relevant cases in the framework of our bilateral political dialogue with Russia.
In addition, the Commission will continue to devote special attention to supporting civil society and independent media in the context of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, for which Russia will be a priority in the short and medium term.
Elections in Madagascar.
Mr President, the results of the first round of the presidential elections, which were held on 16 December 2001 in Madagascar, have been the subject of great controversy and conflict between the two leading candidates, namely the outgoing president, Didier Ratsiraka, and his rival Marc Ravalomanana.
It is claimed that Mr Ratsiraka has rigged the election results and his intentions remain a mystery.
He is not stepping down and his silence is leading to fears of violent actions being carried out by his supporters.
Although the Ministry of Home Affairs attributes only a small majority to Mr Ravalomanana, he is claiming to have won the first round and is calling for the second round to be cancelled.
However, the official results mean that the two men must face one another in a second round and the international community is hoping and praying that it will be organised.
Mr Ravalomanana appears to enjoy the support of the people, as hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in his favour, bringing the country to a standstill with a general strike and claiming victory over the opposition.
This strike is having disastrous consequences for Madagascar' s economy, and last week cost between USD 8-10 million.
The losses incurred, following 10 days of strike action, have already exceeded Madagascar' s annual education budget.
Let there be no misunderstanding about this.
This is not a question of us supporting one candidate over another, and I have no more sympathy for Mr Ravalomanana than Mr Ratsiraka.
What could be a cause for concern for the future are his autocratic tendencies, which came to the fore when he was the capital' s mayor, and if elected, Madagascar' s power would be in his hands.
Human rights supporters are becoming disillusioned.
But what we need, first and foremost, is respect for democracy and the Rule of Law.
That is why it is essential that the two candidates agree to the ballot being checked and that the High Constitutional Court agrees to compare the results.
This comparison is the only democratic means of establishing the real results of the ballot.
The Commission must do everything in its power to resolve this conflict, which is pulling the country apart, but also to help in establishing a genuine Rule of Law.
The conflict must be resolved with respect for human, political and civil rights, but also for political pluralism.
Respect for fundamental principles is essential in consolidating the democratic process.
Mr President, after the dark period of colonialism and dictatorships in the developing countries, I feel that it is positive that we are talking today about elections in these countries, even though their social and civil structure is weak, as is the concept of democracy.
It is difficult to distinguish between the parties, given that every culture and every society needs to select its own representatives.
I do feel, however, that we must reiterate the need for transparent elections, for we must promote the development of democratic awareness and culture just as we must promote the growth of civil society.
Moreover, through the instruments available to us, the Cotonou Treaty and the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assemblies, we must propose systems and methods of democratic control, ensuring they are appropriate to the current level of civil society in those countries.
We will be able to move forwards if we succeed in getting across the message that democratic growth, the safeguarding of human rights and the creation of a pluralist State - and therefore of consensus within a pluralist society - will enable this country to grow, for it needs so badly to be actively included among the world' s civil societies.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 25 January 2002, Madagascar' s High Constitutional Court published the result of the elections.
The slow procedure and the quasi-monarchic nature of the regime that has been in power for almost 20 years, which, in particular, had led Madagascar' s government to refuse the presence of international observers, and the ambiguities found in the public statements made by the opposition, sow more than a seed of doubt as to whether these results are reliable.
But are Madagascar' s leaders solely responsible for this parody of democracy?
Why was this country, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, not the focus of particular attention from international public opinion before these regrettable events occurred?
Have the countries of Europe, and France in particular, forgotten the past they share with Madagascar?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Madagascans do not need us to take them by the hand, nor do they need us to make electoral choices on their behalf. However, Europe cannot, under any circumstances, stand aside and do nothing.
In spite of the 'good behaviour' that the observers have emphasised - which is one of the Madagascan people' s defining characteristics - the situation is exceptional for this country.
More than 500 000 people take to the streets every day to demonstrate on a scale that has not been seen since the country gained independence. Madagascar has been brought to a virtual standstill by a general strike that is having disastrous consequences, and the support for which is as strong as ever despite being in its tenth day.
We cannot remain indifferent, given the serious nature of this situation.
We must therefore adopt initiatives to help the people of Madagascar to rediscover a dignified way of life.
And this will only happen if the second round takes place in a transparent fashion; in other words, if the international organisation and if the European Union ensure the elections are conducted in the proper manner.
We must demand that the two candidates show respect for the Rule of Law and safeguard civil peace so that the electoral problems do not escalate into an ethnic dispute.
We must quite simply call for the voice of the people to be heard and for their verdict to be respected.
Mr President, the Commission, which stands by human rights, respect for democratic principles and the Rule of Law, is particularly concerned and worried about the political situation in Madagascar.
Time is short and we are under pressure to monitor the elections, which are currently being prepared. The Commission will not be able to send observers for the second round of voting on 24 February because Madagascar was not on the Commission's list of priorities for 2002, including for reasons which originate in the country itself.
However, the European Union is prepared to support the election process and the Commission has decided to send a team of technical experts to the second round of elections in Madagascar with instructions to support a consortium of local observers.
Elections in Cambodia
Mr President, the elections in Cambodia, which at least represented progress by virtue of being the first local elections for decades, were preceded by an electoral campaign in which the media were manipulated by the ruling party and persons in positions of power, who exploited them for their sole benefit.
A tide of intimidation directed at the opposition parties culminated in innumerable violent deaths and mysterious murders.
That being so, these elections cannot be described as free in the true sense of the word, even though our colleagues have reported from Cambodia that the ballot itself seems largely to have been conducted in a correct manner.
We must, though, register the fact that there is still a great need for democracy to really take root in this country, which has been tested by adversity and has suffered more than any other in the world from the horrors of the twentieth century.
No other country in the world has seen a totalitarian rampage such as took place in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and so the wounds are not going to be healed overnight.
We must, though, nonetheless see to it that we apply clear standards and promote democracy and the Rule of Law - and that can only be done through the local communities.
I therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to systematically promote and support the newly-elected local assemblies, by which I mean not only the representatives of the ruling party but also those of the opposition parties, which must not be allowed to degenerate into fig leaves, but which are needed so that this first tentative step towards democracy may result in real democracy and not just a propaganda show.
We therefore need training and development for local politicians; they, their access to the media, and free media themselves, need to be fostered.
These need to be the priorities of our future policy on Cambodia.
Forces such as Funcinpec, too, as well as others, need to be promoted by us, so that a genuine and stable multi-party system may arise in this country that has suffered so much more than any other.
Mr President, the European Commission agrees with Parliament that priority must be given to supporting basic democratic institutions in Cambodia.
That is why we spent EUR three million in the form of technical assistance to ensure that the recent municipal elections ran smoothly and why we sent observers from the European Union at Cambodia's request.
The European Commission coordinated a total of 120 observers in Cambodia on the day of the election.
This is the first time we have sent observers for purely local elections.
I must say that I was especially pleased that Carlos Costa Neves headed the mission, as this shows that Parliament and the Commission are now working even more closely together on election observer missions.
According to initial reports, preparations for the elections and polling arrangements went smoothly and voters arrived peacefully and in an orderly manner.
We did, of course, receive reports of incidents of violence, murder and intimidation which are giving us serious cause for concern and which took place despite the fact that both the government and the other political parties stated they wanted no violence during the elections.
And we consider that media coverage of the elections was biased.
As the electoral process has not yet been completed, the results have not yet been announced and accusations and appeals have not yet been filed, it is too soon to draw any final conclusions as to how the elections passed.
But clearly, for the first time in its history, the people of Cambodia had the opportunity to vote for local councillors and they turned out en masse in order to do so.
The European Commission representation, together with European Union diplomatic missions in Cambodia, will continue to monitor progress in the post-election period.
Only then shall we be in a position to evaluate the full importance of efforts to ensure that this country continues on the road to democracy.
Eritrea
Mr President, we, who supported Eritrea' s struggle for independence, are alarmed by the changes in this country's governing authorities, while the tragic consequences of the recent conflict with Ethiopia are already causing suffering.
In September 2001, 11 members of the Eritrean opposition, including several former ministers who had published a letter calling for a return to democracy by the ruling party, were arrested by the government.
As well as the arrests, a ban, described by the authorities as temporary, was imposed on the private press.
The elections were also adjourned and the formation of new political parties was prohibited.
Journalists and Eritrean dissident politicians were gagged by the regime.
These repressive measures, which violate freedom of expression, are worrying and unacceptable.
They blatantly contradict the Eritrean authorities' proclaimed desire to undertake democratic reforms.
Furthermore, the expulsion in October 2001 of the Italian ambassador, who represented the European Union on the ground, severely undermined relations with Eritrea.
Yet, in order to enable relations between Eritrea and the European Union to return to normal, it is essential that human rights and fundamental freedoms be respected.
For this to happen, the Eritrean Government must not only release all political prisoners and journalists, but it must also lift the ban on all independent journalists.
That is why the European Union must re-examine its relations with Eritrea in the light of the Cotonou Agreement, Article 96 of which calls for an inter-Eritrean national conference to be held, bringing together the various political leaders and representatives of civil society, with a view to finding a solution to the current crisis and to setting the country on the path to democracy and sustainable development.
Mr President, Commissioner, I ask you to share the sorrow as well as the anger I feel in speaking as a friend of Eritrea.
From 1889 to 1952 Eritrea was under the flags firstly of Italy, then of Britain.
It was then given by the international community to Ethiopia in federation, and then it was annexed by that country.
It then suffered 32 years of war during which its economy and its environment were ruined and its people dispersed.
We then came to 1993 and its referendum for independence.
I was there as a UN observer.
There was a spirit of hope abroad in that country.
The refugees were returning, reconstruction was beginning to take place.
90% of people voted in that referendum.
99% voted for independence.
President Isaias was elected president.
With a moderate lifestyle and a period of optimism stemming from it, we hoped for the best.
For some years the problem was border conflict.
Now sadly the problem is internal.
Human rights have deteriorated, opposition is not tolerated, eleven former leaders of the government party have been arrested, the press is suppressed and journalists arrested.
The Italian ambassador has been expelled.
Multiparty elections which were promised for last December were cancelled and now parties themselves have been banned.
Democracy has been cancelled in Eritrea.
Eritrea is desperate for support in rebuilding a country ravaged by war.
They need our aid, but aid must not be without guarantees of good governance.
To our friends in Eritrea we say: "come back to the world community of democratic government.
Turn away from totalitarianism".
To the Commission I say: "be firm".
Human rights are not just for our benefit. They are not to make us feel good.
They are for the benefit of the people of Eritrea and Eritrea needs those human rights now.
Mr President, Commissioner, as the previous speakers have already said, the situation in Eritrea is becoming increasingly serious as far democracy is concerned. The Eritrean Parliament, which is made up of elected members who all belong to the People' s Front for Democracy and Justice, has decided to ban the formation of political parties.
The independent press has been suppressed and many journalists, politicians and political opponents, including former government ministers, have been arrested, accused of treason against the national assembly. There is an increase in repressive measures being taken to control the citizens, especially students, two of whom died while imprisoned in the desert.
The Italian ambassador has been expelled.
The state of the economy and of citizens' living conditions is becoming increasingly serious. The non-governmental organisations operating in Eritrea report situations which have reached hitherto unknown severity: even doctors, nurses and paramedics have been removed from hospitals and sent to the front, leaving the people with no health care at all.
The violence inflicted on the people, particularly women and children, is indescribable.
The international community cannot just stand by and watch.
We need to intervene as swiftly as possible to help define the borders.
The UN Security Council and the Algiers Commission have committed themselves to doing this, but we need a European delegation, a troika, to go to Eritrea and we need to reassess relations with this country on the basis of the Cotonou agreements.
We need to demand the announcement of parliamentary elections - already scheduled, moreover, for December 2001 - elections which must take place under international supervision. We must demand the release of all political prisoners, and that the freedom of the press, the freedom of association, the freedom to develop society and the freedom to form political parties and trade unions be restored.
All this must be an essential prerequisite if the Union is to resume the financing which is absolutely vital for the reconstruction of the country' s war-torn economy and for its development.
The Council and the Member States need to adopt a coordinated approach to relations with Eritrea which is as effective as possible and such as to contribute quickly to the process of achieving peace at the country' s borders and within Eritrea.
The ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will take place as of mid-March.
We hope that, at that forum, we will be able to debate the processes announced previously as having already taken place, and that we will be able to find a way to initiate a peace process with the Eritreans as well, to restore democracy and, most importantly, to restore to the citizens, men, women and children acceptable living conditions which are no longer shameful.
Mr President, before saying anything else, I would like to express my total mistrust of the present leaders of Eritrea and my absolute condemnation of their actions.
The situation in Eritrea is extremely critical, and we now have a better understanding of what prompted this people to go to war against Ethiopia.
However, the solution reached was not a mutually agreed solution but a concession obtained from Ethiopia, which won the war by military force.
Moreover, Eritrea brought down a regional resolution at the ACP Assembly of November 2001 by refusing to discuss the issue of relations between the two States.
With regard to the Italian ambassador, we should ask why he was expelled.
He was expelled for the 'crime' of conversing with Eritrean civil society rather than just with the country' s leaders.
Therefore, we must be resolute in addressing this situation, first and foremost in order to free the Eritrean people from the ruling power.
I feel that maximum effort and total commitment on our part will be needed to bring growth to civil society, to create a world that is civilised and not excluded from the assembly of the civilised nations.
That the Commission use the Cotonou Agreement to this end is not just necessary but, given the situation, its responsibility.
We cannot allow the situation in this area to persist.
Mr President, recent developments in Eritrea are causing the European Commission a great deal of concern, and we feel that arresting political protesters and muzzling the press are making the situation in Eritrea even worse.
It is good that issues such as the arrest of political protesters, the electoral law and the bill on political parties have been debated in the long-awaited gathering of the national assembly in Eritrea but we are, of course, sorry that no decision was taken on when detainees will be referred to the courts or released and that the formation of political parties has again been put on hold.
We hope that the committee set up to safeguard the future of the press in Eritrea will be able to help get the restrictions on the private press lifted soon.
The Commission is working with the presidency and the Member States, so that it can react in a forceful manner to the present crisis.
Without question, the whole endeavour is based on international law, human rights and human rights conventions and our efforts will be directed towards making sure that political dialogue with Eritrea continues and is reinforced within the context of article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
A visit to Eritrea by the high-level troika is being planned as soon as the report by the Boundaries Commission is published, hopefully within the next few weeks.
Because of the tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Commission believes that every effort should be made to prevent the conflict from escalating.
And the Commission needs to make an active contribution towards conflict prevention and the restoration of peace and stability in the area.
However, we need to tread very carefully and avoid any action which might leave the political leaders in the area with their backs to the wall.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in Turkey
The next item is the debate on 2 motions for resolutions:
B5-0071/2002, by Mr Van Orden, Mr Morillon and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group,
B5-0080/2002, by Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Figueiredo, Mr Papayannakis, and Mr Alavanos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
on the earthquake in Turkey
Once again, Mr President, Commissioner, tragic events have forced our attention on Turkey, following yet another earthquake recently.
I think we owe it to our neighbour to provide every type of assistance, financial, humanitarian and, I would add Commissioner, long-term assistance.
Our resolution says exactly what we are calling for and there is no need for me to comment on it.
What I would like to say is that, if you take a long-term view of the problem, because earthquakes are endemic in this area, you will soon see that we do not have a practical policy for earthquakes, a damage-limitation policy, a policy on repairs, assistance, anti-earthquake measures to protect us, the European Union and all its neighbouring countries, including of course Turkey.
However, we do have the means and the centres and the researchers and I wonder, Commissioner, if we are using them properly.
This is not the first time we have discussed this question and I should like to take advantage of this unfortunate incident to raise it once again.
Mr President, as a representative of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, which is Christian Democratic in character, I wish to express our deep and sincere sympathy with all the victims of the terrible earthquake in Turkey.
We would also express our sympathy to the Turkish Government and to everyone in Turkey.
What has happened shows that, despite all the conflicts of political opinion, the most important thing is still life itself.
It is important for the Turkish authorities and the EU to do everything possible to get aid through as soon as possible.
The events in Turkey highlight the need, at international level too, for some form of emergency force to respond to appalling natural disasters of this kind.
The fact is that the international TV companies are on the scene much more quickly than those of us from the European Union and those from various aid organisations.
Let us work to ensure that aid gets through more quickly.
In conclusion, I would just mention the fact that, the last time something similar happened in Turkey, there proved to be some coming together of Greeks and Turks.
Mr President, I should like to express my most sincere sympathies and undivided support for the Turkish people, hit yet again recently by another earthquake, with lives lost and extensive damage.
I hope that those who lost their loved ones and those who were left homeless or lost their possessions will soon find the strength to recover from the shock of this unforeseen disaster.
I should also like to mention here that the Greek government immediately expressed its support and sympathy and offered help to the victims of this catastrophic earthquake, and to pass on to the European Parliament just how much the Greek people sympathise with the suffering which the earthquake caused the Turkish people and how close it has brought them once again.
The spontaneous response of the people, especially when disaster and suffering strike, is the ultimate expression of sincerity and faith in coexistence and solidarity between nations.
I trust that in the future, in the very near future, these two nations, Greece and Turkey, will be brought closer by happy rather than tragic events, such as the accession of Turkey to the European family, the European Union, within which these two nations will enjoy and serve the same values and ideals of democracy and personal freedom, values and ideals which unite and safeguard their common desire for prosperity, peaceful coexistence and cooperation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that we all sympathise with and support the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and which, as a previous speaker said, is the second earthquake to hit Turkey in under two years.
Obviously, action to help the victims speaks louder than words of support and we have no choice here but to admit that there is no mechanism at European Union level to provide help in these and similar natural disasters.
And another thing: we could say of the area of Turkey which was hit that it is an area where poverty attracts misfortune.
If buildings had been built to earthquake standards, we would have had fewer victims. Even the director of the earthquake institute in Istanbul stated that there is no building control committee in the area to check that buildings meet specifications.
So let this too be an incentive to improve our earthquake defences.
Mr President, the Commission shares the European Parliament's interest in and concern for the humanitarian situation of the victims of the earthquake in Turkey.
I should like first to reply to Mr Papayannakis's question on dealing with natural disasters.
The Commission has already proposed, some time ago now, that a service be set up at European level to deal with natural disasters.
This proposal concerns not just earthquakes, but floods, fires and major accidents such as those which occurred recently in Austria and France, and makes provision for a first decision-making level resulting in a form of cooperation and proper coordination of national mechanisms, so that exponential results can be obtained from the mechanisms in the individual Member States for dealing with disasters.
As far as the specific question of the earthquake in Turkey is concerned, our representation in Ankara has assured us that the Turkish authorities responsible for dealing with emergencies have not asked for help and that no help with civil protection or humanitarian aid are required at present.
And that is after cooperation between the Commission and the government.
According to our information from the Red Cross, humanitarian requirements are being met relatively well.
The Red Cross has said that it is providing 7,000 tents and 10,000 blankets, as well as survival kits for families, and the government has sent 1,000 tents and 3,000 blankets for people obliged to sleep out of doors.
This is the situation so far, according to information from our representation and the Red Cross.
We therefore have no plans for the time being to assist Turkey under ECHO.
The Commission will monitor the situation in Turkey closely and will work with other donors so as to encourage a coordinated international effort so that priorities for action can be clearly defined from an orderly statement of the needs and problems of the area.
The debate is closed.

State of implementation of working time directive
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report: 'State of implementation of Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( 'Working Time Directive' )' (COM(2000) 787 - C5-0147/2001 - 2001/2073(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I am particularly honoured to present the report on the first five years' implementation of the working time directive.
Working times, like wages, have been one of the main subjects of employee claims throughout the history of industrial relations.
These claims and success with them are down to the trade union movement, because the arrangements which it has brokered have restored workers' dignity, improved their standard of living, reduced risks to life and limb and, by deregulating working times, given them time for a political and social life.
Despite the fact that health and safety legislation forms the legal basis for the directive, we must not underestimate its other aspects.
That is why the Member States must safeguard this acquis as the cornerstone of social cohesion.
At the same time, it is also why I have the right to express my disappointment in a number of states for their unwillingness to transpose the directive into national law on time, despite their self-evident obligation to do so.
I should also like to comment on the fact that the Member States have not provided detailed statements of national arrangements which allow the Commission to clearly assess if they are complying with the arrangements set out in the directive.
For example, it is totally unclear if and to what extent it applies to all public-sector workers.
Implementation so far has given rise to a series of disputes and/or straightforward infringements.
One of these issues is the issue of doctors on duty, although this links up with the more general issue of equating readiness to work with working time and, in this sense, it also applies to other categories of workers.
The ruling by the Court of Justice, whereby readiness to work requiring the worker to be present in the workplace and to have alert physical and mental faculties qualifies as regular paid working time, is in keeping with the traditional approach under labour legislation.
Another issue is the infringement of the right to leave where there is a limited contract of employment.
Here too, the Court of Justice's ruling that the right to leave is a basic right to which even temporary employees on a limited contract of less than one year are entitled will help in the fight against infringements.
A third point which deserves the Commission's attention is the woolly definition of maximum working time.
It is strange there is still controversy over the exact meaning of a definition which has applied for decades.
The transposition of the directive in certain countries in the form of collective agreements is also a major issue. This is a matter of general interest.
Without question this method, which promotes collective autonomy, must be encouraged.
However, it must be used in a way which produces the same results as it would if the directive were transposed in a legislative act.
This has not been the case in the past, either because sectoral collective agreements have been used, rather than a general cross-sector agreement covering all workers, or because there are no collective agreements which apply to all workers.
Finally, again in connection with arrangements under traditional industrial relations, there is the problem of special arrangements for specific categories of particular types of workers such as women, mothers, persons with disabilities, children etc. Special care must be taken with arrangements for these categories of vulnerable workers and an initiative must be taken to improve them in the light of past experience so that they can be integrated into the European Union's policy of increasing the number of women in work and making it easier for persons with disabilities to access the job market.
I should like to use the last part of my intervention to comment on what is to become of traditional arrangements following the emergence of new forms of work, where the principle of flexibility and traditional job security are being turned into employability.
We need courageous innovations here if we are to guarantee the principle announced at Lisbon of combining flexibility with protection and this principle needs to be translated into industrial relations by taking specific measures to organise working times.
If we are to replace traditional job security with employability, we need a new approach to working time arrangements because new problems are emerging, such as how to turn part-time employment into full-time employment, what to do about weekly rests and the ban on working on public holidays, how far to adjust working time arrangements where paid work is turned into self-employment, how to control the application of specific working time arrangements in the case of teleworking, what new balance must be struck between home life and work and, finally of course, how can we make time spent on lifelong learning count as working time.
In closing, I should like to add that the European trades unions rightly want to highlight all these issues relating to modern forms of work as immediate priorities in a widespread campaign which they are planning to start on 14 February to follow on from today's debate.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like it to be noted that I am speaking in place of Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, who has been the shadow rapporteur for this report on behalf of my group and who is able to attend this sitting.
On his behalf and on my own, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur and say that I am pleased with the work he has done and with the positive attitude he has adopted towards the amendments which had been presented by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
Directive 93/104/EC is a continuation of Directive 89/391/EC, on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, with the idea that the creation of the internal market must lead to an improvement in working and living conditions, by means of approximating legislations.
In this respect, the Commission' s report is a general description of how the Member States have transposed and applied the aforementioned directive with results which clearly indicate that the method and result could be improved.
It has been demonstrated that not only the temporary delay in compliance with the transposition period and, consequently, the non-application of the Directive within the time limit, but also that the exclusions and exceptions have been due to criteria which are not always clear.
Therefore, transposition, by means of collective agreement, has not always been accompanied by the desired success for this instrument of social dialogue.
The amendments presented by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez were aimed at highlighting and providing a remedy for these shortcomings and the amendments I am going to mention now have the same aim.
Amendment No 1, because the confusion between the concepts of 'exclusion' and 'exception' , which are always in the singular, must not become an opportunity to sidestep the mandatory nature of the directive.
Amendment No 2, proposing an additional clarifier, which is not intended to replace, but to clarify and extend the content of the paragraph, also by means of concepts and definitions which guarantee the application of the Directive, faithful to the idea that things should be judged by what they are and not what they are called.
We believe it is important to expressly highlight these two points for the sake of improving the living and working conditions of workers.
All of this must done in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, "Fair and just working conditions" .
Firstly, that "Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity" , and secondly, that "Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave" . Both aspects - health at work and working times - are clearly linked, and all of this is aimed at a more just society governed by the respect for the individual and collective rights of workers.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to compliment Mr Koukiadis on his report and thank him for the consideration he has given to the conclusions of the Committee on Fisheries, for whom issues of safety are a high priority.
Mr Koukiadis' report directly concerns only the first of what are now three directives on working time.
He pinpoints variations in interpretation, types of derogation and manner of transposal as contributing to defects in its implementation.
Such problems could be compounded by the fact that different rules apply to different sectors.
For example, fish processors are covered by the first directive but those engaged in fishing as such by the second.
It is difficult to predict the effects of this for two sectors that are so closely related to one another.
Similarly, potential changes in the nature of aquaculture may mean that different rules are needed for the future from those that fit its character today.
That is why we are asking the Commission to monitor these aspects of implementation in future reports.
It may be that there are other sectors for which a similar approach would be helpful.
It is desirable that individual sectors are covered by rules that are genuinely appropriate to their own particular situations.
However, many implementation problems might be avoided and quicker adaptation made to technological and other change if such rules could come out of agreements between the social partners.
We point to the agreement between the European Community Shipowners' Association and the Federation of Transport Workers in the EU as an example of best practice in this regard.
Finally, with safety so much at stake, we hope that the rules will become accepted as setting minimum standards to improve upon, rather than maximum ones to adhere to simply because that is what the law demands.
Mr President, I should like to sincerely congratulate the rapporteur on his extensive and critical work on this report on the working time directive.
It was indeed quite an urgent issue to be tackled, given the controversial discussions at the several sessions of the Court of Justice on this very matter.
Before I speak on a number of matters to do with the working time directive, I must say that I am very pleased that a couple of Member States have already implemented a huge number of different legislative, administrative and collective agreements in this regard.
I also feel that the measures taken by the supranational decision-makers go in the right direction, since the Commission's new directives cover the areas excluded from the scope of the original directive.
However, there is still a lot of work to be done.
We all know - and the rapporteur did well to criticise it - that some Member States resort to the tactic of claiming that their existing legislation covers the provisions of the directive.
I cannot understand, therefore, why they hesitate to implement a fairly flexible directive in the large amount of time available.
I therefore agree with the report's encouragement of the Commission to investigate why the Member States refuse to comply with some of the directive's provisions.
We should insist as well on controls on the conditions of application of the directive to new working-time patterns, for example, precarious work, part-time work and fixed-time work.
In addition to that I see a strong need to focus more intensively on the increasing number of homeworkers.
The Commission itself has made strenuous efforts with regard to open and distance learning within the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example.
I feel obliged then to ask you: why do we not give stronger encouragement to the social partners to negotiate the relevant working-time issues?
Nevertheless, the report could have gone further into detail, as it unfortunately neglects so-called self-employed workers.
I am convinced that the need to include this category within the directive is a matter we should all support and in doing so we should merely be adding further to a well-drafted report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the working time arrangements which we are examining here are part of the neo-liberal policy to reverse the industrial relations which the working classes have fought hard to achieve.
This policy undermines workers' rights by applying flexible forms of work and working time arrangements and undermines full and stable employment by replacing it with part-time and temporary employment.
The aim, of course, is to increase the level of exploitation of the workforce and maximum the profits of big business.
Which is why an attempt is being made to abolish the stable seven- or eight-hour working day and weekends off and why collective agreements are being ripped up and limited contracts are being extended.
Workers must be on standby whenever and for however long their employers choose.
In addition, making part-time employment the rule not only hits workers in their pay packets, it also makes it practically impossible for them to acquire pension rights.
The result of the European Union's policy is an increase in under-employment which, in some countries, already stands at over 30%.
We support a different policy, a policy which extends workers' rights and fights against capitalist restructuring.
We are fighting for the repeal of the legislative framework which imposes daily working time arrangements and flexible forms of employment.
We support full and stable employment, eight hours a day, five days a week, more extensive social rights and pay rises commensurate with today's needs.
Thank you, Mr President, EU citizens are very prosperous and enjoy the fruits of that prosperity.
This is expressed in the level of welfare experienced by them.
Consequently, the protection of employee welfare in an economic climate which centres on productivity and efficiency deserves all our care and attention.
Citizens' welfare is therefore served by sound legislation on working hours and hours of rest.
As an extension of the rapporteur' s approach, I should like to draw your attention to Sunday' s being a collective day of rest.
In my view, the rapporteur gives too little attention to the importance of this in his approach.
It is one of the tasks of the Member States, in line with customs and traditions in the Member State in question, to designate a day of rest.
I am delighted to note that in 9 of the 15 Member States, Sunday has been officially designated a day of rest.
These Member States have taken the order from Parliament in 1996 seriously and realise that a day of collective rest is of great importance to families, extended families and other social networks.
Research in the Netherlands has this week shown that consumers have little or no interest in shopping on a Sunday.
It is therefore of major importance that allowance be made in social legislation for the fact that Sundays are to be maintained as days of rest within the European Union.
To Christians, Sunday has the specific significance of a day of rest designated by God, which goes back to the day of Christ' s resurrection.
As such, this day of rest is deeply engrained in European culture.
After all, there is more to life than production and consumption.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission report before us is not merely necessary.
It will bring a great deal of work in its train in the Member States.
The rapporteur has taken a great deal of trouble about the analysis, and for that I am very grateful to him.
The directive strikes me, though, as something of a patchwork rug.
There are too many loopholes with national regulations crocheted in elsewhere, making individual interpretations possible and the whole thing impenetrable.
What is most fundamentally at issue is the protection of workers, a cause which we have taken up.
Both the Commission and the Member States, therefore, have to be urged not merely to adopt the definition and interpretation of particular concepts, but to check precisely on potential deviations from specific legal provisions, in order not to cause any confusion which might, at the end of the day, result in the opposite of what was actually intended.
Most uncertainty in the Member States concerns the maximum permitted working time, although clear limitations are laid down in Article 6, Article 18, and in the final provisions.
The possibility of also using collective contracts or agreements between the social partners to transpose the directive should be seen in a fundamentally positive light.
All that is needed is for this to actually happen, and when it does, it must be completely in the spirit of the directive, without a back door or the possibility of evading its provisions at a halfway stage.
It is also urgently necessary to reach a clearer definition of the concept of 'standby duties' , and, above all in view of the judgment of the European Court of Justice, to implement it completely along those lines.
The judgment in Luxembourg clearly brought out this directive's weaknesses, and it is regrettable that the Commission has to lag behind on this point.
The Koukiadis report will be a great help in the work in hand.
I hope we will actually find the points listed by Parliament still in the directive when the time comes to transpose it.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Koukiadis on his excellent report on the implementation of the working time directive and agree with the last speaker, who pointed out that there are loopholes in the working time directive, although these are being closed as time goes by.
I should like to remind the House that there have been significant developments over the last two years in connection with doctors' working times and in connection with working times in the fisheries industry, not to mention the recent directive on workers in haulage companies.
The Commission report on the implementation of the working time directive contains a general review of how the Member States implement the directive.
The Commission is not obliged to publish this report but we felt, politically speaking, that it was conducive to greater transparency and openness.
This means, as Mr Koukiadis rightly pointed out, that the transposition of the directive varies hugely from one Member State to another.
Here too, we must to admit to the need to reconcile economies and societies with very different customs and practices, which is why the agreed framework is flexible and does not insist on uniform, inflexible solutions which it would be impossible to put into practice and which would make it hard to even agree on a framework.
The Member States have been given considerable room for manoeuvre in transposing the directive.
The directive allows a number of exceptions based on legislation or collective agreements, thereby giving the national authorities the flexibility I have already mentioned.
The Commission is happy with this multi-faceted approach and has no ambitions to push for uniform solutions in this sector.
However, I should like to comment on a number of specific recommendations made to the Commission.
The report calls at various points for the Commission to monitor transposition and take the necessary steps if the directive is not transposed correctly.
We are in agreement here and the proceedings available to us when Community directives are infringed have already been instituted or are due to be instituted in the cases referred to.
As regards the definition of working time and the implications of the ruling by the Court of Justice in the Simap case, which found that the time spent on duty by medical staff in first aid teams counted as full working time, the Commission is examining the implications of this case and has already held a meeting between the national authorities and the Commission services and is planning to schedule a study of the legal situation and the implications of this ruling on health systems and other sectors.
The European Parliament report also calls on the Commission to clarify where exceptions are justified on the basis of industrial agreements.
There is a clear reference to the specific term in Article 18(1) allowing the Member States to deviate from the upper limit of 48 hours, provided that the worker is happy to work the extra hours.
Here too, I should point out that there are safety valves to avoid measures and implications which are unacceptable to the worker.
The only country to have made use of this exception is the United Kingdom.
The same directive stipulates that the Council must review this provision at the Commission's proposal, accompanied by an evaluation report.
And I can assure you that the Commission will be submitting the evaluation report in question.
I should also like to stress that the national authorities in every Member State will be filing national reports in 2002, analysing the practical implementation of the directive in question.
The Commission will use these national reports to draft a summary report on the implementation of the directive in the Member States, which will give us a clearer picture.
I should like to close with a few comments on new work models.
Obviously it is hard to apply traditional working time to new forms of work and the debate on lifelong learning and time compression is a major issue.
What I can say here is that social dialogue is already playing an important part and will play an even more important part in the future.
The social partners and their discussions and agreements on the role of lifelong learning and the principles of teleworking and the agreements already reached in specific sectors demonstrate that, in the initial stages, individual agreements at European level can create the right conditions for moving forward, if necessary, to a legislative framework.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Stimulating Internet access
The next item is the oral question (B5-0003/02), on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission on stimulating Internet access.
Mr President, I should like to welcome Mrs Diamantopoulou here this afternoon.
I know she will be speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen.
We are obviously disappointed that he is unable to be here.
We understand the pressures on the time of Commissioners.
We know that across the Commission there is great interest in this subject and, in particular, in a number of the areas for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is responsible, this issue will also be of crucial importance.
The thrust behind our question - which is tabled at a timely point in the run-up to the Barcelona Summit - is that the need across the European Union to deliver access to information society services and to encourage the climate in which new services will develop has to be at the foundation of the Lisbon goal to deliver the most competitive knowledge-driven economy in the world.
I emphasise "knowledge-driven" because what we are talking about is the ability to achieve the widespread dissemination and availability of that knowledge.
Part of the problem with this topic is the whole issue of jargon, and our question perhaps falls into that trap by talking about flat-rate Internet access.
Perhaps colleagues will bear with me if I just set out why that is so critical.
If the Internet is really to deliver its full potential as a global knowledge network, as an instantly accessible medium, then we have to encourage people to use it in such a way that they become detached from the feeling that, with a time-based connection, they have to hurry through what they are doing, that the facilities are not always there and available to them.
That really is what this is all about.
It is making that huge library of information and services available in such a way that people can have continuous access to it at a price they can afford.
That is really at the heart of this question.
We know that quite a lot has moved forward.
I am pleased to have been a member of the teams in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which have worked very hard with the Commission to push through directives on matters such as the unbundling of the local loop and the whole of the electronics communications package.
We understand our role and responsibility here.
The ultimate delivery of these services will have to come from the marketplace.
It has already happened successfully in mobile telephony; it is already happening now in the marketplace as new investment is going in.
However, we have to encourage investment in the backbone capacity that will carry these services and encourage people to develop the new services that will take advantage of that increased capacity.
What we are talking about is moving from the relatively small knowledge pipelines that are coming into our houses and our businesses to much larger pipelines of knowledge.
New services will be delivered with them.
For example, a full-length movie will be delivered in seconds rather than hours, as it is at the moment.
In conclusion, we look forward to hearing how the Commission is going to encourage that development of fast Internet access, how it is going to stimulate that provision across the Member States, what further action may be necessary, and what further support we can give to this crucial aim for the future of the European economy.
My special thanks to the honourable Member; this is indeed an exceptional issue which is a top priority not just in the European Parliament and the Commission but in each individual portfolio, because an electronic Europe is at the top of everyone's agenda.
The summit in Lisbon called for cheap, high-speed networks for accessing the Internet.
For reasons which you yourself explained, this is the cornerstone of a European knowledge-based economy, the cornerstone of policy for a Europe of justice, equality and inclusion.
As you state in your question, Internet access charges are an important factor.
There is the matter of flat-rate charges for access - as you quite rightly said, there is a problem of terminology and how to translate terms into all the languages and I have to say here that there were words which I recognised in English but not in Greek - so, flat-rate charges for access based on flat-rate connections by Internet service providers and the new telecommunications companies which have taken over the networks of the former monopolies.
The national regulations of four Member States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and France require the former monopolies to provide all market factors with flat-rate Internet access.
This is known as the FRIACO principle, which means Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination.
This service will soon be up and running in Italy too.
The industry maintains that FRIACO results in increased use of the Internet and, because there are no time charges, users spend more time on the Internet and become Internet literate.
It also maintains that, with all these FRIACO services, consumer demand for broadband access and services is increasing.
The Commission welcomes the decisions by the regulatory authorities in the Member States which I referred to earlier and encourages the use of this model in the other Member States.
The Commission's support and encouragement take the following forms: first in the open network provision committee, the forum chaired by the European Union, in which the regulatory authorities and the ministries of the Member States are represented in their advisory and regulatory capacity.
This issue will again be on the agenda of the open network provision committee at its meeting on 20 February 2002.
Secondly, in the seventh publication on the application of the package of regulatory arrangements in the telecommunications sector which it submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in December 2001 and in which it specifically supports flat-rate narrowband Internet access as a gateway to broadband access.
Similarly, as you too mentioned, binding decisions have been taken within the wider context of the continuing implementation of the e-Europe action plan.
The Commission is also making sure the regulation on unbundling local loops is applied correctly.
Unbundled access to local loops allows newcomers to compete with established service providers by providing high-speed data transmission services and constant Internet access using digital subscriber line technology.
The Commission also referred to this aspect of high-speed Internet access in its seventh publication, together with the provision of equal access to high-speed Internet access services retailed by established service providers.
The Commission is also encouraging guaranteed fair and equal terms for the provision of short leased lines which take costs into account.
These are another form of access to the Internet and are important mainly to small companies and companies using the data services of newcomers to the telecommunications market.
So the Commission is clearly operating at two levels.
On one level it is backing specific cooperation policies and the use of models which are already a success, and I have said how, and on the other level it is monitoring the application of binding decision such as regulations which, of course, play a very important role.
As far as disseminating and consolidating broadband technology is concerned, the Commission acknowledges in its report to the European Council in Barcelona that this technology is not at present being provided and used by the Member States as quickly as we would expect.
This being so, the Commission has proposed to the European Council that it set a target date of 2005 for the provision of broadband technology throughout the European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Rail freight in the Channel Tunnel
The next item is the joint debate on:
the oral question (B5-0004/02) by Mr Savary and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission on rail freight in the Channel tunnel;
the oral question (B5-0005/02) by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to the Commission on rail freight in the Channel tunnel.
Mr President, since 7 November the SNCF has suspended all cross-Channel rail freight services because of fears for the safety of its staff at Calais following threats from those seeking to enter the UK illegally.
As a result, Channel Tunnel freight services are now in a state of deep crisis.
However, we are pleased today that both French MEPs and British Labour MEPs have pushed for a debate, and indeed that the ELDR Group has joined us in calling this debate this afternoon.
We need cooperation, not conflict, to resolve this particular problem.
No more naming and shaming, no more buck-passing; we need the British government, the French government, the SNCF, Eurotunnel, EWS and others to start working together more effectively.
A lot has been done, but there is a lot to do.
Added to my list is the European Commission.
Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty and Regulation 2679/98 guarantee the free movement of goods.
That means free movement through the Channel Tunnel.
I thank the Commissioner for intervening in this particular crisis and for responding positively to requests from myself and others.
In the past few days a security fence has been built and we welcome that.
But policing is still only between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.
We hope to be able to persuade our French colleagues of the need for 24-hour policing and adequate police numbers.
We need the SNCF to resume services as soon as possible and we need urgent modifications to locomotives to ensure they do not need to stop at Calais purely for technical reasons.
These are practical measures that will make a big difference in the short term.
We hope you, Commissioner, will continue to act to ensure that this vital link in the single market is restored.
Mr President, the Commission is worried about the fall in rail freight due to security problems at the SNCF station.
This situation is having an adverse impart on the distribution of freight transport services between the modes of transport on this important route.
This is damaging rail transport and runs counter to the Commission's collective view of the role of rail transport, as set out in the White Paper presented in September 2001.
The partial suspension of rail traffic through the Tunnel is reducing the use made of its potential and, as a consequence, the return on the investment in this vital European transport infrastructure.
The Commission has been fully apprised of the situation since it emerged in November.
In application of Regulation No 2679/98 on the free movement of goods, the Commission services asked the French authorities to take all the necessary measures to restore the smooth flow of traffic back in November.
They also asked for regular reports on developments in the situation.
According to our most recent information, the situation has improved slightly.
The police are patrolling the area, rail capacity has been increased, where possible, from 1,200 to 1,600 tonnes.
Work on the Frethun freight terminal started in December and a reinforced fence is expected to be completed at the beginning of February.
Security installations on the site, such as video cameras and heat detectors, will be in place by the end of June.
Contacts with the French authorities will be maintained, Commissioner Bolkestein has suggested meeting his French and British counterparts and the ministers responsible for the internal market in order to discuss the matter on the fringe of the next Market Council on 1 March.
Our objective is to restore the free movement of goods by June at the latest, once all the work on the terminal has been completed.
My last comment refers to asylum and external border controls.
The policy of the Union and the Member States on asylum and external border controls is also in jeopardy.
The Commission believes that approving harmonised rules will help stop certain Member States from being more attractive than others and it has already tabled proposals along these lines.
Mr President, we used to have a joke in the United Kingdom about there being fog in the Channel and the continent therefore being cut off.
Now it seems more a case of people loose in the Tunnel and trains and trade cut off - which is altogether more serious.
The effects of the restrictions are very damaging to free movement and employment: thousands of jobs are at risk.
I have to say that for those affected, removing the restrictions by June sounds a very long way off.
The problem is the proximity of the Sangatte camp for refugees: it is too close and should be moved, and makes policing very difficult.
This Tunnel is an asset and enterprise which is jointly owned and benefits both France and Britain, as well as the wider Community of Member States.
It is probably the single most important physical link drawing Britain and the continent together.
The difficulty of policing illegal immigrants is damaging to this process and must be resolved soon.
I call on the Commission to press the French authorities to take action.
I call on the United Kingdom government to offer more assistance to its French counterparts and to the hauliers and businesses concerned, rather than seeming to turn a blind eye to their concerns and difficulties and spending more time harassing truck drivers and train operators with prosecutions and fines.
The authorities need to take action and not take it out on other innocent parties.
Mr President, firstly, I should like to pay respect to my colleagues Mr Watts, Mr Savary and Mrs Darras for bringing this point to the House for our consideration.
It is ironic that I speak on this subject because, as a rapporteur, I helped push through this House the issue of free movement of goods at border areas where there was disruption.
Primarily it was meant to attack the issue of industrial relations at borders.
But this is interesting: I praise and applaud the Commission's lateral thinking about the application of these articles that have been laid before them.
I knew then, as I know now, that the requirements set down in that particular set of articles were merely mechanistic, that it comes down to political goodwill.
People here today will appreciate that it requires all parties to pay attention to what is happening at the Channel Tunnel and to make sure that they do not allow it to be obscured by the mere arguments, cultural or political, that exist there.
There are problems.
In this particular issue there are problems of slender resources - we understand that - whether of the police or of security personnel at the areas where they are involved.
But we need to get freight through unfettered.
Let us also recognise that this is an international problem.
People have been displaced as a consequence of wars and of major disruption and there are also economic Ã©migrÃ©s who will pay any price to get into the UK.
Quite often it is a price paid to criminal gangs, there to exploit the motivation of these people.
Real solutions, therefore, lie in the hands of politicians coordinating their actions at government level.
Peace and development in the areas of the world facing crisis are also what we must strive for.
In France we have also seen, all too unfortunately, human tragedy that has left in our minds the human aspect of all that is going on there.
The attempts of the French authorities to tighten security are welcome.
The highest level of vigilance must continue to be demanded, as Mr Watts has said.
Attending to this question in the House confirms the international status and interest which it deserves.
Not just the Channel Tunnel, but other issues as well, will be resolved by such processes.
This gives us just such a platform to launch that process.
Mr President, first of all I would be grateful if Commissioner Diamantopoulou would convey to Commissioner de Palacio my personal thanks for the work that I know the Commissioner has already undertaken in this regard.
Coming from one of the more remote parts of Europe, namely Scotland, it is so important for us to be connected with the centre.
The problems we face at the moment are acute.
I refer to exports and the logistical problems that are being created, as well as the problems for the rail freight companies generally.
What is an acute problem could, if matters are not dealt with properly, become a chronic one.
Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already referred to the fact that what is happening with the Channel Tunnel is counterproductive to the policy which we all want to see pursued, namely that of getting freight on to the railways and off the roads.
Given the present situation within the United Kingdom, the difficulties that it has in exporting and the railways there, and looking to the future of the whole transport policy of the European Union, I sincerely hope that as much pressure as possible can be brought to bear from all quarters to get this problem resolved as quickly as possible.
Mr President, I follow Mrs Attwooll as one of the other Members for Scotland in this House.
I am very grateful to Mr Watson and to the Liberal colleagues who put forward the questions which promote this debate today.
It is a vital debate.
To try and make the point Mrs Attwooll was making yet more vivid, 30 miles away from the house in which I live in Edinburgh, midway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, at the town of Motherwell, lies the most northerly freight outpost of the trans-European network into the United Kingdom, the Motherwell Eurocentral depot.
We have been told in recent weeks that the carrier out of that port, EWS, will not be able to afford to continue providing a service out of Scotland at the current available number of trains per day.
It would be a crisis for Scotland, and therefore a crisis for transport across the Union, if that happened.
It is well known, for example, that the Scotch whisky industry depends heavily on rail freight to get malt scotch and blended scotch into the European market.
Heavy losses are being made on a vitally important trade.
In these circumstances it is encouraging to be told that the Commission takes this matter seriously, but it is not encouraging to be told that all will be well by June, because the information we are receiving from the commercial parties involved is that they cannot last until June at present levels.
This is a time when people throughout the European Union people are asking themselves the question: Do we obtain the benefits which we are promised from our membership of the European Union?
These benefits particularly relate to the opportunity to trade freely across the Union.
Other benefits which have been promised are those arising from intermodal transport - that not everything should go on the roads.
That affects not just people in Scotland; it even more affects people down the motorway routes through England, if far too much heavy freight traffic goes down there.
We need traffic on the railways.
We also need traffic by sea.
We are very grateful to Commissioner de Palacio for the work she has put into securing the new ferry link between Scotland and Zeebrugge, but if we are going to have a sensible transport policy which really does spread the load and save the roads from excessive use by heavy traffic, we must have this railway line kept open.
I am grateful to colleagues who have raised this question.
I am grateful to the Commission for taking it seriously; but I want to know as well what compensation will be available to ensure that those who have lost money are not prevented from trading altogether by the uneconomic conditions now prevailing on this route.
Mr President, the free movement of people, goods and services - one of the cornerstones of the internal market - is in various ways at stake in this matter.
The free movement of people, but also of goods, should not lead to the unverifiable movement of asylum seekers as a result of open borders.
Untenable situations have arisen at the Eurotunnel caused by stowaways on trains.
As a consequence of this, restrictions have been in place for three months now, as a result of which the volume of goods by rail through the tunnel has at least halved.
This loss of turnover causes disproportionate damage to the Channel Tunnel operator, who is not even certain that the sanctions for stowaways are now in place.
The discussion on the White Paper on transport policy is in full swing.
Despite all the differences of opinion, almost everyone involved is agreed that the growth in the transport of goods must not unilaterally end up on the roads.
Rail, in addition to water, is a sound alternative.
The restricted use of the Eurotunnel has forced many companies to transport goods by road for the time being.
There is a fear that, once again, the reputation of rail transport will incur lasting damage.
In order for transport capacity to recover, the underlying problem has to be solved.
This is not the place to discuss the problem and tragedy of illegal immigrants in Europe.
However, the asylum policies of the two countries on either side of the Eurotunnel is undeniably responsible for the drastic decline in the transport of goods by rail though the tunnel.
The United Kingdom has to contend with the dubious reputation of pursuing a flexible immigration policy and of hardly fighting illegal employment.
Whether this is an accurate description or not, the British government fails at any rate to discourage refugees.
On the other hand, French asylum policy can be referred to as being two-faced.
The large stream of refugees via France is not stopped until they reach the Eurotunnel and are held at the camp near Sangatte.
This amounts to a concentration of hundreds of desperate people only 3 km away from the Eurotunnel, the gateway to England, their country of destination.
Locked up in a camp within walking distance of the gate to the other side. Surely this is tantamount to leaving the fox to watch the geese!
Asylum seekers deserve our sympathy, for they too are ultimately the victims of ambiguous rules, random implementation and inadequate inspection.
It is high time that the French authorities detained the asylum seekers in France, for example near an international airport, from where, upon being refused admittance, they can return to their own countries.
The sad images from Frethun require both the Commission and the Council to do everything in their power, not only to remove this impediment, but also to tackle the cause.
They must not be allowed to shirk their responsibilities while the market for the transport of goods is being disrupted in this way.
Mr President, I am truly perplexed by the oral questions tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the disrupted Channel Tunnel rail freight services. This disruption was caused by refugees trying to enter Great Britain illegally.
Judging by the oral questions tabled, the main, or even the only problem, is that of the disruption to the freedom of movement of goods through the Channel Tunnel, and therefore the losses incurred by rail freight companies which could be exacerbated - I shudder at the thought - by unfair competition between the various methods of transport to the detriment of the railways.
Like my fellow Members, I strongly regret the losses incurred by the rail freight companies and I would even add that, in my view, it is illogical that France, whose socialist government bears the responsibility for this matter, is not severely punished, morally and financially, for its inability to maintain public order.
However, I would also like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that this matter poses much wider and much more serious societal problems than just unfair competition between private operators.
That is why I will add a set of additional questions to those tabled by the PSE and ELDR Groups.
First of all, some of the people who attempt to enter Great Britain illegally are asylum seekers, but some are illegal immigrants, even in France.
How do many illegal immigrants manage to reach the heart of Europe, having passed several internal borders, without being noticed?
This is a fundamental issue that should be resolved.
Furthermore, what measures are being taken to immediately escort these illegal immigrants back to the European Union' s external border?
My second question refers to the fact that a large number of asylum seekers who attempt to enter Great Britain are from Afghanistan.
However, as far as I know, the Taliban regime has now been eliminated and these people can return home.
What measures are therefore being taken to repatriate them?
My third and final question refers to some people's belief that if we had a single European asylum policy, we would not have such problems.
Of course, this might mean that refugees would no longer receive unequal treatment in different European Union countries.
But does the Commission think that the overall number of asylum seekers would go down?
If it does, how exactly would this be achieved?
On the other hand, this might mean that if the European asylum standards were aligned at a high level - which is what the Commission regularly states it intends to do - the overall number of asylum seekers in the European Union would significantly increase.
Mr President, I join my Scottish colleagues in asking the Commissioner to help us to resolve this situation as urgently as possible.
It may surprise the Commissioner to have such a representation from Scotland, but Scotland is probably one of the greatest victims of this situation in the Channel Tunnel.
Because of the reduction in transit through the Tunnel, we do not have a mere three services a night - we have none, because the service from Scotland to the continent has been withdrawn completely.
As Mr MacCormick said, it is no longer possible to transport Scotch whisky to the Continent or to send our microcircuits to Paris, Frankfurt or Milan.
But more than that: it is no longer possible for us to import parts and continental products by train.
Costs for both exports and imports are increasing, as are road congestion and pollution.
A service which did something to bring Scotland closer to the golden triangle of Europe has been lost, and so Scotland returns to the periphery.
This is a tragedy, and why?
Because we seem incapable of organising our immigration systems on a European basis and of providing adequate security to ensure that any such arrangement works.
Clearly there are faults on the French side of La Manche and on the English side of the English Channel, but the victims are my constituents - hundreds of miles from Dover and Calais - in Scotland.
I call upon the UK government to resolve its immigration system, in collaboration with its neighbours, so that it does not attract tens of thousands of desperate people.
It is surely not coincidental that the UK is one of the only European countries without identity cards.
I call upon the French authorities, from their old allies of the Auld Alliance, their Scottish cousins, to enforce real security at their end of the Tunnel so that the rail freight service to and from Scotland can be resumed.
I call upon the Commissioner and the Commission to knock all their heads together urgently in order to reach a solution to this absurd state of affairs.
Mr President, I apologise for my late arrival and I would like to thank you for rescheduling my speech to a later time.
The reason why we tabled this question is because the public sees the problem at the Eurotunnel site - since it involves two large European countries and also since it concerns our security and asylum policy - as requiring intervention by the European Union.
We cannot let this situation rumble on, as it would then illustrate Europe' s lack of power.
This situation also implies that we have envisaged solutions that can be applied to other borders and to other locations that are under pressure from migration.
We are therefore calling, since the asylum policy and judicial and security policy are not sufficiently harmonised, for the Commission to work with France and Great Britain so that strong measures can be taken in three areas.
The first area is to re-establish, as far as possible, the freedom of movement, particularly that of rail freight in the Channel Tunnel.
What is happening, despite considerable investment by the rail operators and the SNCF in particular, contradicts our policy of moving towards using rail rather than road.
The second area is that if we fail to harmonise security legislation and mechanisms, we must take coordinated and coherent measures in the two countries to combat those involved in human trafficking, by increasing controls and introducing stiffer penalties, as this activity constitutes an intolerable attack on human rights and is a shameful trade.
As far as the third area is concerned, what is happening at Eurotunnel demonstrates the urgent need to harmonise Europe' s asylum policy.
This is because what is happening there, and what France and England are being remonstrated for, is a problem which may concern all European Union countries in the future.
We know, thanks to the experience of what is happening throughout the world, that there will never be a perfect and wholly reliable solution, given the disorder in the world and the growing disparities between North and South.
The first and most important solution, the fundamental solution is, of course, to have a much more generous and more balanced development policy.
However, since we do not have this and as a short-term measure, I think that we must implement common measures in the two countries, so that we can ruthlessly track the people who trade on illusions - human traffickers, in other words.
I think that this is very important.
Lastly, I personally hope that, rather than leaving the these two countries to face their responsibilities alone, we find, with the help of the Commission, measures which are strong enough to be held up as an example and that can be applied to other locations in Europe.
Mr President, clearly we are having trouble applying one of the basic principles of a free Europe, the principle of the free movement of goods.
Numerous approaches have been voiced, from the possibility of invoking articles in the Treaty to intervention by the Commission to persuade the French government to act more quickly.
The current legislation of the European Union allows the Commission to institute infringement proceedings against a Member State found to be obstructing the free movement of goods.
However, these proceedings are subject to strict criteria when the obstacle is created by a few private individuals and the Commission can only act if the authorities in question fail to take the necessary measures.
This clearly does not apply in the present case. Serious efforts are being made, contacts between the Commission and the French government have proven useful and we shall continue to work along these lines.
The French government has already closed the site in question, a study has been carried out and initial efforts have been made to install the technology required but, of course, the level of policing, the number of police officers required and the installation of the high-tech equipment needed are matters for the French government.
The second point I should like to make brings us to the root of the problem.
Why has traffic been suspended?
Why are there constantly problems with train traffic through the tunnel?
Why are illegal immigrants trespassing on various sites used by rail freight transporters?
I think, as several Members have said, that the root of the problem is to be found in common European policy; we need a common asylum policy to discourage immigrants from trying to reach specific Member States.
So the Commission has already tabled a number of proposals on procedures and rules for granting refugee status and minimum common requirements for receiving asylum seekers.
Another proposal sets criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining asylum applications.
These proposals stipulate that, if an asylum seeker remains in one Member State for an extended period, then that Member State is responsible for examining the asylum application.
This means, in this particular case, that asylum seekers will be unable to acquire refugee status in Britain after an extended period in France.
So I think that, when it comes to finding an immediate solution to a problem which is having a significant impact on certain areas, especially remote areas in Scotland, as well as on the European continent, and on trade relations with Great Britain, the French government alone is responsible.
It needs to take action as quickly as possible to complete the plan submitted and it is working with Great Britain and the Commission in order to do so.
As far as a long-term solution to the problem is concerned because, as numerous Members have said today, the problem today may be on the border between France and Great Britain, but tomorrow it could well surface somewhere else in Europe, we need a fast decision on a common asylum policy at European level.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting is suspended until voting time at 6.30 p.m.

Report (A5-0010/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report: 'State of implementation of Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( 'Working Time Directive' )' (COM(2000) 787 - C5-0147/2001 - 2001/2073(COS)).
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Koukiadis report (A5-0010/2002)
Bonde and SandbÃŠk (EDD), in writing.
(DA) We have chosen to abstain from voting on the overall report.
We believe that implementation of the directive in Denmark - characterised as inadequate by the Commission - would undermine the Danish system of agreements in the long term.
Denmark had chosen to implement the directive on the basis of the collective agreements and so hand the matter over to the two sides of industry.
Because, following pressure from the Commission, the directive is, however, shortly to be elevated to the status of law in Denmark, we can only express our dissatisfaction with the Commission' s interference in a system that operates well.
We nonetheless support the general improvements proposed by the report, including more precise definitions of concepts, for the wordings of quite a few definitions have led to misinterpretations during the implementation of the directive.
It is important that the text should be clarified in many areas so that employees' rights are protected and there is improved health and safety in the workplace.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I hereby declare resumed the session adjourned on Thursday, 7 February 2002.
Statement by the President
It is my duty today with the support of all the Members of this House and particularly with the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to express on behalf of the European Parliament our deep concern at the kidnapping of a parliamentarian and candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Colombia, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, a kidnapping by the so-called Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Columbian People's Army FARC.
The European Parliament unreservedly condemns such attacks on innocent civilians and interference in this way in an electoral process.
As President, I appeal to the perpetrators to immediately release Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, the five other parliamentarians being held hostage and the 40 civilians who have been kidnapped in the recent past and are still being held in illegal captivity.
Furthermore, I remind the kidnappers that it is especially inhuman to hold hostages who are in a precarious state of health and that these should be released immediately on humanitarian grounds.
Members will recall our strong support following the statement to plenary by President Pastrana on Tuesday, 26 October 1999 for the peace process in Colombia expressing numerous resolutions on 'Plan Colombia' .
The European Parliament regrets all the more the breakdown in the peace process negotiations and the recent resumption of hostilities and calls on the parties concerned to resume their search for a democratic and negotiated settlement for peace in Colombia.
Parliament expresses its solidarity with the families of the hostages and with the people of Colombia.
Mr President, thank you for that statement.
We will send someone to Colombia to see what we can do as a European Group and we hope, within a few weeks, to have a different option than simply to deplore that our candidate has been kidnapped.
Mr President, I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the gathering, which is taking place right now opposite the Parliament building, of some 3 000 men and women from France, Italy, Belgium and elsewhere.
They are calling on Europe to do everything in its power to bring about an equitable peace in the Middle East, in the spirit of the resolution that we ourselves adopted at our last part-session.
I think that we must welcome this gathering, firstly because it is healthy, when we are discussing the future of Europe, to see so many people demonstrating to urge Europe to fulfil its role as a world player.
And also because this is a demonstration for peace, justice and human dignity in the light of an appalling tragedy, which requires us to make an exceptional effort.
I welcome the fact that most groups have agreed to hold discussions with the citizens' delegations; this is promising.
I think that the next step should now be to send, as we decided, an official delegation from Parliament to the Palestinian territories and to Israel, and also, once there, to organise a visit to Europe by President Arafat.
Order of business
I move now to the order of business.
Mrs Pack, I understand that you wish to make a request concerning the agenda for Thursday.
Mr President, on behalf of all members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to make a heartfelt plea that we should not, as planned, have a combined debate on culture, education and youth on Thursday morning, as these three topics should not be thrown together.
There may well be points of contact between them, but they need to be dealt with separately.
I ask that these three topics be dealt with in the same time as set aside for the joint debate, and I believe that this is something that this House would support.
Let me then make a proposal which the House in its wisdom is at liberty to accept or reject.
In the light of this request I propose taking the three reports from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in separate debates.
(The House agreed to this proposal)
Mr President, you proposed a change to the agenda based on the Council' s availability, which, of course, we understand.
Basically, your proposal is to take Mr MacCormick' s reports on the waiver of parliamentary immunity now and, whatever the quality of the work by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which gave its opinion on the two reports last week, we believe that the time we have been given to examine the two requests for the waiver of parliamentary immunity might be insufficient.
We also believe, in the interests of holding a good debate, in order for our parliamentary democracy and the essential procedure of parliamentary immunity to function properly, in order for us all to be able to give our honest opinion, having had the opportunity to examine all the documents and in order that we do not give poorly informed opinions, that it would have been better to place the two reports on the agenda of the Strasbourg part-session.
I hope that the House can support us in this decision.
Rule 6(6) is very clear: "The report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled".
Under the Rules I am suggesting the correct procedure today.
The rule itself is very clear and it does not seem to fall within the discretion of the President or, at this moment, of the House itself, to alter that rule.
I understand and appreciate the point you make about political preparation but it seems to me that this must remain on our order of business in order to respect the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, this change to the agenda was not taken into account when you made your proposal.
This change is directly related to the Council' s availability.
Until now, it has always been customary to examine waivers for parliamentary immunity at the Strasbourg part-sessions.
I understand perfectly well, therefore, that we placed this issue at the head of Monday' s agenda, but I do not think this was what was intended, especially after last week' s vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Madam BerÃšs I made the suggestion to take the McCormick report at 4 p.m. because of the lack of availability of the President-in-Office, not on the assumption that the reports would not have been taken today.
Our agenda, as originally foreseen for today, was to be led by the Council on the Barcelona Council.
Mr McCormick's reports would ordinarily under our Rules of Procedure have appeared in today's agenda.
My announcement was simply to reverse the order on the grounds of the absence of the Council.
Decisions taken at today's meeting
The next item is the communication by the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, on the annual political strategy for next year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure today to inform you about three important matters dealt with by the Commission.
I need to be clear but also go into some detail in this speech, and so I apologise if it gets a little boring!
I will deal first with the Commission's political priorities for 2003, then with the Commission's human and financial resources and, lastly, with the Convention which is going to start work tomorrow.
First, then, the Commission's political priorities for 2003, which will be one of the most important stages in the organisation of our political life.
This year, for the first time, the three main institutions will conduct an in-depth dialogue on the political priorities and the legislative working programme for the coming year.
We shall do so on the basis of the new understanding presented at the Conference of Presidents on 31 January.
For next year, we have identified three priorities: enlargement, stability and security and a sustainable and inclusive economy.
Fully successful enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission since the beginning of its mandate, and enlargement will therefore remain a key priority throughout the second part of my term of office.
In this context, 2003 will be a very important year, in which we must all be ready to assume our full responsibilities towards the new Member States.
We must be ready to welcome into the Commission our colleagues from the new Member States and to face new challenges.
Let me remind you that if we complete the enlargement negotiations in 2002, then 2003 must be the pivotal year when we prepare ourselves to make sure that enlargement goes ahead smoothly on 1 January 2004.
During 2003, therefore, the Commission intends to do several things.
Firstly, we must help the future Member States prepare to fully assume all the responsibilities arising from accession.
Secondly, we must make sure the Commission fulfils all its obligations from the very first day of accession.
Thirdly, we must rethink Community policies.
This will be the most significant enlargement in the entire history of European integration, and it is essential that we reflect on what common policies the enlarged Union will need.
However, if enlargement is to be a total success, we must also give a high profile to the other two priorities I mentioned just now.
Indeed, the three subjects we are talking about today are closely linked.
First and foremost, stability and security.
Within the Union, our main objective is to step up progress towards a European area of justice, security and freedom.
Therefore, the fight against crime in all its forms - including terrorism, or rather, starting with terrorism - is and will remain at the top of our agenda.
I also believe that there needs to be particular focus on all the complex effects of immigration.
Outside the Union, another of our priorities is to spread stability and security throughout our continent and to the regions bordering on the enlarged Union.
To achieve this, we need to strengthen our partnerships with neighbouring countries.
The reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership must do more than seek to establish a market place: it must create a genuine community of good neighbours.
To this end, we shall pursue our strategy of strengthening the Barcelona process.
In particular, on the economic front, we shall seek to develop joint projects and initiatives together with the countries on the Mediterranean's southern shore through a new financial institution based on the EIB's operation - notably, this morning, we approved the idea that it should be an institution in which the EIB holds the majority share - on the basis of the guidelines the Commission has, indeed, adopted.
Furthermore, we shall spare no efforts in seeking to help resolve the conflict in the Middle East, where the most recent developments have, at last, generated a glimmer of hope after months of tragedy.
We shall also move forward with the association and stabilisation process in the Balkans and, in the wider world, we shall continue to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Our third priority for 2003 is a sustainable, inclusive economy.
I believe it will not be long before the economy recovers, but a lot depends on how resolutely the EU implements the Lisbon Strategy.
Indeed, the external dimension of this strategy is particularly important as it can help us direct the path of globalisation and ensure that its benefits are shared as widely as possible.
To achieve this, we shall be fighting on several fronts.
Firstly, the negotiations begun at Doha will be entering a crucial phase, not this year but in 2003.
Then we must ensure that the Kyoto commitments are implemented.
Finally, we must improve the global partnership between north and south, practically affirming Europe's solidarity with Africa.
Proper discussions will be opened on these issues at Monterrey in a few weeks' time.
The situation is certainly not the most encouraging, there is certainly no cause for optimism in our - at last serious - commitment to the Developing World, but the Commission undertakes to work in this sphere.
My second subject for today is the analysis of the Commission's human and financial resources.
Our Annual Policy Strategy does not simply identify the key political priorities; it also seeks to ensure that the Commission has sufficient resources for its tasks.
This is the commitment I gave at the start of my term of office, and it is now becoming reality as we achieve coherence between policy decisions, planned activities and resources.
This Commission has never undertaken to do anything without having the necessary resources and will never do so.
We must therefore ensure - and this is the plan we are working on - that optimum use is made of human resources.
We have made every endeavour to improve the situation, through productivity gains, negative priorities - identifying tasks to be abandoned, that is - and internal redeployment.
At this point, however, we cannot prepare properly for enlargement without more staff.
There is absolutely no doubt about that if you consider, for example, that the number of languages used - in Parliament too, of course, and in all the work of the different institutions - will almost double.
As you know, the Commission must also be ready to ensure application of the Community acquis right from day one of accession. This means we have to complete all aspects of enlargement preparations by the end of 2003.
To this end, precisely with a view to preparing gradually for enlargement, after rigorous analysis, the Commission has requested 500 non-permanent staff in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2003.
We all know that the current ceiling for administrative expenditure does not allow sufficient resources to cover preparations for enlargement.
The Commission therefore considers it essential to use the flexibility instrument it has proposed.
This request for 500 non-permanent staff in 2003 forms part of a global package of staffing needs to cope with enlargement, and it is derived from a detailed analysis of all the activities the Commission will have to perform in future.
The complete results of this analysis will appear in the preliminary draft budget for 2003 and will be presented for debate in this House.
Our other two priorities - security and an inclusive economy - give the Commission additional responsibilities too.
However, in order not to have to ask for yet more staff we have decided to approve new initiatives only if they can be carried out by redeploying our existing staff and/or by phasing out some of our existing activities.
This shows how seriously and responsibly the Commission is committed to its priorities and also to budgetary discipline.
Apart from anything else, the Commissioner for the Budget is here and she is watching to make sure that I respect this undertaking.
With regard to financial resources, the Commission and the Budgetary Authority must urgently find a more structural solution to the permanent overstretching of external relations Heading 4.
No action can be totally efficient under the current constraints: in other words, we are wasting resources.
Last year's international developments, and especially the events of 11 September and the ensuing war in Afghanistan, showed once again that the Union needs specific mechanisms for making the extra funds it needs for crisis intervention swiftly available.
This is of the utmost importance if we are genuinely to strengthen the European Union' s voice in the world.
The breakdown in Heading 4 that the Commission proposes therefore accommodates crucial political priorities such as Afghanistan, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Global Health Fund, without jeopardising our other fields of external action.
I would therefore urge this House and the Council to address the issue of resources as soon as possible, for the actions I have mentioned cannot be put off.
