We also want to demand once again â as has been said here repeatedly â that workersâ rights to information, consultation and participation be strengthened, both at national and at European and multinational level.
I am aware that the workers of GM are trying to participate in the European committee and trying to anticipate crisis problems, anticipating possible scenarios and in this case it is the management which has done the abandoning and which has made mistakes.
That is why we are once again demanding that companiesâ corporate and social responsibilities be increased, that the Commission not just take the decision to analyse the sector, but also to take measures to ensure that responsibilities towards workers and the territories they work in are met, and we are also demanding more incisive measures in relation to the transparency of decision-making, which we believe has failed in this case.
Furthermore, in the case of GM, these workers â and I am well aware of this, since this has been the case in the Figueruelas plant, in my region of AragÃ³n â have just signed an agreement in which they have demonstrated a great capacity for negotiation, dialogue, foresight and adaptation to the demands for flexibility, specifically with a view to anticipating cycles, but despite that, the management â not the management in AragÃ³n, but the European management â has once again abandoned them.
We therefore call on the Commission, as well as the study group, to apply the required social and economic measures which this Parliament has proposed on many occasions.
Â Â  Mr President, as a number of colleagues have said, this is nothing new.
The car industry is probably one of the most competitive manufacturing industries of any that we deal with.
There are over ten major manufacturers producing cars in Europe and spending billions on research and development.
It is a competitive market.
There will inevitably be changes.
I want to remind colleagues that three years ago one of GM's major plants in the United Kingdom was closed.
I will read a headline from today's which I picked up on the plane on my way here this morning: 'Car output near record levels'.
It is likely that in the United Kingdom this year we will produce a record number of cars.
That record was last broken in 1972.
The message to the many people who are facing uncertainty in RÃŒsselsheim, Bochum and TrollhÃ€ttan â and I have been to some of those plants â is that there is life after restructuring.
That is why the United Kingdom car industry is doing relatively well.
I am not complacent about it, but it is a fact.
We should be reflecting on why General Motors tells us that it needs to save EUR 500 million a year in costs to make itself competitive.
I am sure it can justify those figures.
We need to work together.
That is the message that needs to go out.
It is impossible to achieve record levels of car output in the United Kingdom with, in many plants, quality and productivity levels that are the best in Europe, without working between managers and the workforce and with dealers and customers.
As mentioned in Mr Rehn's statement this afternoon, we must encourage the Commission to look at the competitive conditions.
We do not want an industrial plan for the car industry. We do not want the Commission or politicians telling car companies what to do.
We are in a competitive market. But that EUR 500 million will go into the cleaner, safer cars that Europe's consumers want.
That is the change that is needed.
Â Â  Mr President, the errors of management have been sufficiently described, and, rather than enlarge upon them, I want to talk about what we â the Commission, the Council, and also this Parliament â can do.
We have to get away from making some laws on the environment â albeit very comprehensive ones â followed by laws on the protection and safety of pedestrians and others, and then laws on mobility, while neglecting, as we did in the past, to put together a truly cohesive and uniform strategy for this sector.
That is what is urgently needed if we are not to be helpless spectators while jobs in European industry are wiped out.
I believe that we can gain some optimism from what MrÂ Rehn and Mr Verheugen said in the hearings.
One cannot but welcome the setting up of a high level group of this sort, but âhigh levelâ means not just this or that chairman of this or that companyâs board, but also the workersâ representatives; it must involve not just the Commission, but also the European Parliament.
I think we can find examples of this in shipbuilding too.
There is just one more thing I would like to say, and that is that what the outgoing Commission, as regards jobs in the motor industry, has covered itself with is not just glory.
I would cite not only the Volkswagen legislation, but also the Design Directive, as examples of how urgently amendments are needed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I firstly want to correct MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, who said that he is the only car worker here now in this House.
That is really not the case.
The member of my cabinet, MrsÂ Asenius, is a former worker on the assembly line at a car factory in Gothenburg, and I myself worked in the summers and on Saturdays as a spare parts salesman, all of which gives us, I hope, some kind of practical experience of car industry issues.
I would like to thank honourable Members for their support and sympathy for the workers and for their overall support for the Commission's position.
I have taken due note of the views expressed and will report them to the present Commission and to the new one.
Although I cannot comment on specific sectors and their management, it is true that we cannot blame the macroeconomic environment alone.
Management decisions have also played a role in the current situation in the European car industry.
Our conclusion, which I think is a very common view in this House and in the Commission, is that we need a new approach to industrial policy.
This does not mean picking the winners as we did in the 1970s, which often meant, in fact, sustaining the losers, but a dual policy based on a horizontal view of competitiveness, education, innovation, technology, regional policy and so on, combined with a sound sectoral analysis covering various sectors, so that we know what combination of policies is best for each sector.
I therefore appreciate your support for the consideration of the high-level group, which would, in my view, work in the same way as in the textile sector.
I take due note of your sense of urgency and will report this to the Vice-President designate, GÃŒnter Verheugen.
I am sure he will take that into account if our appointments are confirmed on Wednesday.
Mr Belet asked me to dream.
Yes, I dream about cleaner and safer cars.
I dream and expect that the European car industry, as well as the public sector, will devote more funds to research and innovation.
I should like to see the social partners and all stakeholders focus strongly on the competitiveness of this key sector in the European economy.
This is a very worthy focus for the high-level group, and I trust we will have good cooperation with the European Parliament on these issues.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  We are appalled by the restructuring just announced by GMÂ Europe aimed at cutting 12Â 000 jobs in the short term in all of its European factories and at reducing structural costs by around USD 600Â million per year.
A few months ago, the General Motors Group, of North America, was said to be planning drastically to reduce its workforce and to make cuts in Opel, Vauxhall and Saabâs European factories.
As stated in the motion that was recently approved by the workers at Opel Azambuja, in Portugal, GMâs consolidation measures cannot be allowed to continue to damage the workforce.
It is the workers who have met the conditions of what is known as the 2001 âOlympia Agreementâ, while the Board of GM Europe has been carrying out its obligations in a piecemeal and incompetent fashion, by doing business in a confrontational and contemptuous manner.
In so doing, they have shown their ignorance of the European car market.
GM Europeâs economic success cannot depend solely on importing American brands and American strategies.
It is essential that production be maintained in various countries in Europe.
We therefore wish to show our solidarity with and support for the GM Europe factory workers in their fight against redundancies, against the closure of factories and against the violation of collective working agreements.
Their rights must be defended.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of the rise in oil prices on the European economy, agriculture and fisheries.
I shall give the floor straight away to Mr Almunia.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the price of oil has risen considerably this year, reaching historic highs â in dollars â in nominal terms.
Its impact on the economy is largely due to the marked rise of recent months, since, if we take account of the evolution of the euro-dollar exchange rate and inflation, the current level of real prices, in euros, is comparable to that of 2000.
The expectation in the very short term is that the price of a barrel of oil will remain high, due to the greater than expected rise in demand, particularly the demand from the large Asian countries and, in particular, China, and due to a lack of additional capacity to increase supply in the short term and to global and regional political uncertainties, particularly the conflict in Iraq of course.
The upwards tendency has furthermore been exacerbated by certain speculative movements, attracted by the price volatility resulting from the uncertainty factors I have just mentioned.
This increase is clearly having a negative impact on growth during 2004 and on the growth forecast for next year.
The oil price in dollars is now 60% higher than was forecast six months ago, when the Commission published its spring economic forecasts.
Tomorrow, the Commission will publish its autumn economic forecasts, which include an estimate of the oil price, which of course is greater than the estimate six months ago.
According to the ECOFIN Directorate-Generalâs econometric simulations model, if the price of a barrel of oil stays at 50 dollars â and today I believe a barrel of Brent stands at over 51 dollars â the effect would be an accumulated growth loss over three years of almost one point of gross domestic product, if the price of a barrel remains at 50 dollars throughout that period.
In fact, the economic forecasts the Commission will present tomorrow have been based on the assumption of a higher oil price than in the spring, although it is also the case that, with regard to the estimates of the macroeconomic model, our forecasts for the evolution of the oil price for 2005 and 2006 are slightly more optimistic.
We are not, therefore, expecting this level of 50 dollars to be maintained, but rather we expect it to decrease gradually.
Even so, despite this negative impact, the European economies are in a position to endure this price increase, thanks, in particular, to two factors.
On the one hand, the real price of oil â as I have said â is considerably lower than previous highs.
Not only is it no higher than that of 2000, but it is also very much lower than the high reached in real terms in 1981 and is also noticeably lower than that reached in 1973, more than 30 years ago.
Furthermore, the European economies, over the intervening 30 years, have considerably increased their energy efficiency, reducing their dependence on oil when compared to the eighties, which makes us less vulnerable to increases in energy prices.
In addition to this, the significant changes to the nature of salaries in the European economies, which are now less linked to the evolution of prices, must lessen the secondary effects of the increase in energy prices or inflation, which the President of the European Central Bank has mentioned this afternoon.
Unlike in previous crises, so far at least, inflation is not expected to increase, despite the increases in oil prices.
Having said this, we must recognise, Mr President, that certain sectors are being particularly affected as a result of their characteristics and specific circumstances, and I am referring, of course, as does the title of this debate, to agriculture and fisheries.
The Commission is perfectly aware of the specific difficulties that arise in these sectors as a result of increased fuel prices.
In both cases, producers in the agricultural and fisheries sectors have little capacity to pass on increases in their costs through their prices.
There is therefore no doubt about the need for specific action and the Commission, in response to last weekâs request from the Eurogroup, has agreed to present the Eurogroup and Ecofin with a report next month on the measures States may take in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, without thereby violating the legislation in force in the field of state aid and respecting the principle which we believe to be essential in the Economic and Monetary Union, which is that individual initiatives by Member States must be coordinated in order to prevent distortions of competition.
As well as asking the Commission for this report, the Finance Ministers once again emphasised the need not to adopt unilateral measures and for any possibility of measures affecting competition to be dealt with firstly by means of a prior consultation and coordination mechanism.
Before ending my first speech, I would like, if you will allow me, to stress two elements relating to the European economy in a more general sense.
Firstly, I should stress that the appropriate polices for ensuring the stability of the energy supply are being adequately applied and coordinated at international, Community and national levels and, naturally, we must make it very clear that there is absolutely no reason to fear problems with energy supply in the industrialised countries, since the current level of strategic oil reserves, both in the United States and in the European Union or in other OECD countries, will allow us to deal with problems with the supply of crude over a long period of time, should they arise.
It is important to remember this, since the perceived risk of a possible scarcity of crude oil in the future is contributing to high oil prices, and I do not believe this fear to be justified given the way the market operates and the level of strategic reserves.
Finally, and looking to the future, it is important that we continue with the reforms initiated in the past within the European Union with a view to improving our energy efficiency, because in that way we will improve the capacity of our economies to deal with external economic disturbances, such as this rise in oil prices, and, at the same time, by adopting these energy efficiency measures, we will increase the long-term growth potential of the Union's economies.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to express my regret at the fact that today this House has missed an opportunity to provide the citizens with a package of real solutions to the crisis the price of oil is causing in certain sectors, as our Committee on Fisheries had initially proposed.
In particular â and the Commissioner has mentioned this â the consequences for the fisheries sector are extremely serious, and neither the Community institutions nor certain Member States, including my own, I regret to say, are taking any measures.
Our Parliament has decided not take any action either, preferring a mere Commission statement to committing ourselves to a resolution, as proposed by our political group.
This statement today is of little or no use to fisheries, because we already know Commissioner Fischlerâs opinion, which is that we should pass the rises on to the consumer.
The problem is that the Commissioner â and I am delighted that you have said quite the opposite today, Commissioner â did not know that this solution was impossible for the fisheries sector, since it is governed by a system of Dutch auction.
The situation is very different, Mr President.
The oil price crises of 1993, 1994, 2002 and 2004 show that this is not a problem specific to the current situation, but a cyclical problem, and we must work on the basis that cycles will become shorter and shorter, since we are talking about an exhaustible energy source.
We are, therefore, dealing with a structural deficiency which must be dealt with through structural measures.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore calling for the implementation of a Community instrument which can be mobilised almost automatically during these periods of crisis.
Furthermore, however, we need urgent measures for supporting the sector until that instrument becomes part of Community legislation; and we propose that these measures include the granting of low-interest or zero-interest loans and setting a maximum price, compensation in line with the real price by means of financial measures and temporary reductions in social and fiscal burdens.
Â Â  â Mr President, apart from the obvious concern in every economy, the high price of oil and the present dependence of the world economy on it have started to financially suffocate both households and businesses.
The present price rise appears not to be simply a short term or speculative rise; on the contrary, it also reflects structural changes which may well result in multiple reviews of the global economy.
The growth of the Tiger economy and a series of geopolitical factors are among the factors which have caused the present oil-triggered disorder in the economy.
Consequently, it is not at all impossible that oil prices will stabilise at much higher levels than those which we considered normal in the past.
For the European Union, the Commission itself has stated that a 25% increase in the price of oil this year will reduce the rate of growth by 0.17%.
As a result of these negative developments, there is an urgent need for the Commission and the Council to proceed with immediate action and medium term interventions.
In a period of economic recession, of inflationary pressure and of pressure to re-examine the financial policy of the Stability and Growth Pact and the effectiveness of the support mechanisms for the Lisbon agreement, we cannot confine ourselves, Commissioner, to declarations and statements that, basically, everything is fine.
The European Parliament would like to re-examine ways and means â there is a detailed analysis of the repercussions of the already enhanced oil prices on economic growth in the individual sectors, such as transport, agriculture, trade and employment.
First, we should stress that nearly all the budgets of the Member States have been prepared on the basis of an oil price of USD 29.
Secondly, we should stress the need to configure a stable and effective European framework for dealing with upward trends and sudden fluctuations in oil prices.
Thirdly, we should stress the need to develop and activate a plan for dealing with the crisis and creating an efficient framework for preventing any crises which may affect the new stability pact.
Fourthly, we should stress the need to avoid speculative market trends.
Fifthly, we should stress the need to support vulnerable social groups, as this will mitigate the reduction in their income and prevent their social and economic marginalisation.
Finally, we need to stress the need for financial support for farm holdings and businesses, which are already bearing the burden of the increase in production costs, which they truly cannot pass on to the consumer.
I should like in closing to stress that any delay in taking immediate initiatives will contribute to the emergence, as we have seen in the Council, of isolated national measures, and I should like to stress here that different national economic and political approaches must not be allowed to affect the degree of application of unified Community policies.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, during the past few months constant increases in the price of a barrel of oil have deepened the crisis affecting the European fisheries sector.
These increases have a direct impact on wages for crews, as well as on companiesâ profit and loss accounts. As you said, these companies can barely, if at all, pass the increase on to the selling price of fish, given the specific nature of this market.
The previous crisis which occurred ten years ago had an avalanche effect, weakening management and financial structures in the sector and thus seriously jeopardising the economies of affected regions.
The situation we are facing today is comparable in the economic and social distress it is causing. The governments of the Member States are endeavouring, or will endeavour, to confront this situation by taking measures which comply with Community regulations, as you said.
These measures, however, can do nothing but maintain the current state of affairs, and they cannot claim to provide an effective and lasting solution to the economic problems caused by high fuel prices.
The Community approach, which is focused almost exclusively on, and I quote, âthe sustainable management of fisheries resources to preserve the interests of future generationsâ, is no longer credible as it stands, as there is a risk that it will result in a situation where the European Union is no longer able to exploit these resources due to a lack of workers experienced in the field.
Under these conditions, how can we work towards the real goal of our common fisheries policy, which, as I see it, is for it to act in tandem with the common agricultural policy to maintain our continentâs capacity to produce sufficient food?
Mr Almunia, my question is that which I prepared with my fellow members of the Committee on Fisheries; will the Commission undertake to act on behalf of the most seriously affected areas?
For example, does it intend to put forward proposals to allow measures to be taken under the existing Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, or under the future European Fisheries Fund, or under any other mechanism, to improve the economic situation and to thus preserve the future of regions which have no real alternative?
Â Â  Mr President, many communities, many families in Scotland are highly dependent upon the fishing industry, an industry which has had massive economic and social pain inflicted upon it as a direct result of political decisions made in Brussels under the common fisheries policy.
The rocketing cost of fuel could be the final straw for many businesses â and a fishing boat in Scotland very often is a business, a family-run business â which have been forced by the CFP to operate this year for only 15 days each month.
Some EU governments apparently recognise the exceptional economic pressure which rising fuel prices puts upon the fisheries sector.
Recently France, supported by at least four other Member States, saw it as a long-term Community mechanism for granting public aid to the sector.
This initiative was opposed â unsurprisingly â by the UK, citing the need to respect state aid and competition rules.
I think the real reason for the UK failing to support that proposal was, as usual, that it did not wish for any precedent which might require it to aid its fishing industry â which it never does.
Mr Fischler, regrettably, was also unsympathetic, apparently saying that fisheries, unlike the agriculture sector, could easily respond to the fuel price increases by increasing fish prices.
That is all very well, but what about the consumer, and what about the fact that fish products are relatively healthy and are recommended by dieticians to consumers?
The agriculture sector in Scotland is also suffering greatly from high fuel costs, not just through the direct use of fuel on farms, but also owing to the excessive cost of sending their produce to distant markets, an economic pressure which the UK Treasury has also added to in the form of unjustly high levels of taxation.
But it is people and communities and not just businesses that suffer.
The , the newspaper of the Orkney Islands, reports a 67% rise in the price of fuel leading to an overspend by Orkney Ferries.
Sometimes in the Orkney Isles, the Shetland Isles and the Western Isles it is normal and indeed essential for people to take two ferries to get to work or to shop.
This is not just affecting businesses, it is impacting on a whole community.
Â Â  â Commissioner, despite the gravity of the situation, all we have heard from you is a mixture of reassuring generalities, wish lists and neo-liberal doctrine.
Competition must be saved at all costs.
However, the rise in oil prices places a burden on low incomes and increases the tax revenue of the Member States.
There are Member States saying we should refund part of our enhanced revenue to low incomes.
In France in particular, there is talk of tax refunds.
In Greece, a reduction in the tax collected by the state has been proposed in order to relieve the pressure on low incomes.
Farmers and fishermen are not satisfied with studies, they want specific measures.
I should therefore like you to tell us in your reply why the majority rejects the proposals emerging from France or from Greece and when a decision will be taken on specific measures for farmers and fishermen.
Â Â  â Mr President, why such panic from Sweden to Greece and from Portugal to Poland?
Why has the Commission been caught unprepared?
Why have you allowed things to develop in such a bad way for European households, industry and fisheries?
Did the Commission not see how much the map had changed over recent years?
Did it not see the intervention of the United States?
It is controlling Iraq's oil through the invasion.
It is controlling Saudi Arabia's oil by controlling the royal family.
It is controlling Libya's oil by holding Gaddafi hostage.
It is controlling Venezuela's oil by trying to destabilise Chavez.
It is controlling Russia's oil through its customer relations with Putin.
It is controlling oil and playing games with oil to the detriment of the European Union and to the detriment of China.
A China desperately in need of oil (one in twelve barrels produced go there) and a Europe which, with its overpriced currency and with oil at USD 55, has particularly unaffordable and expensive goods which no longer even get near the shelves.
You will see huge problems soon.
Chryslers will flood Europe; there will be fewer Renaults, fewer Mercedes, fewer Fiats.
The result will be more American cars and everyone knows what that means for the economy.
We need to get out of this trap they have set for us as quickly as possible.
We need to be able to adjust the currency and, above all, we need to be able to take the oil which is ours, oil in Romania and oil in the Aegean which Turkey has blocked.
If you want cheap oil, it is up to you to pull Turkey into line and to have cheap oil in Europe so that the European people are able to make ends meet.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President, the facts are as follows: since the beginning of the year, the price of a barrel of oil has increased by 65%, going over the magic figure of USDÂ 50.
According to the predictions of certain analysts and economists, in the next few months the price may rise to USDÂ 70Â orÂ 80 per barrel.
The results of such an increase include a massive rise in costs in all areas, in particular in transport, agriculture and the areas to which reference has already been made today.
A further slow-down in economic growth has ensued too.
This can be estimated using the following simple formula: if the price of a barrel increases by USDÂ 5, economic growth will fall by 0.3%.
The increase has also resulted in a strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the other currencies of the European Union, as well as in disequilibria in the balance of payments of the major importing countries and, finally, in the European Union becoming less competitive and moving further away from the goals of the Lisbon strategy.
Polish farmers were delighted to receive their first payments from the Union.
Unfortunately, they are already aware that these payments will mainly be used not to develop farms, but to cover the cost of increases in fuel and fertiliser prices.
The world did not anticipate these price rises, and the European Union did not anticipate them either when it planned its long-term policy consisting of programmes for the replacement of natural fuels by alternative and renewable fuels.
Rapid measures should be taken to amend and accelerate the 2000 programme in the same way that America has done in the case of biofuels, with the country now using 10% biofuels in petrol and producing 70Â millionÂ tonnes of them every year.
A further example is that of the German economy and the production of electricity.
Particular encouragement should be given to the production of biofuels, an increase in which would be the simplest and quickest way to limit imports.
That would improve the European Unionâs balance of payments both by increasing the number of jobs in rural areas, by accelerating the development of the much-feted multifunctional agriculture and also by raising profitability in agriculture, making it independent of the suffocating support system of subsidies.
Now is the time for us to make a rapid change of policy to one that makes us independent of price rises, oil imports and excessive greenhouse gas emissions, and now is the time for us to choose the path of environmental protection.
Â Â  Mr President, the rise in fuel prices affects many sectors of the European economy, and in particular transport-related sectors.
Yet it is clear that the primary production sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the most acute problems.
This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate, in which we have bitten off more than we can chew. We should therefore focus on these two subjects.
It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties, and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this.
Within a little over one year, fishermen have seen the price of diesel oil double, with approximately one litre of fuel needed to catch one kilo of fish.
This is why, together with the other Members of this House, I was quite literally shocked and appalled at the statements made by the Commissioner for Fisheries, in which he said that one need only pass the rise in the price of fuel on to the price of fish in order to solve the problems.
This is of course impossible, and it is an example of the very kind of flawed reasoning which will dissuade consumers from buying fish, the very food we wish to promote.
In my opinion, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis of 1993-1994, which caused a widespread breakdown of structures, was that extremely rapid action will be needed.
The proposals we have just heard, in particular those put forward by Mrs Fraga and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, include placing a ceiling on the cost of diesel oil, reducing financial, social and tax costs and, most importantly, providing monetary advances which correspond to the needs of fishermen experiencing very serious problems, of whom there are already a large number.
This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing.
In other words, there is a need for both measures taken at European level during crisis periods and national measures adapted to local situations.
Â Â  Mr President, what I have noted today in this House, in particular, is the absence of the Commissioner responsible for the two sectors â agriculture and fisheries â who should be taking the initiative to propose measures to alleviate the negative impact of the rise in oil prices on two sectors which are unquestionably his responsibility.
These are two strategic sectors in terms of maintaining jobs and of the Unionâs food supply.
As Commissioner Almunia has acknowledged, both sectors have difficulties passing the rise on through their prices, something which MrÂ Fischler appears not yet to have understood.
I believe that it is our duty â and the Commission's duty â to act diligently in crisis situations.
In this respect, I would like to say to Commissioner Almunia that we do not want to return to the scenario of 2000, when the Commission decided to declare the State aid received by those professionals illegal and demand that it be returned.
Such a situation would damage the credibility of the institutions, not just the Community institutions, but national institutions as well.
In this regard, I agree with the Commissioner on the need to adopt a mechanism capable of responding to the situation at Community level, since it is endangering two of our most sensitive production sectors.
I do not think it is asking too much to wait for a month if that allows us to create an appropriate Community framework capable of establishing the scope and duration of any measures adopted by either the European Union or the different Member States, this being the only way, we believe, to prevent any problems of distortions of competition which could arise if each Member State adopts them individually.
Â Â  Mr President, the price of agricultural fuel has risen by 40% since the beginning of this year.
If we consider a case I know well â that of Spain â this rise has led to very great losses for producers and no national compensation measures have been put in place to alleviate them in good time.
The Spanish farmers are very concerned about the Spanish Governmentâs failure to act in this respect.
Last week a draft was presented in this House calling for a parliamentary resolution in favour of long-term measures aimed at reducing the farmersâ dependence on diesel.
The draft â the only one I have seen in relation to agriculture â was not accepted, which I believe can be interpreted as a lack of solidarity on the part of this House towards the farmers, one of the two sectors â together with the fisheries sector â which are least protected against price rises because in neither case can producers pass this increase on through their prices.


In order to resolve this problem, I propose five measures: firstly, the Member States should take measures in a coordinated fashion in order to prevent distortions of competition between neighbouring countries; secondly, the European Commission should be as benevolent as possible when authorising national aid; thirdly, the European Union, once and for all, should give mature consideration to the resources available to deal with the crises which have been arising for years â let us remember 1993-1994, 2000 and that all these years in which oil prices have risen have been devastating for producers; fourthly, in relation to the issue which was aborted in the Conference of Presidents last week, I proposed calling on the European Union to bring forward the report it has to produce on aid for fuel production with a view to revising the Community legislation as soon as possible, in order to reduce the dependence of farmers and the European Union on oil; and fifthly, as a final measure, I also propose that this Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture produce a report with a view to seeking viable long-term solutions.

Â Â  I would like to comment on the subject from the viewpoint of the countries with poor energy sources.
The increase in the price of oil has resulted in general price rises in our country too.
As a consequence, economic growth has slowed down, the budget situation has become uncertain and agricultural competitiveness has deteriorated because, unfortunately, the agriculture of countries with poor energy sources consumes a lot of energy, and employment and social achievements thus become jeopardised.
Living costs increase and poverty deepens.
It is a sad picture.
The unreasonably high oil price endangers global economic growth, and I can only emphasise what Commissioner Almunia said, that the main reason for price increases, namely international speculation, must be dealt with.
A combined European effort is needed not only for this, but also for turning the dream of a welcoming Europe into a reality, despite the problems.
In a collective effort, the institutions of the European Union must therefore help prevent crises brought about by price increases.
They need to increase the proportion of renewable energy so that they become more independent of the oil market.
Furthermore, they must help create an observation system that analyses the oil price movements and determines the strategic level of oil reserves.
All this is planned for the future by LÃ¡szlÃ³ KovÃ¡cs, Commissioner-designate, whose expertise has been called into question by some people in this House.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the continual rise in oil prices is again bringing home to us our economic dependency on third states.
We must never forget that crude oil has been, and still is, the cause of many economic conflicts, not to mention the detrimental effects that its extraction, processing and use have on the environment.
Nor must we ever forget that we are dealing here with a finite resource.
It is high time for Europe to free itself from economic dependence on oil imports.
High oil prices have an adverse effect on agriculture and mean substantial losses of income for our farmers.
The targeted use of renewable energies is now more necessary than ever before; not only does the use of renewable raw materials significantly help to protect the environment, but it also offers new alternative sources of income for our farmers.
Above all else, though, it is the right way to become self-sufficient in energy, so we have to push for the voluntary Europe-wide admixture of biofuels, which is a half-hearted solution, to be made mandatory.
In this Directive, the interests of the oil industry have prevailed to a large extent, while the goals of the Kyoto Protocol, more secure income for our rural areas and an opportunity to create more jobs, including in the outermost regions, have lost out.
Commissioner, our responsibilities to future generations demand of us that we press for the more efficient promotion and mandatory admixture of renewable energies right across Europe.
If now is not the time to do this, then when is?
So, equipped with new and smart energies, let us go on the march into the future!
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the price of oil is still lower now than it was at the beginning of the eighties, but that has not taught us to conserve.
Fuel prices seem to follow fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar, at present the currency of a country at war.
Why do we not quote these prices in euros, as MrÂ Karlsson proposed in his report?
Unfortunately, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats overturned the report on emergency supplies in this House a little under a year ago.
Perhaps the present energy problems in the United States and Europe have woken us up.
The unstable situation in Africa, the Middle East and Russia has resulted in problems in the supply of oil.
Not only ourselves, but the United States, Japan, China and India all compete for Russian oil.
We must ensure that we have a steady fuel supply.
Member States should prepare for long periods of high prices by introducing interim fiscal solutions, stockpiling supplies, which we need, exploiting new sources of energy, and reduced and more efficient consumption.
When MrÂ Karlssonâs report was overturned, Parliament called on the Commission to draft a new proposal on the matter.
When does the Commission intend to put this proposal forward?
It is obviously necessary for us to reduce our dependence on oil and develop new energy sources.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise in oil prices is having an undeniable impact on the European economy, agriculture and fisheries.
It would be hard to think of a more topical issue.
Today, for example, we have heard about farmers making it difficult to store and refine oil in France, where they are demanding, in a typically French way, complete exemption from tax on fuel used in agriculture.
Also in the news too the critical stage which the industrial dispute in the Norwegian oil industry has reached, and that has put up the price of crude oil in the Nordic countries.
Examined in historical context, the current price of oil per barrel, which is more than USD 55, easily exceeds the 40 dollar level, which it was thought would significantly slow down global economic growth.
If current price levels are maintained, forecasts for the global economy may well have to be adjusted downwards.
If the situation continues for a long time, it will also become a problem for us.
For now, however, we should keep our composure.
The long-term rise in oil prices is not just the result of recent events, but of strong economic growth in China and the countries of South-East Asia, which in itself is a positive thing.
Low stocks in the United States and political instability in the Middle East have also had an impact.
Furthermore, when we consider the American presidential elections and many other political factors, such areas of speculation have now contributed to price pressures, although they are not directly linked to any real oil shortage.
The only means by which we can have an effect on the price of oil or any other form of energy in the long term is to ensure that European energy policy is sufficiently diverse in scope.
Specifically, we need to support a diverse energy mix that includes all the main forms of energy, especially nuclear power.
Dependence on oil is also a very difficult issue from the point of view of relations with Russia, as MrÂ Paasilinna, for example, has just said.
Russia sells energy wherever it can obtain the best price for it, and China and India, as major consumers, have the advantage over Europe here.
We should not, therefore, rely on imported energy. Instead, we must ensure that we produce a greater proportion of our energy in Europe ourselves, at a reasonable cost, and in a way that is environmentally sustainable.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a few comments in response to the speeches made during the debate and point out that I entirely agree with many of the arguments and opinions expressed.
Firstly, with regard to the assessment of what is happening and of what is going to happen in relation to the evolution of oil prices and its impact on the European economy in general.
I believe we must insist once again on the need to be realistic when assessing this impact, and in the case of this crisis, of this rise in the oil price, which is very significant in terms of dollars, the impact on European economies is much less significant than in previous crises.
We must not, therefore, exaggerate the general impact on the economy, despite the particularly noticeable and socially painful consequences for certain specific sectors.
Secondly, I believe we must be prudent when assessing the possible evolution of the oil price, by making judgments on what that evolution may be.
It is true that some economists are talking about 60 and 70 dollars, but it is also true that the futures markets are operating on the basis of a reduction of the current level of 50 dollars per barrel and that the market operators are, therefore, not anticipating further rises in the petrol price, but rather a tendency over the next two years for the market situation to moderate, given that, as some of you have said, the proportion of the rise in the oil price over recent months does not correspond either to the objective situation of supply and demand in the market nor to the other geopolitical factors influencing the situation, but to speculative operations which cannot be maintained permanently over time.
We therefore need to be prudent and realistic when assessing a situation which, in any event, is not a positive one and which, as I said at the beginning, and as many of you have repeated, has a negative impact on growth and on the evolution of prices.
Thirdly, I entirely agree with those of you who have insisted on the need to continue moving ahead in relation to our energy efficiency and on policies to reduce our dependence on oil as an energy source.
I believe that the European Union has made significant advances in this respect over the last 20 or 25 years and that we must continue to make progress in this direction and intensify where necessary â and I believe it is clearly necessary in relation to certain aspects â common actions at European level in relation to energy policy.
By way of example, while I said earlier that, if the price of a barrel of oil remains at 50 dollars over the next two years, until the end of 2006, this would have an impact on the European Unionâs economy of a reduction in growth of around one point, the impact on the United Statesâ economy would be much greater, because their level of dependence on oil as a primary energy source is much greater than that of the European Union countries.
And of course, given that the impact of oil prices is negative, but is not spread equally across the different sectors of our society or the different production sectors, as many of you have pointed out, it is clear that we need to redistribute our efforts in order to deal with the situation of the sectors suffering most from the rise.
And the majority of you who have referred to this unequal distribution of efforts have referred, quite rightly, to the fisheries sector, firstly, and also to agriculture.
According to which rules and within which framework should we deal with this distribution of efforts or this particularly intense compensation in the sectors most suffering as a result of the rise in oil prices?
I would like to repeat three criteria.
Firstly, attention must obviously be paid to the principle of coordination â it benefits nobody to take unilateral measures at national level on issues which should be decided at European level, whether by the Ecofin Council or by the Agriculture Council.
On the 18th, the Agriculture Council began to analyse this issue and in the first debate the positions of the different Member States were not unanimous.
It is, therefore, true that the Commission must draw up initiatives and the new Commission â which I hope is confirmed next Wednesday â as the honourable Members are aware, will not just have a new Commissioner for Agriculture, but also a Commissioner specifically dedicated to fisheries, Mr Borg, and a new Commissioner for Energy, as the honourable Member said.
In addition to the Commission's initiatives, however, a consensus must be created at Council level both in terms of coordination, which is the responsibility of the Ecofin Council when it comes to measures of a fiscal nature, and in terms of any measures which may be adopted at the level of the production sectors, which were discussed during the first debate on the 18th.
There was no full agreement amongst the Member States.
Finally, we are all aware that we are going to have to continue discussing this issue over the coming months, but I will repeat what I said at the beginning.
We must do so in the knowledge that, structurally, the oil market is never going to be what it was ten, twenty or twenty-five years ago, amongst other things because there are new energy consuming countries with extraordinary economic potential and with a very high level of growth, but the direction taken by European energy policy is the right one and we must not change that direction but rather enhance it.

Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The price of a barrel of oil has exceeded the psychological barrier of USDÂ 50.
Although this figure is fluctuating, the tendency is upwards.
This rise is the result of a complex series of factors, including the invasion of Iraq, political and social instability in some of the big exporting countries, natural disasters, increased demand in countries with large populations and strong economic growth, and also speculation.
The International Monetary Fund says that a USDÂ 8 per barrel rise will cause a 0.5% fall in economic growth.
Consequently, whilst the downturn is not as severe as that of the seventies and eighties, the risks to the world economy and to its much-trumpeted upturn are enormous.
The first sectors to be affected by these oil price rises have been transport, fisheries and agricultural.
These sectors, particularly the last two, are already severely depressed.
Accordingly, Community restrictions on direct public aid to the sectors affected should be lifted, and measures should be taken and practical support provided at EU level in order to minimise the socio-economic impact of oil price rises.
The key issue, however, is much broader and more structural, and is due to the fact that the worldâs economy has never resolved the problem of its dependence on a resource that is finite and subject to speculation.
Â Â  â The increase in international and national oil prices is the result of the all-out attack by big business in its quest for greater profit and it directly affects the income of grass-roots families.
The consequences of this increase will be felt in particular by poor households during the winter, unless there are direct measures to provide them with financial support to cope with heating bills.
The spiralling increase in the price of 'black gold' is leading to a new, general wave of increases in the prices of widely consumed goods, on top of the constant price rises which have significantly eroded workers' incomes.
At the same time, the profits of the multinationals operating in the sector are multiplying at a rapid rate, the concentration and centralisation of capital is intensifying, to the detriment in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises and capital restructurings are being reinforced.
The increase in the consumption of energy in developing countries and the wars and escalations which the monopolies themselves cause are a pretext for increasing prices.
The real reason lies in the exploitation of productive resources for the benefit of the plutocracy and in the strengthening of it within a climate of generalised privatisation.
The only response to high prices is to be found in the fight of the workers against this barbarity and for radical change and for energy and other strategically important sectors to become the assets of the people and satisfy the contemporary needs of the workers.

Â Â  MrÂ President, it is rather strange that we are being asked to approve this urgent procedure.
After all, just a few days ago the Commission made appropriate and indeed important amendments to the proposal on the Agency.
To make things simpler, the same can be said of the Councilâs second request for urgent procedure concerning support for the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, because in both cases the Council and the Commission have only just tabled significant new proposals.
The committee will deal with these matters this evening, but in both cases and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should like to recommend that at this stage the request for urgent procedure be rejected.
Â Â  Mr President, as you know this vote will decide on the request for two urgent procedures concerning macro-financial assistance, one to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the other to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The two referrals are proposals for decisions aiming merely to extend the current expiration date of the financial packages, which are due to expire on 9 November 2004.
Yesterday the Committee on International Trade â the committee responsible for both referrals â held an extraordinary meeting to decide on the request for urgent procedure.
I would like to inform you, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, that it decided by a wide majority to accept the request for urgent procedure in both cases.
It also adopted the report on these two referrals through simplified procedures.
We believe that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia should not pay for problems in the handling of internal EU procedures.
However, before proceeding to the vote, I would call on the Commission not to abuse the urgency procedure, but use it only as a last resort and to always inform Parliament as soon as possible through the appropriate channels.
I regret to note that Parliament was not properly informed about the possibility of an urgent procedure in this case.
The handling of the case dossier, and the communication with Parliament, took place late and did not follow the appropriate channels.
I hope this will not be repeated.
That being said, and on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I wish to advise my colleagues to accept the requests for urgent procedure so that Parliament can adopt the committee's opinion on Thursday and so that the Council decision can be amended to allow the foreseen allocation of financial aid to Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we are very much in favour of this and support the request for urgent procedure.
I simply wished for formâs sake to point out that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists.
It is Serbia and Montenegro â a small point, but one that is regarded as very important, particularly in that part of the world.
That concludes the votes on requests for urgent procedure.
As Mr Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission, has not yet arrived, we shall suspend the sitting for a moment.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by MrÂ Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at a decisive stage of this important democratic process, the establishment of the new European Commission.
In June, a consensus of the Heads of State or Government nominated me as President of the Commission.
On 22Â July, Parliament gave me its confidence with a large majority.
I thank you for the honour that you bestowed on me.
I then put together my team, with the Councilâs agreement and based on the nominations by the Member States.
I also decided how responsibilities would be shared out among the Commissioners-designate and the main features of the new Commissionâs internal organisation.
Throughout this period I kept in constant contact with Parliament and I had the opportunity to meet all of the Members of the Council, except those Heads of Government of countries in which elections were held recently.
I appear before you today, ladies and gentlemen, to request approval for the future college.
This Commission is a team with a number of positive features: it contains more women than in any previous Commission; it contains representatives of the main political streams in Europe, Christian democrats and peopleâs parties, socialists and social-democrats, liberals and democrats; it contains people with extensive political experience, at both European and national level.
All of the Members of the future Commission are committed to defending and promoting our Unionâs interests, and are aware of their joint responsibility towards Parliament.
In its internal operation, the Commission will be guided by complete compliance with the principle of collective accountability.
As I said to you in July, and in accordance with your wishes, there are definitely no first-class or second-class Commissioners in this college.
It is also true that, broadly speaking, the Commission that I now propose to you has been received very favourably by the general public in Europe.
All the men and women in this Commission have attended hearings in the parliamentary committees.
This procedure, which has no parallel in the Member States, is an example of democracy in action at the heart of the European institutions.
Your hearings have revealed a broad consensus between Parliament and the future Commission.
In the vast majority of cases, Parliament's verdict has been positive.
In a few cases Parliament has identified weaknesses and asked for a response from me.
At the Conference of Presidents last week, I gave my reactions to the letters from the parliamentary committees.
Today I wish to clarify my position on the most important points, without going into details of the undertakings I have already given, and provide you with the additional steps I am ready to take.
In a specific case of a potential conflict of interest, I gave the strongest possible guarantees that the Commission's work in the field of competition policy will not be affected.
These guarantees are based on rules and procedures that are a matter of public record.
The Commission will always carry out its responsibilities in the area of competition impartially, independently, transparently and with assiduity and expertise.
Some doubts have been expressed about the mastery of the details of certain complex and technical portfolios, such as energy.
I can assure you that I have absolute confidence in the political skills of the Commissioners-designate and their ability to absorb and defend their brief, however technical.
In the case of the criticism levelled against one Commissioner-designate, relating to her former political career, I would remind you that this concerns allegations which can be dealt with under existing national control procedures, including judicial investigation.
At this point, no accusations have been made against this Commissioner-designate and she therefore retains my confidence.
I expect all Members of the Commission to meet the highest ethical standards and to comply fully with the Code of Conduct.
Let me say once again that I intend to use all the powers that the Treaty confers on me to ensure that this is indeed the case.
I will not hesitate to demand the resignation of any Member of the Commission who is manifestly not up to the job or who fails in the duties imposed upon him or her by the Treaty.
This also holds for cases brought up by Parliament, which I will actively consider before taking a final decision.
All the Members of the Commission have undertaken to tender their resignation if I ask for it.
Obviously this also applies to any possibility of a reshuffle during the mandate of the next Commission.
Once the Commission is approved by this Parliament, I will have the power to make the adjustments I may deem necessary.
The verdict on Mr Buttiglione's performance at one of the hearings he attended was positive, and at another hearing it was negative.
Following this hearing, I asked him for a clear explanation of his position.
He replied in writing, expressing his regret and reaffirming his commitment to the principle of non-discrimination.
I, for my part, would never accept anyone in my Commission who defends positions that are not compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I am sure that MrÂ Buttiglione will fully comply with the Treaty and the Charter and I can confirm that the rest of the Commissioners-designate share my view.
However, one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident: it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination.
For this I must thank Parliament.
This debate enables us to move from words to substance, and about substance no doubts are allowed.
This Commission will give civil rights and anti-discrimination policy top priority.
I have already told the Conference of Presidents â and I confirm this today to you â that I intend to create a group of Commissioners responsible for fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities.
This group, which I will chair, will monitor all Commission action and measure initiatives in these areas.
It will also act as the political driving force.
This group will not be a talking shop.
It will ensure that the action by the Commission in promoting fundamental rights and fighting against all forms of discrimination is cohesive.
It is my intention to set an ambitious agenda for this group. I will be ready to discuss it with you and to ask for your suggestions.
Already I can announce that I will make use of the results of a public consultation aimed at facilitating the creation of a European fundamental rights agency, which will take as its starting point the current Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna.
I will await Parliament's contribution before presenting a legislative proposal on this matter.
I also intend to initiate work with a view to a framework directive on the basis of Article 13 of the European Community Treaty, which will replace the directives adopted in 2000 and extend them to all forms of discrimination.
Currently, these directives have a limited scope.
With the framework directive, Community action will cover all areas of discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender or sexual orientation.
With this initiative, I am simply confirming even more clearly what has, from the very beginning, been one of the features of this Commission: that its very composition, with eight women in the college, affirms its determination to combat discrimination.
Lastly, I intend to launch a programme and an action plan to combat discrimination with particular reference to all forms of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia.
In this connection the future Commission will commit itself to relaunching negotiations on a framework decision on racism and xenophobia, which has been blocked in the Council for far too long.
All these initiatives, and others that might be considered by the group of Commissioners or suggested by you, will be prepared under my authority.
I am prepared to present them to you in person when the time comes â not just in plenary but, if necessary, in the relevant committee.
Let me make it very clear that I will personally assume full control of our action in the fight against discrimination and the promotion of fundamental rights.
So, as you see, I have listened carefully to Parliament's opinion.
I have taken into consideration your major concerns and objections and have provided substantive replies.
Some of you would have liked a more radical response and a reorganisation of the team, but is that a real option at this stage?
All the information I have, after careful consideration and extensive consultation, makes me think that changing the portfolios at this stage of the procedure would cause more political and interinstitutional problems than it would solve.
We should bear in mind that this process involves not only the President-designate and Parliament but also the Council, as a third and very relevant partner.
My team may not be considered perfect by all of you, but is there any team in any of our national governments that we can consider perfect?
However, it is recognised by many to be, on the whole, a very strong and balanced team.
I am convinced that we can do our job in the service of Europe and its citizens, under the political monitoring of this Parliament.
It was a great honour for me to receive your support and confidence in July by a very large majority.
I ask you now to support the solution I am proposing, as it is you who best serve the interests of the European Union at this point.
You will be able to judge the President and all the Members of the Commission later in the light of their actions and not just their words.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in July, I announced to you my intention to build a partnership for Europe â a partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security.
In order to achieve this, the new Commission must tackle some major issues, both at internal and international level.
It must meet the expectations of European citizens.
Fundamental institutional changes await us in the years to come, when the Constitution enters into force â as the Commission hopes it will â after it has been ratified by all of the Member States.
We must prepare for those changes.
We must also explain, clearly and objectively, to people the many advantages of the Constitution over the current Treaties.
This Constitution will significantly enhance both the democracy and the effectiveness of the European Union.
It will provide the EU with the appropriate instruments to address the actual needs and expectations of Europeans more effectively.
The main task of achieving ratification at national level naturally falls to the Member States, in accordance with the procedures laid down in their internal legal orders.
The future Commission, however, is more than ready to work with the Council and with Parliament to set up a common communication strategy.
The EU must place growth at the heart of its activities. Europe needs more growth, more jobs, more entrepreneurial spirit, more innovation and more research.
It must achieve reforms that foster economic dynamism.
It must invest in education and training, knowledge and technological development, so as to be a genuinely knowledge-based economy that is up to speed with the increasingly tough demands of international competitiveness.
Those reforms and that spirit of constructive change must form part of a sustainable development strategy that takes up the challenge posed by climate change and that appropriately addresses the issues of energy, transport and protection of the environment.
To this end, we must redouble our efforts at both internal and international level, in our quest for a coordinated strategy within a multilateral framework.
The Russian Federationâs ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is a tangible success of the multilateral strategy for the environment, which bodes well for the future.
A more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with maintaining the European social model, and I would add that a more dynamic and more competitive Europe is the only one in which we will be capable of completely safeguarding this model.
We must also bear in mind that, in some of our countries, we are still a long way from a genuinely fair level of social protection.
Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must progress in tandem.
It is clear that cohesion policy and actions aimed at creating a more competitive and more dynamic European economy are intrinsically linked and complement one another.
The new Member States in particular expect us all to make an effort in terms of cohesion and solidarity.
I am convinced that solidarity is a core value and abandoning it would endanger the character of our societies.
Solidarity â between generations, between members and groups of our societies, between Member States and regions â is not an abstract value.
It is a wise choice, which fosters social cohesion and which requires both political commitment and the appropriate financial resources.
Our European Union is not only an economic area; it is also a fully-fledged area of freedom, security and justice.
The Commission attaches the highest importance to implementing common policies in the areas of asylum and immigration â fair and balanced policies that are intended to promote economic and social integration for third-country nationals, policies that respect every individualâs cultural identity and the core values of European society.
In this area, cooperation with third countries is crucial.
I must state that I am opposed to setting up âcampsâ outside the EU.
The Commission will cooperate more extensively with third countries in order to help them deal with migratory flows.
Partnership with third countries is only possible if based on a joint undertaking and in compliance with international law.
Let me be clear on this point: the future Commission will work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to build international cooperation in this field.
It will urge those third countries that are our partners to sign up to and comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
This new Commission will also continue to work towards strengthening the security of us all, whilst respecting their civil liberties, to meet the tough challenges posed by the threat of terrorism.
The EU must play its full role on the international stage.
It has important responsibilities and must be a strong and credible partner.
It must continue to foster peace and stability and to strengthen the multilateral dimension in a wide range of areas.
We must strengthen relations with third countries and with regional organisations.
Cooperation with the United States must be based on a relationship of equals and on deep mutual understanding.
The election of a new US President, at the same time as the new Commission takes up its duties, gives us the opportunity to restore the transatlantic axis, regardless of the election result.
I firmly believe that the United States is ready to contribute towards setting up a more balanced relationship with Europe.
Whilst we want the United States to take a more multilateral approach, we must also, on our side, carry out our activities with greater unity and effectiveness.
We shall continue the process of enlarging the EU to include the candidate countries.
Our neighbourhood policy is also something that we see as a priority, a powerful tool in the EUâs external relations that will enable us to build stronger partnerships.
I believe that our continent stands a much greater chance of lasting peace with an enhanced stability policy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean countries.
I feel that development policy is essential for greater cooperation with the parts of the world that need our support and our assistance.
Ladies and gentlemen, next January, I shall appear before you in this House to present the EUâs strategic priorities.
This will not solely concern the Commissionâs legislative and work programme forÂ 2005.
My intention is to give the strategic programme a broader outlook.
In the spirit of the Constitution, I shall present to you the priorities for the next five years.
My aim is to reach an agreement on long-term programming with Parliament and the Council, and in so doing, I shall be addressing one of the main concerns expressed by Parliament.
In July I told you of my wish to establish positive cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
I strongly believe that the Commissionâs strength and credibility lie in Parliamentâs support and in active cooperation between our two institutions.
I have studied carefully Mr Borrellâs proposals on relations between our two institutions.
I await your resolution with interest and I am ready to respond most openly during tomorrowâs debate.
Let me say straight away that I am in favour of transparency and cooperation between our two institutions.
I hope that, as soon as the new Commission takes up its duties, negotiations will get underway between our two institutions aimed at introducing the necessary changes to the framework agreement.
Europe needs fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, the two institutions that are always at the forefront of the European project.
Ladies and gentlemen, an event of historic importance is almost upon us â the Constitutional Treaty is set to be signed in a few days, on 29Â October.
This is not a simple matter of revising the existing Treaties; it is the culmination of a long process involving Parliament, the Member States, the Commission, the national parliaments and civil society, aimed at making the EU more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.
As the representatives of the peoples of our enlarged Europe, you are aware of the magnitude of the European citizensâ expectations.
You are aware of the apathy and the scepticism that are affecting European democracy.
You are aware, as I am, of populist threats coming from people who wish to weaken Europe and who always seek to call into question the credibility of our institutions.
We must not give them any fresh arguments to use against us.
This is a momentous time for our countries and for the EU.
I have shared with you the principles that have guided the composition of my Commission and I have shared with you my intention to work closely with you throughout the next five years, so as to promote prosperity, solidarity and security.
We have no time to lose; the time has come to take action and to work together for the benefit of the citizens.
Let us devote our energies to promoting growth, jobs, harmonisation and the Lisbon strategy, to strengthening a dynamic knowledge-based economy and to promoting greater cohesion in our enlarged Europe.
This Commission is worthy of your confidence and deserves your support.
I appeal to your sense of responsibility.
I appeal particularly to your European commitment to express your confidence in this college.
We can build a stronger Europe on the foundations of this relationship of mutual respect and confidence.
Â Â  The representatives of the political groups and the other scheduled speakers are now going to speak.
I must inform you all that this debate must end by noon because that is when Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands will come into the Chamber.
The Chairman will therefore have to strictly monitor adherence to speaking times.
I am warning you of this so that the speakers can bear it in mind and so that the Chairman does not have to resort to turning off microphones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-elect of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on 22Â July, and by a large majority, Parliament expressed its confidence in the President-elect of the European Commission.
Today you are here with the team that has been proposed to you by the national governments.
MrÂ President-elect of the Commission, you have expressed your willingness to cooperate very closely with the European Parliament, and, while we welcome this, we will also take you at your word in the future.
We also very much welcome the further commitments you have entered into today.
We welcome your desire to be the President of a strong Commission, and several times you have mentioned the responsibility that you, as President, will have for determining overall policy.
That too is in our interests, for we need a Commission with a strong President, such as the European Union has enjoyed in the past.
Our group has tabled a motion for a resolution.
It is regrettable that the groups could not agree on a joint motion, but ours will be the yardstick for monitoring the Commission.
We expect the new Commission to agree its political and strategic programme in close cooperation with Parliament and we expect the Commission to be in regular attendance in Parliament and its committees, not only today â and it is impressive that they are all here â but also throughout the five years of its term of office.
Do not forget your responsibility to Parliament once you are confirmed in post tomorrow.
We expect the Commission to take the principles of subsidiarity very seriously.
We want a strong Europe, but we also have the identity of our nations, the identity of our regions and the identity â let us not forget â of our towns and villages.
What are our values?
The cornerstones of our free society are respect for the dignity of each individual, tolerance, pluralism and the rule of law.
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
The strength of our European cultural identity lies in the fact that we accept cultural difference and tolerate it.
It is my firm conviction that, if we stop doing so, then Europe will fail, and that means that no one in the European Union, no one in Europe, no one in the world should be discriminated against, including for their religious beliefs.
We want a Commission that is made up of a diverse range of people and not just one with people from all of the countries in the European Union, as the Treaty stipulates.
We want people from different cultural backgrounds, with a range of different religious beliefs or non-religious beliefs and convictions.
If we accept this â and it seems to me that this is what the Commission team represents â Europe has a good future ahead of it.
Everyone here should be aware that if this college does not win the vote of confidence tomorrow it will not mean that one, two, three or four Members will be replaced: no, the status of every member of the team that is here today will then be open to question.
This is not about one person, it is not about two or three people; it is about the whole college and we should be aware of that.
On Friday, we will have the signing of the European Constitution.
We all know how difficult it is going to be to win approval for this in those nations that are holding referendums.
And please bear in mind that if we were to get a result tomorrow â I do not think that we will, but if we did â that suggested to the European Union that we do not accept our cultural pluralism, it would make it even more difficult to have the constitution adopted in the 25 countries of the European Union.
All of this must be borne in mind.
Let me be quite frank, ladies and gentlemen, and say that I find it very moving to see public figures from 25 European countries sitting in front of us now.
When I was elected to the European Parliament in 1979, I could only dream that one day we might have Members of the Commission from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.
These public figures are here today in our midst.
It is our responsibility tomorrow to express our confidence in this Commission so as to secure Europeâs future.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, an impressive picture presents itself to my right.
The Council of the European Union feels that Queen Beatrix is representation enough today.
We should take note of that.
Because MrÂ Poettering is of course right that this is an important day.
Here we have a Commission President who is fighting for confidence in his Commission.
Parliament is here, as is the entire Commission.
Perhaps the Council will arrive later on.
MrÂ Barroso, you have made remarks that we have all heard before.
Today you added a few initiatives, but you still have not addressed a significant part of what my group has been trying to get over to you for days.
The point is that we expect you to draw the obvious conclusions from a six-week process that has taken place here in this Parliament.
For six weeks we have listened to the nominee Commissioners and have drawn conclusions in five different committees â controversial conclusions in the case of one particular Commissioner, who did not win a majority in one committee, and four further sets of conclusions in which serious comments were made, serious comments which led to proposals and suggestions being put to you.
And the answer that we are being given yet again today, MrÂ Barroso, is this: I will not change anything; the portfolios will not be reassigned.
That is a significant hurdle.
That is a hurdle.
I can only appeal to you once more to think again.
This morning, once again, I should like to tell you about the impression I get; it is that you are confusing the vote of confidence on your Commission with one in a national parliament.
The European Parliament does not form opposing majorities.
The European Parliament is â you are right there, MrÂ Poettering â heterogeneous.
It consists of diverse currents of opinion.
Even within our groups â as you of course know from bitter experience â there are very heterogeneous currents of opinion, and anyone who wants to win a large majority in this House has to show consideration for these different currents and try, as far as possible, to accommodate them all.
For weeks, your approach has been: I have a Commission, I have handed out the portfolios, and I am not prepared to make any changes!
If that is the case then even cosmetic changes in the form of announcements of initiatives are not going to help.
If that is the case then it will be very difficult for us to express confidence in your Commission.
This is also about the issue of confidence.
We know that we are voting on the Commission as a whole, not on individual Commissioners, however controversial they may be.
This being the case, the question becomes one of basic confidence.
At the end of the day, after weighing up all of the facts and all of the observations that have been made about individual candidates, do we have a fundamental confidence in this Commission as a whole, as a collective body, or do we not?
That is the salient question here.
Since we cannot pick out individual points but have to decide whether we have this fundamental confidence in the collective body, that is precisely what our group will be considering this evening.
Do we have this fundamental confidence, or do we not?
I have to say that I found nothing in your speech this morning to increase my confidence.
I should like to take up one point that you mentioned.
You referred to the US elections.
My group does indeed hope that John Kerry will be elected President.
We hope that he will be President because he is someone who says that the war in Iraq was a mistake.
We want the USA to be led by a President who says, yes, that was a mistake, and a leader who admits to his mistakes is what we want for Europe too.
One final comment: a democratic vote is a normal democratic act.
If this Parliament voices its confidence in your Commission, then you will have won.
That decision will have to be respected!
But if you do not have the confidence of this House tomorrow, it will not herald an institutional crisis, it will be a normal process, a normal right exercised by a freely elected Parliament in respect of an executive.
Â Â  . Mr President, three months ago, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats urged the Presidentâdesignate of the Commission to respect the prerogatives of this Parliament.
My Group and this House have offered a sober and considered rejection of his nominee for Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr Barroso, we recognise that you could work only with what you were given.
We recognise that your independence is not total.
We have, on the whole, offered our support for the other members of your Commission.
But our judgement stands, and it will be respected.
This Group supported you as President of the Commission; we voted for you; we still support you.
But we value the prerogatives of this House too highly to see them taken lightly.
I welcome the package of measures that you have put before this House today.
I believe you come here in a genuine search for rapprochement.
Some of the measures you propose are bold and all of them are important.
I believe that you are committed personally to the promotion of fundamental rights and that this spirit will infuse the Commission you will lead.
Liberals and Democrats will consider your proposals carefully.
But I am bound to say that they come late in the day and they contain little about Mr Buttiglione's future, a future which may be intimately bound to the future of the Commission-designate.
This House is not asking to be placated or patronised.
We are asking that the other branches of our European government recognise what our Treaties recognise and what the European Constitution recognises: that power in Europe rests in some measure with this Chamber and its elected Members.
The approval process is not a rubber stamp and this Parliament should not be treated as one.
It has been said often in the last week that it will be Liberals and Democrats who decide the fate of this Commission.
But Liberals and Democrats did not nominate the Commissioners rejected by Parliament's committees.
It was not Liberals and Democrats who would not or could not find the compromise that might have put Mr Buttiglione beyond the reach of controversy.
Whatever happens tomorrow, the fate of this Commission has more than one architect.
Moreover, I know that I am not the only one in this Chamber who feels that there is an invisible elephant in the room.
The elephant is Justus Lipsius.
The elephant is in the heads of the governments who gave you a weaker Commission than you deserve, and then refused to come to your aid when our House called their bluff.
How many of Europe's governments would have done what Mr Berlusconi probably did and told you to take their man, , even if it left you with a Commission containing a Commissioner whose political feet of clay would probably disqualify him from inclusion in most of the European Union's national governments?
My Group feels that Member States owe Europe their best and their brightest.
How many governments have shown their willingness to accept the democratic and legal right of our Parliament to judge the men and women who were proposed?
The silence you hear is the sound of Europe's governments leaving you and your new Commission swinging in the wind.
As the defenders of the Community method, the strength of our House is ultimately the strength of yours.
Because if the Council can mock the prerogative of this Parliament, then be absolutely sure that it thinks the same of the independence of your Commission.
The Council prefers this Parliament to be weak.
Too many in the Council find it convenient for the Commission to be weak.
My Group wants this Parliament to be strong, because we cannot conceive of a strong European Union without it.
And we want your Commission to be strong because the European Union needs an independent executive of the highest calibre.
We have demanded a new framework agreement with your Commission: draft it and sign it, so that we will not be brought to this impasse again.
This House faces a heavy choice.
If Liberals and Democrats vote against the Commission-designate, we will not do so lightly.
But we cannot, and we will not, diminish the status of this House, the standing of the Civil Liberties Committee or the stature of the post of the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs in the interest of an easy life.
You might say â if I can use Mr Buttiglione's own words â that we will not change our principles against our conscience for political convenience.
Â Â  In view of the repeated references to the Council, I must inform Parliament that the Presidency has sent a letter to the President-in-Office of the Council inviting him and the other members to attend this sitting.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, I shall speak in French so that there is no translator between us and that you understand completely what our group wishes to say to you.
Mr Barroso, you are a rather strange orchestra conductor.
After auditioning some of your musicians, we found a pianist on the oboe and violinists playing the drums and, following these auditions, we told you that the music did not sound right.
At which point you told us, âno problem â if a Commissioner here or there has a conflict of interests, he will be a part-time Commissioner and I, Barroso, will take care of things.
If a Commissioner is not very familiar with the agriculture dossiers, that is no problem, she will go on a course to catch up and she will take a written exam.
If a Commissioner for the environment is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is here.
If a Commissioner for energy does not know the technical aspects of the dossiers, that is no problem, there are night classes and he can go and catch up.
If a Commissioner for taxation is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is hereâ.
MrÂ Barroso, that is your first mistake.
We are not looking for a European superstar.
We want a Commission which is able to work.
I am sorry but your Commission â as you propose it â will not be able to work.
Mr Barroso, it is on television that we look for superstars; in this House we look for something else.
First mistake.
Second mistake, Mr Barroso â you have been on a tour of capital cities.
You asked Heads of Government to telephone Members of this House.
Mr Barroso, did MrÂ Schroeder, MrÂ Blair and Mr So-and-so take part in the hearings?
Were they here when the hearings took place?
No, they were not.
This is why, Mr Barroso, you must respect the institutions.
The Council nominated you.
You were elected with a healthy majority.
My group did not vote for you, but we recognise this election.
Then there were the hearings.
Please stop asking the offices of Heads of Government to disturb us.
In any event, the more they telephone, the fewer votes you will get.
Try to tread carefully.
Listen a little to the British Members of this House who are starting to become fed up with telephone calls from Downing Street.
Your third mistake, Mr Barroso â at this point I come back to what Mr Poettering said to us on the subject of cultural difference: âthere is no need for uniformity in this Houseâ.
Yes, Mr Poettering, nobody here criticises anyone whatsoever for their religious beliefs, their philosophical beliefs or their ideological beliefs.
Nevertheless, any religious or ideological fundamentalism is poison for democracy.
If a man campaigns against divorce, he is perfectly entitled to be against divorce and to wage a political campaign.
If a man campaigns against a womanâs right to have an abortion, he is perfectly entitled to be against abortion and to wage a political campaign.
If a man campaigns for the withdrawal of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation from the fundamental Charter and from the Constitutional Treaty, as MrÂ Buttiglione did by signing AmendmentÂ 444 of the Convention, he is perfectly entitled to do so, politically speaking.
We are perfectly entitled, however, to say that he is the least suitable person to defend the principle of non-discrimination in the European Union.
This is a political decision, not an ideological one.
Accordingly, let me state this once again: you cannot say in this House that democracy will be rejected by the general public if it is working; you cannot say that if there is a ânoâ vote here the general public will reject the Treaty.
The opposite is true â if Parliament shows its democratic colours, the general public will vote for that democracy and for that Constitutional Treaty.
We are defending democracy and we have had enough of the authoritarianism of orchestra conductors.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, is it reasonable to bring down a Commission because two or three Commissioners are not entirely satisfactory?
This presentation of the situation by the President-designate constitutes, as far as my group is concerned, a deeply flawed assessment of the crisis affecting the EU.
The recent mounting criticism of the Barroso team is nothing short of a clap of thunder in a calm sky.
Let me remind you that a not inconsiderable section of this House had, as long ago as July, expressed its mistrust of the rather too liberal choices that characterise MrÂ Barroso.
It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the college of Commissioners presented to us only serves to exacerbate all of these reservations.
By putting in the highly sensitive competition post an ardent devotee of market economics, as one analyst put it, an industrial lobbyist who represents and fosters dubious relations between public responsibilities and private interests, to the point of having been severely and unanimously reprimanded by his national parliament; by naming in the post of international trade a champion of free trade, who has no compunction about announcing that he puts his faith in competition to improve the performance of public services; by giving the internal market portfolio to a fundamentalist of liberalism, that of the environment to a conservative, for whom ecology appears to be the least of his concerns, and that of agriculture to a champion of the agricultural business, and so on and so forth, the President-designate has no doubt succeeded in convincing a number of doubters that he nurtured a particular idea of Europe that they certainly did not share.
Against the backdrop of this fundamental challenge to Mr Barrosoâs economic, social and environmental choices, the Buttiglione bomb has gone off.
MrÂ Barroso told us that he set great store by communication.
He has got what he wanted.
One single Commissioner has brought fame to the whole of his Commission, albeit at a considerable price.
The image of his team, whatever may have been the quality of some of its members, is forever tarnished with unworthy and anachronistic words that were not punished as they should have been.
If a candidate country displayed such fundamentalist beliefs on the place of women in society, and such discriminatory beliefs on homosexuality, it would be rejected.
At the very least, we should have done likewise with a European Commissioner.
Let me add that other statements made by MrÂ Buttiglione are also worthy of our attention, even if, or rather, all the more so, because the Council and the Commission have among their ranks a number of sympathisers with these dangerous ideas.
One such idea is to set up camps for migrants and asylum seekers in North Africa, on the subject of which Mr Buttiglione felt the need to clarify that they would not be, and I quote, âconcentration camps at all, but humanitarian centresâ.
Thank you for clearing that up.
A further example is the bellicose view of the fight against terrorism that MrÂ Buttiglione has trotted out: our society is afraid, we are at war, we will win. This is the message drummed out by the Commissioner-designate, picking up an old refrain dear to the current incumbent of the White House.
It is these elements that should influence our decision tomorrow.
Never, in the 25 years that I have seen colleges of Commissioners come and go, have I seen such an unloved Commission before it has even taken up its duties.
In fact, I firmly believe that, following the failure of the Santer Commission, then the stormy journey taken by the one that succeeded it, following the succession of increasingly bitter disputes between governments and the Commission, between governments themselves, between the Commission and Parliament, following numerous worrying signs of âeurofatigueâ among the general public â to use an expression often heard in the new Member States â not least after the elections, which were notable for a record low turnout, and given the fact that the draft Constitution might not be ratified in a few daysâ time, I firmly believe that the Barroso syndrome, which will tomorrow lead to an historic defeat or to a Pyrrhic victory, constitutes a new and powerful indicator of the deep crisis of a Europe without vision and without a unifying plan.
Clearly a root-and-branch review is needed to put some sense back into what could and should be one of the high adventures of our times.
Accordingly, my group, in a unanimous decision on the part of its 17 members, will tomorrow vote against the appointment of the Barroso Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, this row over MrÂ Buttiglione sums up the biggest problem of the European Union.
Across our continent there are many different cultures, different languages, different religions and different ways of living.
This attempt politically to force them all to become one will, in my opinion, never work.
In UKIP, we take no side on Mr Buttiglione's comments whatsoever.
Our reasons for opposing this Commission are different.
We oppose it because it an undemocratic institution.
Even if tomorrow this House kicks it out, what we will get is a new set of political appointees, and it will still continue to look like a rest home for failed domestic politicians.
It makes law, it produces law, in over 3Â 000 committees whose constitution nobody ever knows and has not been declared.
The Commission is the government of the European Union and it has the sole right to initiate law â something which the constitutional treaty does nothing to amend.
The Commission is the motor of integration.
The Commission is the guardian of treaties that are already unacceptable.
The Commission is the enemy of the nation-state.
That is what it is all about.
We will be voting 'no' tomorrow.
Perhaps the rather delicious irony is that, for the first time ever in this House, the UK Independence Party will be with the majority.
Â Â  Mr President, following Mr Farage's comments, I note that this is the first time ever that UKIP will vote with the Communists!
Here in Parliament over the last six weeks, we had a series of hearings where we put the Commissioners-designate through their paces.
As a result, as every speaker so far has said, certain committees raised questions on the suitability, or otherwise, of individuals.
In fairness, Mr Barroso has responded: he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns.
However, Mr Barroso rightly has not rolled over and died in front of the onslaught that has taken place, over the last week in particular.
We need mutual respect between all the institutions of the European Union, and an understanding that power does not rest within one institution alone and that we are interdependent on each other.
From some of the speeches this morning and our discussions over the last week that if you have experience in business or politics, if you have strongly held beliefs, if you have a strong ideology, if you have a strong opinion, then, according to some, you are not suitable to be a Commissioner of the European Union.
And yet what Europe is trying to find at the moment â in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of today's re-united Europe is properly represented within all the institutions â is people who have opinions, people who have visions, people who can best represent the countries that nominate them.
Again, what seems to be forgotten in this whole discussion and debate is that in July this House gave its endorsement and its confidence to Mr Barroso.
That was not done in isolation: President Barroso already had confidence placed in him by the governments of the 25 Member States who put his name forward for that position.
Each of the national governments had nominated the people they considered to be the best for the position of Commissioner in the European Union.
It is incumbent on us to play our role within the democratic make-up of the institutions of the European Union, but it is also our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow it to degenerate into domestic political discussions and false accusations with regard to ideology or 'who said what to whom'.
Let us become the voices of a new world.
Let us represent the peace, the tolerance and the acceptance that the European Union should truly represent.
Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form.
Let us give credit where credit is due: Mr Barroso has moved, he has brought forward new initiatives and new policies.
Let us ensure that we can show the same tolerance that we expect of others.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not be supporting Mr Barroso, as I mentioned before during my first speech in this House, because he represents anti-European powers and anti-European interests, and he is the sole representative of a contradiction, full of conflicts of interest, and of a Commission that I consider anti-European in its very essence.
Let us not forget that, amongst other things, MrÂ Barroso has openly supported US intervention in Iraq.
I therefore hold him jointly responsible for the stand that certain European countries have taken alongside the United States, a stand that has caused serious harm and damage to the whole of our continent.
To defend our Europe and our interests as Europeans, the Commission and its President should be adopting a very different stand.
I call on my fellow Members not to vote for the Barroso Commission.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, you have heard the reservations expressed by previous speakers as regards certain hearings, for reasons of competence, for subjective reasons, or indeed because what was said in some of those hearings was blatantly distorted.
Against this backdrop, you managed to give a political answer, safeguarding both the Commissionâs character, which is that it has a President in sole charge â a specific political figure â and that of the college.
You also managed, therefore, to take advantage of the political reality of the Commission to endeavour to answer at least some of the pertinent criticisms made in this House.
You did the right thing.
You did the right thing by refusing to commit the cardinal sin of buckling at the outset of a Commission that, for the good of Europe, must be a strong Commission with strong leadership.
It is clear that this is not the time for a false crisis.
At a time when we must consolidate the enlargement, the Lisbon Strategy, the Turkey issue, the issue of the Financial Perspectives and so many others, the last thing we need is a false crisis.
You have done everything to prevent such a crisis.
You have done the right thing.
If you keep up this determination and continue to show respect for Parliament, you will continue to enjoy our support.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ President.
You have said yourself, MrÂ Barroso â and it has already been stated today â that you want to be the President of a strong Commission.
There are actually a whole series of Commissioners who have shown themselves to be very strong, including in the hearings, for example those sitting in your immediate vicinity today.
And there are many Commissioners who, as you said, have the potential to be very good Commissioners once they have acquired the necessary technical knowledge.
Even though many of them hold views on politics and social policy that are not akin to our own, we are convinced that they will make suitable Commissioners, and so we have approved them.
There are a number of cases, however â and you have had to defend them today, which is already unfortunate at the start of a new Commission â that are going to cause problems in the Commission in the years to come.
Of course there is one Commissioner in particular whom we do not consider fit to head the department that he has been allocated.
It is true, as has already been said many times, that MrÂ Buttiglione has every right to hold these views, which we do not share.
But if he holds these views, and if he also, and repeatedly, acts in accordance with them, then he is not fit to hold the portfolio that you have allocated to him.
This must be made absolutely clear.
MrÂ Barroso, the problem is no longer just MrÂ Buttiglione.
By acting or not acting in the way you have, you yourself have made the Buttiglione case into a Barroso case.
This is regrettable and it will certainly have a significant bearing on our decision this evening.
Although you have just made a series of proposals, MrÂ Barroso, you are still not taking Parliament seriously, as much of what you are selling here is already in the pipeline.
You act as though you were responding with something new.
But you are not responding, you are simply taking up what already exists.
You are selling old wine in new skins.
We cannot accept this.
We will give it very careful consideration, but I do not believe that we will be able to accept Parliamentâs being approached in this way because it is not a true reflection of reality.
What is more, MrÂ Barroso, your proposal to create a kind of sub-Commission within the Commission is already being mocked by MrÂ Buttiglione.
He is making fun of it and is slandering a fellow nominee Commissioner, MrÂ Å pidla.
Is this any way to treat your proposals for the Commission itself?
You did not comment on this.
I would be glad if you were to do so.
What do you think of a member of your Commission slandering another member of the Commission, making false claims about them and mocking your proposals?
That is precisely why we cannot derive much comfort from what you have proposed today, President Barroso.
I regret to say that I wish things could have been different.
You have not convinced us.
You have not even made a serious attempt to convince us.
Â Â  â MrÂ Barroso, I voted for you in July because I believe that you have the potential to be a good President of the Commission.
I also voted for you because you made three pledges, namely that there would be more women in this Commission â you have delivered on this; that there would not be any super-Commissioners â you have delivered on this too; and that you would remove Commissioners from their departments, take away their portfolios or discharge them entirely if they did not have the confidence of Parliament.
These pledges will once again determine how we vote tomorrow.
I would therefore ask you, MrÂ Barroso, to take this very seriously.
I am pleased that you wish to steer a very definite liberal economic course with your Commission.
I am also pleased that you are making human rights a matter for decision at the highest level, but Parliament is the assembly that represents the people of Europe.
Take the vote seriously; discharge Commissioners who do not have the confidence of Parliament!
That is right for Europe and right for democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Barroso referred to our Committee hearing process as an example of democracy in action, but that process, without the accompanying power to approve or reject individuals, makes our hearings more of a charade.
After the hearings, I heard spokespeople for certain political groups express deep disappointment at the performance of certain individuals but go on to say that because he or she was a member of their political family, they would support them anyway.
Mr Barroso acknowledged certain specific weaknesses â conflicts of interest â and claimed to have attempted to deal with that.
I think conflicts of interest are as much about perception as actuality.
Surely, it is not too much to expect each individual to have done enough homework to be able to demonstrate that they have mastered their brief.
Citizens' expectations and our sense of responsibility were referred to.
My sense of responsibility demands that I vote against the Commission tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since you first stood before this House, our reasons for voting against you have increased.
We have already told you what these reasons are: they are called war, which you have supported, and policies, of which you are a prime representative.
It is no coincidence that today we are adding another reason: democracy.
You cannot say that you want to cooperate with Parliament and start by not respecting its vote.
You cannot say that people are experiencing a crisis in democracy and set that kind of example.
Our vote against you and your Commission is therefore a vote in favour of peace, social Europe, democracy and also a new maturity for this Parliament of ours.
If you and your Commission are defeated, Parliament and democracy will be the winners, and the people will have more confidence in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, this House has heard some home truths. Commissioner-designate Buttiglione has reminded us all of the meaning of marriage and the family, and of the role these institutions play in society, a role sanctified by time and by the experience of generations.
We fully support everything MrÂ Buttiglione has said on these issues.
His critics assume the moral high ground, and this is wrong.
It is actually MrÂ Buttiglione who holds this moral high ground.
Unfortunately, however, we will not be able to give him our support in terms of votes, as we are to vote on the Commission as a whole, and this Commission contains 25 Commissioners.
Our support for one of these Commissioners must not be allowed to outweigh our opposition to the remaining 24.
The way in which the Commission is appointed is exceptionally undemocratic.
As a general rule, those nominated by governments as potential Commissioners have no chance of gaining support from voters in their own countries, and have met with public disapproval precisely as a result of their activities to date.
This was certainly how the Polish Commissioner-designate, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, was chosen, and our opinion of her is a negative one.
I am sure the same is true of the Commissioners-designate from the other post-Communist countries.
In view of the outgoing Commissionâs attitude to Poland, and the unfair conditions upon which we were admitted into the EU, which differed greatly from those granted to the German Democratic Republic, there is every reason for us to have the gravest reservations about the European Commission as an institution.
We cannot support it.
I apologise to MrÂ Buttiglione.
Our vote against this Commission is not directed at him personally.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate sparked off in this House by the extreme Left is a debate Europe could well do without.
What Europe and the Barroso Commission do need to do here and now is get down to work to solve the problems faced by millions of citizens of our continent in both the new and old Member States.
This ideological debate, initiated without any sense of shame by the extreme Left in this House, is an extremely dangerous precedent.
If the Barroso Commission is actually rejected it will be a sign that Catholics are prohibited from practising their faith in Europe.
This is something we cannot agree to.
Â Â  Mr President, you deserve our support and you will have it.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, in July this House endorsed MrÂ Barrosoâs candidature as President of the Commission.
Three months have passed since that time, and neither MrÂ Barroso nor this House have changed in any way.
Mr Barroso does not select the Commissioners-designate. That is the job of the Member Statesâ governments.
Yet although the governments sometimes put forward controversial candidates, it is unfortunately not the governments, but MrÂ Barroso himself who has to swallow the bitter pill today.
I should like to make it clear, however, that we do not object to the vast majority of the members of MrÂ Barrosoâs team.
I believe MrÂ Barroso will honour the promise he made today before this House, namely that he will change the make-up of his Commission during his term of office, if the situation so requires.
To use a metaphor, MrÂ Barrosoâs blank cheque of confidence should be renewed, but we must also pay close attention to what he does with this cheque.
MrÂ Barroso, I wish you luck.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Barroso, this is no ordinary moment in the history of the European institutions; we are in the process of drawing up a Constitution for Europe.
A Constitution is more than just another Treaty and the stage leading up to the adoption of a Constitution is not just another stage.
How must politicians behave at a time when we are drawing up a Constitution?
We must be in a position to partially put aside our ideological differences and our party differences.
What are we going to ask of the European citizens when we ask them to support the European Constitution?
That they put aside their ideological differences in order to vote for a constitution for everybody.
We are going to ask supporters of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, socialists, liberals and conservatives to vote together for the Constitution.
And how can we ask them to make this effort and to behave in this way if we are emphasising our ideological differences and our partiesâ strategies differ more than ever?
Parliament must be the exemplary institution during this formative period.
Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage by all the citizens, and the social environment our societies require demands that we start by creating a political environment which is based on the greatest possible degree of cohesion and unity.
We therefore want to act in a manner which is consistent with this political environment which the adoption of the European Constitution is going to require, by supporting Mr Barroso unequivocally.
Some people believe that a defeat for Mr Barroso will be a victory for the European Parliament.
I must tell them that they are wrong: it will be a success for those who do not believe in the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, for the first time in the history of the European Union, the appointment of the new Commission has attracted a great deal of attention throughout the European media.
This is partly due to the very particular way in which MrÂ Buttiglione has commented on the interpretation of fundamental civil rights in Europe and the wounding remarks he has made about large groups of people.
My group is not alone in finding these remarks unacceptable and totally inappropriate for a future Commissioner who has the specific task of defending the fundamental rights of every European citizen.
The way in which the next President, Mr Barroso, has so far defended MrÂ Buttiglione leads us to believe that the opinions held in large parts of this Parliament are of no great concern to him.
As you stated this morning, a reshuffle is out of the question.
What threw into relief the problems surrounding MrÂ Buttiglione was the open and direct manner in which the European Parliament heard the new Commissioners.
Bearing in mind the urgent need for clarity, and without any preconceived ideas, the Members of this House have tested the new Commissioners on their vision of the future and the functioning of the European Union.
It is certainly true of my group that the work that has been carried out painstakingly over the past four weeks forms the basis for the ultimate judgment we will be passing about this Commission tomorrow.
This is not just about the provocative statements Mr Buttiglione has made.
It has become evident to us that a number of other candidate Commissioners do not always display sufficient knowledge and dedication for the roles they may be playing over the next five years.
Thanks to the in-depth and serious manner in which Parliament has acquitted itself of its task in the hearings, the failings of a number of candidates have become apparent.
I refer to the almost total lack of commitment to Europe on the part of the new Latvian Commissioner, Mrs Udre, and also to the various conflicts of interest that will make it virtually, if not totally, impossible for the Dutch candidate Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, to fulfil her role on a number of important issues.
The outstanding issues surrounding a few Commissioners and the weak performance of some others are not the only problem.
At least equally important is the fact that, during the hearings, only a few of the future Commissioners appeared to have a clear vision of the role of the European Union.
As a result, they were hardly capable, if not incapable, of setting clear priorities for the Commissionâs coming term of office, or of setting a good example for Europeâs global role.
The Social Democrats want the European Union to play a strong role in the world and apply effective multilateralism in order to reinforce peace and democracy.
Europe should offer a clear and coherent alternative to counteract the unilateral approach of the United States.
It is disappointing that during the hearings, few innovating ideas emerged from the Commission on this score.
The open and direct way in which the European Parliament has welcomed the future members of the Commission has given rise to great expectations.
Over the past four weeks, we have shown the European public that we want a new Commission with competent and honourable governors who also have clear ideas about Europeâs future course.
Tomorrow, the European public are expecting from us a clear verdict about the Commission presented by Mr Barroso.
Although a number of the candidate Commissioners clearly meet the high requirements prescribed by us, our general verdict about the Commission cannot be positive at the moment, not even after this morning.
Â Â  Madam President, quite apart from Parliamentâs political existence, what is at stake here is the whole question of the balance between the European institutions.
Do we want the future of Europe to be decided tomorrow behind closed government doors or do we believe, more than ever, in the need to build a democratic Europe?
Madam President, you have chosen to disregard Parliamentâs opinions and votes, in order, I believe, not to upset the Council.
You had the historic opportunity to gain your independence and thereby to help increase the Commissionâs authority and that of our Community method.
You chose to do the opposite. This is something that we must not and cannot accept because, quite apart from our own Parliamentâs powers, what is at stake here is the very question of Europeâs democratic future.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many members of the proposed Commission have my heartfelt support.
Unfortunately, however, the only option left to me is to vote against it.
The task of the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs is to oversee the implementation of civil rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the applicant countries as well.
To the conservatives, those of you who argue against accession negotiations with Turkey on the basis of human rights concerns, I say this: how can you support a man for this job who declares entire groups of people to be sinful and bad?
What sort of signal does this send to Turkey and the other applicant countries?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was also concerned about the replies given to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by MrÂ Dimas, Commissioner-designate for the Environment.
MrÂ Dimas did say he felt that environmental protection promoted economic development, which delighted us.
He did not, however, present any sort of action plan or anything concrete on how environmental protection should be developed, and this worried us.
I hope that MrÂ Dimasâs work will prove our fears to be unfounded.
Â Â  â Mr Barroso, your idea of a Europe with limited sovereignty, subordinate to the United States, is something we have already discussed over the past few days while examining your programme.
This morning, however, we have come across a further quality of yours: arrogance.
For you, Parliament does not count or, rather, it counts for very little.
That was apparent when you arrived late and did not even apologise, unlike Mr Prodi, who arrived late but did apologise.
Yours is a mediocre Commission on account of its hyperliberalism, on account of all the privatisation, and for the fact that it does not condemn the war.
It contains some mediocre Commissioners and, in Mr Buttiglione, a terrible, medieval Commissioner who damages Italyâs image and stands for a return to the past, to the most reactionary Middle Ages, riven with racial, sexual and gender discrimination.
For these reasons we shall be voting against your Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, both Dutch Members of the Independence and Democracy Group are very disgruntled about the fuss that has been created following statements by the candidate Commissioner Mr Buttiglione, and that is putting it mildly.
This is a case of discrimination on the basis of religious conviction, and that is something of which the European Parliament should not be guilty.
What is described as tolerance means tolerating only what progressive Europe wants to hear.
Mr Buttiglione has never called for the rights of women and homosexuals to be jeopardised.
He has merely given his personal opinion in response to a specific question. That is constitutionally acceptable.
However, a conscious attempt has been made to find a stick to beat a dog.
It appears that a minister from the Berlusconi Cabinet is unacceptable from the very start.
By rousing popular feeling in this manner, the European Parliament wants, indirectly, to have an impact on individual Commissioners.
As Dutch Members of the Independence and Democracy Group, we see the present proposal for the composition of the new European Commission as a reason to vote in favour of it.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is incredible that this morningâs debate has not focused on the new Commissionâs commitments and the current emergencies, which arouse such strong feelings among the citizens whom we represent.
We have not talked about immigration policies, the fight against terrorism, the reform of the Structural Funds or the reform of the Stability Pact.
The stage of our little European theatre has been taken over by a thoroughly ideological and calculated attack on the Commission-designate and in particular on the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione, who is guilty of having personal opinions and religious beliefs.
The apologies which the Commissioner-designate did in fact offer were not enough; even the changes which the President-designate did in fact make were not enough: people want to settle a score at all costs.
That is unacceptable.
Voting down the Commission tomorrow â let us not pretend otherwise â would lead to an institutional crisis that we really do not need right now.
Just two days away from the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome, which ought to be a solemn, historic moment, we really cannot allow ourselves a pathetic act of weakness that would be totally out of keeping with the expectations of Europeâs citizens and of the world as a whole.
What would be quite clear to them yet again would be the total lack of any political or institutional substance in the Community institutions.
Â Â  Madam President, President Barroso, in Europe there are 50 million poor people, small farmers are under threat, necessary investment is not being undertaken due to the austerity pact, and in the meantime what are we talking about?
Mr Buttiglione!
It is true that this philosopher has behaved in a rather dubious fashion. He has quoted Kant, Hegel and Carl Schmitt, but, tellingly, he has not quoted Socrates, who, himself, had a somewhat modern sexuality.
Clearly, this is a case of discrimination.
When President Borrell, however, contemptuously suggested that Mr Buttiglione should take care of agriculture, what was he trying to say?
That because pigs were rarely homosexual, they would not be a source of embarrassment to MrÂ Buttiglione?
When it comes to agriculture, incidentally, I shall not speak about MrsÂ Fischer, her interests in a sugar multinational, nor her family pig farms businesses that relocated to Russia.
The composition of your Commission is perhaps more balanced than it might appear.
The competition Commissioner, for example, is from a background of unbridled capitalism.
She will have her victims but MrÂ Buttiglione will pray for her.
You are therefore inventing the compassionate capitalism Commission.
There are contradictions, it is true, but we know from Chairman Mao that a distinction must be made between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, and you are a Maoist!
This is also why Cohn-Bendit says: turn the spotlight on the Barroso Commission!
Ultimately, however, we know that we end up with Deng Xiaoping, so it matters little whether Barroso is white like pale capitalism, or black like Mr Buttiglione. What matters is that he catches mice.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will be voting on a team, the individual players of which we have been able to put to the test.
That is something quite unheard of in other parliaments.
The selection, however, was done elsewhere.
The coach has put his team together in consultation with the management, in the full knowledge that each member of that management was allowed to designate one player.
We do not find all the players equally agreeable; we would have liked to see some more women and, above all, some more players with a jersey in our colour.
We, too, though, are bound by rules, and it is not up to us alone.
Some players have weaknesses, but all of them have enough experience on the field, have promised fair play and have accepted the authority of the coach and all of them realise that it will be an important match.
For those who may not be positioned correctly, additional man cover has been provided, and the coach can change people around at any time and, if necessary, send them off the pitch.
With that coach we have already agreed to play, and we are indeed counting on him to turn this team of twenty-four into a cohesive team and to ensure that it will end up in a higher division than last season.
That is what the supporters want too; above all, they also want the match to begin at last.
A certain degree of drama, but not too much, is always a bonus.
What counts is what is on the scoreboard and the points that are awarded during the match.
I believe that this team can take office.
I have confidence in them, and taking office is, of course, not the same as being given a blank cheque.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to point out that in our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs we attempted to evaluate MrÂ Buttiglioneâs personal suitability for managing the portfolio of fundamental rights, of legal cooperation and of asylum and immigration.
In each of those fields, MrÂ Buttiglione proved problematic.
During his hearing before the Civil Liberties Committee, MrÂ Buttiglione showed that he was completely out of step with what we are constructing in our committee.
This was the case not only as regards fundamental rights, but also the right to asylum, the European arrest warrant and judicial assistance in criminal matters.
The Civil Liberties Committee could scarcely decide in favour of awarding this portfolio to MrÂ Buttiglione.
Mr Barroso, as guardian of the Treaties you must defend Parliamentâs rights.
We therefore call on you to take our opinions on board.
We feel that it would be unthinkable for you to force this through.
The adjustments that you have suggested are unacceptable, not to say humiliating, for the Commissioners concerned.
Parliament carries out its duties, all of its duties.
We are the representatives of the people and this is not an institutional crisis at all.
This is democracy in action.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in July this group placed its confidence in you on the strength of the promise you made to us of a cooperative relationship, like the one your predecessor Mr Prodi had with us.
You were chosen by the Council, and your Commissioners by the national governments.
Our job is to examine your Commissioners and give them a vote of confidence.
We have done our job carefully and expressed criticisms about five Commissioners.
Today you ask us to trust you; my reply to you is that you, rather, should trust Parliament and its judgments.
Personal assurances, or promises of a reshuffle after the vote, are not enough.
Political selections are made first, not afterwards.
We have not changed our minds about the aim of building a strong relationship between the Commission and those who democratically represent the people of Europe.
Show that you too have not changed your mind by making new selections today, not tomorrow. Otherwise, on behalf of the Italian delegation in the ALDE Group, I say that we will vote against this Commission.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, I should like to rebut one assertion very strongly: our rejection of MrÂ Buttiglione has nothing to do with any desire on our part for a return to the days when people with certain views were banned from becoming civil servants; neither does it have anything to do with any desire to undermine citizensâ freedoms.
The subjective freedom of religion is something that we would always defend as a constitutional right, but MrÂ Buttiglione has cast himself in the role of , an in the new Commission.
He is acting on behalf of MrÂ Berlusconi to attack an enlightened Europe and, faced with such an attack, MrÂ Barroso, this Parliament has to defend itself.
However, it is not just MrÂ Buttiglione whom we need to debate today.
Let us take, for example, the Commissioners-designate MrÂ KovÃ¡cs and MrÂ Dimas.
As a Member of the Greens, and I do not want us to ignore what we have learned, 20 years since the first report of the Club of Rome and ten years, more than ten years, since the first conference on climate change in Rio, about the ecological ...
Â Â  Madam President, for me, there are two reasons for voting against this proposed Commission.
The political composition is a clear step to the right for the EU.
Free-market liberals and right of centre politicians dominate most key areas.
It is therefore obvious that, as a socialist, I should vote against it.
It is also obvious that quite a few of those appointed are quite unsuitable for their tasks.
During questioning in the committee, MrÂ Dimas, as a nominated Commissioner, showed that he lacked both the necessary knowledge of environmental policy and a vision of its future.
There are similar problems in the energy area.
The nominated Agricultural Commissioner is a landed property owner, and the candidate for competition issues has very strong links with large-scale industry.
The person who is to protect the rights of women, homosexuals and refugees is opposed to equality, is homophobic and wishes to restrict the right of asylum.
One wonders if it can get much worse.
Â Â  â Madam President, MrÂ Berlusconiâs government has committed a grave sin, as Professor Buttiglione would say, by not confirming Mr Monti, a man trusted by the major powers.
MrÂ Buttiglione has thus been attacked, as chance would have it, by the very politicians who in the last parliamentary term voted in a member of the Bilderberg Club as European Ombudsman and may be preparing to do so again.
In practice, however, the fact remains for us that this Commission seems to be entrenching the European superstate project, as sketched out by the new Constitution, which to us is unacceptable for the very same reasons that are put forward to support it: the rights to freedom and the rights of the regions, peoples and nations, which this project wants to overwhelm.
We see it every day in the measures that are adopted: peoples and regions have their voices and even their languages, their minority languages, stifled.
This is not the European project of which the founding fathers dreamt, this is not our story, and we therefore express our disapproval of this project.
Â Â  Madam President, in the run-up to this debate we have seen left-wing and Liberal hysteria reach a crescendo.
When put to the test, those who talk the most about human rights and freedom of speech have hypocritically displayed themselves as utterly intolerant in their virulent attacks on Commissioner-designate Buttiglione.
I regret that the President of this Parliament diminished his office by joining the left-wing herd in what, however it is dressed up, amounts to a denial of the Commission-designate's right of freedom of thought and speech.
It is a sad commentary on moral probity in this House that one who dares to hold to moral rectitude is so relentlessly vilified.
However, for me the defining issue is something else. It is that I will not endorse by my vote government by unelected placemen.
I for one will not lend the veneer âŠ
Â Â  . â According to the proposals in the Constitutional Treaty accepted by the 25 governments, the Commissionâs future president will be able to choose, in the case of each country, from three government-designated candidates.
Nevertheless, this year not a single government has bothered, or rather was brave enough, to nominate several candidates.
The elected president of the Commission had no opportunity to choose.
He could select only from the few options put forward by Member States.
Governments made their nominations in many ways: some sent to the Commission those they wanted to get rid of.
However, there were wise governments, and fortunately, those that proposed their most talented politicians were in the majority, thus helping along the collective European issue.
In the opinion of our group, those who have done particularly well were: Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Dalia Grybauskaite, Charlie McCreevy and those who gave a particularly weak performance were Ingrida Udre, LÃ¡szlÃ³ KovÃ¡cs or Neelie Kroes.
It takes someone on the ball to forge a unified team from this motley crew: a European government that is able to halt the Commissionâs loss of prestige that has been going on for years.
President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso has proved already as Prime Minister that he is strong and a true leader.
I am sure that he will be capable of getting together a good Commission.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will judge the work of the currently forming Commission according to what extent it will be able to create more unity, more cohesion and more competitiveness in the Union: to bring it closer to the citizens, to improve citizensâ standard of living and security, to help the joining up of the new Member States and to promote minority rights.
He who seeks to indulge in short-term political personal interest threatens the stability of the Unionâs institutions and plunges the big plan of the newly united Europe into crisis.
If we were to look at our personal considerations, we would not support more candidates either.
However, we are looking at the issues of a common Europe.
The stake is high and I hope that the European Parliament will not fail.
Â Â  In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have heard four candidate Commissioners, two men and two women.
Although we have great respect for your attempt to get more women in the Commission, unfortunately, we do have some issues around the two ladies in this Commission and are still waiting for responses and reactions to those issues on a number of scores.
With regard to Mrs Kroes, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs asked you to publish the legal advice on the basis of which she has drawn up the code of conduct by means of which she intends to avoid conflicts of interest.
She herself, during the hearings, agreed to it being published.
Can you tell us why that has not yet been done?
A second question concerned clarification from you as to how you view the issues that she explains away in connection with her past dealings.
Are you handling these matters yourself?
Will you be setting up a working party for that purpose?
How can you guarantee to us that no other conflicts of interest are involved and that those issues will be properly dealt with?
I would now like to turn to the other candidate, MrsÂ Udre.
During the hearing, she indicated repeatedly that she cannot be blamed for the suspicion levelled at her party in connection with receiving anonymous donations.
This is very difficult for us to judge.
We have asked you to launch an inquiry, or have one launched, into the facts and to provide us with information about this and also with your assessment.
That question, too, is still on the table, and we would like to see it resolved.
Â Â  Mr President, first I would like to thank the Commissioners who willingly underwent the hearings process; it was a gruelling experience for all concerned.
The process is far from perfect; there are certainly improvements that can be made, but the legitimacy of the process is accepted, not only by the Commission and the Parliament, but also by the Council.
There are serious political consequences, and we are now preparing to draw our conclusions.
I have to say to President-designate Barroso that if we vote the Commission down, we will not be creating a constitutional crisis.
The institutions are acting within their Treaty powers.
We will be creating a political drama, but Parliament is breathing democracy into the constitutional settlement that we are to sign up to with so much pride in Rome on Friday.
If the first Barroso team is rejected, we look forward to seeing the second Barroso team as soon as is practicable.
Â Â  Madam President, I was worried and I remain worried.
Of course you are not to blame for the envoys sent by the Pope, Mr Chirac, Mr Blair and Mr Schroeder, to name but a few.
You are responsible, however, for awarding portfolios to your Commissioners.
Some Commissioners-designate have scandalised Europe with their words.
Others have convinced us of nothing else but the fact that they were the wrong people for the wrong job at the wrong time.
Such was the case with MrÂ Dimas in environment, who refused to see the sword of Damocles above our heads.
Climate change and the effects of wastefulness on our planet mean that we must find other ways of thinking than purely productivity-based economics and other ways of governing than pure liberalism.
Sustainable ecological development is crucial, whether we like it or not.
Inequality is on the rise, nature is being exploited, society is taking backward steps, health care is being ravaged, all the warning signs are on red alert and what your college proposes is to continue along the same inflammatory path.
Given that our European dream is in danger of turning into a liberal nightmare, that our actions today are a crucial influence on tomorrow and that the citizens of Europe are demanding a more ambitious Europe, my answer is no, I cannot place my confidence in this team.
Â Â  Madam President, ever larger groups of EU citizens view with disquiet the way in which the self-determination of the Member States is continually undermined.
In spite of all the talk about subsidiarity, political power is progressively being transferred to the institutions of the European Union.
Yet MrÂ Barroso points with pride to the fact that the Commissioners he is proposing are undisguised federalists from the right and from the socialists and liberals.
They will campaign vigorously in favour of the draft Constitution, he promises.
For those of us who have been given democratic mandates in democratic elections to campaign against the centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project and for those of us who have been given democratic mandates to reject the draft Constitution, this Commission is therefore unacceptable.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, which I represent in this Chamber together with Mr De Michelis, I confirm that your Commission has our vote.
It is a Commission born, alas, amid countless arguments concerned more with national issues and hidden agendas than with problems of Community-wide scope and importance.
We have confidence in you, Mr Barroso, and we look forward to policies that are equal to the new challenges Europe will have to face.
I am the youngest Member of this Parliament and, as a representative of my age group, I feel I am pinning on you the hopes and expectations of a new generation of Europeans.
This generation has an appeal to make: now that we have created a monetary and financial Europe, let us make every effort to create a Europe of Europeans, a continent that at last has a single voice and a single heart but one that respects all its individualities, which form a common heritage and wealth that must be nurtured in every possible way.
Mr Barroso, we will back you, but we ask you to honour through your actions the trust we place in you and to make us always proud to be European citizens.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, if I could make one wish today, it would be to say to you: let us get down to work!
I freely admit that I have been shocked by the views expressed by some people in your team during the hearings, and I wonder about the ability of certain others to fulfil their portfolios.
This is most regrettable, given that your Commission is intrinsically a good one.
More than 85% of your college was favourably received.
Some Commissioners-designate are competent and know their portfolios well.
Must the functioning of the European Union suffer as a consequence?
Mr Barroso, you have unfortunately fallen into the media trap of short sentences.
You must take on board today the recommendations made by Parliament following the hearings.
Your proposal to create a fundamental rights agency surprises me a little and does not reassure me greatly.
The truth is that we create agencies when we do not exactly know how to address a problem.
You therefore have a great responsibility and we expect you to make sure that this Commission is strong and that it respects Parliament, that it explains the Constitution, that it implements the Lisbon Strategy, that it pursues reforms leading to greater competitiveness, social cohesion and happiness for our citizens and that it addresses the Turkey issue objectively.
The âyesâ vote that we will give you is not one of blind trust, but one of common sense.
If your team responds to these challenges, it will have our trust. Please be aware, however, that, as in any relationship, trust is subject to constant review.
I wish you good luck.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, your Commission is of a liberal persuasion, and I deplore that.
But leaving aside that political persuasion, you are committing an institutional error by ignoring the true nature of the European Unionâs institutional triangle, just as your predecessors did.
MrÂ Santer fell because this Parliament had been too complicit, too indulgent for too long with regard to its natural ally, the Commission.
Your direct predecessor, MrÂ RomanoÂ Prodi, arrived terrorised by this Parliament and wanted to ignore it for more than a year, until the day when he found himself powerless in the face of the European Council and was obliged once again to rely on the true power of this European Parliament.
Today, you want to set up a special dialogue with the Council, but the Council is not there to support you at a time when you are involved in this difficult dialogue with our institution.
So you are saying to us: âit is too late to change Commissioners or remodel portfoliosâ.
If, however, it is too late, then what real power does this European Parliament have?
I hope we will demonstrate it tomorrow.
Finally, you are making a fundamental mistake, because one of the essential powers of your Commission is the one it will exercise in the field of competition.
From this point of view, your candidate is weak and will weaken your Commissionâs power as a whole.
An example of this is the idea that because a person has been a company director they will be a good Commissioner.
Well, Mr President of the Commission, I can tell you that all our experience, at national level and at European level, suggests quite the opposite.
The post of Commissioner is a political post for which we need people capable of carrying out their duties with complete independence and with an acute sense of the European dimension and interest, and not any individual interest.
Â Â  Madam President, the question is, in fact, whether or not a Commissioner can set aside his personal convictions when he is at work.
As we are dealing with an area of policy that is very sensitive, namely civil rights, asylum policy, and immigration policy â an area of policy that will become more and more European in years to come, and so you need somebody on board who is the driving force behind that policy.
Mr President of the Commission, or rather Mr President-designate of the Commission, you are implying, by the measures you have announced, that you do not have the right man for the job on your team.
I still have my doubts.
There are many reasons why I would like to vote in favour of your team, but there is one important reason why I hesitate to do so.
I would therefore ask you to give me, before tomorrow lunchtime, arguments that will dispel my doubts.
Â Â  Madam President, the French Sovereignists will vote against the Barroso Commission and we have plenty of reasons for doing so.
