On the basis of that study we shall be able to decide how to continue developing our economic and commercial relations with those regions.
Turning now to the cooperation issues dealt with in the report, I should start by mentioning the positive impact that the implementation of the external aid management reform will have.
The new programming and management mechanisms will increase the coherence, complementarity and efficiency of cooperation programmes.
I should also like to make it clear that the emphasis on social aspects - in particular health, education and the fight against poverty - is a priority for the Commission too.
We are currently promoting a forum for an exchange of ideas between the different actors in civil society on issues relative to social equity, so that its conclusions may be submitted to the Madrid Summit.
Social equity should be central to the dialogue between Heads of State and concrete initiatives in that field ought to come out of this summit.
I am grateful for the support given to Commission initiatives in the fields of education and culture.
Before the end of the year, the Commission intends to adopt an ambitious scholarship programme so that postgraduate Latin American students can complete their studies in Europe.
I am equally grateful for the support of the rapporteur and this Parliament for the programme aimed at enhancing the participation of Latin America in the information society.
I hope I have made it clear that the Commission shares the majority of the objectives set out in the report and that we very much appreciate the quality and ambitious nature of the proposal it contains.
I nonetheless wonder whether it is necessary to adopt a common strategy to achieve those objectives.
We must bear in mind the dynamic nature of our relations. That dynamism results to a large extent from the vast array of regional and sub-regional mechanisms available to us.
These allow us to develop a flexible political dialogue which is easily adaptable to current circumstances and priorities.
The vitality of our relations is largely the result of our decision to move forward on the basis of a strategic association built upon a relationship between equals.
The priorities of that strategic association are defined by the Heads of State and Government of both regions.
I therefore believe that before launching any new initiatives we should ensure that the process we have just started continues to develop and builds progressively on the present dialogue and association relationship.
I should like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution.
With reports such as this, Parliament continues to present a clear vision of what our relations should be with a region which is developing closer political and economic links with the European Union.
Finally, I am fully aware that some questions were addressed to Mr Patten.
I am sure he would like to provide written answers to the questions from Mr Medina Ortega in particular, but also to those from other speakers, and I assure Parliament that it will receive a full reply within the next few weeks.
Mr President, my sense of nobility obliges me to respond to the positive and constructive speech by Mr Bolkestein.
As rapporteur, I would say to him that I almost did not miss Mr Patten' s absence.
I would also like to express my thanks to all of my fellow Members.
For reasons of accuracy, I would like to refer to a point that has been made in this debate that the great omission from this report was the failure to mention indigenous peoples.
I would like to quote directly from paragraph 27, which "calls for the new common strategy to make education, health and culture its priorities and to provide for targeted measures in support of those Latin American countries which require them, with particular attention paid to ethnic minorities and indigenous groups".
Therefore, to say that there has been an omission, when we are asking that the maximum priority within the new common strategy be given to indigenous peoples, seems to me to be a clear contradiction, although, naturally, I respect the opinion of all my fellow Members.
Thank you, Mr Salafranca.
I am afraid the Member who made this observation is not present and was therefore unable to hear what you said, but he will certainly be informed.
Shipbuilding
The next item is the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001) 401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding is extremely important, for shipbuilding is a strategically significant sector in the European Union.
I would like to take this opportunity to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, regrettably, does not coincide with that of the rapporteur.
I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, for her outstanding work, especially in view of the very short time available to her.
I would therefore like to thank her, even though she has difficulty in accepting the legality of this proposal.
Naturally, my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal's legality are unfounded.
I therefore wish to comment briefly on the content of the proposal and the report.
It would be remiss of me, however, if I omitted to mention the constructive cooperation with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I think we have put forward a sound proposal.
I very much hope, too, that the Commission will adopt the amendments proposed by this House.
The conclusions of the Industry and Energy Council of 5 December 2000, in accordance with the 1998 Council decision, confirmed the ending of operating aid for shipbuilding from 1 January 2001.
However, it was pointed out at the time that if the negotiations with Korea failed, the Commission could adopt a different position after a review.
We must recognise that Korea has failed to honour the 2000 agreement in terms of price discipline and subsidies.
The Commission therefore had to examine whether, in the event of the failure of negotiations with Korea, which continues to violate current trade agreements by granting state subsidies, a temporary defensive mechanism should be proposed for European shipbuilding.
The proposal has now been submitted because the negotiations failed, and the proposed defensive mechanism must be evaluated.
From the Committee's point of view, the proposal is inadequate, as it is restricted solely to container ships and tankers for transporting petroleum products and chemicals (excluding stainless steel tankers).
The proposal allows operating aid of 6% and, in special cases, of up to 14%.
A dispute settlement procedure is also to be initiated before the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
These aid measures are to be applicable only until the conclusion of proceedings, that is, until 31 December 2002 at the latest.
We believe that the European Parliament should maintain its position that a dispute settlement procedure should be initiated.
However, this proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is in need of improvement, since the three segments referred to only account for 20% of European shipbuilding.
Yet almost every segment in the European Union is affected by Korea's unfair competition practices.
In particular, those categories of ships which will also be the subject of the complaint to the WTO must be included.
Only then will our message to Korea be clear and convincing.
In this respect, Commissioner, I believe that your support for Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is essential.
The duration envisaged is also inadequate, in our view.
We therefore propose that the defensive mechanism should be applicable at least for the duration of the current Regulation on aid to shipbuilding, Regulation 1540/98, which expires on 31 December 2003, or possibly until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings.
As the European Parliament, and as the European Union, we must not allow unfair trade practices to damage European business and put jobs at risk. Otherwise, these unfair practices will emerge in other sectors too, impeding growth and threatening jobs.
At the same time, however, we must strike a careful balance between justified defensive mechanisms and anti-market protectionism benefiting certain sectors through State aid, which impedes fair competition.
I believe that the Committee's proposal takes account of these concerns. I would ask you to support the draft report, and I appeal to the Commission to state its willingness to adopt the amendments.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the draftsman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Valdivielso de CuÃ©, not because he does not support the report, but because he cannot be here today.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supported the proposals put forward by Ms Randzio-Plath by a very substantial majority: 39 votes in favour to 9 votes against.
The intention is to send out a clear signal against South Korea's dumping policies, which in recent decades have driven European shipbuilding to the brink of collapse by maintaining subsidies and benefits for companies in receivership.
For a year now, we have pursued a policy which aimed to reach agreement with South Korea.
A protocol to this effect was drawn up on 5 June 2000.
South Korea did not honour it.
In December 2000, we agreed to appeal to the WTO panel.
South Korea did not respond.
For this reason, the Commission quite rightly decided in July that temporary assistance of up to 14% may be paid by the national authorities, not from the European purse, for a specific number of ships until the end of 2002.
This is the issue today.
In line with Ms Randzio-Plath's proposals, we want to extend the categories of ships to include ferries for trains, persons and road vehicles, as well as natural gas and petroleum gas tankers, and we want to extend the term until 2003; in other words, we are in favour of a two-year period.
We ask you to endorse this draft report and clearly reject the Liberals' motion which calls for the entire draft report to be dismissed.
South Korea has the solution in its hand.
None of us wants long-term subsidies. However, this is our only opportunity to exert pressure on behalf of the European shipbuilding industry on this difficult issue.
The debate is now suspended and will be resumed this afternoon at about 4.45 p.m., after the debate on the international situation in which the Commission will take part.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
Procedure without debate:
Recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (11253/1/2001 - C5-0474/2001 - 2000/0211(COD)).
(The President declared the common position approved)
Report (A5-0364/2001) by Erik Meijer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway (COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD))
Mr President, I have an oral amendment to Amendment No 75.
After the vote on Amendment No 130: President.
Unfortunately Mr Fatuzzo, that means that Amendment No 75 falls.
Mr President, it is not 'unfortunately' , because what I wanted is contained in that amendment - it concerns pensioners.
(Laughter and applause)
We aim to please.
Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:
Mr President, I should like to ask you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution further to yesterday' s communication by Commissioner de Palacio that she would not accept what is now being decided upon by a large majority in Parliament.
In my opinion, we should set aside some time to consult further with Mrs de Palacio on this matter, because if we do not, although she may present a draft regulation in a few months' time, the regulation will be in a form different from that which has now been accepted by Parliament.
That is why I propose postponing the vote on the legislative resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my side has admittedly lost in a key vote, but the process must continue.
We must now ensure that the Council forms an opinion.
If we prevaricate and postpone this issue, the Council can continue to hide behind its inaction.
I therefore propose that we reject the rapporteur's motion and now hold the final vote so that the ball is the Council's court.
We still have the second reading and the mediation process.
A delay at this point will not help: we want to move forward on this issue, and so I ask you to reject Mr Meijer's motion.
Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Jarzembowski's remarks for another reason.
The plenary has substantively amended a Commission item by a large majority.
The Commission must also accept, for once, that this House may substantively amend a Commission item.
I am therefore in favour of continuing the process.
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Before we move on I would like to congratulate Mr Poettering who I understand has just been re-elected leader of his group.
(Loud applause)
Report (A5-0354/2001) by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on market access to port services (COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD))
Before the vote on Amendment No 47:
Mr President, now that we have adopted Amendments Nos 48 and 49, I would like to ask the Liberal Group whether Amendment No 47 automatically lapses.
That is my question, as we have agreed that the Commission must put forward appropriate proposals.
I assume that Amendment No 47 now lapses.
I think it lapses but if the Liberal Group wants to support me I am very happy to receive their support.
(Laughter and applause)
- (NL) Mr President, unfortunately, the rapporteur is right.
I thought that my amendment was far superior, but I accept that, as his amendment has already been adopted, it makes no sense to vote on mine.
However, I would point out that the Commission has stated that his amendment is not accurate whereas mine is.
Amendment No 47 falls.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0359/2001) by Luis Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation (COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD))
Before the vote:
Mr President, I should like to make a point about the PPE-DE recommended voting list.
There was a mistake in Amendment No 8 as a result of a mistake in the original draft, which has now been corrected.
So Amendment No 8 should be supported by the PPE-DE Group as a recommendation.
Similarly, Amendments Nos 57, 13, 46 and 47 have a mistake in the English language translation which renders it nonsensical.
The word 'by' should be replaced by 'to' in the relevant paragraph (c).
The rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, supports me on both counts.
We will ensure that the language versions are corrected and correspond to one another.
Mr President, Amendment No 55, rather than being an oral amendment, in fact adds text that must have been forgotten, since this text does not appear.
Therefore, the following words should be added to the end of the text of Amendment No 55: 'will have to give the name of these insurance companies' .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Mr President, in my opinion, Amendment No 60 is not incompatible with Amendment No 41 and can be voted on as an addition.
I would like to hear the opinion of the proposing group.
Mr President, this proposed amendment works perfectly well as an addition, and can therefore be voted on as an addition.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Colleagues, we shall only vote now on the two Caudron reports. The remaining items will be held over to the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, we are in the middle of taking a vote.
I merely wanted to point out how absurd these foreshortened sessions are, without a Friday. It is never possible to deal satisfactorily with the agenda.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, due to the large number of votes outstanding, I urgently request that we begin early enough with the votes tomorrow morning; otherwise, we will not be able to deal with everything.
Mr President, it was announced that Amendment No 35 would not be dealt with as it does not concern all the language versions.
However, it relates to the introduction of gender-neutral language throughout the proposal, and I would ask you to ensure that gender-neutral language is used in the entire research framework programme.
We will ensure that all the terms used are gender-neutral.
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 322 and 333:
I am sorry.
I cannot agree because we are voting on additions.
Mr President, the principles included in the Caudron report are exactly identical to those in the amendments tabled by Messrs Liese, NisticÃ², Fiori and Trakatellis, except that in those amendments, one more element has been added, namely the fact that we must also take account of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
That is the only point added, and I therefore hope that our socialist friends, as well as others, will vote in favour of this amendment.
Thank you for that clarification.
Do you agree, Mr Caudron?
Mr President, I agree with what Mr van Velzen has just said.
He is right about that minor addition.
We can therefore vote on it, and I vote in its favour.
Thank you.
The rest comes later, once we get to other parts of Amendments Nos 332 and 333.
All we are voting on is that section at the moment.
Mr President, I think the rapporteur wants to comment.
Mr Caudron, Mrs McNally is reading your mind.
I certainly wished to comment. When one is seated in the second row one can be seen more easily than when one is rather further away.
Concerning the three parts, the rapporteur' s opinion is to vote for the first and the second.
He does however advise voting against the third part, contrary to a note sent to the presidency. As is abundantly clear, the third part clearly states that work should concern stem cells from embryos or foetuses resulting from spontaneous miscarriages or abortions undertaken to safeguard the health of the mother.
That is outdated wording.
I am indeed sorry. It does appear that in this debate we are reworking the debate on abortion and this is causing me considerable concern.
Mr Caudron, you are possibly confusing two parts.
We are voting at the moment on part 3 - stem cells.
You have raised the issue of embryos at this point.
We are only voting on the stem cells aspect of this amendment at the moment - section 3 of the amendment.
No, Mr President, I am not mistaken. It is indeed in Paragraph 3, in the last part of Paragraph 3.
I am not referring to Paragraph 4.
To be absolutely clear, it is the words: 'to ensure the mother's health may be funded' .
Yes, Mr President, that is the part I did not wish to be voted on.
At least I am clear now.
Before the vote on amendment 330: Turmes (Verts/ALE).
Mr President, this amendment is about technology assessment.
In principle all the groups agree, but our amendment is a bit rigid on the financial implication.
It says: 'a minimum of 3%' .
So I propose an oral amendment which will read: 'activities in all thematic areas should be supported only if a certain percentage of the respective project is used for technological impact assessment' .
That is very clear.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 33:
Mr President, could I perhaps invite the rapporteur to present his oral amendment to 335?
It was agreed with the rapporteur that the word 'and' would be replaced by 'or' .
That is an extremely minor oral amendment, and I know that the rapporteur is in agreement with this.
Do you mean 'fish or animal' , or is it 'new or improved' ?
Mr President, my reaction will indicate how much work I put into this report.
The draft oral amendment tabled relates to the second part of Amendment No 335, 'new or improved races' , and I feel it is indeed more appropriate to use 'or' rather than 'and' , because the human race could not really be subsumed under 'new and improved races' .
Alright, 'new or improved' .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 320:
Mr President, as regards 320, I can go along with the proposed addition concerning quality as regards nutrition. I cannot however accept the deletions contained in this amendment.
If those who tabled the amendment agree, I can accept the addition to the text.
Do the Greens accept the oral amendment as an addition?
(The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0355/2001) by GÃ©rard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area (COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS)).
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
Report Meijer (A5-0364/2001):
Mr President, we have approved the new regulation on action by Member States in the liberalisation of public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway, in order that this may be consolidated as a new single European market.
And, with regard to this, our Parliamentary Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled various amendments aimed at preserving aspects relating to the environment and sustainability in the transportation market, such as the rational use of energy and the fulfilment of standards on the control of emissions which contaminate the atmosphere, greenhouse gases, noise, etc, as well as giving priority to alternative forms of transport which make a better contribution to the much hoped-for reduction in traffic congestion.
We have argued for the need to defend the quality of transport services, whether these be run by public or private companies, and we have stated that social conditions with regard to the health and safety of employees in these companies should be closely linked to the quality of services offered.
We also think that liberalisation should not lead to an abandonment of the idea that passenger transportation is a social instrument and which supports the weakest groups in society, such as schoolchildren, trainees, pensioners and those living with some kind of disability, all of whom should continue to be protected through restrictions on ticket prices.
Ticket prices should be standardised in order to facilitate the integration and interoperability of different transportation methods, including cross-border transportation, where timetables and service networks also need to be coordinated.
Transport should be cheap and available throughout all regions, and should also guarantee a service to less populated and less prosperous areas at moderate prices.
Finally, it is not acceptable to liberalise urban, suburban and regional transportation whilst remaining, as some governments are, opposed to the liberalisation of state transportation, as for example the passenger railways.
Although it should be controlled, this market should be open to free competition throughout the EU.
Mr President, I express my personal satisfaction, as a Member and as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, for the approval of amendment 130 in this document, which regulates public service in transport by rail, road and inland waterway throughout Europe.
Amendment 130 was tabled by the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, whom I thank for tabling it, and voted on before the oral amendment, which, like the Greens' amendment, sought to extend the possibility of granting free travel on public transport to pensioners.
I therefore thank all the Members who voted for it, particularly the European Members of the Northern League - Mr Gobbo, Mr Borghezio, Mr Speroni - and of course above all the Members of the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left who tabled the amendment that has been voted on, and also all those, notably including the socialists, who voted for it.
.
(FR) We consider this draft regulation to be a real threat to the urban public passenger transport service in that it abolishes the freedom to manage our territorial communities.
Calling this fundamental principle into question in many Member States, possibly even going as far as constitutional recognition, is detrimental to free choice and, more importantly, to the free organisation of local public services, thus affecting service itself.
However, we can only agree with the exclusion of long-distance rail services due to the exclusive rights without compensation that apply to them.
We also approve all the amendments aiming to preserve the social clause.
However, for reasons of safety and coherent management, which would be jeopardised by the division of the lines, we consider the inclusion of local rail services within the scope of the regulation to be unacceptable.
That is why we propose that this text, which is neither acceptable nor desirable for the continuity of the local public passenger transport service, be rejected.
.
(FR) For ages, governments all over Europe have been closing rail services to the benefit of private companies throughout the road transport sector, leading to the tragic accidents in the Mont Blanc and Saint-Gothard tunnels and the tremendous human and social cost of all, more 'normal' , accidents.
Today, the road networks are at saturation point, so some private investors are turning to rail in order to make new profits there, aided and abetted by both the European authorities and national governments.
Neither users nor the general population can expect to benefit from the privatisation of public services.
Nor will workers in the sector, who are denouncing and fighting privatisation and its devastating effects on employment and working conditions.
It is true that the rapporteur is concerned about the damage done by unbridled liberalisation and suggests the possibility of opposition by local communities. However, he is nonetheless among those who see privatisation as a fait accompli and the dismantling of public services as inevitable, and who are only trying to regulate the process somewhat.
As we are in favour of the development of public transport both on international routes and in regional and local networks, we do not want to support the dismantling of public services directly or indirectly, since this dismantling, even if it is regulated, is detrimental to users and to workers in the sector, and constitutes a severe social decline.
That is why we have not voted for this report, and we would say once more that public services everywhere must be designed and implemented to respond to the needs of the user, not to make money for private companies.
This report seeks to improve the Commission' s proposal, which, despite its name, effectively seeks to privatise passenger transport.
Although important proposals have been approved, and we voted for them, the fact is that the introduction of competition may jeopardise established rights for users, such as travel passes, and for staff, something that has not been sufficiently safeguarded in this report and will certainly be even less so in Commission and Council practice.
Thus, even greater obstacles to user mobility may be created, although certain proposals approved by Parliament along different lines are to be welcomed.
Furthermore, there is no proper guarantee of coordination between the various means of transport, and adequate answers are not given to those users located in less profitable areas: private companies may consider them unprofitable and then cancel services there.
Lastly, the vote against the legislative resolution is also justified on account of our fears regarding the implementation of the Commission' s position and the consequences for staff and users, which may jeopardise a quality, low-price service.
It should also be noted that, although the Commission is backing the privatisation of transport services, part of these services will continue to be supported by public money, which is unacceptable.
The proposal clearly states that its aim is to develop competition in the field of transport provision.
Contrary to what it states in several places, everything shows that within the framework of so-called 'regulated' competition, the results of opening up the market have not been positive, and nor has the efficiency of services improved.
Quite the opposite.
The overall process of liberalisation runs counter to improving the service for passengers, to improving working conditions, to respect for the environment, traffic safety and a regional planning policy that is not imposed by market restrictions.
We are stating our opposition to any liberalisation of transport, and our support for maintaining the status of transport as a public service, and for cooperation between public companies at European level.
We are against any State aid being allocated to private operators who are not, moreover, prepared to make the necessary investment in infrastructures.
What is more, we are in favour of the immediate re-nationalisation of all the private railway lines and networks in Europe and in favour of the re-nationalisation/municipalisation of urban and local transport.
The underlying problem is that it is impossible to compromise with market logic.
When it is applied, it is to the detriment of another logic, that of public service, which explains why we have voted against this report.
Report Jarzembowski (A5-0354/2001):
Mr President, open access to the port services market and equal opportunities in this field are not only appropriate but also a requirement of the Treaties on which the European Union is founded.
Regulation and control are needed in this particular field to ensure that no State provides financial assistance to its ports, since this is a serious threat to free competition between Community ports.
However, there are certain aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the EU.
Member States and their constitutional bodies with competencies in this field should maintain their capacity to include their own specific standards for the invitation to tender for contracts for supply of port services and for the protection of workers affected.
Additionally, pilotage, mooring and the handling of cargo, including stowage and trans-shipment, since they are compulsory services, should not be included in the Community Directive liberalising port services, but their regulation should remain under the control of the Member States and their port authorities, for reasons of the safety of maritime traffic.
In an airport, there would be chaos if there were more than one company providing air traffic control.
In a port, there should only be one authority for pilotage and one for mooring, for the same reason.
As you know, Mr President, I was born in Genoa and lived in Genoa until I was 21.
I admired the port of Genoa every morning when I looked out over the city, since I lived in a very well-known district up high, from where I could enjoy precisely this beautiful view over the port of Genoa, which is nonetheless a very busy port, like so many in the European Union.
Well, in this document, which regulates the organisation of the port, port services and safety, I would like to have found greater commitment and greater financial involvement by the European Union so that all the ports in Europe without distinction, northern European ports and Mediterranean ports, could be financially supported just as our competitors in South Korea do with the shipyards in their country.
We, too, should help our ports and our shipping.
Opening up port services to competition, at least in the way proposed by the Commission, will have a number of serious, adverse repercussions:
a) on the quality of port services and the standards applied, because they will have to compete and will recruit unskilled staff;
b) on working conditions and the employment prospects of port workers, thereby jeopardising their health and safety, curtailing their vocational training and undermining their skills;
c) on the safety of transport by sea and the environment, due to the generally lower standard of services provided.
Although the Committee on Transport's motion represents an improvement, with the amendments adopted, it is still thinking along the same lines as the Commission and has even reduced the scope for public-sector controls, which is why I voted against it.
The generally-worded title of the Community directive before us conceals an important step towards the privatisation of ports, especially the services which they provide, such as pilotage, towing and docking ships, loading and unloading and storing goods and moving passengers.
The aim is not to improve the port services provided; it is to sell off yet another publicly owned sector to big business and hand a complete infrastructure over to the private monopolies so that they can make use of and profit from it.
The unavoidable consequences will be a reversal in labour relations and rights and a tragic drop in safety standards for workers, for passengers on board ships and in the services provided.
We want to stress from the outset that we are opposed and completely reject both the directive and the Jarzembowski report.
We refuse to be party to a line of thinking that accepts privatisation as inevitable and endeavours to rescue a few individual services.
On the contrary, we steadfastly support the argument for public port services and ports whose operations are integrated into an overall development plan which develops the potential of each country, supports the economy and employment and guarantees the safety of human life in port and at sea.
These are highly sensitive issues for Greece, with its large number of island complexes and its sovereignty in the Aegean, a sensitive area from the economic, social and national security standpoints.
We would also point out that multipurpose ports such as Piraeus, which support and serve the shipbuilding and repair industry, can only do their job efficiently if they remain in the public sector.
This endeavour is more than infuriating or provocative.
It is an attempt to intervene in the operational unit itself, that is, the port, and to prohibit it from doing what any enterprise does, that is, from operating as a single entity.
It breaks up and imposes internal competition between services provided by the same service provider.
At the same time, the directive talks about prerequisites for 'public services' but leaves them at the mercy of the private sector.
The Communist Party of Greece is fighting, alongside the workers, for uniform, 100% public-sector port services, so that they are able to operate, develop and connect with other sectors of the economy.
If we want properly operating ports, safety, coordination and development, we need to support a single, vertically-integrated service, with each activity helping and supporting the other.
Otherwise, the smooth and efficient operation of the sector will be at risk, any attempt at coordination will be doomed to failure and safety will be thrown to the winds because it will be subject to the laws of profit and competition and will have to rely upon the goodwill of the enterprises.
That is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report.
The draft report presented to us is unacceptable in its current form.
First, because it provides a confused response to the fundamental questions of competition between European ports and financial transparency in the allocation of grants to these ports.
But also, and in particular, because the indiscriminate liberalisation of all port services constitutes a dangerous threat to safety, the environment and employment.
To safety, because opening up to competition highly specialised services such as piloting, requiring specific skills adapted to each port, carries the potential risk of seriously jeopardising the safety conditions in which these professions are exercised.
To the environment, because liberalisation does not allow it to be taken into consideration sufficiently.
On these two points, the report and the directive contradict the 'maritime safety' and environmental risk reduction reinforcement policy launched by the European Union following the Erika disaster.
Lastly, such liberalisation poses a threat to employment, because opening up port services to competition, in particular those employing the most staff, such as freight handling, carries the risk of plunging the European ports into a dangerous downward spiral with regard to social benefits.
This tendency would be unsustainable in areas that are often vulnerable or in labour market areas that are already severely affected by industrial restructuring.
I cannot, therefore, approve all the provisions that would lead to port services being opened up to competition with no compensation or safeguards.
That is why I voted for all the amendments aiming to exclude port services such as piloting, mooring and freight handling from the scope of the liberalisation proposed by the directive.
As these amendments have not been adopted, I voted against the report.
.
(FR) First of all, I would like to thank both our rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, and the Committee as a whole for the high quality of their work.
I have several reasons for voting against this report.
To me, voting against this report means first of all rejecting the liberalisation of intra-port services, that is to say going against the obligatory privatisation of handling and mooring services.
As piloting is the only intra-port service to have been recognised as an obligatory public service and as an activity requiring great care with regard to safety, it is the only intra-port service that will continue to be controlled by the Member States, and that will, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the directive.
I simply cannot comprehend, however, that mooring service providers, who provide an internationally recognised service of general interest by providing indispensable assistance both with regard to prevention in the field of environmental protection and in implementing the best possible level of safety, will from now on be subject to competition.
To me, voting against this report also means rejecting liberalisation between ports, that is to say, rejecting competition between ports, competition which can only have disastrous and harmful effects, with regard to both the quality of services rendered and the working conditions themselves.
Voting against this report therefore means arguing for increased cooperation between ports, recognising that ports are a full and complete factor in regional planning and that as such, they must not be subjected to competition that could lead to their eradication.
These, in short, are the two main reasons that have led me not to deliver a final vote in favour of this report.
.
(FR) This proposal to liberalise port services is of immediate concern to us due to its potential practical consequences.
We feel it is completely inappropriate to seek to open up all port services to competition regardless of their type, given that some of them, due to their specific obligations, are of a public service nature.
Apart from national differences regarding the very concept of public service as applied to port services, optimum safety must be ensured in all Member States. They alone can define and control this by means of public service tasks, professional qualifications, restrictions or the definition of their activities.
The economic logic in favour of users must never take priority over safety in the widest meaning of the word: personal, environmental or material.
Therefore, we consider that this proposal must exclude all services that are of a public service nature according to the standards of each Member State, be they piloting, mooring or other services.
This is not the case, so we are voting against this text.
. (PT) Our vote reflects our position on a deeply controversial report, which has not been accepted by any sector of port services.
As we know, the Commission proposal seeks to open up major areas concerned with port safety to competition and does not guarantee workers' rights.
Although the report itself contains some positive references, it retains negative aspects that give some backing to the Commission' s position.
For countries like Portugal, this proposal could have highly detrimental effects on a sector that has already been affected by other, equally detrimental measures, and we have therefore voted against it.
.
(FR) Having attacked public rail transport, Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, is now attacking port services.
The logic behind this, which is still the same, is a direct result of the process of liberalising telecommunications, transport, energy and postal services.
This involves placing the organising bodies, infrastructures and professionals carrying out public service tasks, often in a public context, under the yoke of the market.
Three hundred European Union ports and all port services such as freight handling, piloting, towage, mooring, embarkation and disembarkation services would be affected by this directive.
However, a recent opinion poll confirmed by the success of the European dockers' strike of 6 November shows that these proposals meet with the mass rejection of port service workers.
The long amendment war that took place within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism may have meant for now that competition will no longer be within ports but between them, but these results are not satisfactory.
Moreover, because we demand that public service obligations regarding safety, regularity, continuity, quality, price and harmonisation with the system that is most favourable in terms of social protection for port workers and respect for the environment, be fulfilled, we have rejected the Jarzembowski report.
.
The majority of British ports are well run and prosper because private operators have taken over from cash-strapped local authorities and are running the ports as successful businesses.
The proposed European Commission directive to increase competition in port services in the EU threatens to reverse this.
It would leave British ports vulnerable to takeovers similar to the takeover of various electricity firms by ElectricitÃ© de France.
It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market.
It would threaten the independent, commercially based and subsidy free nature of British ports.
I would like to see private operators exempted from the scope of this directive.
.
(FR) Mooring services are a general interest service as recognised by the judgment of the Court of Luxembourg of 18 June 1998.
Within this context, the port authority may require mooring services to handle any safety problems with no obligation for remuneration.
Mooring services provide all ships with the same quality of service, due to an extremely extensive knowledge of the port in which the service is provided.
The permanent nature of the service, the professional qualifications of the workers, their knowledge of the specific local features and the essential role played by mooring services in port and maritime safety make this activity an essential determining factor in environmental protection.
The deterioration of the merchant fleet as a whole and the increasing over-use of frequently faulty boats and equipment show the extent of the essential role to be played by mooring service providers in years to come, due to their technical skills and wide knowledge of their place of work.
Mooring services, like piloting, must therefore be excluded from the European directive, and that is why the group of the Greens has voted in favour of Amendments No 66 and 67 of this report.
), in writing.
(NL) Mr President, the introduction of the port package has clearly given European port policy a new lease of life.
The report on market access to port services has caused a great stir in the European Parliament, not least because the European Commission proposal predominantly deals with competition within ports.
The wish from the EP, dating back to 1997, to reach a Regulation on competition among ports has been completely overlooked.
In this connection, a request has been made for clear rules on financial transparency and State aid in the port sector.
The Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) within the ELDR Group wants to guarantee more transparency for government funding and has asked the European Commission to present a proposal to this effect prior to the entry into force of the present directive.
Otherwise, we would start to question the directive' s added value for European ports and their users.
Opinions in my group are divided as to which services should fall within the scope of the directive and which should not.
The VVD backs the rapporteur where he wants to limit the directive to the technical-nautical services.
However, in our view, pilotage services should be included in the directive.
Cargo handling services are by their very nature land-based and do not belong in this directive.
Furthermore, port authorities and users are required to make relatively sizeable investments in infrastructure and superstructure.
The tendering of the cargo handling aspect will mainly lead to red tape.
This administrative burden is not proportionate to the result and creates uncertainty within investing authorities.
It also creates an obstruction for urban planning authorities of the local councils, to which most ports in the Netherlands still belong.
The VVD is against including the cargo handling services in this directive.
.
(FR) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on this highly sensitive dossier.
Unusually, the division here has not been political but national, and the compromise brokered is generally positive.
This directive was necessary because port services must be opened up to competition and European ports require European legislation on port services.
If competition is encouraged, it is essential that it be organised by an appropriate framework.
However, account must be taken of the specific nature of each activity.
I am thinking of piloting and mooring services in particular, since these, for safety reasons, must continue to be governed by the port authorities.
This method of management works very well in France and even if these activities are open to competition in other European countries, I am in favour of their current exclusion from the scope of the directive.
These are port services of general interest.
If these services are kept within the scope of the directive, the concept of port authority loses all meaning.
On the other hand, I approve of the liberalisation of freight handling, since this is a commercial service and opening it up to competition should be synonymous with increased employment.
Lastly, I have supported the provisions in favour of greater transparency in financial relations between ports and Member States.
In the name of legal certainty and fair competition between European ports, it must be possible to subject grants paid by national authorities to detailed inspections.
Report Berenguer Fuster (A5-0359/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the regulation of insurance mediation.
I take the opportunity to hope that the European Union will also soon regulate the mediation of public insurance.
'What is public insurance?' you will ask, Mr President.
Naturally it means social security and sickness benefit.
In this area too, citizens have the right to be properly informed about what the public sector offers them for their future lives as pensioners, and how much they must pay now, as workers, in order to have a pension tomorrow.
Moreover, the information service for workers and pensioners about their right to a pension should be regulated throughout Europe, to enhance it in every possible way.
Cross-border insurance mediation will increase consumers' options to choose between various insurance providers.
The directive proposal we have in front of us now allows insurance intermediaries to operate also in other Member States.
When making choices between various providers, EU citizens must nevertheless be confident that we, as European legislators, guarantee consumer protection by making sure that persons practising insurance mediation are highly qualified.
The report on the insurance mediation directive, which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have been working on, is generally satisfactory.
We ensure that insurance intermediaries have the necessary professional competence, liability insurance or other equivalent insurance as well as adequate financial capacity.
Any insurance intermediary must also be a person of good repute, who has not been made bankrupt.
Simultaneously, however, we must ensure that EC regulations do not cause any unnecessary bureaucracy.
Our committee has made several amendments, which according to the opinion of expert advisors clearly make the directive more sensible and give Member States the option to make decisions in consideration of national circumstances.
We have achieved compromises, which the majority of Member States in the Council seem to be inclined to support.
It is important not to apply the directive to any persons whose principal professional activity is other than insurance mediation.
By this I mean in particular, travel agencies, who also offer their customers travel insurance as part of a travel package.
They make the customer' s life considerably easier and in Finland, for example, they are under the supervision of the authorities.
In connection with travel insurance accident insurance is also often sold, which include provision for compensations in the event of death.
It has been very beneficial to specify that these are not life insurances referred to in this directive.
It would also have been more beneficial not to apply the directive to intermediaries, who work under the responsibility of their insurance company, or for whose activities the company is responsible on the basis of international legislation and for whom the company also provides appropriate training.
As it unfortunately has been impossible to allow part-time agents, who act under the responsibility of their company, to be totally excluded from the directive, it nevertheless is good to relax the registration liability in the way our committee has proposed.
The relationship of Amendment Nos 14 to Amendment Nos 13 and 6 remains unclear, because Amendment No 14 allows for example travel and animal insurances to be totally excluded from the directive, while in other sections intermediaries providing those insurances are excluded from registration liability only.
If further amendments are still allowed, I would like to propose that Amendment Nos 18 and 22 be removed.
Insurance mediation by banks is no different from the rest of the mediation activity, and would not need regulation of its own.
Report Caudron (A5-0376/2001):
Mr President, what is this subsidiarity that is talked about so much in the European Union?
Subsidiarity, you tell me, Mr President, means that one should act at a European level when that gives the greatest advantage and the greatest benefit to all the citizens of Europe.
So how should we carry out scientific research in Europe?
With fifteen different projects from fifteen different States, which tomorrow will be fifteen plus the twelve that are joining, which makes twenty-seven, or would it not be better to have a single research fund?
Is it better to make a single decision on how to spend the money of all twenty-seven European Union Member States, the 15 current ones plus the 12 candidate countries, or to leave twenty-seven different chapters of the budget?
We should decide to have a single European research fund.
Mr President, I voted against the report, as some of the outcomes of the vote are incompatible with my own ethical and moral views.
Furthermore, I cannot understand why only marginal approaches exist for research in agriculture and forestry even though it is vital, for the future of agriculture and forestry, to set the necessary research priorities in this area in particular.
.
(FR) This report is completely in line with the policy of the European institutions, where it emphasises aid to employers under the pretext of research and where it aims to strengthen the link between research and private interests, even if it sometimes cloaks this link in ecological or regionalist attire, according to fashion.
Nor is this report free of concessions to certain obscurantist ideas, whether religious or otherwise.
As for the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme, this penalises, in financial terms, research units whose work has been judged not to be a priority as it has little potential for profitable use by the private sector in the short or medium term.
The only reason we have voted in favour of this report is that we do not want to prejudice certain research strands supported by the report, which are seeking to make scientific, medical or technological progress, and nor do we want to risk depriving researchers in the public sector of the funding they need.
We have also adopted all the amendments that could represent progress in relation to the current situation.
. (PT) Despite the efforts of the rapporteur and most of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, there is no guarantee that there will be no discrimination against countries and regions whose business structure does not have the economic ability to take part in programmes aiming at the rapid transfer of knowledge in technological innovation, even though there may be scientific resources.
Thus the efforts to ensure cohesion enshrined in the Treaty will not be enough to combat the loss of competitiveness that this will entail.
The assumption behind the aims of the Lisbon strategy was full employment and exclusion, and not the opposite.
Without being able to share in knowledge and take part in programmes, the less favoured regions will be left a long way from economic and social convergence.
.
(FR) I voted in favour of this report.
I am a long-time supporter of research work at European level.
I am also pleased by Parliament' s stated desire to create and develop this interdisciplinary Community area.
In France, in particular, we are seeing a worrying drop in the number of researchers.
As a result of disappointing national policies, the most talented researchers often go abroad and only too rarely return.
The measure included in this report on the mobility of researchers and assistance with returning home will also, I hope, help to compensate for the shortcomings of some governments.
Stimulating research also means ensuring an independent training policy based on existing competences at European level.
Although the task of the legislator may be to provide a framework for research, there is a risk that this will be too restricted.
A Europe of discovery must also be fostered and work on biotechnologies, which represent the future, should be encouraged.
Similarly, the fundamental European research at the heart of the competitiveness of our industries and the substantial work undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, whose input we know to be necessary to discovery and innovation, must also be supported.
Research also affects the everyday life of all Europeans and priority areas, such as food safety, the fight against the major serious diseases and improving public health, show the desire to associate research and wellbeing.
I am also pleased to note the support that is proposed for the development of research into childhood illnesses, a field in which national policies have often failed.
That is why I call on the Commission to publish proposals on paediatric medicines.
Research and development are of crucial importance if Europe is to become a continent characterised by economic growth and sound welfare.
International competition, especially from the United States, increases the need for new and intensified research efforts.
In its proposal in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme, the Commission has identified several important problems and research areas which Europe needs to concentrate on.
Obviously, it is important that Europe' s researchers cooperate and that research efforts are coordinated to some degree.
It is also very important that we should not only make it easier for researchers to travel but also facilitate the distribution of research results.
What worries us is that the framework programme involves a very considerable centralisation of research.
Major resources are being invested in a small number of selected areas.
Research is thus being directed in an unfortunate way because the Member States' own research routes will be governed by the Commission' s priorities.
For small countries with limited research budgets, the EU is thus in danger of becoming one of the main bodies that funds research, something which would give rise to an unfortunate degree of centralisation.
As liberals, we applaud the principle of independent research.
From the point of view of efficiency, independent research has shown itself to be far superior to politically directed research.
In the long run, societies which provide researchers with large room for manoeuvre when it comes to choosing subjects and methods achieve better results than societies in which the politicians determine the direction to be taken by research.
The principle of the independent pursuit of knowledge has, for centuries, strongly characterised research in Europe.
Universities and other institutions of higher learning have an important role to play in cooperating with industry and the public sector, but their most important task must not become that of taking orders from the latter.
We believe that the Sixth Framework Programme would give rise to undue centralisation of independent research.
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on the Caudron report.
- (FR) As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics ( 'Bioethics' ), I have attached particular importance to this report, in its two main aspects:
the conditions for support granted to research in Europe, and
the ethical framework within which the European Parliament plans to conduct it.
As the amendments show, the essence of the debate concerned the part relating to 'ethics' applied to biotechnologies.
Insofar as the majority of votes approved the instrumentalisation of humans by authorising the use of human embryos, in this case conceived within the context of the treatment of infertility by in vitro fertilisation, to the detriment of the promotion of human dignity and integrity, I consider that the ethical framework adopted by a majority at first reading gives a negative tone to the report as a whole, including the technical provisions.
In conclusion, despite good technical provisions, the supposedly 'ethical' provisions mar the report as a whole by failing to respect human life.
- (PT) Therapeutic cloning, which opens up new opportunities for the treatment of certain diseases, entails the destruction of embryos and, although it has been more researched (and is therefore more accessible) than other techniques, it is not the only one and is certainly not ideal.
It would therefore be a mistake if legislators were so eager to give the green light to this technique that they gave up their obligation to pass robust legislation that would last for many years, which, in a field that is evolving so rapidly, is even more necessary. They should send the message to scientists and industry that they should choose to develop other techniques, some of which are as yet poorly developed and very costly, such as the use of adult cells, but where there is still plenty of room for research.
We must not give up the fight to find techniques that have the advantages of human embryo work but without its ethical drawbacks.
Furthermore, the creation of embryos by transferring cell nuclei would facilitate cloning for reproductive purposes, which is generally considered to be aberrant.
Thus, at a legal level, I support the Europe-wide ban on the cloning of human embryos for both therapeutic and reproductive purposes.
There should, however, be two exceptions to this ban: supernumerary embryos and the 64 available cell lines.
Nevertheless, with regard to research funding, and especially in the context of the Sixth Framework Programme (the subject of the Caudron report), I believe priority should be given to the Community funding of research projects that provide for the use of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes.
Various Dutch fellow MEPs have made statements in the media to the effect that the Liberal Group refuses to prescribe ethical limits for scientific research.
Our voting behaviour has proved that this is nonsense.
First of all, adopted Amendment No 41 has a liberal pedigree.
It demands that both during the implementation of the programme and for the results, the ethical basic principles, such as protection of human dignity, data and privacy are adhered to.
Additionally, with regard to stem cell research, the guidelines drawn up by the ESF ethical committee must be observed.
Furthermore, our group wanted to adopt Amendment No 22 of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which prevents funding being channelled into research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, the creation of embryos for research purposes and eugenic modifications in the genetic heritage.
Unfortunately, the restrictive text of Amendment No 322 has been adopted in which therapeutic cloning has been ruled out.
We regret this, precisely because therapeutic cloning offers genuine opportunities for patients suffering from Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, AIDS or diabetes.
We have therefore abstained from the final vote.
Report Caudron (A5-0355/2001):
Mr President, I was very young, I must have been ten or eleven, when someone gave me a beautifully illustrated Walt Disney book.
Its title was 'Our friend the atom' , and it was illustrated in that marvellous way that Walt Disney used to illustrate his universally famous works, as we might call them.
I was fascinated by that science book, which was so well explained to a young person like me.
Since then I have been in favour of nuclear energy and so I have voted for this document, especially because it promotes study and research into the nuclear sector in Europe, which, in my view, we should increase further.
Mr President, I view the expiry of the Euratom Treaty as an opportunity for Europe to phase out nuclear energy.
Yet today's vote on the Euratom programme has endorsed follow-up funding for nuclear research.
This is set out in Amendment No 12, for example, which provides funding for research into the safety of existing reactors (with priority for reactors in the candidate countries), as well as reactors of the new generation. In other words, it safeguards future nuclear power plants.
Yet research should be targeting non-nuclear energies, especially renewable energies, in order to make a contribution to the progressive phasing-out of nuclear energy in Europe.
This is why we rejected not only Amendment No 12 but also the entire Euratom programme in today's vote.
.
I warmly welcome this report by Gerard Caudron, which recommends changes in the allocation of spending to the Commission's proposal for the EUR 16 bn research budget.
It is high time that the programme's health research agenda was broadened to include more common diseases: most people have had contact, close or otherwise, with diseases such as cancer, degenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
By allocating money to research these illnesses, the EU would be seen to be working for real causes that affect real people's lives.
The ethical, legal and social aspects of research issues are increasingly important, if not as important as actual research.
Therefore, by calling for the funding in these areas, the committee is showing an awareness of the importance of these modern-day issues.
The call to allocate money to the information society demonstrates a real commitment to substantiate the Union's stated ambitions laid out at the Lisbon so-called dot-com summit, to make the EU one of the most competitive and dynamic economies in the world.
There is no other option: if the EU wants to become a credible global player in the new economy and the information society, substantive amounts of money should be invested in this domain as soon as possible.
Finally, the allocation of money for research should always be informed by a consideration for the environment.
By funding research into renewable energies, this report shows itself to be balanced and environmentally sound.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Madam President, during this afternoon' s vote, there was unfortunately some confusion with regard to the Jarzembowski report.
The view adopted by my group was that if cargo handling was not included in the directive, we would vote against it.
We thought that that was the case, but that appeared not so.
Hence the confusion.
It was our group' s intention at the end, during the final vote, to vote in favour and not against, as we did, and I should like to have this minuted.
Mr Sterckx, we gladly note your group' s wishes.
International situation
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the international situation.
Mrs Durant, President-in-Office of the Council, now has the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since the attacks on 11 September the international situation has entered a serious crisis.
The purpose of my statement is to update you on the crisis and inform you of the initiatives that the Council has taken and will take further.
I will therefore concentrate on the question of Afghanistan, which lies at the heart of the current crisis, after which I will also discuss the situation in the Middle East.
With regard to Afghanistan, when the Council found itself faced with an emergency situation it reacted with determination and clarity.
At its meetings of 21 September and 19 October, the European Council defined the framework of the European Union's action, which comprises two main elements.
The first is solidarity with the United States and support for the actions taken as part of its legitimate defence and in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1368, on the understanding that these actions must be targeted and endeavour to spare the civilian population.
The second is to contribute to the anti-terrorist coalition formed under the aegis of the United Nations.
In late September, the troika visited Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, where it had in fact met the Arab League leaders.
Recently, it visited countries in Central Asia.
The EU-Russia Summit of 3 October and the European Conference of 20 October were an opportunity to discuss the action to be taken at international level.
The November meeting of the General Assembly will offer a further opportunity to reinforce this coalition.
In concrete terms, the European Union's strategy towards Afghanistan follows five broad lines: attaching priority to emergency humanitarian aid, the central role of the UN, the quest for a just and lasting internal political settlement, the importance of a reconstruction plan for the country and, lastly, the need to give the stabilisation plan a regional dimension.
It should be noted that the General Affairs Council of 17 October in Luxembourg and the informal summit of 19 October in Ghent clearly approved these five strategy lines.
With regard to emergency humanitarian aid, to date we have mobilised some EUR 320 million to deal with the crisis of the refugees and displaced people and with the effects of the famine.
The main difficulty is access to the people in need, which requires full cooperation from Afghanistan's neighbouring states.
The presidency has taken various steps to that end.
With regard to the release and distribution of the aid, there is close cooperation between the Member States' cooperation agencies, ECHO and the various international humanitarian organisations, such as the HCR, the World Food Programme, the ICRC and the many NGOs.
The second strategy line is the central role of the UN.
The European Union recognises the United Nations as the sole body with the international legitimacy to seek an internal political solution.
The United Nations will also have a determining role to play in the implementation of a reconstruction plan for the country.
The European Union therefore supports the UN Secretary-General and his representative for Afghanistan in their efforts.
It is also most interested in the plan that has just been submitted by Mr Brahimi, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative.
The Council is coordinating its efforts with a view to deciding how best it can contribute to the implementation of this plan.
On the question of an internal political settlement, the European Union believes it is important for the future Afghan authorities to be elected by the Afghans, for them to be representative of the ethnic groups on the ground and for them to respect and promote human rights, humanitarian rights and the rule of law in general; finally, they must refuse to cooperate in any way with terrorism and maintain harmonious relations with neighbouring states, thereby contributing to general stabilisation.
For the time being, the European Union prefers not to openly advocate any one solution over another, leaving this to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and to the Afghans themselves.
Regarding the reconstruction plan, in the light of internal political developments in Afghanistan, the European Union believes it is urgently necessary to draw up a reconstruction plan for the country.
It wishes to be involved, together with many other actors, including the donor countries and international organisations.
It also believes that this will be a long-term undertaking that will require a long-term commitment by those participating in the plan.
With regard to regional strategy, the European Union believes there can be no lasting peace in Afghanistan unless a regional approach is taken.
In other words, Afghanistan's neighbours, together with certain other powers in the region, must be convinced that peace in Afghanistan will also be to their advantage.
Legitimate account must also be taken of these states' security concerns, so as to avoid any further repetition of the foreign interference that has so often undermined Afghanistan and fuelled its internal conflicts.
The European Union regards the following countries and international organisations as having an essential role to play in any regional strategy with regard to the Afghan question: Pakistan, Iran, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China, Russia and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.
Obviously we cannot discuss the latest developments.
Events have speeded up over the last few days with the capture of Mazar-I-Sharif and Kabul.
These events show that the Taliban regime and the terrorist networks are gradually losing control of Afghanistan.
They represent another step towards achieving the international coalition's objectives, namely to root out the terrorist networks.
During these crucial hours for Afghanistan's future, Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the European Council, reiterated the Council's position yesterday, namely that there will be no stability in Afghanistan until a government can be established that is stable, legitimate, democratic and representative of all ethnic groups.
This government will also have to adhere fully to the principles of human rights.
He also pointed out that the United Nations must play a key role in helping the Afghans to form a government.
The European Union intends to support the United Nations' plans to that end and strongly urges the Northern Alliance to contribute unreservedly to these efforts.
Moreover, the EU is prepared to help Afghanistan draw up and implement a vast reconstruction plan, a vital guarantee of a return to peace.
This project in no way affects the priority given to emergency humanitarian aid, which the Afghan people now need more urgently than ever.
Finally, the President-in-Office of the European Council stressed the regional dimension of the Afghan issue.
While the Afghans must, of course, themselves decide who will govern in the future, at the same time, all the other countries in the region will have to feel reassured by this new Afghan government.
It is with this in mind that the President of the European Council, accompanied by the President of the Commission, will be visiting India and Pakistan on 23 and 24 November.
With regard to the Middle East, the European Union continues to be deeply concerned by the situation there.
The violence and lack of trust between the different parties have prevented a resumption of the political dialogue that should begin with the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report recommendations and should conclude with a just and lasting solution to the conflict, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principles set out in Madrid and Oslo.
As part of its strategy of relay diplomacy, the European Union, whether in the form of representatives of the Member States or of the Council, is always present on the ground.
Thanks largely to the activities of Mr Solana, the High Representative, Mr Moratinos, the Special Envoy, and several European ministers, after many false starts, the Peres-Arafat meeting finally took place on 26 September.
Unfortunately, the Israelis and the Palestinians did not succeed in this renewed attempt to call a ceasefire.
The Euromed Conference held in Brussels on 5 and 6 November was an opportunity for a wide-ranging exchange of views on the question of the stability and security of the Mediterranean region.
It allowed the participants, amongst other things, to take a further step towards resuming a high-level dialogue that could, eventually, restore the trust that would be needed before negotiations on the final status could resume.
The President of the European Council and the President-in-Office of the Council will be heading for the Middle East again this week.
They will be accompanied by the President of the Commission and by Mr Solana, the High Representative, whose important role is acknowledged by all the parties involved.
This mission, which comes under the mandate the informal Council of Ghent entrusted to the Belgian Presidency, will offer an opportunity to remind the parties, once again, of the European Union's clear position on the goals the final negotiations must seek to achieve. These are, for the Palestinians, the constitution of a viable and democratic State and an end to the occupation of their territory; for the Israelis, the right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.
The European Union will also point out that the quest for a global and lasting peace in the region means taking due account of the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the conflict, which must be resolved on the basis of the same principles.
To conclude, as you can see, up to this point the European Union has not stinted its efforts to seek a rapprochement between the various points of view in the Middle East and it will continue along this track for as long as is necessary.
Furthermore, the European Union continues to keep a very close watch over the development of the situation in Afghanistan and throughout the Central Asian region.
As a member of the anti-terrorist coalition, it will continue its action to combat all forms of support for international terrorism.
Madam President, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, as you know the situation in Afghanistan is changing very quickly.
Every hour brings its fresh share of dramatic news.
The military strategy against the Taliban has proved successful.
Yet it is important to emphasise that despite the encouraging developments of recent days, the task is far from completed.
The military campaign has not yet achieved all its objectives and we have always made it clear that we regard humanitarian and diplomatic issues as vitally important.
In the light of what has happened, we will have to redouble our efforts in this regard.
Moreover, even greater efforts will have to be made to establish a broad-based government for the Afghan people.
As Mrs Durant emphasised, we strongly support the process conducted by the United Nations, under the aegis of Ambassador Brahimi.
Furthermore, we must exploit the new military situation and intensify our humanitarian efforts.
The Commission is playing an active role on both these fronts.
Last week, Commissioner Patten met Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, and this week he has held talks with Ambassador Brahimi in New York.
The Commission will cooperate closely with the World Bank and the other parties involved with a view to evaluating the needs and contributing to the reconstruction work in Afghanistan.
The Commission does not propose to speculate at this moment on the exact amounts of money involved.
First of all the international community will have to assess urgent needs and, in consultation with the Afghan people, define exactly what is needed.
Meanwhile, we are trying to ensure that the EUR 52 million in aid allocated under the ECHO programme for 2001 and the EUR 22.5 million earmarked in 2001 for displaced persons will indeed reach those who need it.
In addition, thanks to the World Food Programme, we are now providing EUR 23.5 million in food aid, that is, about 36 300 tonnes, and we are granting the NGOs EUR 4.5 million for supplying the population with food, seeds and tools, that is, a total of EUR 100 million in aid this year.
Furthermore, we have already decided, at the very least, to maintain these levels in 2002.
As you know, the Commission has spared no effort since the events of 11 September.
As you also know, in the space of a few days we presented new measures to combat terrorism in Europe and, in particular, proposed a common definition of acts of terrorism, a European arrest warrant to replace the cumbersome extradition system now in force between the Member States, more stringent rules on money laundering and, lastly, legislative provisions to ensure that the assets of an individual or an organisation can be quickly frozen throughout Europe as soon as they are identified as a potential source of finance for terrorism.
Moreover, the Commission hastened to take measures to improve aviation security, ranging from access to the cockpit to luggage checks.
At the same time, the European ministers jointly decided that the Member States should try to protect the airlines from the worst consequences of 11 September, for instance, by giving them insurance cover against acts of terrorism, something the commercial insurance companies were no longer offering, while avoiding a war of subsidies, which would distort competition.
The European Union is also distributing massive humanitarian aid both within and outside Afghanistan.
The Union and its Member States have already mobilised EUR 310 million to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people.
This effort, which only the United States has surpassed, has largely gone unheeded, but it has already saved lives.
Furthermore, the ECHO humanitarian aid office has been remarkably diligent in acting on its undertakings.
Under the aegis of President Romano Prodi, the Commission is also involved in crucial diplomatic efforts; Mrs Durant has already described Mr Prodi's itinerary over the coming days and weeks.
This clearly shows that Europeans want to take a balanced, international diplomatic approach.
As you know, in the days immediately after the attacks, Mr Chris Patten, accompanied by Mr Louis Michel, the Belgian Foreign Minister representing the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council, and Mr Solana, travelled to Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Wherever they went, the message they heard was the same: mankind as a whole must unite in the fight against terrorism.
They discussed the need for closer cooperation within the region.
The Union has already taken an important trade decision by improving the access of Pakistani exports to Europe and we hope we will soon be able to conclude a free-trade agreement with the six Gulf Cooperation Council states.
Furthermore, we will be putting forward proposals on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran.
We will also play our full part in the efforts to relaunch the peace process in the Middle East, not only by giving financial support to the Palestinian Authority, which is beset by enormous difficulties, but also by trying to ensure the implementation of the Mitchell report that the European Union co-signed.
As Mrs Durant pointed out, this week Mr Peres and Mr Arafat both attended the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held in Brussels.
As you can see, the European Union is pursuing a common foreign policy, but this is not a single policy.
Each country, each institution, draws on its own assets and pools its own resources for the sake of the common cause.
The action the individual Member States decide to take underpins the common effort, and vice versa.
The fact that the Member States take independent measures, especially in times of crisis, is not a sign of failure on the part of the Union.
It illustrates the very nature of the Union.
In conclusion, let me tell you, on behalf of the Commission, that we are all aware that the events of 11 September have changed the parameters and we have recognised that the attacks on New York and Washington were attacks not only on the United States but also on every free and open society.
The threat is a common threat, which is why it needs a concerted response.
The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, are making their full contribution to this common objective and we intend to continue along these lines.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the day before yesterday, an aeroplane crashed over New York, and once again, we all held our breath because we were afraid that it was another terrorist attack.
Thankfully, it was not an act of terrorism, although it was a truly horrific incident.
However, Monday's fears show that terrorism is affecting our lives and that we cannot simply continue with 'business as usual' .
We must therefore make it clear that we regard terrorism as an enormous challenge, an intellectual, political, economic and, indeed, a military challenge.
I welcome your comments, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
They tie in precisely with the keywords which I have written in my notes: we must dismantle the terrorist networks.
This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan.
We have all seen the pictures, which show the joy on people's faces in Kabul but also the dead bodies, obviously the victims of massacres. We therefore appeal to the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, a responsible leader whom we welcomed here in April, to conduct itself in Afghanistan and in Kabul in a way which demonstrates that it is a good representative, also for human dignity and a better future for this suffering country.
What we now need, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council on this point, is action from the United Nations.
I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way.
However, what we also need, and the European Union must play a key role here, is an alliance, a coalition for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
We must not repeat the mistake of the 1980s and 1990s, when we left Afghanistan to fend for itself. We must give Afghanistan our help.
The European Union's role throughout this conflict, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has been rather pathetic.
Of course, the military issues are primarily national issues.
We are not yet at the point where we, Europeans, can genuinely take on a joint role.
However, I am extremely embarrassed by the conduct of some of the European Union countries over recent weeks.
First of all, there was a tripartite meeting during the informal summit in Ghent, and then there was the meeting in London.
I must say that I found this embarrassing.
We do not have any self-appointed chiefs within the European Union; we have a European Union with a Council Presidency and a Commission.
In London, the representatives, even the President-in-Office of the Council, invited themselves, and I found that especially embarrassing.
Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and the Belgian Presidency attended the meeting in London; Greece, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark did not.
I would have expected the Belgian Presidency, which I hold in high esteem, especially the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, to protest about this meeting, as it should have been the presidency's task to invite Member States to a meeting of this kind instead of having to request an invitation to go to London.
I hope that different procedures will be adopted in future and that this kind of division within the European Union will not happen again.
Of course, we have to learn from our mistakes.
I hope that we will learn from these mistakes as well.
From our group's point of view, it is essential that we act jointly, not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation.
We want joint action from Europe, and we expect resolute and courageous action from the Council Presidency in this context too.
We will support the Council Presidency if it responds in this way, and we will also support the Commission.
Mr Busquin, I call upon the Commission, its President and all its members: please make Europe's voice heard!
The Commission must get involved; it must state its opinion, and it must not simply accept what we have witnessed in recent weeks and months.
We have a chance if we take this resolute stance, and I can say on behalf of our group that we will be resolute in our support for the Council Presidency and the Commission if the shared interests of the European Union are stated clearly.
We call on you to take this action.
If you do so, you can be sure of our support.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, little more than two months after the attacks of 11 September, we have all understood, including the United States, that, in order to confront global terrorism, we need to create a policy with many dimensions: military, security, intelligence, humanitarian, I would add cultural, and others.
And we need a common will: that of the coalition, whose framework or basis is the United Nations.
The news over recent days confirms that hope is beginning to come to Afghanistan, and we must state one thing very clearly: the primary victims and hostages of the aggressive fundamentalism of terrorism have been the Afghans, and particularly, the Afghan women, because it is they who have suffered most from this situation.
This is demonstrated by the television pictures we are seeing of women, and men, but particularly women, who can now move around with their faces exposed.
That is my first point.
We now have the obligation, through the United Nations, to seek a political solution to the Afghan situation, firstly, and to the whole complex problem of Central Asia.
The European Union must continue to cooperate in terms of humanitarian aid and cooperate with the UNHCR in order to deal with the problem of the refugees and displaced persons, and also so that, under the auspices of the United Nations, there is a plan for stability and future democracy in Afghanistan.
Secondly, we must continue to intensify our action, so that the European Union can respond to terrorism.
Police cooperation is improving.
Just yesterday, eleven people from Bin Laden' s network in Spain were arrested in my country, and this is happening every day in other countries of the Union.
In general, we are guaranteeing the rights of people who want to fight our democratic and pluralist system, and this is to our credit, but it causes problems.
And in Parliament we are trying to move ahead quickly, together with the Commission, to create a common anti-terrorist policy.
We must continue in that vein.
Thirdly, we note that we lack the capacity to act jointly in a military sense.
Up to a point, we have compensated for that lack by means of other policies, but that does not justify this vacuum in the security and defence policy.
Rather than looking back to see who was at the meeting in Ghent, or, bringing to mind that old film, 'Guess who' s coming to dinner' , working out who was in London and who was not, what the European Parliament has to say to the Council and the Commission is that we want the security and defence policy to be included in the Treaties.
I will take this opportunity to say to the Commissioner that my group, and, I believe, the whole of Parliament, hopes that the Commission, using its powers as guardian of the Treaties, and also its powers of initiative, will take a clear approach in relation to Laeken and the Convention by raising these issues.
We will support them in that and, in this way, we will be able to overcome the current situation: updating our security and defence policy, updating the Petersberg tasks and stating it jointly.
That must be our response.
I would like to make a final comment, Madam President, on an absolutely essential point which we were able to raise in the Euro-Mediterranean forum, which followed the forum held by the Council, where we were able to speak with our colleagues, parliamentarians from both sides of the Mediterranean.
We heard voices - Arab, Israeli and European - agreeing that we have to continue working, and the European Union is playing a central role for the first time, in order to create an Israeli State with secure borders together with a Palestinian State which also has secure borders.
This is the only possible basis for a stable solution in the Middle East.
We, in Parliament, must therefore decisively support the work of our representatives, both here and in the Middle East.
Madam President, the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends, as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban, although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view.
However there are aspects of the war and not just the terrorist aspect which have been kept hidden and one group I should like to mention - to which, Madam President, you paid tribute on Monday - is the journalists who paid the ultimate price to tell us the story.
We know so little about modern war and we are so excluded by the powers-that-be that without the commitment and professionalism of journalists we would know nothing.
We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude.
What we know from the comparative success in Mazar-i-Sharif and now in Kabul, and even reports of the front line extending to Kandahar, is that new challenges are presenting themselves.
The international coalition - particularly the United States and not least its President - has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable, that it will do certain things and not others.
So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul.
But it is there.
It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped.
It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process, even if not yet a stable government.
It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak, as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul.
But we also hear of new fears, because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban.
So there is a great need for urgency.
The second challenge is the humanitarian one, which preceded the war but has been compounded by it.
Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control, we must visibly and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground.
Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action.
The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money, which I think he said were largely unrecognised.
Unfortunately Europe's contribution is often unremarked in these situations, and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity, not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort.
I have two final comments.
One concerns the Middle East.
I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues, the Belgian Presidency, the Commission and others, because, while America has been looking in another direction, we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions, a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace.
Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy.
My group is strongly in favour of it and welcomed the moves in that direction.
We thought that was what ESDP was, until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy.
Madam President, I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy, which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I shall confine my contribution to Afghanistan.
It is extremely difficult to question the military course of affairs because the situation is so extremely fluid.
I should nevertheless like to ask one question in this connection, namely with regard to an element which, in my view, will remain high-priority for the foreseeable future.
It concerns the idea of sending a UN peace-keeping force to Kabul to ensure that the situation there does not get out of hand.
Has the Council discussed in any way or at any time the fact that European countries, or the Union perhaps as a whole, would make a contribution to the UN peace-keeping force, or does the Council hold the view that it would be best if this UN peace-keeping force were to comprise representatives from Muslim countries only?
In other words, is future involvement by the EU provided for in this UN peace-keeping force?
I should now like to turn to the humanitarian aspect.
It is clear that there are still many needs and it is also evident that the invasion of large parts of Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance enhances the prospect of granting this aid.
Does the Commission know whether at the moment, or over the next few days, all aid which the Commission wishes to grant is being delivered promptly and adequately, or are there still obstacles?
If so, what are they?
Finally, I should like to touch upon the political and diplomatic dimension.
My group fears that the politicians will be trampled underfoot by the military.
The fact of the matter is that the military conquests have preceded the political ones.
My group is concerned that finding a political solution could be frustrated or perhaps even made impossible if the Northern Alliance continues to advance southwards.
I know that the European Union and the EU Member States, alongside UN representative Mr Brahimi, are involved in finding what you refer to as a stable government.
What is the EU' s specific involvement at the moment, and in the next few days, in finding this political solution which, in my view, takes priority over anything else?
This might well be higher on the list of priorities than a military solution.
If no political solution is found, any military invasion could well be in vain.
I should like to finish off with a comment on London.
I am not so much concerned about the fact that countries that make military contributions, and that want to discuss this, meet in London.
What does worry me is the fact that the agenda of London also featured the Middle East policy.
I would ask you, among others, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether Middle East policy is drafted in London or in Brussels.
Mrs Durant, Commissioner Busquin, let us not disguise our pleasure at once again hearing the sound of music on the streets of the Afghan capital and a woman's voice broadcasting on Radio Kabul.
It does us all good to read the sense of liberation on the faces of the Afghans and the rout of some of the most obscurantist and cruel oppressors the world has seen.
Let us however, without further ado, take a good look at all the aspects of the situation today, to make sure that our hopes are not soon overshadowed by a new nightmare.
Firstly, the fighting is, alas, not yet at an end.
The Taliban have regrouped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan, where they will go to any lengths to try to save, at whatever price, the remnants of their power and capacity to inflict harm.
It would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from Pashtun groupings, who might feel rejected by the new leaders of Afghanistan.
As for the various rival factions that make up the Northern Alliance, we must beware of idealising them.
The way women are treated in some of the provinces under its control gives real cause for concern.
Furthermore, its past conduct, only five years ago, and the disturbing information we have received from Mazar-i-Sharif unfortunately suggest that there is a risk that sooner or later they will embark on a bloody settling of scores in the reconquered territories.
Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution.
From the outset, the political issue has been the determining factor.
Secondly, we must look at the distress of the Afghan people, exhausted by five years of terror, months of drought and misery, followed by five weeks of intensive bombing.
The UN estimates that seven and a half million people are at risk of famine in this devastated country.
In fact, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN Special Representative, has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason.
What the country does need, however, is emergency aid and development aid on a large scale.
For let us not forget that international opinion was mobilised specifically in order to neutralise the terrorist networks, to cut off the sources, mainly financial, that feed them and also to destroy the social and political breeding ground on which they thrive.
To date, we have certainly not achieved this just and ambitious aim and any failure to find a political solution to the Afghan problem would only take us further from attaining it.
This explains the role that an international player such as the European Union, and particularly the UN, must fulfil through its Member States, as well as within the framework of our relations with the American leaders and with the countries of the region. This will enable a political solution to be found that comes from all sectors of Afghan society and from Afghanis who, until now have been the chief victims of the Taliban, must now be among the agents of change.
It is high time this martyred population was offered stability, dignity and peace.
Madam President, there is a taboo word that I have not heard mentioned in this hour of debate and which I do not hear in the negotiation meetings held in Rome or Peshawar, in Islamabad or New York.
It is a taboo which I, or rather we, intend to confront: women' s participation, the substantial participation of women in the provisional government of Afghanistan.
The United Nations Secretary General hopes for an ethnically balanced transitional government.
The Council, in the person of Mrs Durant, has told us she hopes for a fair and lasting composition.
But what justice are we talking about?
What balance are we talking about?
Millions of Afghan women have not only been the primary victims but have also been the major architects of non-violent opposition all these years throughout the world.
You know them: they are the women from Negar and RAWA; they have been here in the European Parliament; they were the ones who ran the country before the Taliban.
They made up 40 per cent of the medical staff, 50 per cent of the teachers, 70 per cent of the administration, while the men were off making war.
Yet around the negotiating table I only see men with beards, some longer, some shorter, but I have not seen any of those fantastic women we have met any more.
Well, I know very well that I will be greeted with smiles and grins everywhere.
I know very well how I felt when faced by those smiles in ' 97 and ' 98, when this Parliament and the Commission were, to my knowledge, the only institutions that supported the campaign 'A flower for the women of Kabul' in 1997.
This courage of ours - of yours, ladies and gentlemen - I believe should continue.
Now, enough of the gossip, the discrimination, the exclamations of 'women, poor things' !
No, enough of that!
We want Afghan women to take on conspicuous political responsibility in the reconstruction of their country in the transitional government.
I know this will not be enough; I know public opinion needs to be mobilised.
Therefore on 24 November we are promoting a day of fasting throughout the world, a world satyagraha, precisely so that women can at last form a part of this provisional government.
I hope this proposal of ours will not be received with the usual derision.
Often, those who concern themselves seriously with human rights have much greater vision, application and objectivity than those who always believe they know it all and think that the world today can go on simply with the traditional Realpolitik.
Things are not like that.
The human side, people are the architects of their futures.
What future can there be, however, without half of the population?
Therefore: 24 November, world satyagraha day, so that women can form part of this provisional government.
Madam President, last April, when we received Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud in this Chamber, he told us that the fall of the Taliban regime was inevitable given that the Pakistani government would find itself unable to provide it with any political and, in particular, military aid.
All that Massoud asked of the international community and the European Union was to exercise effective diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to stop it from interfering in any way in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan.
He was counting on his awareness of the Afghan people's exasperation with the Taliban when he predicted that it would rebel, including in the largely Pashtun southern territories.
He assured us that he had set up an Alliance network throughout the country that would guarantee the establishment of a broad-based government of national unity.
The speed of events over the past 48 hours has surprised only those of our learned experts who, without ever having been on the ground, professed that the anti-Taliban Alliance was made up only of a bunch of warlords who were just as barbaric as the Taliban themselves, and even more dangerous because inspired only by a hunger for power that would inevitably trigger new quarrels among themselves.
Echoing the anxiety shown in Islamabad, these same experts, totally certain they are right, are still spreading the word via the media that the Northern Alliance represents only a very small percentage of the opinion of the Afghan people, who are supposedly still attached to the peace that only the Taliban have managed to bring them.
The jubilant popular demonstrations in Kabul, the rebellion now underway in Kandahar itself, the signs of the return of thousands of refugees suffice to show that these prophets of doom were misled.
The Members of this Chamber who had the intelligence to listen to Massoud will certainly rejoice.
Yes, the situation remains politically fragile.
It is up to the international community, and within it the European Union, to help establish this united government, which the former king, Zahir Shah, is willing to support.
Yes, we must also give the Afghan people all the material aid it needs to recover from a disastrous humanitarian situation, in which, as Mr Wurtz said, we fear for the survival of 1.5 million Afghans who are at risk of famine and for the health of more than 6 million who are now at risk of serious malnutrition.
We hoped that the Council and the Commission would be prepared to give undertakings along these lines without delay.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for confirming this.
Madam President, Afghanistan is currently going through a time of uncertainty that will prove crucial for the future.
The end of the Taliban dictatorship opens the door to a process of democratic reconstruction, which, however, is still far from a foregone conclusion.
We will probably see Islamist guerrilla warfare on the Algerian model, against which massive bombing is pointless and will have to be halted.
The European Union must adopt a strong and clear stance for, as Mrs Emma Bonino and Mr Francis Wurtz said, Afghan women must not be sacrificed in the process of political reconstruction.
The participation of women is the key to the lasting reconstruction of Afghanistan.
They will have to be present as from the first negotiations and will have to participate in a new government as from the first day.
That is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights.
The European Union could not endorse a proposed government that did not take account of this crucial dimension.
The integration of women is also a first step towards democracy.
Unfortunately, this democracy cannot accommodate warlords who have proved guilty of repeated human rights abuses, a wide range of acts of violence and who, whatever side they are on, are more concerned with defending their ethnic group than with the future of their country.
We must put an end to the reign of impunity.
The Afghans must be represented by a mixed, democratic government that represents all the ethnic groups and respects human rights.
Madam President, recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working.
The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective.
The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden, an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror, not only this year, but in recent years too.
Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself.
The fall of key strategic cities in Afghanistan this week will certainly help in the process of eroding the power of the Taliban.
But much work remains to be done if the Taliban are to be defeated in the near future.
They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience.
I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan.
This is not going to be an easy task, but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option.
Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice.
We too must prevent further terrorist attacks, and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together.
One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people.
The international community, under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union, must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people.
A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter.
There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.
This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations.
In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan.
We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated.
Clearly, a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on.
In conclusion, it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam.
There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union.
The European Union as a political entity is a friend, and will always be a friend, to the Muslim people.
We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it has been shown that the strategy pursued in Afghanistan by the coalition against terrorism is the right one.
It has also been shown that this is not merely a matter of hunting down terrorists, but also liberating a nation from a government which is far from popular among its own people.
This has been shown quite clearly, and I think we should say so in all frankness in order to make it clear in this way that we have nothing against an Islamic people; on the contrary, we want to work with it to build a future in freedom.
Of course, this also means, and this is borne out by Afghanistan's history, that we should work together with its own government and respect its decisions, and that it is not our task to involve ourselves in the details.
I think this is also extremely important if the task of creating a government of reconciliation in Afghanistan is to be mastered successfully.
Here, the European Union must take an active role with its conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capacities and help organise the reconstruction of the country on this basis, as long as this is what the parties involved want.
In more general terms, the events of recent weeks have shown that in the areas where the European Union functions effectively, it can make a significant contribution.
I do not believe that the coalition against terrorism would have operated as effectively in the Middle East without the European Union and the visits by its troika.
On the other hand, we must acknowledge that in the military field, where we are particularly weak, we have continued to rely heavily on bilateralism and directed solutions. I think it is clear that in all areas of security and defence policy, we must move more resolutely towards a community approach.
It must become clear that even the larger Member States, which think they still have a role to play, actually had no influence on all the strategies which have been enforced. We must therefore accept that we will only have a role to play if we act jointly, if we achieve our common goal of establishing a 60 000-strong rapid deployment force by 2003, and if we underpin our conflict prevention and crisis management capacities credibly with this third component.
I also think that this must, to a substantial extent, be discussed in the light of Laeken and in the context of the post-Nice process.
Time and again, when we are active in the foreign policy field, we see the extent to which our inadequate structures prevent us from bringing our full weight to bear.
I am thinking in particular of the frequent organisational chaos in the Balkans and the competition not only between Solana and Patten but also between the parallel structures which were established and which, as experience has shown, work against and not with each other.
These structures must be rationalised, perhaps in the hands of the Commission with their own legitimation via the Council.
In my view, these are the lessons we have learned from the last two months, and we should call on the governments in our countries to respond appropriately. I believe it is necessary, in the interests of the future viability of our nations, to cultivate this community method to a greater extent in future in the field of foreign and security policy too.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I hope you will forgive me if I go over my speaking time by half a minute.
Since Mr McMillan-Scott is not here, we could possibly steal half a minute of his time.
First of all, I should like to say that, unfortunately, the objective of the fight against international terrorism has not been achieved with the fall of Kabul nor will it be by a possible fall of Kandahar soon.
We must, of course, focus on many other criteria.
Of major importance are, naturally, the tracking down of terrorist cells in, inter alia, Europe, the freezing of financial sources of international terrorism and the whole discussion, also in our society, around the question as to what groups are, in fact, active in our society and how we can call a halt to their activities.
In my view, a large number of conditions must also be created in Afghanistan in order to be able to remove this kind of breeding ground for international terrorism.
A multi-ethnic government is logical, but we must also manage to find a special solution for Kabul, of course.
Peace must be established with the countries around Afghanistan to ensure that an area of stability and peace is created.
The refugees must be able to return home and a massive amount of money must be invested in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Finally, we must ensure that a government is put in place that respects human rights.
That is a total package.
The causes can be found indirectly in the Middle East.
Although that is not the case, that argument is being used by Bin Laden.
I therefore believe that the Middle East peace process needs an extra boost and I also wonder whether the time has come to do this now.
I would direct this question to the President-in-Office of the Council, if she happens to be listening.
I would especially ask you whether you, together with the Commission, could not ensure that a UN resolution on a Palestinian state could now be laid down at long last?
Has the time not come for pushing for breakthroughs on this score, as we did years ago with Israel?
I also wonder whether an evaluation is not needed of the role of Saudi-Arabia in the funding of all possible institutions in western Europe which one would be right to question?
The position of Syria has already been mentioned.
As our President has already pointed out, I also believe it is useful and necessary to help the young Assad to play the far more positive role which we had all expected of him, but which, through all kinds of circumstances, he was unable to fulfil.
As, however, Syria plays a crucial role, a great deal more needs to be done there.
If we as the EU want to play a part, also in the peace process as a whole, we must be careful what action we undertake, for example, in connection with the arms sales or the supply of goods for dual use to Iran.
Israel is monitoring the proceedings with great concern, and I believe that these kinds of signals are of the utmost importance.
Finally, nearly everyone has already said it, and I am not about to repeat it, but it is unacceptable for the European Union to continue to send out a disintegrated picture.
We must show a united front and act at Community level in terms of external, peace and security policy.
If we still fail to get the message, how can we then expect to play a role on the world stage?
I therefore make a dramatic appeal, also to the presidency, to make huge strides forward on this score.
Madam President, I am very glad we are holding this debate today, at a moment when the situation in Afghan is changing by the hour and, I hope, for the better.
I know that Europe has two obligations towards Afghanistan.
Together with the UN, we must press for a political settlement of the conflict, aimed, as Guy Verhofstadt said, at the establishment of a stable, legitimate and democratic government that is very broadly representative of all the ethnic groups and abides by the principles of human rights.
Yet I believe we also have a second duty towards Afghanistan, an urgent duty.
We know that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is a tragedy.
It is the result of the combined effect of a war that has been devastating this country for 23 years and the drought that has plagued it for the past three years.
We know that seven million people were dependent on humanitarian aid even before the military operations began.
We also know that up to 100 000 children may die this winter unless adequate supplies reach them in the coming weeks.
That is why we call on Europe to take urgent, large-scale measures in face of this humanitarian tragedy.
In the framework of what we hope will become a process of permanent consultation between the European Union, the United States, Afghanistan's neighbouring states, the specialist UN agencies and the NGOs working in Afghanistan, we call, as you, Madam President, have also done on several occasions, for the creation of safe humanitarian corridors through which emergency food aid and shelter for the displaced Afghans can be brought in.
This is not only an urgent requirement; it is quite simply the duty of the peoples of the European Union, whom we represent here.
Madam President, I will reply or, at least, try to give some kind of reply to the comments made during this debate, which is all the more interesting because it is being held at a moment when we have very high hopes while at the same time having little idea of what the outcome will be.
Let me first take you back to the famous meeting in London that several of you mentioned and remind you that this meeting was certainly not arranged at the presidency's initiative.
The presidency is responsible for inviting and chairing the meetings of the Fifteen.
The Ghent meeting, by contrast, was convened for military reasons or, in other words, those who wished to meet in Ghent cited military reasons.
In regard to the London meeting, let me also point out that the presidency was invited to that meeting but as I said, the meeting was not held at its initiative.
Once he had been invited, Mr Verhofstadt, the President of the European Council, naturally contacted his various colleagues immediately to ascertain their individual positions.
He was strongly encouraged to go to London and at the COREPER meeting the following day, he immediately undertook to report back on everything that would be said in London and chose to be accompanied by Mr Solana, since he felt that these issues were indeed most important and related to security.
So these are a few facts about the context of this meeting in London. Allow me to repeat that the European Union obviously plays a diplomatic and political role but also a humanitarian one - and I am saying this not just by the way but as a definite statement.
I declared in my introductory statement, as Mr Busquin also declared on behalf of the Commission, that we attach great importance to humanitarian questions, not only at the level of words or financial resources, but also and above all at the level of deeds.
We are making sure that we take action here.
You may be certain that the presidency of the Council and the Commission are determined to make very concrete, specific and urgent progress in terms of responding to the situation and endeavouring to do so very visibly.
It is indeed important, over and above the action to be taken, for people to know and see that the European Union wants to play and will play a role in this respect.
I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice.
I can assure you that the Presidency of the Council has done its utmost to ensure this, in particular at the London meeting. It was a meeting we did not convene but prior to which the presidency was asked to consult the other Member States and to attend together with Mr Solana.
That is what I have to say on London, Ghent and these matters.
In reply to Mr Lagendijk's question about, amongst other things, the United Nations force and the post-Taliban regime, the Council has not yet discussed the participation of the European Union as such in a United Nations force and has not, therefore, determined its position at this stage.
Therefore I cannot give it.
Conversely, regarding the stabilisation of the post-Taliban regime, I think that will necessarily require consultation with the countries of the region under the aegis of the United Nations and therefore of the Security Council.
Since we are discussing this post-Taliban regime, which we all hope will be stable, multi-ethnic and democratic, while also knowing that the road will be a difficult one, let me put particular emphasis on a question which I and the Presidency of the Council feel very strongly about, namely the gender question.
We must indeed aim at a representation and a government that are more democratic, stable, etc. But we must also take the gender question into consideration.
Neither I nor the Presidency of the Council would find it comprehensible if Afghan women, who were the first victims of the Taliban regime and who suffered a great many deprivations, especially of their rights, while taking on huge responsibilities, were excluded from the formation of this government and its future activities.
Lastly, I think nearly all the speakers pointed out that we very much need to adopt a more integrated European stance on common security.
We need to act as a community.
The Belgian Presidency is convinced of this and I really hope this question will be on the agenda of the Laeken Summit.
Recent events have made it abundantly clear that we have to move forward together, in a more harmonious manner and as a community.
These are the replies I wanted to make to this debate, which, I believe, has highlighted some extremely useful and important principles for the days, weeks and months ahead.
Madam President, I just wanted to make three clarifications.
As Mrs Durant pointed out, the question of humanitarian aid is of course paramount.
As many speakers have also shown, it is a priority at a time when winter is approaching and the people are in danger.
I can only confirm our resolve to release the funds that have been allocated.
Let me repeat that the amount for 2001 is EUR 100 million, channelled via the World Food Organisation and the non-governmental organisations.
This being said, if we agree about the creation of safety corridors, I think it is then up to us to ensure, via the ECHO instrument, that the aid is delivered as effectively as possible.
That, at least, is the Commission's resolve.
I can only confirm it.
Similarly, the Commission, in consultation with the international community and the Afghan people, including, of course, Afghan women, is assessing the reconstruction needs, as indeed it also did in Serbia, where that process was regarded as a model of speed and efficiency.
Finally, at diplomatic level, Mr Prodi and Mr Patten, in particular, are quite ready to respond to the requests the Presidency of the European Union will no doubt be making to them in the next few days.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks.
Mrs Durant has the floor on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the negotiations on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
The attacks of 11 September have only strengthened our conviction that multilateral instruments for disarmament and non-proliferation are more crucial than ever.
Everything possible must be done to prevent terrorist organisations and their members having access to more powerful means with which to carry out their criminal activities.
The fight against biological weapons must, in this context, be pursued at a more sustained pace, particularly given the threat of potential bioterrorist attacks.
The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a crucial instrument in this process.
The European Union and its Member States have committed themselves to ensuring that this convention is universally observed.
The European Union will be launching, with regard to the Fifth Review Conference on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that will take place in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001, a new call to those States that have not yet signed up to the Convention banning biological and toxin weapons, to ratify this as soon as possible.
Strengthening this Convention is, furthermore, one of the Union' s priorities in the field of disarmament.
The Council, therefore, attaches the greatest importance to concluding the negotiations that have taken place in Geneva, within the ad hoc group, on a legally binding protocol establishing an effective system that will ensure compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
In its conclusions of 11 June 2001, the Council of the European Union once again confirmed its commitment to contribute to the drawing up of a protocol containing a raft of practical measures that it had defined in its common position of 17 May 1999, as essential to the implementation of an effective instrument.
In this regard, the Union regrets the fact that the special group has not managed to fulfil its mandate, which is to conclude these negotiations on a legally binding protocol before the opening of the Fifth Review Conference.
The Union has, in fact, expressed its disappointment at the United States' refusal to accept the synthesis text presented by the chairman of the special group.
The Council is, therefore, maintaining its position.
The threat biological weapons pose requires an appropriate multilateral response.
The Council will continue to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work that must lead to a legally binding instrument and, in particular, to maintaining the special group.
The Union has noted the statement by the United States, according to which that country supports all multilateral mechanisms currently in force for the control, non-proliferation and monitoring of arms exports and has also noted their alternative proposals, which the Union is still studying.
We have already discussed them with the United States and will continue to do so in the context of preparations for the Review Conference.
The Union reserves the right to also formulate its own proposals.
Lastly, the Union hopes that the gains made in the negotiations are preserved and that the Review Conference is able to take decisions that offer prospects for a rapid renewal of negotiations within the multilateral framework of the Convention, with the participation of all States involved.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great deal to add to what Mrs Durant has just said.
I simply wish to confirm that the European Union has, for its part, always been strongly in favour of the compromise text, convinced that it is as important as the agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons, provided that these are accompanied by effective verification measures.
The Union is convinced that sending a negative signal on progress with international commitments on the non-proliferation of weapons would generally be damaging to world security.
As has been said, the compromise has not been accepted.
It is, therefore, unlikely that a resolution will be produced before 19 November, but regular contacts are being maintained between the United States and the European Union on this matter.
The United States take the view, furthermore, that the events of 11 September and those that have followed do not change their position on the verification protocol drawn up by the ad-hoc group.
On the other hand, for its part, the European Union maintains that this compromise text would have enabled a major breakthrough to be made at a particularly critical moment.
The Union also takes the view that the dynamic of discussions in the ad-hoc group must be preserved, even if the form and the procedure have to be adapted to circumstances.
The United States is in the process of drafting new proposals for protection measures against the risk of a biological attack, insisting on the need to defend itself against the risk of terrorism.
The European Union considers that some of the United States' proposals are to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, it also wishes to add others that are intended to improve the Convention and to encourage the development in the longer term of an instrument that is truly binding under law, but that is the very nub of the problem.
The Union will also be proposing a mechanism that will enable us to pursue regular dialogue on the Convention and will open this up to all parties concerned.
These measures will certainly be part of the discussions at the Fifth Review Conference.
In conclusion, and as has already been said, one thing is certain and that is that there will be no protocol verifying the biological weapons convention in the short term.
We are seeking to uphold the achievements of the ad-hoc working group.
Consultation is taking place on a regular basis with the United States and we are trying, on the basis of their proposals, to complement them with our own, so as to preserve the spirit of open and regular dialogue with all parties to the Convention. This, in our view, is the key to multilateralism.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is said that proverbs are the expression of the wisdom of nations and, according to a French proverb, every cloud has a silver lining.
The appalling disaster of the World Trade Center and the launch by a few madmen of a campaign of anthrax poisoning can at least be credited with waking up public opinion and, through public opinion, waking political leaders, making them more aware of the dangers of the development of an international form of terrorism that is bent on imposing its view of the world by all means possible.
In this regard, one only has to think of the recent sabre rattling by Osama Bin Laden.
I hope, by the way, that this will be his last, because he will surely soon have to account to international justice for his crimes.
I hope, however, that following his imminent fall, the international community will pursue its action to control and ban biological and chemical weapons in order to eliminate the terrible threat that they pose.
This is the reasoning behind Parliament' s drafting of the motion for a resolution that will be submitted tomorrow for the approval of our fellow Members.
We are pleased to see the change in the attitude of the American government which, in July, withdrew from negotiations on concluding a protocol to implement the Convention, as you have just reminded us, Commissioner, and we hope that the new conference that is due to take place next week in Geneva, which you informed us about, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, will consequently take place under the best possible auspices.
We wish to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as representative of the Council, for having assured us of the Council' s desire to coordinate the actions of the Member State governments in this area.
To this end, we call on the Commission to set up, under its own control, a specialist agency, that could rapidly intervene whenever breaches of the Convention are suspected.
Could you, Commissioner, give us your personal opinion on this matter?
Mr President, earlier this year we expressed our disappointment at the lack of support from the United States for the reinforcement of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
In the wake of the events of 11 September and the anthrax attacks on the United States, the issue of bio-terror has suddenly become very topical.
Biological weapons are threatening to become part of the asymmetrical warfare which typifies the fight against terrorism.
The Convention is, of course, directed at states, but the effective implementation also makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain these weapons.
These weapons have been banned for a very long time, but are unfortunately still available.
That is why we call for binding international rules in order to monitor compliance with the Convention better.
Fortunately, the Americans are back at the negotiating table.
They have a problem which they are unable to solve on their own.
However, the proposals they have tabled contain too many loopholes.
The tighter and more transparent the controls, the better, and that must also be the EU' s focus of attention at the forthcoming review conference later this month.
The Convention must become an instrument in the search of manufacturers of biological weapons, but also for tracking down existing supplies.
Russia used to implement extensive programmes.
How were they wound up, and what happened with the expertise gathered?
It is rumoured that scientists who worked on these programmes have offered their services elsewhere.
The anthrax attacks in the US compel us yet again to consider how we can stop the arms programmes in Iraq.
For this purpose, the UN must launch new initiatives.
Naturally, the Convention does not offer adequate protection against bio-terror, against the so-called non-governmental players.
This also requires more and better cooperation with the police and intelligence services, as well as better criminal investigation methods.
We need to offer our citizens better protection against possible attacks and the effects thereof.
Many countries take measures in order to protect themselves against anthrax or smallpox better.
The costs involved in those initiatives are enormous.
Poor countries do not have those funds and could for that reason become the principal victim of a possible smallpox epidemic as a result of bio-terror.
I would call on the EU and the EU Member States not only to consider the possible protection of its own citizens, but also to examine whether developing countries can be helped by setting up programmes to protect the people in the event of possible terrorist attacks involving biological weapons.
Mr President, my group, the Liberal Group, wants to make three points, largely in the form of questions.
First of all - and this point will appear in the compromise resolution which is not yet in print but it is certainly in our own resolution - my colleague, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, points out that the United Nations is extremely slow, or has been in the past, to respond when there are reports of breaches of use of these weapons.
For example, when Saddam Hussein, in the early 90s, used these weapons in the marshes of Iraq, it took the United Nations three and a half weeks to get inspectors there, giving Saddam Hussein plenty of time to cover up the evidence of his crimes.
Would the Council kindly point out to the United Nations that we need a much quicker response than three and a half weeks if such incidents happen in future, as we fear may happen.
Secondly - and this appears in the Liberal Group's resolution and also in the compromise resolution - the anthrax problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening.
There is no European Union-wide agency looking at this although, in the USA, there is the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency, under its control, which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases?
That would speed up our reaction and help us on a Union basis.
My third question is addressed to the Council.
I hope it is a hypothetical question.
If the investigations in the USA show that the anthrax outbreak came from Iraq and therefore American public opinion becomes overwhelmingly in favour of an attack on Iraq and - I imagine that George Bush would find it very hard to resist such overwhelming public opinion - what would be the Council's position?
Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well, or would we try to hold George Bush back?
Has the Council considered this?
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, may heaven preserve us from the weapons which serve and are designed to protect us.
After the attack of 11 September on Manhattan, the American people remained in the grip of fear following the anthrax attacks which, although they resulted only in a limited number of victims, have a massive psychological effect which reaches far beyond the United States.
The deadly product that was used points, in terms of its concentration and purity, in the direction of laboratories in the United States itself which are reported to be the only ones in the world that could make the product.
This clearly shows that the risks which our population faces as a result of the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons are insufficiently removed by current legislation.
A conference on this subject matter is to take place in Geneva shortly, and we would remind you that in July, notably, the United States withdrew from the negotiations about the Protocol that is before us.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 14 June to back the approval of this Protocol.
However, we are convinced that an outright ban should apply to both the manufacture and the use of chemical and biological weapons by the international community, and that this ban should be legally binding.
Current supplies should be destroyed expertly, and I fear that the Protocol too could still be too weak to cope with this.
Mr President, we have had a treaty against biological weapons and weapons containing toxins for a very long time now.
It cannot be applied and its application cannot be monitored without a protocol setting out how this is to be done, something we have been trying to achieve for years.
We have not succeeded.
The United States sabotaged the protocol, do not ask me why.
I read papers by American analysts who say that they have not had time to complete various biological warfare programmes which are up and running.
Be that as it may, following the awful events in New York and the anthrax attacks in the United States, we need to get back to the concept of monitoring and applying this treaty as quickly as possible, come what may.
I was astounded to hear the Commissioner say that the position of the United States has not changed and that we are unlikely to have a protocol with provisions on monitoring and applying the treaty in the foreseeable future.
We obviously need to withdraw what we say in the joint motion before you, honourable Members, about welcoming the change in the position of the United States.
We have made a mistake.
We must change it tomorrow in an oral amendment.
Secondly, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not told us how you intend to exert greater pressure on the United States, given that the whole business is down to them.
Will discussion alone suffice, I wonder?
Thirdly, new factors have come into play, Mr President.
It has been proven that genetic engineering can be used for this sort of weapon of mass destruction by applying research into vaccines and other forms of treatment which are easily hijacked for military purposes.
I have tabled an amendment for tomorrow's vote.
I think that we should adopt it and that the European Union should include this issue in the debate.
Finally, if it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, as the FBI is saying, that the anthrax was made and supplied in the United States, are there any Members here who propose that someone, do not ask me who, should bomb the United States?
Mr President, since this is the first time I have spoken in this House, please allow me to greet the presidency, the Council and my fellow Members.
The possible use of military technology and biological and chemical weapons by subversive groups is no longer a remote risk but a real civil defence problem.
The loss of military secrets, experts and materials has now been verified and is the real basis that the strategy of terrorism can use to strike against the civil population, which is defenceless in the face of such new aggression.
To address this new scenario of warfare, in which the enemy is well concealed in the meshes of civil society, protected by the very rights of freedom he is fighting against and where the targets are no longer just the armed forces but the civil population, it is vital to know what threats may be hanging over the safety of the citizens.
In view of the fact that some nations have not signed up to the Geneva Convention on chemical and biological weapons, as we have heard, and have continued to develop these technologies of warfare, we appeal to the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union, as well as all those states that have not taken part or signed up, to provide the international community with detailed information on the biological and chemical agents they know about which could, in some way, be traced or stolen by terrorist groups.
The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation, stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction, and, at the same time, to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is an historic tragedy that the country which has refused to adopt truly effective controls on the use of biological and toxic weapons was the first to fall victim to these brutal attacks.
Of course, this does not prevent us from expressing our deep sympathy with the American people and especially the families affected.
However, I believe that this sign of isolationism and unilateralism, which is still very strong in America, must be viewed by the European Union, and in particular by the Council, as an opportunity to lobby the US very hard, not only on this issue but also on the International Criminal Court, for effective international agreements and monitoring arrangements in the wake of these dreadful attacks.
It is grotesque that in recent days, Congress has debated a bill which vehemently opposes the establishment of the International Criminal Court - a Court which would deal with crimes like these, especially if they were supported and perpetrated by states.
The second important point - and I would like to address the Commission in particular here - is how we, in Europe, are equipped, as far as is humanly possible, to defend ourselves against such attacks or to reduce their impact to a minimum.
As has already been mentioned, the USA has an agency in Atlanta, a disease control centre.
Does the Commission think this should be considered in Europe as well?
Of course, I know that when there is a problem, there is a tendency to call for a new EU agency to be set up, which raises further problems of control and supervision.
However, in light of recent developments, I think that there are various arguments in favour of this type of agency.
In general terms, I think that the Commission must do more regarding security against this type of terrorist attack, whether it involves biological or nuclear weapons.
This is not a task which we can simply leave to the Member States.
Certain safety standards in these areas must be set out at European level in response to this type of terrorism.
I also believe that the Commission, together with the Council, must consider how we should deal with the installations, factories and laboratories which handle these hazardous products, especially genetically modified products, without encroaching unnecessarily on the privacy of employees while achieving a minimum of transparency, protection and prevention.
Those who work in this kind of installation must therefore be prepared to accept a certain measure of control.
