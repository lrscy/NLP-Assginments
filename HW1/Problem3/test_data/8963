There is no doubt that, in theory, as regards the idea of new momentum, for example, there is the goal of closer relations.
However, there will be no common area without common construction.
We are far from that, listening to Romano Prodi talk about political rapprochement and gradual integration into the European Union's economic and social structures.
Would the word 'neighbours' then be replaced with the word 'partnership'?
Does the composition of the enlarged meeting of 40 European countries, held in Athens on 17 April, which you have discussed, prefigure a type of multi-speed integration, with second-zone countries, the so-called Wider Europe, and others in a third zone, the southern Mediterranean countries?
Above all, however, mere alignment with the market approach that governs the current process of European integration does little to meet our needs or achieve any effectiveness in this area.
A genuine cooperation policy cannot equate to the sacrosanct transposition of the Community acquis, because that is what we are talking about, especially when no equivalent is mentioned as regards aid.
The initiative of launching specific action programmes may be interesting given the rigidity, for example, of the overall Barcelona process.
Nevertheless, while the negotiations conducted with the candidate countries have left a bitter taste in the mouth and resulted in a great deal of frustration, as we are quite aware, the Commission has not proposed any review of the matter.
What is worse, a bonus is offered for the best reform students.
As regards the conflicts, and I am ending now, the Commission has spent very little time on this aspect although a common area can only be built on the principle of international law and on a much more active role for the Union.
Finally, the fact that the entire Commission document focuses almost exclusively on the security aspect of relations?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we fully support the desire of the Commission and the Council not to erect new walls within Europe.
We do not want the hallmarks of the European Union to become borders protected by barbed wire and infrared cameras in the east and the south; we want the EU to be associated with partnership and closer bonds.
The border regions in the east and the south were historically meeting places between people of different cultures, religions and lifestyles, and we should endeavour to recreate those regions.
In political terms, the Commission communication may be right, but the measures proposed are not.
Our greatest criticism is reserved for the way the Barcelona process, the EU partnership with Russia as a regional power and relations with neighbouring states who have indicated a desire for integration have all been thrown into the same pot.
In this way, the real substance of the existing processes has been watered down, and existing concerns and objectives are recycled without a fresh assessment of achievements and developments to date.
This is not the significant added value that we need for a new qualitative concept of 'neighbour'.
No solutions are offered for the real problems that will arise for people in eastern border regions in particular if Schengen is implemented, nor have suitable instruments been formulated with sufficient clarity.
This represents an enormous shortcoming in the communication.
We need the various problems to be dealt with individually, so that a solution can be found for the combination of regional communities, business life and family relations for which the new Schengen border will pose great difficulties in the east, by easing restrictions on a regional basis in border areas.
In addition, an adequate budget must be provided to facilitate the preparations necessary.
There should also be a financial instrument directly compatible with this and administered in a decentralised way.
Last but not least, the eastern and southern border regions share a need for a humanitarian refugee policy that is both in line with the Geneva Convention and provides for burden sharing with our neighbours.
Mr President, one of the principal results of enlargement is the fact that countries which, until yesterday, seemed geographically far away have been integrated into the Union, and, therefore, that the peoples of these countries have been integrated, bringing the number of inhabitants of the new enlarged Union up to 450 million.
The geographical, political and cultural upheavals experienced by the European continent and the Mediterranean Basin during the twentieth century have certainly not helped in the recent past to bring Europe closer to Russia, the new independent states and the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are now our neighbours.
They have suffered very diverse, tragic situations, and that is why it is still important today to find common ground and points of active cooperation between us.
One of the primary objectives of the new reunified Europe, with its 25 Member States, will have to be the achievement of a preferential relationship with these neighbouring countries of both Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia, such as Kazakhstan, and those which make up the Middle East region and lie on the Mediterranean Basin.
The political Europe born of the work of the Convention and the new institutional treaty which the IGC will submit to the people of the Union will have a duty not just to strengthen economic alliances, which will facilitate the improvement of communications structures too, in order to encourage mutually beneficial trade between citizens and companies, but also and above all to promote all those political, social, cultural and scientific initiatives which will increase the citizens' involvement in the development of democratic, secular governments with due regard for all the national, cultural and religious traditions which, in any case, uphold man's dignity and safeguard his physical integrity.
If, however, this dialogue is to proceed with equal intensity where all the Union's neighbouring countries are concerned, we believe that political measures in the immediate term to facilitate peace in the Middle East and restore economic stability to the Mediterranean Basin are a priority.
Indeed, in our opinion, full recognition of the state of Israel and its citizens' right to a life free of terrorism and full recognition of the Palestinian people's right to an autonomous, independent state which is committed to combating all forms of terrorism and to monitoring whether the funds appropriated by the European Union are genuinely used to help the Palestinian people, to educate young people, to develop production activities and to build houses and infrastructure, are a primary objective.
Another primary objective is preventing a mass exodus from the poorest countries, which would lead to uncontrolled migration, both impoverishing the countries from which the migrants are emigrating and throwing into disorder the structures of the countries of reception, which cannot deal with mass irregular immigration, particularly when, mixed in with the migrants seeking better conditions, there are numerous members of criminal or terrorist organisations dealing in drugs, arms and, worst of all, human beings.
There is therefore a clear need for a political and economic Union undertaking to encourage ongoing, harmonious development in these countries, so that people find in their native countries not just the means of subsistence but the means of social and cultural progress too.
Only in this way can it be ensured that the people emigrating will be doing so on the basis of a reasoned decision and in accordance with the rules, not out of desperation or illegally.
Mr President, we must, moreover, all remember the need to call upon all the European institutions to mount, by means of appropriate agreements with the governments of neighbouring states, an intense, relentless fight against child abuse, the exploitation, especially sexual exploitation, of women and children, and all practices which violate the physical integrity of the individual.
Mr President, the proximity policy for the enlarged Europe, which has just been discussed by the Council and the Commission, would appear to be very interesting as it forms part of a new, more flexible approach, the approach of general cooperation that is graduated and differentiated, adapted to the situation of each neighbour country.
At this stage, however, four questions come to mind.
Firstly, the content of the neighbourhood agreements has at times been defined by the expression 'everything except the institutions', which may be mistakenly interpreted as meaning 'everything except decision-making power'.
This ambiguity must be clarified.
Secondly, once again with regard to the content, there has also been talk of giving priority to extending the single market's four freedoms of movement.
Is it not very rash to make this commitment in advance?
It is all too clear that other objectives are much more pressing, for instance security.
Thirdly, the new proximity policy seems to have to be limited to non-candidate neighbouring countries.
Turkey is not included in this list, but it is difficult to know why that is the case as its accession has not yet been officially approved.
Fourthly, in this proximity policy, the European Union is not starting from scratch.
It is not starting from square one as the current Members already have relations with their neighbours, particularly those with which they share borders.
How is the European policy going to work in relation to the existing national policies?
Should the Member countries which are the immediate neighbours of these countries not be given a decisive role or a special right of consultation as regards the new European policy?
Mr President, it just so happens that there is, today, an article on the future of Europe in the international press.
It paints a very dramatic picture, mapped out by a French institute, of the dangers threatening Europe.
Populations are falling, economic growth is stagnating, and the institute takes the view that the situation will be long-term.
The innovative strength of the European Union lags far behind that of the United States.
Doom and gloom.
The remedy that the French institute prescribes is to open our eyes, see the bigger picture and look further than the Commission does at this moment.
That was what it boiled down to.
Whether this is the remedy, I do not know.
In any case we must always keep the United States at the back of our minds, since that country is an important neighbour of ours.
As far as the course of events in Europe and in our neighbour states on this continent are concerned, however, I am bound to say that I had a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu when I read the Commission's statement.
The Commission is familiar with the whole field of expansion, and with the attendant process.
Reading the document one has the strong feeling that we are embarking on a new round of expansions.
It is made very clear that this is not the case.
The only prospect being offered to the surrounding countries is participation in the internal market, not participation in the Union and its decision-making process.
But we find that matters relating to environmental policy, public order, security, fighting crime, quality of government administration, the rule of law, are all open to consideration for a joint approach - in short, virtually the whole spectrum of topics also discussed on the admission of the candidate countries.
The development of neighbouring countries, the statement continues, in all these sectors can then be discussed annually in progress reports.
It looks remarkably like the expansion process.
In addition there is talk of benchmarks - there are a number of internationally recognised benchmarks, by which the neighbouring countries will be measured, and these are consequently mentioned in concrete terms.
I just wonder whether we are dealing here with a 'Department of Public Works' effect.
The Department of Public Works is a very efficient agency in the Netherlands that is continually creating polders and dikes.
Once they have completed the construction of a new polder, they suddenly find that a dike is much too low and they immediately have to set to work on it.
This may be something of a tongue-in-cheek comment, but I could well imagine that that effect might play a part.
Those involved in hands-on work see further ahead than the rest of us.
The theme of a Wider Europe therefore, if I have understood correctly, in fact concerns the affiliation of neighbouring countries to the European Union but without their participation in its decision-making.
This will in fact turn them into virtual satellites, also removing them, for instance, from existing cooperative agreements in which they are involved; Russia from the GOS, and perhaps also the North African countries from their own federation of Arab states.
It also presupposes that our current Member States fully meet the benchmarks and criteria mentioned in the statement.
Naturally I warmly welcome the latter news.
That every new candidate must be carefully judged by the same standard, is a conviction we all share.
How are we to deal in that respect, however, with countries to which we definitely cannot or do not wish to offer the prospect of membership?
Will they accept such assessment and such an annual investigation?
It seems to me that a Wider Europe might be a space for countries whose traditions make it impossible to opt for the European democratic model.
I can imagine that there are such countries.
It is actually difficult to deny admission to countries that do opt for the model.
What moral basis is there for telling such countries, when they ask for a date, that they can not join?
My feeling is that such issues will have to be discussed in great detail in the future.
Mr President, we live in a world where the better our neighbours and our other fellow human beings thrive, the better we also thrive.
That is why it is important to cultivate a policy that strengthens democracy and prosperity in the Union's neighbouring regions.
When Finland joined the European Union the Union suddenly had Russia as its neighbour, sharing a border with that country which is almost 1 300 kilometres long.
That border still represents one of the world's widest gulfs between standards of living.
Despite development, Russia still has much hard work to do in the creation of democratic social structures.
The strengthening of democracy and civil society also remains a fundamental aim of cooperation between the EU and Russia.
Enlargement means that, in addition to the border between Finland and Russia, the Union will be getting 10 new Interreg-TACIS borders.
It will no longer be possible to maintain the current system of cooperation, but the experience we have had up till now of cooperation should be put to careful use.
The new Member States will bring with them Belarus, Ukraine and Moldava as neighbours.
Each of them has significant political and economic problems.
If they get worse they could increase instability in Europe.
The situation is worst in Belarus, where the political situation has hindered EU cooperation with the country.
Hopefully preparations for the elections in 2004 will clear the way for what would at least be the first openings for cooperation.
The Commission communication quite rightly stresses the importance of cross-border and regional cooperation with our new neighbours.
A new financial instrument must be developed for cooperation.
It should, in my opinion, be based on the Interreg principles and be flexible enough to meet the needs of each border region.
The key principles are that it should be multiannual, that there should be power of decision in the regions, and that it should be organised as efficiently as possible with regard to its administration and making payments.
It is also important that expertise and cultural know-how in the new Member States of the EU should be swiftly harnessed in the planning and implementation of policy towards our neighbours.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the process of enlarging the European Union by 10 new Member States is not yet complete, and yet we are already talking about a still larger Europe in future, a good-neighbourly Europe.
We do of course have to consider how the enlarged Union of the future will arrange its relations with neighbouring states.
The external borders of the Union will shift to Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
We need to construct as strong a partnership as possible with Ukraine in particular, and we also need to adopt a positive approach under Article 4 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
This involves working towards a free trade area, greater use of twinning projects and using the European Conference as a forum for neighbourhood policy.
The borders of the Union will also shift to Croatia, which we hope will participate in the next enlargement round alongside Romania and Bulgaria.
It is therefore absolutely right that a debate should be taking place about the outermost geographical borders of the Union, a debate in which the new Member States should be able to participate.
There should also be a clear alternative to membership of the European Union, an alternative leaving open the option of a European Economic Area with stronger relations and increased assistance.
Although I understand the EU strategy of striking a balance between a neighbourhood policy for continental Europe and a Mediterranean strategy, it seems to me that we should be setting priorities for a future European neighbourhood policy, as otherwise our ability to implement and finance it could be undermined.
It must of course also be our objective for countries that will be joining the European Union in the medium or long term - or never - to be guided by the political criteria of the European Union.
Democratisation of society, the rule of law and respect for human rights and minorities need to be implemented by means of practical policies not just because membership of the European Union is on the horizon, but also because they are in the best interests of the peoples concerned.
Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a region at the very edge of the continent, the Caucasus, which the Minister has already mentioned and which the rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, has touched on.
It is a matter of interest to Europe, for the Caucasus has been part of Europe during many periods of history.
Armenia and Georgia are two of the oldest Christian countries.
In the Middle Ages, Armenia was considered to be a major European power.
At the end of the nineteenth century, nobody would have denied that Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was a powerful centre among the pioneers of the oil industry, even in European terms.
Today, moreover, Azerbaijan is the principal supplier of crude oil to the European Union.
After the First World War and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the national governments of the three countries, despite their diversity, turned to European values.
The Conference of Versailles gave a number of European powers the task of assisting the birth of the new democracies.
The three Republics participated in the 1972-1975 Pan-European Helsinki Conference as part of the Soviet delegation, and all three are part of the Council of Europe.
They are therefore not foreign to Europe.
The EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committee has visited these countries on a number of occasions, and the solution for finding a way out of the crisis put forward by the three governments lay, each time, in establishing closer relations with Europe as quickly as possible.
It is hoped that even the potentially extremely dangerous crises such as the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh can be resolved in a European context.
The United States and Russia are involved in the region for economic reasons.
The national governments, with different emphases, of course, therefore have to carry out balancing operations. Nevertheless, they would prefer another protagonist such as the European Union to be more involved.
Our Cooperation Committee - for which I have appointed myself spokesman - was impressed by the intrinsic feeling displayed by the three countries - Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan - of historically being part of Europe.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are holding this debate in the European Parliament today, because the issue of Europe's external borders is one that we really have to tackle.
The question we have to address politically speaking, and which we are currently examining in the Convention, is how far European integration can go.
What is the bond that links us together politically and encourages us to take joint political action?
Geography is another issue that we need to discuss.
What are the geographical limits to a Europe that is willing to cooperate within this political union?
And that leads on to this question: how are we to work with our neighbours beyond this closely cooperating Europe?
I would accordingly like to thank the Commission and the Council for having addressed in their paper and in today's debate something that Europe urgently needs: a wide-ranging public debate on this very issue, the geographical expansion of Europe, not of the continent of Europe, but of close political cooperation within the European Union.
We will also have to stop thinking in black and white terms, as if relations can only take two forms - non-membership or full membership.
It would be the worst possible mistake if that were the signal we were sending out.
Europe has at its disposal a broad panoply of individual forms of cooperation.
I myself come from a constituency that will continue to border on a non-Member State, namely Switzerland.
In this case we have found a variety of solutions, including legal solutions based on agreements and cooperation arrangements through integration and specific European programmes.
This is a perfect example of how the interests of a particular country - Switzerland - and of the EU can be reconciled without simply saying, 'you either remain on the outside or you become a full member'.
So we should focus once again on achieving this broad panoply of means of cooperating with our neighbours without constantly having discussions about ever more countries joining the European Union.
We also need to ask ourselves what the limits are to Europe's capacity for integration.
If we are to discuss the question of political boundaries, of political responsibility, then we also need to consider who can tread this path alongside us.
A European Union that ultimately degenerates into an enormous free trade area is not the model I am committed to, and I think that my fellow Members feel the same way.
I also expect these debates to be held in public and not in the Council, essentially at the meetings of Heads of State and Government, which discussed Turkey's accession in less than three minutes.
That is no way to deal with issues of this kind.
We need to listen to people here, and that must be the signal that goes out from Strasbourg today.
We must take the public with us, and if they are ready to go down this road with us, we should work together politically to make it happen.
Mr President, in one year, the European Union of the 25, and later of the 27, will have new neighbours, but it will also keep old neighbours.
A debate on the new environment is both useful and necessary.
From this point of view, the position of Commission President Prodi, that the European Union must look on all new neighbours as friends and associates is absolutely correct.
This position must become the position of all of us, peoples and governments alike of both the 25 and the 27, and that is because, in certain cases, sometimes overt and sometimes concealed, opposition is being expressed on the basis of historical atavism or by reviving past antagonisms and/or enmities.
In all events, we do not need divisions, we do not need new iron curtains, we do not need new cold war fronts.
We must look on many of our new neighbours as potential candidates for integration into the European Union or, in any event, as associates and friends.
Any perspective must, however, express the free democratic will of each nation.
On the borders of Europe, following enlargement, interesting tasks are under way, tasks that are often of wider geopolitical and strategic interest, including for countries which are not located in this area, which means that they intervene in developments.
From the Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia, Russia, the western Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East, the other side of the Mediterranean, peoples expect a great deal of the European Union, of us.
We must respond positively to these expectations.
Now as regards the boundaries of Europe, I should like to add to what Mr Volcic said about the Caucasus, that right back in antiquity, in the ancient Greek tragedy of Prometheus Bound, it says that this is where the gods tied up Prometheus in order to punish him for giving man fire, that is to say the first elements of modern civilisation.
Mr President, in my view, the main aim of the initiative for new neighbours in the Wider Europe is not to put those neighbours who are waiting for their turn to join the Union to come one day on hold, Commissioner Verheugen.
They are already aware of our requirements, which will continue to be based on the Copenhagen criteria, although they will no doubt be better clarified by the constitution proposals we are awaiting from the Convention.
I highlighted the importance of this during this morning's debate, but I would like to relay to you the moving account of one of these countries, which, in its own words, is currently waiting in the kindergarten of the Council of Europe until it is one day allowed into the older children's playground of the European Parliament.
This was in Mostar, where, as you know, the rivalry and fear between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians are still far too intense, in spite of the efforts of the European Community.
In Mostar, the Croatian mayor of the town told me that the only thing that Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians have in common is the sentiment and the belief that they must be Europeans together.
So that is the situation of those who are waiting.
However, although I am paying all due attention to the reflections of our rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, I am not the only person to ask if we can use this report to send a very strong signal to all those who have neither the desire nor the intention to seek their accession, and I am thinking in particular of our neighbours in the southern Mediterranean.
There are many in that region who fear that the efforts made with regard to Central and Eastern Europe may result in a slackening of the links with their own countries that are already too little institutionalised.
In the emotion following the 11 September attacks, we decided quite unanimously, for example, to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process and, to this end, decided to create a Euro-Mediterranean Forum, which, I am sad to say, is not functioning today due to the war in Iraq.
Is it not time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to reinvigorate this initiative without delay?
Mr President, during the last plenary sitting, we voted in favour of one of the greatest ventures ever undertaken by the European Union - the accession of ten new Member States.
The challenges are not over yet, however.
Our horizons are widening, our borders are expanding and the arrival of new Member States will spur the Union on further to consolidate relations with its new neighbours, such that - as I see it - in the coming years, the Union's ability to provide its citizens with security, stability and sustainable development will depend on its desire and ability to step up and develop cooperation and dialogue with the new neighbouring countries.
In this regard, the Wider Europe initiative draws our attention to the European Union's new proximity policy, seeking to define a strategic framework for relations with the new neighbouring countries during the coming decade.
Poland is one of the countries which have now reached the eve of their de facto accession to the European Union, and I am the rapporteur for Poland.
As such, I particularly welcome the important role that this major border country will be able to play in developing neighbourly relations with countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and, above all, Russia, as President Kwasniewski said only today.
Lastly, I had to mention the southern Mediterranean, which is of particular interest to a country such as Italy, almost all of whose territory borders on the Mediterranean Sea and which is thus a natural bridge linking the European Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
In conclusion, I hope that the Council and the Commission, together with the European Parliament, especially given the impending start of the Italian Presidency, will create better geopolitical conditions for carrying through the project for a renewed Europe, a Europe which is not just politically wider but which has grown in economic and social terms too, so that countries which are different but which have common interests make up a healthy whole, despite the differences in their history and individual experiences.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission communication.
I confess that I was initially somewhat surprised that this paper bracketed together countries like Libya and Belarus in a single communication.
These two countries, like the other countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in eastern and south-eastern Europe, have precious little in common apart from their relative geographical proximity to the European Union.
That is why I am pleased that each country is to be dealt with individually.
The Presidency has made an announcement to that effect and the Commissioner talked about action plans.
As something has therefore been said about practically all our neighbours, for the sake of completeness a sentence could have been added about Norway and Switzerland, as an example, at least in the case of Norway, of just what can be done without signing up to actual membership.
I find wording such as the heading 'Different countries, common interests' somewhat unfocussed.
Their agendas really are too different.
It has been said that there are countries that have membership prospects and others that do not.
If we want to, we can demand a lot more from neighbours who also belong to the Council of Europe: for example, in return for granting trade preferences, we can make demands in the area of human rights.
However, we should not make offers that we cannot honour.
We cannot offer all neighbouring states the four freedoms as the Commission does in Section 3 of its communication, and I quote: 'the prospect of a stake in the EU's Internal Market and further integration and liberalisation to promote the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital'.
Fortunately, the Commissioner did not repeat that quotation from the communication as such.
However, the communication almost gives the impression that we are offering an 'Ã  la carte' Europe.
I have to say that I cannot identify any political consensus for granting North Africa and Russia, for example, freedom of movement in any foreseeable political future.
I therefore call on the Commission to draw up pragmatic and realistic action plans that neither raise false hopes nor over-commit the EU.
Mr President, it is important to establish the EU's relations with its new neighbours, following the enlargement through a zone of prosperity and a ring of friends with whom the EU enjoys close, peaceful and cooperative economic relations.
In return for concrete progress, Russia and countries of the Western NIS and the Southern Mediterranean should be offered the prospect of a stake in the EU's internal market and participation in the so-called four freedoms - in effect, everything bar participation in the Institutions.
Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union allows any European state the opportunity of joining the Union, which is why accession has already been ruled out for the non-European Mediterranean partners.
Russia and Belarus do not wish to join the European Union, being content with the PCA Agreement, and the Maghreb is planning to be part of an African Union.
However, better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country.
In spite of Article 49, there is still a serious danger that Moldova and Ukraine will see the process as insufficiently differentiated and as a way of distancing the EU from their just membership aspirations.
In addition, the suggestion that there should be additional freedom of movement of persons for all neighbouring countries would undermine the existing attempts to limit large-scale immigration into the EU.
The movement of skilled and educated people to nearby countries would also create a serious brain-drain that would damage the economies of countries such as Moldova and Ukraine.
However, the EU is looking at ways of facilitating the crossing of external borders for bona fide third country nationals; after all, good fences make for good neighbours in my opinion.
Lastly, I propose that Phare and other successful pre-accession financial instruments, which have benefited acceding countries so much, be extended, along with the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS countries, which would replace the current limited Tacis Programme and approach, which carries no private sector economic investments.
Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that the initiative presented by the European Commission on 11 March last is the best response the European Union could give to some of the fears inspired by enlargement.
This proposal is based on an overall view of the place of the new Europe in its surroundings, but from an individual viewpoint for each country, without affecting the European aspirations of these countries.
That should be clear.
This area of new neighbours should be built on compliance with shared values, which we must continue to establish.
That way, the EU strategy with regard to the southern border, in terms of democratisation and human development, cannot be limited to the democratic clause.
The United States are currently implementing a global strategy on this subject with increased budgetary resources and the European Union cannot lose sight of the overwhelming need to foster democratisation along its closest cultural and strategic border.
This should take place gradually and realistically, but with strict requirements.
The European Union should provide what our Mediterranean partners are always asking for: an area of shared prosperity. This, however, should also be an area of shared responsibility, above all with regard to the subject of immigration, which is of particular concern to this House.
In order to accomplish this, the Commission's proposals on the free movement of persons should be studied carefully and debated in depth, and Parliament must be heard.
The global and regional strategy represented by this initiative for new neighbours must act as a spur for regional integration and strengthen cross-border cooperation between the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, which is currently almost non-existent. It must also break down, once and for all, the walls that make many borders between Mediterranean countries impenetrable.
The initiative we are discussing today must be credible and offer tangible results.
This will require sufficient budgetary resources and certain proposals will need to be reviewed, such as the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank.
Lastly, we must also explore the possibility of a 'conference of neighbours' involving the Heads of State and Government of these countries to address matters of common interest, including the Middle East, in the presence of the two parties and two members of the Quartet.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make three brief comments, and to reiterate that no complete plan is as yet in existence; the situation is rather that a plan is now being developed in conjunction with the Member States and the partner states based on the reflections the Commission has presented to you.
This plan will be differentiated and tailored to the needs of each country, so there is no danger, for example, that Libya will be offered freedom of movement.
Instead, the instruments available will be examined to see to which countries they are best suited, and how we can take advantage of existing potential for cooperation.
Our intention is that at some point next year there will then be an overarching strategy for the future.
Secondly, this plan includes those countries that do not have any prospect of membership.
I think I made that clear, so I cannot understand why several Members of this House have suggested that preparations are being made for a covert further round of enlargement.
It is precisely because these countries have no prospect of membership that they are included in this programme.
All the other countries we have been discussing here do have membership prospects, that is to say, the Balkan states, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
The countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland in any case have a special treaty relationship with the European Union, which has already been pushed to its limits.
The only further step possible for these countries is full membership; there are no other options open to them.
It is, though, for these countries themselves to decide if that is what they want.
That brings me to the last point that I would like to clarify.
It is a shame that Mr Ferber is no longer here to listen to what I have to say, although I asked him to stay to hear me out.
I really must defend the EU Heads of State and Government against the accusation that they dealt with Turkey's application in just three minutes.
That was not the case in either Helsinki or Copenhagen.
In both cases hours of detailed discussion were devoted to this subject.
Perhaps Mr Ferber was referring to the fact that it only took three minutes in Copenhagen to decide which Cyprus protocol should be adopted, Protocol A or Protocol B, which confirmed that the two sides could not agree on a political solution in Copenhagen either.
But I would like to spell out that the subject of Turkey is always discussed with the greatest care in the Council and that a very great deal of time has been devoted to it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
In any case, your response to Mr Ferber is a response to the whole House.
It will appear in the Minutes.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparation for the EU-Russia summit.
Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity given to me today to refer to the relations between the European Union and Russia is exceptionally timely, given that the summit in St Petersburg, which will be held at the end of May, has given occasion both here and in Moscow for an integrated examination of the framework for cooperation between the two sides.
Preparations for this summit were also an occasion for a more global approach to the question of cooperation with Russia and essentially demonstrate the common wish to strengthen our relations on the basis of common objectives, on the basis of a mutual effort to resolve problems and create new prospects.
The basic parameter of our plan is the realisation that Russia is a strategic partner for the Union, its biggest and most important neighbour.
At the same time, enlargement will increase the points of contact, the common interests and the common challenges even more.
Despite the difficulties which it is encountering in its efforts to change to a market economy, Russia is still a country with huge potential.
The current international climate has also reminded us once again of the importance of our strategic relations with Russia.
Of course, this image does not make us also forget its major weaknesses.
As I just said, the Russian economy is still in a transitional stage.
Its economy accounts for just one tenth of the volume of this economy, that is, of the Union of the 15; it absorbs just 4% of our exports, while the European Union absorbs 40% of its exports.
Similarly the institutions of the market economy remain weak and the financial sector in particular is facing problems and its regulatory framework needs to be developed.
Finally, Russia has still not joined the World Trade Organisation.
Its political system presents a similar picture.
Despite significant progress in the field of stabilising democracy, there are still shortcomings in relation to human rights, especially in Chechnya, which I shall come back to, as well as problems of organised crime and corruption.
It is without doubt in the Union's interest to help Russia develop a stable, democratic, prosperous society by strengthening its ties to Europe.
This is something we have achieved in other cases, using different types of tools, of course, than those which have to do with Russia.
And although the means we use are different, essentially the objectives, in other words the dissemination of the Union's values to its surroundings, to its environment, both geographical and political, always constitute the basis of our policy.
With this thought in mind, we took initiatives, as soon as we assumed the Presidency, for an initial evaluation of the adequacy of our framework for cooperation with Russia.
As we know, relations with Russia are based, from the contractual point of view, on a partnership and cooperation agreement. This was signed in 1994 under the previous Greek Presidency.
May I remind you that this is the type of agreement which the European Union has kept for all the countries of the former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic States, which we recently welcomed as members of the ?U. Consequently, apart from a few differences, the same type of agreement ties us to Russia as ties us to the countries of central Asia.
This lack of proportion quickly became apparent, given that the partnership and cooperation agreement was unable to cover sufficient sectors, such as close cooperation on judicial matters and internal affairs, on foreign policy and defence matters, on the questions of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, combating terrorism and other matters.
That was one of the main reasons why we adopted a common strategy with Russia in 1999.
This cooperation was implemented in a series of ad hoc initiatives.
I can mention by way of example the energy dialogue, the initiative to create a common European Economic Area, the action plan for cooperation on questions of justice and internal affairs, which do not, however, have a contractual legal basis.
Appraisals of the adequacy of the EU-Russia cooperation framework, as regards covering a broad range of relations, vary.
Everyone acknowledges that the framework has, to a great extent, been overtaken by events and that this will become even more apparent in the future.
On the other hand, neither the ?U nor Russia appear to be ready to proceed with a radical reform of the framework, a reform that would also presuppose time-consuming procedures for new negotiation and ratification.
In the face of this situation, the Presidency proposed that the work of the summit should focus exclusively on the future of our relations with Russia, approaching the matter at two levels, naturally with the St Petersburg summit, as the datum plane for taking decisions.
The first level is to reform the cooperation structures with the objective of rationalisation and of securing tangible results on a regular basis and the second level is to examine the possibility of the summit's giving the political order to start up the procedure for processing ideas and strengthening the cooperation framework in the sectors in which this is needed.
At the first level for reforming cooperation structures, the procedure has already borne fruit with specific proposals to the Russian side.
We hope that Russia will respond positively and that this will be reflected in the summit's decisions.
As far as the second level is concerned, there are some reservations between the partners about the extent to which it is advisable for us to start up the procedure for reforming our relations with Russia, at a time when the existing framework has not yet been fully applied.
We believe that, in order for us to engage Russia in a procedure of gradual harmonisation with European standards, a balanced policy of incentives and preconditions is needed, which can also include in the incentives the prospect of the long-term upgrading of the cooperation framework in sectors in which we all know this is needed and in which everything shows that this will happen sooner or later, especially on second and third pillar issues.
We also believe that the St Petersburg summit, the first following enlargement and with the participation of all the new Member States, is the appropriate forum for taking this step.
Beyond the medium- and long-term prospects of our relations with Russia, we have also focused on achieving tangible results on a series of outstanding issues.
A major issue that has dragged on in relations between the two sides, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment and Programme for Russia, has already been set for the 21 May in Stockholm.
Secondly, the problems with the application of the solution for the movement of people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia have been overcome.
Thirdly, negotiations have started on the conclusion of an EU-Russia readmission agreement and we hope they will be completed quickly.
Fourthly, we are optimistic that the mechanism for resolving differences within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement will have been set up by the time the summit takes place.
Our efforts to persuade Russia to invite the ten new members of the Union to St Petersburg are also having positive results.
Thus the summit is acquiring even greater symbolic importance and may contribute to a peaceful and secure Europe which confronts challenges with closer cooperation.
We also decided in our deliberations with Russia to link progress on matters of greater interest to Russia with corresponding progress on matters of greater interest to us, the ?U, so that we arrive at specific results.
Thus, we have focused our efforts on the environment, by which I mean Russia has to agree to ratify the Kyoto protocol, on nuclear safety, on issues of safety at sea and on issues of justice and home affairs, with the emphasis on progress with negotiations on the readmission agreement.
Finally, I would point out the common interest in combating the threat of narcotics from Afghanistan and central Asia.
I should like to say a few words about Chechnya, to which we attach particular importance.
First of all, I should like once again to express our disgust about the recent criminal terrorist bombings which cost the lives of dozens of people.
There has been another such attack today.
On the other hand, I want to welcome the statements by President Putin following the attack, in which he promised to continue efforts to resolve the problem by political means.
We believe that political procedure and dialogue are the only way to achieve a lasting solution to the problem.
We continue to take every opportunity to underline the need for respect for human rights and the need to punish those involved in violations of human rights and in violations of international humanitarian law.
At the same time, we need to encourage Moscow to move towards the application of an integrated policy on Chechnya, the aim of which will be the establishment of peace, the consolidation of a climate of trust and the economic and social reconstruction of the area.
In order to achieve this, we must examine the possibility of drawing up specific programmes that will aim to promote democracy, the rule of law, institutions and social recovery.
As far as the results of the March referendum are concerned, we note with satisfaction that, despite the particularly difficult situation, the ballot was held without any violent episodes being reported.
We must point out that, despite any irregularities and organisational weaknesses there may have been, the vote in favour of the constitution would appear at first glance to be positive and may be seen as a first step by Moscow towards a political settlement in Chechnya.
Finally, the presidency considers that the OSCE can provide valuable help to efforts by the Russian authorities in the area.
We heartily support the efforts by Holland which, in its capacity as chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, is holding discussions with the Russian Government in connection with the modus operandi of a new OSCE mission in Chechnya.
We welcome the results of the discussions so far, which appear to be paving the way for the presence of Holland there and we hope that the Organization will thus be able to start operating and make a positive contribution to efforts for peace and democracy in the area.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit in St Petersburg provides a welcome opportunity to briefly take stock of our relations and to analyse the problems that we have to solve together.
Both sides are in full agreement that we have wide-ranging relations on a long-term basis, and that these relations need to be based on common values and should be further developed in the direction of a strategic partnership.
For our part, we attach particular importance to cooperation in what we regard as areas of risk that we can only overcome together, such as environmental protection, nuclear safety and justice and home affairs issues.
Our relations with Russia will also, but not to the exclusion of all else, be shaped by the enlargement of the European Union, as the debate that we have just had shows.
The neighbourhood policy that we discussed here this afternoon plays an important role in our relations with Russia, but there are also other significant factors, such as the security of the European Union's energy supply, the joint war on terror, and the need for cooperation to solve major regional and global problems.
On Russia's side, there is particular interest in cooperation on security policy, as evidenced by Russian participation in the police mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina or the proposal for a joint European centre for crisis management.
We have recently made very good progress in some areas, particularly on Kaliningrad.
I am pleased to say that the transit issues that the European Parliament dealt with in considerable detail have now been resolved.
The instruments that we proposed in conjunction with Russia at the time have now been introduced and can be implemented as from July.
A special Tacis programme for Kaliningrad has also been agreed so as to help ensure that instead of the socio-economic gap between Kaliningrad and neighbouring countries widening - which has already been mentioned this afternoon - it will be narrowed.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, good progress has been made in negotiations on a readmission agreement.
I would also like to mention that the energy dialogue with Russia has led to concrete results.
Examples of this are agreement on projects of common interest and the energy technology centre in Moscow.
We hope that we will be able to present a joint plan for the common economic area by the end of this year.
Good progress is being made in the negotiations on Russia's membership of the WTO.
Next week we will be signing the multilateral nuclear environmental programme with Russia and other donor countries in Stockholm.
This certainly represents a breakthrough in dealing with contaminated nuclear sites in north-west Russia.
We are hoping for a ban on single-hull vessels transporting heavy fuel oils in the Baltic Sea.
Unfortunately, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been achieved in Russia.
This subject will therefore have to be given high priority in the forthcoming talks at political level.
We should not ignore the fact that there are many areas where, although we agree on the fundamental objectives, we nevertheless have different ideas about how to achieve those objectives.
Neither side wants to see new 'moats' or 'curtains' in Europe.
In particular, the Commission hopes that the neighbourhood policy proposals it brought forward in March will prevent new 'moats' developing on the European Union's eastern borders, which could lead to a two-class Europe.
The enlarged Union will have to further intensify and deepen cooperation with its neighbours, but our security needs dictate that the new Member States should also fully and effectively implement the Schengen rules when they join Schengen.
There are considerable reservations within the European Union about the Russians' desire for a detailed timetable for complete visa freedom.
It is of course conceivable as a long-term objective, and it is something the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement committees could deal with.
Nevertheless, we should as of now be taking advantage of the full scope of the Schengen framework to make minor border traffic as simple as possible and to promote cross-border economic development.
This will of course also require the refinement of technical assistance instruments.
I am grateful that the President-in-Office commented on Chechnya.
I simply wish to confirm that on behalf of the Commission.
Chechnya is also still very much on our agenda and our list of priorities remains the same: a peaceful political solution, respect for human rights and humanitarian aid.
We concur with the Russians that our cooperation structures should be shaped more efficiently.
Nevertheless, we cannot agree to their wish for extensive use of the 15+1 formula, or in future a 25+1 formula.
This brings us very close indeed to the central issue of the EU's identity.
We do, however, believe that there is considerable scope for improving the way the institutions work under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, especially as regards the Cooperation Council.
Lastly, we would like to emphasise that we may have different views about the process of adapting to EU enlargement.
Russia is currently working on the assumption that extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new EU Member States provides an opportunity to renegotiate trade policy and other issues.
We do not see it that way.
In contrast, we hope that the basically positive view of EU enlargement in Russia will help to maintain the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as the basis of our relations, including the new Member States.
The Commission will not enter into any negotiations about the consequences of enlargement.
This wide range of subjects and the need to give all the Heads of State present in St Petersburg an opportunity to put forward their viewpoints makes thorough preparation of the St Petersburg Summit all the more necessary.
The EU is being represented here, in the time-honoured fashion, by the Presidency, the Commission and the Council Secretariat, and Mr Yiannitsis has already reported in detail on the objectives the Council is pursuing in this context, and there is total agreement on all this.
Mr President, four minutes is a generous allowance, especially after both the President of the Council and the Commissioner have answered quite a number of questions raised in the resolution, and I should like to express my thanks.
Russia of course remains an exceptionally important topic for us, not so much because our border has become so much longer, since the accession of Finland, which brought the larger part of that border with it.
In fact, the border has been extended only around Kaliningrad and the Baltic states.
I should like therefore to begin with the latter.
The last time this was discussed I asked whether the Council, following on from the treatment of the Kaliningrad question on transit visas for Russian citizens, could urge Russia to ensure that the border agreements between Russia and the three Baltic states are all ratified.
This question is still hanging over the market somewhat.
In the previous debate the Commissioner gave an unambiguous indication of complete agreement, since Russians going to St Petersburg will travel not via Lithuania and Belarus but via Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
That is why it is vitally important that this gives us a means of exerting pressure on the Russians to get rid of this silly little discrepancy.
I hope that the President of the Council will give that point a moment's thought.
The President of the Council also talked of the agreements and of course he also had in mind the complaints that have been made about their implementation.
He promises us streamlining, meaning that there must also probably be a better focus on Russian complaints too, that greater efficiency, more guaranteed finance - naturally an important point in any case - more support with project management, etc. will be forthcoming and that a new northern-dimension environmental programme could probably serve as a model.
I was gratified to hear that progress in being made in that respect, since on our last visit to Murmansk we found that the cleaning up of those nuclear submarines is proceeding at an extremely slow rate.
It is in our mutual interest that this process should be accelerated.
In this context it would be interesting if you could tell us to what extent TACIS can be associated with cross-border projects.
Cross-border projects are always difficult in any case, but it seems that using TACIS actually makes things a little more difficult still.
I was pleased to see that the common European economic area also came up for discussion at the summit.
I should like to ask whether that is one of the typical effects of our idea of a wider Europe.
Does this wider Europe in fact relate to these kinds of bilateral agreements, like this common economic area with Russia?
In that context have we considered other matters that might be raised in the framework of a wider Europe, for example the democratic development of Russia?
Can we exert any influence? If so, in what way?
The fact is that, as yet, the Russian Federation cannot be called an entirely normal democracy.
Many say that Russia should be integrated into the security structures of Europe.
I have a question on this point.
It is naturally splendid that Russia should be integrated into trans-Atlantic security structures.
That strikes me as an excellent first step.
But what would be the effect if Russia, which after all is a former superpower with a great military capability, were to start playing a major role in European security and defence policy?
It seems to me that our relationship would become slightly unbalanced.
I should especially like to hear the Council's assessment of this.
The resolution also calls on the Commission to set up a strategic partnership.
That means of course that there must be convergence in EU policy.
Strategic partnership, by bringing the whole EU into line, actually has more meaning for us than it does for Russia.
That has been apparent in the past.
Now, with the crisis in Iraq and the crisis in the EU regarding Iraq, what are the actual prospects of the convergence of this policy in a strategic partnership with Russia?
I should like to wish the Commissioner much courage in publishing reports on this matter.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there really must now be a new phase in our relations with Russia.
It is now a historic time - in Russia, in the Union, and in the world too - and we must act.
We have only partly implemented this master document, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Bureaucracy has obstructed reform, and inertia, the Kaliningrad question, environmental problems and the mass media have generally drained it of its strength.
Terrorist attacks, whose victims' relatives I want to express my deep condolences to - and my sympathies also go to the victims themselves - show that there is opposition to any political solution in Chechnya, although my understanding is that the Russian Government has gone down that path by actually organising elections.
The human rights situation in Russia still needs a lot of work.
It may be that if we are to deal with the Chechnya issue, which is souring relations between us, we need to provide a working group to plod on with the task in cooperation with Russia.
Reforms in Russia have thus been slow to come about.
Meanwhile, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are gaining strength more rapidly and sustainably, being led in their progress by the European Union.
Russia may lose its markets in the region, and Union enlargement, if the worst comes to the worst, may isolate Russia.
For that reason I want to emphasise the need for a new approach: we need a new strategic partnership with Russia.
The Iraq war has shown that Russia is part of a European area of cooperation.
It is the most recent example of that.
The spearhead of this partnership could be Russia's modernisation and its civil society movement.
Cooperation on energy, an area where still only a little has been achieved, could give a boost to its economy.
An example of this might be the Northern Dimension, which, with the right financing, would strengthen this partnership.
Russia must put the Investments Protection Agreement in order.
The country must be made a member of the WTO as soon as possible, and given a certain role to play in European security cooperation.
The fact is, the faster Russia 'westernises', the faster human rights will improve there.
Russia is constructing no fewer than three oil ports in a remote part of the Gulf of Finland, which is known for its reefs and which forms one end of the Baltic Sea, the world's most ecologically burdened sea.
In winter the solid ice cover there is 70 centimetres thick and the pack ice is anything up to 20 metres high.
This last winter dozens of ships were cast adrift by ice, there being no help available from an ice breaker - ships on their way to Russia.
Vessels not strong enough to withstand the pressure of ice and in such an appalling condition as those are an environmental time bomb, just like the Prestige was.
I want to ask the Council what action Greece, as the country to hold the Presidency, has taken to ensure that only double-hull, ice-strengthened tankers, which can get there safely, should travel to these three new oil ports in Russia.
There is one thing about Russia that has often gone unremarked.
That is the importance of its culture, about which still too little is known in Europe.
Now that the machinery we work with, the information society, is crying out for content, Russian content production could diversify and enrich content production in Europe, which is engaged in global competition.
Russia has turned westwards, but I think it has also turned to the north, which is apparent from Russian activity in the northern and northwestern regions.
This means that a new opportunity has now been created for the European Union and Russia to swiftly improve their mutual cooperation, along with the chance for them both to benefit from it.
Mr President, it is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the resolution agreed among the groups will provide a good basis for the work of the EU-Russia Summit.
The position taken here is forward-looking and constructive, although it also has criticisms to make.
The resolution will also be of use with regard to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting between the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to be held in Moscow next week.
For my own part I would like to stress that we must try to narrow the economic and social differences that exist on all the Union's external borders.
With the border between the EU and Russia becoming much longer than before, we must make dramatic improvements to cross-border cooperation.
We must particularly encourage the Member States and their regions located on the EU's external borders to create direct links over the border to Russia.
Such systematic programmes of cooperation between neighbouring regions have been in place on the border between Finland and Russia for a good ten years now.
There now has to be the same kind of action both between Estonia and Russia and Latvia and Russia.
Lithuania and Poland, meanwhile, must take special responsibility for the development of the Kaliningrad region.
The Union has to be prepared to finance this cooperation between neighbouring regions.
For cooperation in the border regions we need a new system of funding.
The current TACIS and Interreg systems are not strong enough and they cannot be adequately coordinated.
We have to create a new system of funding that can be used on the Union's other external borders too.
The PHARE scheme, before it became part of the accession process, might serve as a model for this new system.
Mr President, it is obviously not a matter of dispute in this House that we want a really in-depth partnership with Russia, and the EU, or the candidate countries, and Russia did indeed, in the past make a great deal of progress - and face manifest problems - in this regard.
Reference has already been made to the issues connected with the Kaliningrad region, which I believe have still not yet been satisfactorily resolved, not to mention the failure of the Russian Government or the European Union to make purposeful, comprehensive or even strategic use of the opportunities that might result from this problem.
'Strategic' is, in my mind, the key word in terms of what I am talking about.
I believe that we should be evaluating the European Union's joint strategy from June 1999 - to which Mr Oostlander has already referred - in a much more critical light.
To date, I believe, it has been neither joint nor - in the literal sense of the word - a strategy, nor is the far more modest framework for relations between the European Union and Russia that we actually have being adequately realised.
I would like, in the first place, to highlight our responsibility and the chances we have of a strategic partnership in the area of security policy.
I believe it to be of great significance that the European Union and Russia are, by means of the strategic development of their relations, contributing to multilateralism, helping to strengthen international law, to advance international cooperation, the UN, international agreements and disarmament.
I can also see the present need for the UN to have a role in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Secondly, there is a need for our economic relations with Russia to develop further in terms of substance and of quality.
I regard the energy alliance as very important indeed, but as not going far enough.
It should, I think, be quite consciously about the development of economic ties that would to some degree be mutual and on an equal footing.
I believe that to make economic sense, and that it could make a very close relationship between the European Union and Russia irreversible.
I believe it to be also utterly unacceptable that Russia's exports to the EU are arranged similarly to what one would expect from a developing country that is rich in raw materials.
I know it will be very difficult to change that.
This makes political efforts by both sides particularly important.
Thirdly, any strategic partnership demands that both parties be consistent in their commitment to democracy and the implementation of human and minority rights.
One has to accept that this will be evaluated in different ways.
What is not acceptable is that human rights and their role should be regarded purely in terms of economic cycles, as I believe they are by many EU governments, especially as regards the issue of Chechnya.
I see that as also a sign that there is no strategy.
Let me conclude by saying that I hope that we, the European public, and also those of us who sit in this House, will, in our dealings with the Commission, the Council, and the Russian Government, have the courage to speak rather more resolutely about the strategic and institutional objective of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia, so that the door may be kept open.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our relations with Russia give me the impression that the values on which the European Union is founded, and which also apply to relations with Russia, are increasingly being sold down the river.
While deals are being done about the shared use of Russia's enormous energy sources and cooperation in the field of armaments is being negotiated, fundamental democratic rights and respect for human rights no longer have any part to play, even though full respect for human and minority rights are the basis for all forms of partnership, cooperation, and economic relationship - something that the first paragraph of the Agreement makes abundantly clear.
What this means is that the restrictions on the freedom of the press, the hounding of journalists, the massive political pressure on the justice system, conditions in prisons and, not least, the human rights violations in the war on the Chechen people must have a central place in the summit talks and must not be allowed to appear only as the dessert course at the final banquet.
Concessions in economic relations and help with military research must be made conditional on significant improvements in the human rights situation in Russia, and on the country's respect for fundamental rights.
That, at any rate, was what was agreed here in this House between the Commission, the Council and Parliament when the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was approved.
My expectation of the Commission and the Council is that they keep their promise, which will mean that the discussion must give priority to peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chechnya, and that there must be real insistence on dialogue at long last.
It is clear that we all - my own group included - condemn the crimes that are being committed there by both sides, the bomb attacks as much as the crimes committed by the troops of the Russian Interior Ministry.
We condemn the attempt to find solutions by means of violent acts against the civilian population.
That is not acceptable.
Peaceful dialogue is the only option, but it must be made possible by concessions on the part of the Russian Government and, most of all, by the crimes committed under the aegis of the State against the civilian population being punished.
This leads me to ask you to reverse the priorities at this summit and not give centre stage to economic relations in the way you have done today.
Mr President, two bloody terrorist attacks in Chechnya and Saudi Arabia at the beginning of this week underline the necessity of an international campaign against international terrorism.
It is precisely this political urgency that demands an effective approach.
In that sense clear doubts are being raised about the Russian anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya. Not least by Russian politicians and Russian citizens themselves.
On the main cause a recent academic analysis is clarity itself: 'The main obstacle to a true normalisation and pacification of Chechnya is the atrocities committed by Russian forces and special units.'
Sadly, the Chechen terror gangs attract many young Chechens who are otherwise afraid that they will be picked up, abused, tortured and maybe even shot by Russian troops who are completely out of control.
The draft resolution before us says nothing about this worrying situation in the Northern Caucasus.
This House wishes, in view of the penultimate paragraph, to await the report on the visit of its delegation to Chechnya in mid-June.
Hopefully the Council and Commission will raise the question of tackling the thoroughly deplorable Chechen terrorism - let there be no misunderstanding on that point - at the forthcoming summit with the Russian Federation.
And not only because of wider geographical repercussions?
That brings me to another important point concerning regional security and stability.
Paragraph 4 of the draft resolution welcomes the active participation of both the EU and Russia in the Middle East peace process.
However, that process is not served in any way by the military and nuclear ambitions of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The US is afraid that these Iranian ambitions are being given practical sustenance by the present nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran.
At the beginning of this month therefore there was an American request to Russia to reconsider this specific cooperation.
Do Council and Commission share these concerns of our Atlantic ally and do they also intend to raise this question at the forthcoming Summit with the Kremlin?
I sincerely hope that they will make a common trans-Atlantic front against Russia and Iran!
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow on the relations between the European Union and Russia is frankly repugnant.
Mr Oostlander talked to us about his concerns regarding democratisation, or the lack of democratisation, in Russia, but he did not say a word in his four-minute speech about Chechnya.
Mr Paasilinna, who together with Mr Oostlander is one of the main initiators of this resolution, did not mention it either.
The resolution even goes so far as to praise the Russian military forces for their peacekeeping efforts.
Russian peacekeeping forces, in Chechnya or elsewhere - like a few years ago in Afghanistan - let everyone judge for themselves.
For once, at least the Council spoke a little about Chechnya, but I feel that the Council is deluding itself and I would even go so far as to say that it is lying to itself.
However, by the same token, it is lying to us and telling us stories because the issue is not that which the President-in-Office of the Council outlined.
The political solution proposed by Mr Putin is not a political solution. It encourages two forms of terrorism: the terror imposed on a daily basis by the Russian forces in Chechnya and the actions of gangs of terrorists secretly assisted by these same Russian military forces, who now occupy the entire territory and no longer give the political solution advocated by the Council a chance.
We have tried everything, Europe did everything it could to isolate Mr Maskadov, who was nonetheless elected by the people of Chechnya during elections legitimised by the OSCE.
The European Union has done everything it can to ensure that the ministers of Mr Maskadov's Government cannot move throughout Europe and can no longer meet the political authorities in the various EU countries.
It has done everything in its power to destroy any possibility of real negotiations between the Chechens and the Russian authorities.
Today, we have a kind of Quisling controlling Grozny and the surrounding area, who obeys Moscow.
From time to time, he rebels and draws up a report, which you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in which he speaks about the daily policy of terror implemented by the Russian authorities in Chechnya.
That is the reality today.
Without President Maskadov, peace will not be possible and no political solution will be possible in Chechnya.
Without a clear message to President Putin to launch negotiations, there will be no solution in Chechnya.
Moreover, Mr Putin stated about 10 months ago in the Financial Times that the problem facing Russia was not that of the final status of Chechnya but one of security.
Mr Maskadov's Foreign Minister has proposed provisional administration of Chechnya by the United Nations, precisely to reassure the Russian authorities and to establish, within five or ten years, a Chechnyan administration that would provide a guarantee against the threats to Russian security.
You do not talk about this; you do not want to see it happen; you do not want to see the Chechnyan Foreign Minister, who can no longer move throughout Europe and to whom you refuse a visa, just as you refuse visas to the other members of Mr Maskadov's government.
That is the opposite of what should be done and yet it is what you continue to do.
That is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror, which, every day, as Mr Belder and Mrs Schroedter said, pushes young Chechens to despair, young people who have seen their parents, brothers and cousins killed in Grozny or in other towns in Chechnya, kidnapped and raped by the Russian forces.
By acting this way, you are pushing them into the arms of the extremists who finance some of the madmen operating elsewhere in the world.
It is essential to change this attitude as soon as possible. If not, instead of champagne, you will be agreeing to drink blood at the next St Petersburg summit.
Mr President, neither at the international or global level - as shown by the Iraq crisis - nor at the European level, can we avoid dealing with Russia, and this is only right.
We need Russia as a partner, and I believe deeper cooperation with it to be both desirable and worth striving after, for the Russians should understand the enlargement of the European Union not as a hostile act, but as an opportunity.
As has been frequently said, borders shift and change, and one of the consequences of enlargement is that we will be sharing borders with Russia.
The resolution, under the Danish Presidency, of the problem with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad - the former KÃ¶nigsberg - is very much to be welcomed.
Now there is also to be a new summit on 31 May, an EU-Russia summit on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of St Petersburg.
There has since 1999 been a common strategy, whose cornerstones are meant to be democracy, the rule of law, further integration into a European economic and social area and general enhancement of security and stability in Europe, along with reforms in the energy sector and the shared struggle against organised crime.
Russia does not aspire to membership of the European Union, which would go against its conception of itself as a major power.
The European Union should seek genuine cooperation with Russia, which would, not least, involve the European Investment Bank being allowed more opportunities for activity in Russia, an idea put forward by, among others, Mr SchÃŒssel, the Austrian Chancellor, who propounded it in a letter to President Prodi of the Commission.
If Russia were to ratify the agreement with the European Investment Bank, which agreement is oriented towards the Northern dimension, the Russians would at once have billions of euros at their disposal, which would make it possible for a fair amount of nuclear waste to be disposed of.
As far as Chechnya is concerned, it is clear that we must demand that human rights be respected, just as much as we must condemn terrorism, which again claimed civilian victims only a few days ago.
Diplomacy, however, is what is called for here, in order to break the spiral of violence and responses to violence.
Mr President, Commissioner, Council representative, I think that, in this debate, there is more honesty, when it comes to relations with Russia, than there has been for a long time.
On many previous occasions, we have pretended that we have achieved results.
Today, we are, however, saying quite clearly that we are holding meetings but that the results are rather far from being achieved.
I am pleased about this honesty, and I therefore hope that the Commission's approach will in actual fact prevail.
We do not need any new organisations.
As for the advice that has been given - 15 plus 1 - I hope that the EU will reject it.
I also in actual fact believe that it is a little too optimistic to do as some of us in Parliament have done and talk in terms of our having the same basis of values.
There is a risk of the EU not being so unanimous in its approach to Russia as this debate suggests.
There are forces that may intervene in such a way as to cause division in the EU's view.
Moreover, we are silent on the issue of Chechnya.
Think of the issue of new organisations and of freedom from visas.
I really do hope that the policy adopted by the Commission will apply.
If disagreement arises on issues of this type and if the Commission's and the Council's attitude does not then prevail, we shall have relations between the EU and Russia similar to those we have today between the EU and the United States, that is to say relations characterised by division.
I am pleased that both the Commission and the Council addressed the environmental issues.
We have had success with the MNEPR.
It was really not, however, the PCA Agreement that led the way but, rather, money.
In addition to those you mentioned, there are many other unsolved environmental issues.
These are issues linked to the Stockholm and Espoo Conventions and marine safety.
I would ask you to keep the pressure up when it comes to those issues that are important to us, such as marine safety.
Issues of marine safety, the environment and human rights must be on the agenda.
Mr President, allow me a few supplementary observations on issues which have been touched on during the debate because, for the rest, both my first intervention and the Commission intervention gave a great many replies to a series of issues.
We are, of course, interested in having, as with every other country, a successful summit.
The precise objective of the meetings being held is to promote the objectives which we too have in accordance with the ambitions, values and principles that we want to promote.
We know that these procedures are often time-consuming and laborious.
I know of no procedure which quickly results in changes, in solutions to problems which have dragged on.
I should like to refer to Kaliningrad.
The solution for Kaliningrad is progressing to timetable and I think that it is progressing satisfactorily.
The ratification by the duma of the border agreement with Lithuania will have taken place by 30 June, according to the commitments entered into.
And we expect the same for the readmission agreement between Russia and Lithuania.
Similarly, I should like to say that provision has been made for a special TACIS programme on Kaliningrad and our precise objective is for the summit to give the order to draw up a strategy jointly with Russia, so that there is integrated development of this Russian area.
As far as the Northern Dimension is concerned, we are currently preparing the new action plan and the Commission is preparing a first draft which we shall subsequently process within the framework of the Council.
We consider that the Northern Dimension must continue to be an important development tool in our relations with Russia.
The signature of the MN?PR agreement will release funds for protection against nuclear dangers in north-west Russia, funds which have been amassed precisely within the framework of the Northern Dimension.
I should like to point out that huge changes have been made as regards Russia over the last thirteen years.
Traditional stereotypes have been overturned, new premises have been created, Russia's relations with the European Union, with ????, with the United States, have changed radically and this is creating new situations, of which each Member State and the European Union as a whole are weighing the importance and deciding to see how to proceed and what momentum to give.
Within these frameworks, one needs to take account of the reports on foreign policy, security and defence issues, but I should like to point out that one needs to be very, very careful here.
These are not issues that can proceed quickly.
They need a long-term perspective and strategy and a method that does not create confrontations and contradictory situations on basic strategic choices by the European Union and Europe as a whole.
We therefore welcome the possibilities opening up and are proceeding with the methods and the degrees of freedom that we judge are opening up on each occasion and allowing us closer forms of cooperation.
Could the President-in-Office of the Council say something more about the ratification of the border agreements between Latvia, Estonia and Russia?
I specifically asked for that.
Mr Oostlander, I am able to inform you that, while the agreement between Russia and Lithuania is in the process of being concluded, the duma has given a firm undertaking that the border agreement with Lithuania will be ratified by the end of this month.
As for the others, I am not in a position to give you news of such a positive outcome, but we are working on them.
In practice, though, this will not in the least be a problem, as there is no dispute about the borderlines.
The only real problem was in connection with Kaliningrad, and that has been resolved.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate
Question No 1 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0215/03):
Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece
Council Directive 1999/70/EC
Article 2, Paragraph 1 of Council Directive 1999/70/?C concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the European Trade Union Confederation, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe and the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation obliges the Member States to comply with the directive in question by 10 July 2001.
Under Article 2, Paragraph 2, the Member States may have one more year, if necessary, over and above the deadline for the application of the directive in question, in order to take account of special difficulties or implementation under a collective agreement.
Bearing this in mind, the Council would ask the honourable Member to put the question to the Commission, because the Commission is competent for ascertaining progress with regard to the application of Community law by the Member States.
I am sorry, but by reason of my capacity as the Council's representative, I cannot mention more details, of which there are many and which would have enlightened the honourable Member.
Mr President, I have listened carefully to the President-in-Office's reply.
Certainly the Commission has a responsibility for the application of Community legislation but the Council cannot also be without responsibility for the fact that a Member State is not applying an important directive.
And of course, in relation to the original question, today there is a presidential decree - a month ago - it has of course changed - but the presidential decree died in its infancy because the Civil Court of Appeal of Crete found in judgment 466 in 2002 that it contradicted the basic provisions of the Community directive.
I can do no more than repeat my question to the President-in-Office with this new information.
I have nothing to say other than to ask the honourable Member to put his question to the Commission.
Question No 2 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0217/03):
Subject: War against Iraq: Aerial refuelling of B-52 bombers over European cities
The Basque Country and the whole of north-eastern Spain have been taken by surprise at newspaper reports on the route followed by B-52 bombers between their base at Fairford (England) and Iraq. It appears that they are being refuelled by KC-135 'stratotankers' in the skies above Bilbao, Pamplona, Zaragoza and Barcelona, before entering the Mediterranean.
Rather than refuelling over the Atlantic, they are cutting corners and flying close to towns and cities with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, whose safety they are jeopardising.
The Spanish airforce is banned from carrying out such operations over population centres.
Does the Council not consider the overflying by these aircraft of densely populated towns and cities to be an infringement of public safety?
When coupled with the aerial refuelling operations, is this not showing disregard for the rights of the local populations, which are taking second place to a cruel war that is opposed by public opinion in Europe and world-wide and is being waged without the consent of the UN Security Council?
Should the EU not reproach Mr Aznar and his government for allowing these dangerous operations to be conducted and for supporting and participating in the illegal war against Iraq?
The allegations contained in the newspaper reports to which the honourable Member refers in his question have not been notified to or discussed in the Council.
The matter comes under the jurisdiction of the Spanish state.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish citizens have not forgotten how Mr Fraga Iribarne, founder and honorary President of the People's Party, and mentor of the current President, Mr Aznar, as a minister under the dictator Franco, deceived them by swimming in the sea at MojÃ¡car and say that he also did so at Palomares, where four thermonuclear bombs had fallen as a result of a collision during an aerial refuelling operation between a B-52 bomber and a tanker plane. In the meantime, the US cleared and fenced off 105 hectares of land contaminated with radioactivity in a large area which was closed to the Spanish people and referred to as Camp Wilson.
Today, the Spanish People's Party Government has also begun to deny that several B-52 bombers were refuelled in the skies above Bilbao, IruÃ±a/Pamplona and Barcelona on 21 March last, on their way to Iraq.
Confronted with evidence provided by air traffic controllers, the Spanish Government had no choice yesterday but to recognise in Parliament that that day, at the very least, it authorised the overflying and refuelling of eight bombers carrying 240 tonnes of bombs, and justified this by saying that this involved low-risk manoeuvres.
Does the Council believe it acceptable for these operations to be carried out overflying densely populated towns and cities and for the Government to claim there is no risk?
Does the Council consider it democratic for a government cynically to have denied these events and deceived its citizens so blatantly?
I think that the honourable Member merely referred in greater detail to a series of incidents of which the Council is ignorant and, as I said, the matter comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish state.
It is not a matter for which the Council of the European Union is responsible.
You clearly heard the Council's response.
In theory, the response does not give rise to further supplementary questions, but I am going to grant them.
Mr Nogueira has the floor for a supplementary question.
Mr President, the Spanish State has been notable for its support of the unilateral attack mounted by the United States and the United Kingdom against Iraq.
Now, together with Italy and Poland, it is going to act as an occupying power in the Iraqi State.
Does the Council believe that the Spanish State should consequently share international responsibility because of its warlike, illegal and unjust aggression?
What kind of relationship will the European Union have in the action it undertakes in Iraq with the Member States occupying that country?
I must remind Mr Nogueira that his question - Question No 3 - which would be next, has lapsed and it is very similar to his supplementary question because a debate took place just this morning based on a Commission and Council statement.
I am forced to remind you of this.
In any case, Mr Yiannitsis has the floor if he feels he should respond.
What the Spanish Government did in relation to the question of Iraq or any other related issues is not a matter on which I, as President-in-Office, can comment or refer to in the manner in which the honourable Member wishes.
The truth is that I would like it if Mr Ortuondo Larrea did not always bring up national concerns in this Parliament and if he could make contributions to European integration, which is why I believe we are all here.
Gentlemen, although I am going to give you the floor, I would ask that this be the end of the matter.
The President-in-Office of the Council has given a full, clear answer with regard to the subject of the question.
In any case, Mr Ortuondo has the floor if he feels that this concerns him.
With all due respect for the opinion of Mr Oreja ArburÃºa, I bring here any issues that affect European citizens.
The Basque and Catalan citizens who were at risk from the overflying B-52 bombers, and also the Andalusian citizens who were at risk from four bombs which fell on them, are European citizens and, therefore, responding that this is an internal affair is simply an attempt to avoid taking the bull by the horns, when it is a matter that affects European citizens.
Clearly your metaphors also come from Spain: the bull and its horns.
There are no points of order.
I believe we have exhausted the topic of the points raised by Mr Ortuondo.
Question No 3 lapses.
Question No 4 by Bernd Posselt (H-0223/03):
Subject: Reforming the Dayton Agreement
How does the Council Presidency view the notion of reforming the Dayton Agreement in such a way that Bosnia and Herzegovina would be converted from a community of three peoples and two entities into a federation of three peoples with equal rights?
Equal rights between the peoples that make up Bosnia-Herzegovina are enshrined in the constitution, as set out in Annex 4 to the peace agreement, and have been confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In an important decision in September 2000, the court ruled that the express recognition of Bosnians, Croatians and Serbs in the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as peoples that make up the country, brooks just one interpretation: that they enjoy equality as groups.
It also states that the constitutional principle of collective equality between peoples that make up the country, which derives from the definition of Bosnians, Croatians and Serbs as the peoples that make up the country, prohibits any special privilege for any one of these peoples, any predominance of one side in government structures or any ethnic homogenisation as the result of divisions on a territorial basis.
The constitution of the Srpska Republic and of the Federation was amended further to this judgment, in order to remove the contested provisions.
A new law was also passed in order to safeguard the representation of the three peoples that make up the country at all levels of governance and throughout the public sector.
The European Union is continuing via the stability and association process to promote democratisation, the rule of law and economic reform as means of promoting the rights of the minorities and as a means of promoting equal opportunities for all citizens.
Mr President, let me start by pointing out that the expression 'to take the bull by the horns' exists in German as well; we may not, alas, have bullfights, but we still have the metaphor.
I am obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for his very precise and very fine answer, and would like to put to him a supplementary question. If this development, namely the equal rights of these three ethnic groups being put on a firmer footing - which I very much desire - actually comes to pass, might another approach not be to make the structures rather less bureaucratic?
Many Bosnians tell me that there are too many cantons, and that they are too small, something that is a result of an imbalance and leads to a large proportion of the gross national product and of international aid being swallowed up by excessive bureaucracy.
I should like to start by saying that the simile heard also exists in Greek.
It would appear in fact to exist in all the countries of the European Union, regardless of whether or not there are bulls, and to remind you, in all events, that bull fights were depicted on frescos in the old Minoan palaces which have existed for thousands of years, before modern Spain.
As for the rest, I should just like to take note of your comment.
I have nothing to say.
Restricting bureaucracy may be a problem.
Insofar as it is feasible, you may see it but, as you will understand, you cannot also intervene in a series of very internal affairs in these countries without this being seen as another form of intervention.
Question No 5 by Othmar Karas (H-0229/03):
Subject: European corporate tax reform policy
Small firms in particular suffer because of the existence of 15 (soon to be 25) different tax systems, because of the bureaucracy resulting from the various VAT rules, and because of the vast administrative demands stemming from the different corporate tax regimes and innumerable dual-taxation agreements.
What justification can there be for the fact that large firms have a lower effective tax burden to bear than SMEs, which cannot engage in fiscal engineering?
How does the Council view the European Parliament's call for continuation of the successfully conducted project for reduced VAT on labour-intensive services in order to prevent illegal working and create a more favourable employment environment?
How does the Council view the call for a firm to be required to include intra-EU sales revenue in only one turnover tax declaration, in the state in which its headquarters are located, and how does the Council view the pilot project on home state taxation in order to reduce SMEs' administrative burden?
What is the Council's position on extending the principle of qualified- majority voting to those areas of taxation policy which directly influence the extent to which the European internal market can operate?
?he administrative cost and the cost of compliance which small and medium-sized enterprises face has been the focus of particular attention during the work of the Council to coordinate the various tax systems.
Generally speaking, I would say that the Council has turned its attention on numerous occasions to initiatives and proposals as to how to limit the problems and difficulties which small and medium-sized enterprises have with their access to the market.
As regards the findings from the individual initiatives, the honourable Member will have to address his question to the Commission of the European Communities, whose job it is to monitor the measures in question.
As far as the procedure under which the Council takes decision in the taxation sector is concerned, it should be noted that the relevant rules are provided for in the Treaty and no one can ask the Council to change those rules.
In all events, the honourable Member will have observed the discussions held recently, which are also taking place within the framework of the Convention, on the possible extension of qualified majority voting, in which case there may be a different arrangement here too which will give more desirable and more positive results.
Even if you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council cannot be expected to change its stance overnight, I do nonetheless believe that one can expect it to be willing to change a stance that causes problems of this sort.
Our twenty-five different tax systems result in distortions of competition in the internal market; small and medium-sized businesses are put at a disadvantage, particularly when operating across borders; and, of course, unanimous voting in the Council on tax matters creates problems when it comes to strengthening the internal market and the European economy.
So let me again ask you what initiative the Council would take in order to remove the disadvantages to small and medium-sized businesses resulting from differing tax systems and to support the internal market as a whole?
What initiatives have been taken in the Convention by the Member States in order to do away with the requirement for unanimity on matters affecting the single market?
The honourable Member is talking about structural problems on the internal market and so on.
I should like to point out that, in principle, every enterprise in any country of the European Union faces for the most part a single tax system, not 25, the tax system of the country in which it trades.
Consequently, there is no problem of a small enterprise facing 25 or 15 different tax systems and, consequently, of being oppressed or foundering, in contrast to the potential of a large enterprise.
Secondly, you have to look at the potential for a small enterprise to extend to other markets and, even more so, to the internal European market.
I should like to remind you of the problems which a small enterprise in southern Germany has in penetrating even the markets of northern Germany, or a small enterprise based in Athens has in extending and covering large sections of the market in its own country.
These are problems concerning structures on which tax systems have a negligible effect.
In all events, I think that they exist in every country.
They exist in my country, to give you an example, and I know that they exist in many countries in which the tax system for small and medium-sized enterprises and a series of subsidies which are allowed within the framework of the rules of competition aim precisely to strengthen these companies.
Having said which, the existing institutional framework which makes provision for unanimity between the Member States on taxation is binding and no presidency can force through initiatives or regulations if these regulations are not agreed at the level of the 15.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has asked the Commission to produce a study of the effects of Basle II.
Even though this study has not yet seen the light of day, we know that the effects of Basle II touch Europe - I refer in particular to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises and the securities they are required to provide.
What I want to ask is: what will the Council do in order to get its hands on this study, and how will it deal with the problem of tax reform in such a way that small and medium-sized enterprises can meet the requirements of Basle II?
We shall look and see why the European Commission is late.
There are numerous cases in which, for objective reasons, the European Commission may be late submitting a study.
It has also happened to us on other occasions during the course of the Greek Presidency.
Of course, on the basis of this study - and I do not think that one study will resolve all the problems - and any proposals that may be made, we shall see how we are going to respond.
Question No 6 by SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain (H-0230/03):
Subject: EU initiatives to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning
Will the Council state what initiatives it is pursuing to save the life of Amina Lawal, the Nigerian woman who is appealing her sentence of mandatory punishment of death by stoning and whose appeal was delayed until after the elections in April 2003, and is the Council aware of other similar convictions in Nigeria and what action is it taking in these cases?
The ?U closely monitored the case of Amina Lawal, who was sentenced last year to death by stoning, and we expressed our deep concern in a declaration on 21 ?ugust 2002 about the decision by the court of appeal rejecting Amina Lawal's appeal.
Following this referral of the case, no similar convictions have been noted in the Council.
The ?U will continue to exert pressure within the framework of political dialogue and at various levels, especially through the head of missions in Abuja, stressing that Nigeria must ensure that the constitution remains the supreme law in its country.
Amina Lawal's defence formulated the opinion that supportive action should be taken in a discreet and confidential manner due to the constitutional problems which arise from the application of Sharia law in certain states.
The ?U has taken this advice on board and is of the opinion that, as long as the case is not considered to be pending, it is better to follow a general approach, such as that I referred to earlier, and not to individualise the case.
Within these frameworks, the ?U has repeated its position on the death penalty and encouraged the Nigerian Government to continue to work for the abolition of the death penalty and for the prevention of any form of harsh, inhumane or humiliating treatment or punishment.
In particular, we are urging the Nigerian authorities to respect human rights and human dignity fully, especially as regards women.
On this issue, the ?U generally attaches great importance to the role of civil society and we are supporting the human rights organisations and other non-governmental bodies active in this sector.
Given that the electoral process has now been completed, the ?U will continue to focus on this issue - it is an important issue - and will take appropriate action depending on subsequent measures taken by the courts.
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply. I feel that his answer is satisfactory to an extent.
However, this is a most appalling case and should be followed more closely than his reply seemed to suggest, because there are other similar cases and similar convictions in Nigeria and elsewhere.
We must show that we are earnest in calling for the repeal of those most foul actions and that we are against the denial of the most basic human right - the right to life.
Therefore, I hope that the Council will take further action to ensure that this does not continue and also to seek out where other convictions of a similar nature have taken place.
I thank the President-in-Office again for his reply, but I would urge that this be followed more closely still with regard to the most basic human rights that I have mentioned.
Mr President, Mr President in Office of the Council, I wonder if there is any EU country that has declared itself prepared to give Amina Lawal protection against the possibility of the court case not going the way we wish it to.
Has any country shown a readiness in the Council to make such a statement?
If we are serious about wishing to protect her, we must press our countries to give her protection against this type of state persecution which is, de facto, exercised against many women.
I do not know the answer to your question at this moment in time.
We can examine it and give a written answer.
Question No 7 by Niall Andrews (H-0232/03):
Subject: Cotonou Agreement and Council priorities
In the light of the entry into force on 1 April 2003 of the Cotonou Agreement, will the Council outline what its priorities are for enhancing the political dimension, tackling debt, reducing poverty and dealing with the major health issues at a time of increasing global economic uncertainty?
The Cotonou Agreement is based on three main pillars: political dialogue, financial and commercial cooperation and development aid.
This partnership focuses on the objective of reducing and, possibly, eliminating poverty and this is linked to the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the global economy.
?CP-?U cooperation is based on a series of fundamental principles, which include equality of partners and the adoption of development strategies.
In order to implement the objectives of the partnership, the Cotonou Agreement clearly stipulates that the ACP countries shall determine the development strategies for their economies and societies with full sovereignty.
Most provisions of the Agreement were implemented in transitional agreements well before the full entry into force of the Agreement in April 2003.
Now that the Cotonou Agreement has entered into force, the funds under the ninth EDF are now fully available.
Programming of these resources, in other words the preparation of the strategic support for each country, which is based on the particular medium-term objectives and on the development strategies of the country, and the introduction of an indicative timetable for implementing the support strategy for each country have almost been completed.
The Commission announced its intention to use the reserves of the ninth EDF mainly to finance the Community contribution to international initiatives for the benefit of developing countries, such as debt reduction and health.
These proposals, which are currently being examined by the Council, will also allow for faster disbursement of EDF funds.
The application of these proposals will require joint decisions with the ACP countries.
The Council's priorities for EC development policy are clearly noted in the Council and Commission declaration approved in November 2000, which lays down six priority sectors on the basis of the added value of Community action and their contribution to reducing poverty.
These sectors are: the link between trade and development, regional integration and cooperation, support for macro-economic policies, the promotion of equal access to social services, transport, food security, sustainable rural development and, finally, the creation of an institutional infrastructure.
The Council supports the Commission's efforts to mange the Community's external aid more efficiently and to use EDF funds in accordance with the objectives and criteria of the Cotonou Agreement.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
It was a very comprehensive reply indeed, but one of the issues I have discovered, over almost thirty years of involvement in development, is the lack of emphasis on education.
The reason I put this question to the Council was to try and establish whether the Council and the European Union can put more emphasis on education, because in developing countries if you have the three basics - reading, writing and arithmetic - even at the simplest level, you can challenge the village elders and the leaders in your community.
When you are illiterate that is impossible.
The purpose of my putting this question was to shift the emphasis, because poverty cannot be tackled through a continuation of the same old formula.
I believe that 'education, education, education' is the real answer to poverty.
That is where the emphasis should be.
I have noted the member's comment.
I cannot but agree with him that education is crucial to success.
Moreover, in the age of information technology and knowledge, it is absolutely basic.
As far as the possibility of further intervention in the internal policies of these countries is concerned, I have noted his comment, which I shall also pass on to the European Commission, and we shall bear it in mind within the framework of the Council.
Question No 8 by Liam Hyland (H-0234/03):
Subject: WTO and agriculture deadline
In view of the fact that negotiators at the WTO were unable to agree agriculture negotiating modalities by the 31 March 2003 deadline, does the Council consider that satisfactory progress can be made in other areas in time for the 5th WTO Ministerial Conference in CancÃºn in Mexico next September, and that more acceptable agricultural proposals can be considered in the meantime in line with the negotiating mandate it gave to the Commission, and how does it regard the views expressed in the US by the Director of the Institute for International Economics, Mr Bergsten, who said, according to Reuters, that the WTO negotiations are more likely to stretch on until the middle of 2007 when the White House's current trade negotiating authority expires?
The Council acknowledges that the general situation as regards the Doha negotiations on development matters is far from satisfactory, mainly because the deadlines were not kept to as regards certain sectors, such as the details of access to pharmaceuticals and the details in the agricultural sector.
The impasse on pharmaceuticals was due to the refusal on the part of the United States to agree to the solution which was accepted by almost all the other countries.
As far as agriculture is concerned, the situation is more complicated and repeated efforts by the president of the WTO Committee on Agriculture, Mr Harbinson, were rejected by all sides for contradictory and mutually exclusive reasons.
The Council is, of course, willing to examine any new text submitted by Mr Harbinson or anybody else.
Despite these difficulties, however, it is fundamental at the present juncture to maintain the momentum of negotiations within the framework of the WTO and to make fundamental progress in the run up to the CancÃºn conference.
To start with, in today's unstable international political climate, it is even more important to make essential progress with regard to trade issues.
In addition, the most recent multilateral meetings in Geneva demonstrated that there is enhanced awareness between the members of the WTO that the pre-preparatory procedure needs to proceed over coming months so as not to create an excessive workload for the CancÃºn conference.
Finally, the Council does not share the pessimistic views formulated by certain commentators as regards the CancÃºn conference.
The problems which need to be resolved before CancÃºn are numerous but it is not the first time that we have worked to tight deadlines in trade negotiations.
If all the important players make serious efforts and demonstrate real political will, it will be possible to make progress on all outstanding issues over coming months.
Consequently, positive links need to be pursued between issues in order to restore the momentum of the procedure, given that all sides know that there is no agreement until there is full agreement.
As far as agriculture is concerned, the Council confirmed its support at its meeting on 8 April 2003 for the Community proposal on the details in the agricultural sector and urged the Commission to continue its efforts so that an agreement can be reached on this basis because, in its opinion, this is the most realistic means of completing the negotiations in accordance with the timetable laid down in the Doha ministerial declaration.
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply.
I am sure he will be aware of efforts to reach agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy in advance of the World Trade Agreement and the June deadline, which the committee has set.
I have just left the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where I made the point that we were proceeding with indecent haste in relation to meeting those deadlines.
I am sure the President-in-Office will also be aware of the potential impact of the WTO on an eventual CAP agreement.
My question, therefore, is: to what extent can an agreed reform be protected in the context of the forthcoming WTO negotiations?
Can he assure the House that whatever is agreed in relation to the reform of Europe's common agricultural policy will be fully protected in those negotiations, because otherwise the entire negotiating process would be meaningless?
I should like to refer to the concept of rational expectations and rational behaviour and to say that, obviously, any conclusions within the framework of the negotiations being carried out inside the European Union will not be adopted if there is any prospect that they cannot be safeguarded or they cannot be compatible with what is decided at world level.
Question No 9 by Brian Crowley (H-0236/03):
Subject: Closure of Calder Hall Magnox reactor in Sellafield
Given the welcome closure of the Calder Hall Magnox reactor at Sellafield at the end of March 2003, will the Council now actively support calls for the closure of the five remaining Magnox plants in the UK which present an increasing safety concern as they get older?
The question of nuclear safety generally concerns the Council, which fully supports achieving a high standard of nuclear safety throughout the European Union.
However, competence and responsibility for nuclear safety lie with the Member States in question; consequently, the Council is not in a position to comment on safety and other aspects relating to specific reactors in specific Member States.
As the honourable Member will know, each reactor should normally only operate for as long as it complies with the requirements of high nuclear safety standards.
The current Community legislation on the safety of nuclear facilities is based mainly on Chapter 3 in Title ?? of the Euratom Treaty.
Directive 96/29/?uratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation sets out the basic obligations for radiation protection which must be honoured.
The Council also notes the Commission's recent proposal for a directive laying down the basic obligations and general principles relating to the safety of nuclear facilities, which will be subject to careful examination.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
However, whilst he may be technically correct in saying that the Council does not have an area or role of responsibility with regard to the question of nuclear facilities, there is an immediate need for political leadership.
As you have mentioned yourself, this issue has been discussed a number of times within the Council.
Indeed, if you look at the Treaties that give the legal basis and authority to the Member States and to the different institutions to take action, the Council can in fact take action under the Euratom Treaty.
What I am seeking is a commitment from you Mr President, as President-in-Office, to bring this before the Council at some stage in the future.
We could fill this hemicycle with reports of the accidents, leakages, damage to the environment, damage to human beings and damage to property caused by bad management, faulty construction and bad design of this type of Magnox plants.
It is essential to have that commitment now, at a time when the nuclear industry is saying that nuclear power can be good for Kyoto and good for the environment.
We could draw up a whole list of the casualties and suffering caused by nuclear discharges, and immediate action should therefore be taken.
As I mentioned, there is the Commission proposal which is being examined by the Council and, if the Council so concludes, there may be a basis for examining this sort of request.
In addition, I should like to point out that the problem is not a technical one.
The problem, over and above the national aspects, also has institutional dimensions, of course it also has political dimensions, but it also has institutional dimensions which you need to respect and not to violate, and that creates restrictions both on this issue and on other issues where there are institutional provisions for the limits within which the Council can intervene.
Question No 10 by Gerard Collins, which has been taken over by Mr Andrews (H-0238/03):
Subject: European Rural Model
The Greek Presidency has emphasised the importance of the European Rural Model and the foundations on which it is based, namely family farms and local communities, small towns and villages located throughout the EU's rural areas.
Will the Council make a statement now on the progress made during the Greek Presidency on preserving and promoting this European Rural Model?
The Greek Presidency, continuing the efforts of the previous presidency, has been trying since January to progress as best it can with an examination of the legislative proposals for reforming the common agricultural policy, including of course the proposal for a regulation on rural development.
According to the latest information given to me on developments in the relevant Council, I might add that I am optimistic about progress with this work.
The debate on reforms during these first six months should allow the Council, following the opinion also of the European Parliament, to reach an agreement on all the reform proposals in June.
Our presidency attaches great importance to safeguarding the multi-operational European Rural Model, which focuses more on attention to rural development and it could not be any other way, given that we have also tested the value of this model in our country.
During discussions which have already been held on all the proposals, these aspects of the proposals were generally well received and the importance which needs to be attached to these issues, and the rural development of peripheral areas in particular, was emphasised.
In addition, the Council and the Commission are aware of the fact that funding under the CAP must comply with the conclusions of the European Council in Berlin on financial ceilings and with the conclusions of the European Council in Brussels in October 2002.
Consequently, measures in favour of rural development will depend on the funds available under the second pillar of the CAP and any funds obtained from reallocating resources which may be released at the level of the first pillar of the CAP as a result of the reform under way.
If Mr Andrews would like to reword his question, he also has the floor.
If he does not wish to reword it, Mr Ã Neachtain has the floor to put his question.
I thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply.
I just want to say, as somebody who comes from a peripheral area of the west of Ireland, that the European rural model is seriously endangered by the various enactments of the European Union in many cases, especially in the reform of the common agricultural policy.
It seems to me that a small family-owned farm, for example, which we could take as a base for rural development, etc., is greatly endangered by the new movement that is occurring at the moment.
I would ask that this be taken into consideration, because that has been the foundation of the rural model that the European Union put in place.
If it is in any way damaged, there will be serious implications for rural society in Europe in the future.
It was clear from my reply that I agree that this model has an important role in the operation of European agriculture; we are in the process of examining how to proceed.
During this process, the competent ministers will obviously bring their experience and positions to bear and I hope that the final balance struck will safeguard precisely the positive elements of the model which prevails in the Union and which is important not only from an agricultural but also from a more general economic, social and, in the final analysis, political point of view.
I should like to refer to the remarks made by the President-in-Office and Mr Ã Neachtain.
President-in-Office, you mentioned in your first answer the need to stay within the parameters of the Berlin Agreement of 1999.
As everybody in this House knows, and as I am sure you know, the parameters of 1999 have now been thrown out as a result of the proposals made by Commissioner Fischler regarding reform of the CAP.
Two years before that, in 1997, we had the Cork Declaration stating the need for a vibrant and innovative rural development policy to combat emigration from rural areas and the ensuing social problems this created in urban areas.
As you know yourself, with regard to your own country, peripheral areas and islands suffer unique disadvantages and hazards that must be responded to in a common and complex way.
That is why I would ask you to remember - at future Council meetings, or when people from other countries say we must shelve this whole agricultural-rural issue - that there is a direct link between agriculture and rural development which cannot be broken.
I shall bear the comments expressed in mind.
Question No 11 by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo (H-0240/03) will not receive a response as the subject it concerns has been included on the agenda for this part-session.
Question No 12 by Sarah Ludford , which has been taken over by Mrs Thors (H-0241/03):
Subject: Women in Afghanistan and Iraq
In Afghanistan, over a year after the fall of the Taliban, life for most women is hardly getting any better.
What action is the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, taking to improve the situation there for women, who in many cases are in practice still confined to their homes by widespread restrictions?
As an aid donor, what pressure is the EU putting on the Afghan interim government to stop harassment and oppression of women, such as bans on walking, obligatory wearing of the burqa and bans on being driven by a man in a taxi?
Will the Council ensure, to the best of its ability, that women in post-war Iraq get a fair deal in the process of physical and political reconstruction?
The ?U is closely monitoring the situation as regards respect for the human rights of women in Afghanistan.
In its contacts with the Afghan Transitional Administration, the ?U constantly and incessantly stresses that the rights of Afghan women and the promotion of their full and equal participation in every aspect of public life are an important reference point for the evaluation of the performance of the Afghan Transitional Administration and for defining subsequent EU policy towards Afghanistan.
On 14 April the Council approved conclusions in which it underlined, among other things, the importance of including the mainstreaming of gender awareness into the policy of the Afghan Transitional Administration and in which it urged the establishment of a constitutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights, especially with regard to women and girls.
Similarly, the Council stressed that gender awareness must be one of the features of the government to be formed following free and fair elections by June 2004.
The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, who met the EU ministers in April 2003, subscribes to these conclusions.
Following the fall of the Taliban, there are nonetheless signs of improvement.
More and more girls are attending school and they are also studying at higher education institutes in the larger towns.
The ministries are recruiting women and, generally speaking, a lot of women have returned to their work outside the home.
One very positive step was the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women on 5 March.
However, the Council indeed acknowledges that the situation of women is still unacceptable as regards the possibilities of education and work, as regards their legal protection or their full and equal participation in public life, despite the examples to which I referred.
Similarly, women are the main victims of insecurity, which threatens their life and their dignity.
The office of the EU special representative for Afghanistan, Mr Vendrell, has established good working relations with the Ministry for Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Committee and is supporting the creation of an infrastructure of women's organisations through training and dialogue.
The EU special representative, together with the representatives of the Commission and the Member States, regularly evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the policy of the European Union, including in the field of women's rights and shall, if they deem necessary, submit recommendations on further action to be taken on the part of the ?U. Finally, the Council will also pay special attention to the role of women in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Firstly, I want to thank the Council for its answer.
Unfortunately it contained very little on the issue of the situation of women in Iraq.
Yesterday I was in the position to hear directly from Baghdad a UNICEF representative saying that the Shia have taken over Sadr City, and that means difficulties for women.
Mrs Elisabeth Rehn, my predecessor here in Parliament, wrote a very influential report dealing with the situation of women in both war and peace.
She pointed out that it will be more difficult for women when there is peace.
Unfortunately, especially in Afghanistan, we have a situation where women cannot be sure that they will not be raped. This is a problem in western Afghanistan.
Please, Council, what actions are you taking in the light of Mrs Rehn's work?
She proposed several actions, including the suggestion that peacekeepers should be very well informed about the rights of women.
As for the situation in Iraq, is there any way you could intervene?
I shall have taken note of these comments and, as with Afghanistan, the same applies to Iraq and, once the situation has returned to normal, we shall be in a position to take specific actions.
Would the President-in-Office not agree that the situation for women in Afghanistan has not changed at all outside of Kabul?
The situation for women in Iraq is unlikely to improve in the near future.
I said in my position that the situation of women in Afghanistan does indeed correspond to the problematic picture to which you too referred.
The Council is trying with all the means at its disposal to influence this situation.
As the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.
Question No 14 by JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro (H-0243/03):
Subject: Cuba: policy review
The European Union has been developing a policy of constructive dialogue with Cuba. This development was based on the assumption that the Communist regime in Cuba was prepared to open up to some degree and the hope that it might help bring about a move towards democracy and full respect for human rights.
The European Parliament held a debate on the extremely serious situation in Cuba on 10 April 2003 and adopted a resolution.
What specific political consequences does the Council draw from the abrupt change in the situation in Cuba?
Will the Council continue with the policy which was on the point of being finalised, even though the Cuban regime has brutally overturned the assumptions on which it was based?
What steps is the Council taking - and what further steps can it take - to secure the release of all political prisoners being detained by the Cuban regime?
Does the Council share the view that, particularly following the award of the 2002 Sakharov prize and certainly throughout 2003, all the European institutions have an even greater responsibility to act firmly and in a spirit of solidarity in support of all those people in Cuba who merely wish to be able to exercise their basic human freedom and who believe in democracy and human rights, including for the people of Cuba?
In its regular evaluation of the EU's common position on Cuba, the Council always underlines its approach of open and constructive dialogue with Cuba on all matters of common interest.
The Council has reiterated that the objectives of the policy of the European Union on Cuba remain the encouragement of a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and a better standard of living for the population.
The ?U monitors the situation in Cuba on a regular basis.
As soon as it learned of the recent wave of arrests, the presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued public statements and proceeded with intense demarches towards Havana.
In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities, the Member States protested strongly about the arrests.
The Council has taken due account of the resolution passed by the European Union on 10 April, which reinforces the EU's position against these measures.
At its meeting on 14 April, the Council of the European Union approved the following conclusions:
'The Council condemns the recent actions of the Cuban authorities, notably the executions, the large-scale arrests of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed.
It calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in Cuba, will affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation.
The Council will keep the situation under close review.'
The ?U also supported a resolution on the human rights situation in Cuba which was passed within the framework of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
As a general comment, the presidency of the ?U issued a declaration stating that the ?U condemns the large-scale arrests, the unfair summary trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on numerous dissidents for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social opinions and because they were exercising their right to take full and equal part in public life.
Consequently, the ?U demands that those persons, whom it considers prisoners of conscience, be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition.
The ?U roundly condemns the recent executions of Cuban citizens carried out following summary trials and expresses its regret that the moratorium on the death penalty in the country has come to an end.
These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country, will affect the ?U's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation.
The ?U will monitor violations of personal and political rights, which continue to affect the Union's relationship with Cuba, very closely.
I should like to close by pointing out that the ?U will continue to keep the situation under close review, especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the President-in-Office for his extensive answer, but I feel I must suggest that we need to go further.
It is precisely because we support a change towards transition in Cuba and because people's expectations have been brutally shattered, that I believe we all have a particular responsibility. This is all the more true because last December this Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to a great Cuban personality in the field of human rights: Osvaldo PayÃ¡, who is suffering considerably at the moment.
We must adopt a position of active solidarity, which leads me to ask the following question: is the Council prepared to invite Mr PayÃ¡ to take part in meetings with the Presidency, with the High Representative and with the Council, in order to give his feelings, in person, about the extremely serious events taking place in Cuba?
Would the Council consider the possibility of suggesting to all Member States that they do the same, through their diplomatic representatives, in other words, that they convey their solidarity directly and invite Osvaldo PayÃ¡, the 2002 Sakharov prizewinner, to visit every European capital and there give a true picture of the Cuban people's suffering?
I referred to the declarations made by the Council and numerous, perhaps all, the Member States condemning recent developments in Cuba.
The Council is particularly sensitive to this issue, and discussed it at its last meeting and decided to issue these declarations of condemnation.
Further action will be judged in the light of developments.
It is clear that what happened in Cuba recently has given rise to a general outcry and we hope that this will influence subsequent decisions by the Cuban Government.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos. 39 to 58 will be answered in writing.
Colleagues, it gives me great pleasure today to welcome Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of the Republic of Poland.
Especially in the context of this week here in Strasbourg, a week when we in the European Parliament begin a process of pre-integrating our political colleagues and friends from the accession states through the observer process.
We have observers here today from the parliaments of the accession states and, of course, observers from the Sjem and the Senate in Poland.
I am very pleased also that we can welcome you here today, Mr President, to acknowledge the role which your country has played in bringing all of us in Europe to this point in our integration and re-integration.
I also pay tribute to you personally for the role you have played in the transformation and transition in the Republic of Poland.
From this platform, I should like through you to send a message to the people of Poland.
Here in this House, on 9 April 2003, we voted on the accession treaties.
We said, on behalf of the 360 million European Union citizens that we represent, 'yes' to Poland by more than 90%.
That is a message we want you to carry from Strasbourg to your people in Poland.
(Applause)
May I also recall that in the early 1980s this House also displayed its solidarity with your new awakening by creating a group of Friends of Poland - Amici Poloniae. That act of solidarity represented even then the depth and the continuity of the interest which this House has in your republic.
We look forward to Poland joining the European Union next year.
1 May 2004 will mark the end of a long road.
For all of us, that road started in the shipyards of Gdansk in the middle of August 1980.
We are conscious today of how much we owe you, the Polish people, for opening this new chapter for Europe and, indeed, of the Polish tradition borne out by that chapter of fighting 'for freedom, yours and ours'.
We think also of the common identity that our histories combine to bring us: Westerplatte, Katyn, the two Warsaw uprisings are important pages in our common history.
Your compatriots, led by Lech Walesa, set this peaceful revolution in train.
I recall a famous poster, as I think we all do, from the streets of Prague in November 1989, that read: Poland - 10 years, Hungary - 10 months, GDR - 10 weeks, Czechoslovakia - 10 days.
That started in a shipyard in Poland.
We also recall that other distinguished Polish compatriot of yours, Karol Wojtyla - His Holiness Pope John Paul II - when he spoke to the Polish Parliament in 1999 he remarked that Poland had a full right to take part in the process of progress and world development, especially European development.
He supported Poland's integration into Europe, as we do in this House today.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to salute your leadership.
Some weeks ago, with Commissioner Verheugen, I had the privilege of attending the launch in Warsaw of your presidential campaign in respect of the upcoming referendum in Poland.
I know that you have an extensive personal travel schedule right throughout your country.
You have visited citizens in Plock and Gorzow, and yesterday, despite an extraordinary storm, in Bialystok.
Even today we laid on some rain here to make you feel at home.
(Laughter)
I know that your campaign will take you to many more places and you will bring your message and your vision to those places.
Your vision of Poland in Europe, your vision of central Europe returning to Europe and the wider world, your relationship with your old neighbours - such as the Ukraine and others who have become our new neighbours - these things mean you can help us to develop our eastern dimension perspectives.
You have my sincere wishes for the work of leadership which you bring to Poland at this defining moment.
It is my hope that your compatriots will seize this historic moment and that they will take their lead from your campaign and say 'tak dla Polski'.
(Applause)
That concludes the formal sitting.
(The formal sitting closed at 12.30 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0141/2003) by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of foot and mouth disease (COM(2002) 736 - C5-0029/2003 - 2002/0299(CNS)).
Mr President, I am pleased to be here to discuss the Commission's proposal for a new directive on Community measures for the control of foot and mouth disease.
This proposal aims to provide greater flexibility to the Member States in their choice of the most appropriate control strategy under particular socio-economic conditions, thus conferring more responsibility for the measures applied, notably in relation to compliance with relevant public health and environmental requirements.
Our fundamental position on prophylactic vaccination for FMD remains unchanged.
This position reflects the current status of vaccine development, the divergent nature of the causative virus and the serious trade implications any turn towards prophylactic vaccination would provoke.
Stamping out of infected animals and those likely to promulgate the disease remains the principal method to effectively counteract any outbreak.
However, we have learned, not least thanks to the excellent work of your Temporary Committee, that the massive killing of apparently healthy animals raises major public concern about the ethics and economics of today's animal husbandry and disease control measures, and their repercussions on rural communities.
The Commission's proposal, therefore, marks a shift of emphasis of the available control measures to promote emergency vaccination from an instrument of last resort to the forefront of the available control methods.
The Commission is fully aware that protecting the current animal health status is a very challenging objective, given globalisation of trade, frequent movement of persons, the nature of the virus and the fact that it is endemic in large parts of the world.
The proposal therefore includes also provisions on the Community antigen bank, diagnostic laboratories and contingency planning, in order to ensure a high level of disease preparedness.
I am grateful to the European Parliament for having carefully studied our proposal.
I look forward now to your discussion of the report.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as the plenary, just over six months ago, adopted by a large majority the report from the temporary committee on foot and mouth disease, so, today, we are stating our position on the proposal for a Council directive on the control of FMD.
In so doing, we are coming to the end of a very important chapter, and I would like to take this opportunity of again, and very warmly, thanking all Members, as well as the secretariat and, most especially, the Commission for their excellent cooperation.
Our special report, and the report now before us, are the fruit of the best kind of cooperation.
Many of Parliament's demands have already been incorporated into the proposal that the Commission has now submitted, and so the various amendments we have tabled are about making the proposal more precise rather than giving it a new direction.
As much for the avoidance of misunderstandings as for any other reason, I would like to re-emphasise the fact that we are not calling for any sort of general preventive vaccination of the sort that was customary prior to 1992, but for emergency vaccination, allowing the animals to live, to be the means of first resort when it comes to containing any outbreak of FMD.
This is an important distinction, and it still needs to be maintained at certain points in the text.
I would also like to emphasise that products derived from vaccinated animals are not in any way hazardous to human health, nor would they even have any effect on it.
That much we know, and that is why it would be impossible to justify banning the marketing of products derived from animals vaccinated in the course of an outbreak.
We know that there will be problems as regards trade with third states such as Japan and USA, but this can be dealt with by regionalisation, and the award of 'FMD-free' status six months after vaccination, rather than - as was the case a year ago - after twelve months, must be considered an essential contribution towards developing a new policy.
It might be added, though, that we need to keep on working towards getting the OIE to lay down a three-month rule.
This is the subject of an amendment tabled by Mr BÃ¶ge and others, which I ask you to support.
We must, however, vote against the Committee's Amendment No 32, which I do not believe takes adequate account of the present position in international law.
The Greens' Amendment No 49 also needs to be rejected, as it would reduce the room for manoeuvre that we need.
I do not want to go into the individual proposals in detail right now, but the incidence of fowlpest or chicken flu is now showing us how important it is to find a new direction for the control of zoonoses and fundamentally re-evaluate it.
In the Netherlands, twenty-five million animals have already been slaughtered, and the disease has now appeared in Germany as well.
As we demand in very clear terms in our report, we must eventually find a completely different way of dealing with epizootics, so that it is not trading and economic interests alone that determine what is done.
The strategy must involve ethics just as much as it does economics.
The risk of diseases spreading is, in part, made greater by intensive livestock farming and by international trade relations, and so vaccination policy needs to be thought through anew.
Some viruses are highly deadly and so, in future, another approach will be called for.
In its report, Parliament has very clearly outlined the economic and social consequences of a strategy failing to hit the mark.
In the same way, we have to consider how, in future, we can recoup the costs, whether by way of national funds or in conjunction with a European Epizootic Fund, and who is to be compensated - only those immediately affected, whose animals were slaughtered, or all those who sustained financial losses.
This point has not yet been satisfactorily resolved.
There is also the need for research, especially applied research, to be stepped up if we are to have improved vaccines, but, at the same time, prophylaxis must be maintained in businesses, in imports, and when transporting animals.
This is more important than ever as a means of preventing pathogens or viruses from getting to the animals in the first place.
It is our hope that the Council will, under the Greek Presidency, be able to come to an agreement that will do justice to the needs of the producers, that is, the farmers, the consumers, and also the animals.
In these areas, the EU has competence and options available, which should be used to the full.
We in this House have played our part, both in the committee and on the ground, by talking with the people affected in Great Britain and the Netherlands.
I hope that the future will find us able to break through the vicious circle of killing and isolating.
Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur highly on the way in which he has cooperated with the various groups and also on the very commendable result.
This demonstrates that he has understood the great unease felt at past outbreaks.
He has produced a very good report in response to the Commissioner's legislative proposals.
I should also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Byrne for his speedy reaction to the own-initiative report of Parliament based on investigations we had carried out.
He has adopted at least some points from this parliamentary report.
This augurs well for good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, in achieving, now and in the future, an effective approach to combating animal disease epidemics.
At the same time, Mr President, I must say on behalf of my group that the parliamentary investigation has taught us just how shattering the outbreak of animal diseases can be.
We conducted an investigation into the epidemics of foot and mouth disease.
We saw the consequence for animals and humans alike but we also saw the secondary results.
The health problems that are still occurring in places hit by foot and mouth, the huge economic loss but also people's distress and all its attendant problems demonstrate that we can no longer view these animal diseases as a technical question but must emphatically also look at the social consequences.
It cannot be denied that the risks of infectious animal diseases are growing in a world where borders are becoming increasingly transparent and where there is ever more international trade.
I need only make passing reference to the outbreak of SARS to indicate the degree of panic it can generate.
We must be fully aware that, if we have opted for a non-vaccination policy, the risks of infectious animal diseases will increase.
We want to keep animals outside, we want to see cows in the fields, and we want to see chickens and pigs ranging freely.
That does mean, though, an increased risk.
In addition there are also the international risks of more transport, more international trade.
That means that we cannot leave the consequences solely at the door of the farmers but must as politicians reflect on how we can tackle these risks in future.
In that respect, the Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler report is a good initial step.
If there is a new outbreak we can then at least ensure that through a fundamental change of policy, perhaps also through vaccination, we can achieve a much more effective approach to and control of a number of epidemic animal diseases, in this case foot and mouth disease.
Regarding that fundamental change of policy, namely the provision of more options for Member States, more options for the Commission and most definitely the use of vaccination to keep an outbreak in check, it is of the utmost importance to look at how we can subsequently control the secondary effects and their repercussions.
There are a number of important questions.
To begin with - and so far the Commission has not yet been totally clear about this - how are we to deal with those indirectly affected by future outbreaks?
Secondly, how can we ensure that there is a maximum market for products from the moment that prophylactic vaccination is used and the animals survive?
Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks.
How are we to deal with this?
What is our role as politicians in the process, and what is the role of the Commission?
A third question is, how can we ensure that these kinds of outbreaks are translated internationally in trade relations?
In that field I should point out that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted an amendment - I tabled it on behalf of Mr BÃ¶ge and a number of other members of our group, in which we call urgently on the Commission to look at what the rapporteur has said, namely that it is crucial that in the international field the length of export bans following an outbreak be reduced from six to three months.
That is absolutely crucial to our approach in the European Union, and this approach can only be successful if, internationally too, we see the opportunity of reducing the period from six to three months.
We urge the Commission to achieve this through negotiation.
I should like to hear the Commissioner's response to this point.
Mr President, I am glad that we have been able to take a step forward regarding the combating of foot and mouth disease.
At the same time I say this with mixed feelings, now that in my own country, but also our neighbours, Germany and Belgium, the spectre of fowl pest has reared its head.
Once again I appeal to the Commission to examine how we can take social responsibility for those major animal diseases, such as fowl pest, such as swine fever, and in this case foot and mouth, in order to arrive at a coherent policy.
But, once again, the Group of the European People's Party is glad that we have managed to take a first step in relation to this foot and mouth dossier.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the FMD crisis has left deep scars.
The culls have brought heartbreak to countless families.
They have led to public indignation and rage, sometimes impotent rage at authorities and also rage at Europe, which blocked the vaccination of livestock.
First of all, my sincere thanks to Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler.
Once again he has done an excellent job.
After his report on the foot and mouth crisis he has worked hard to ensure that the list of recommendations that this House submitted last December has been incorporated into the Commission's proposal.
Meanwhile we are engaged in a legislative process.
I believe that the proposal and the proposed amendments are all in all an acceptable response to the public outcry on the mass culling of livestock.
I am in favour of the use of prophylactic emergency vaccinations, with animals being kept alive until slaughtered for consumption.
I should like to stress two important points in the form of questions to the Commission and would like you to respond in a moment.
The first concerns political responsibility.
The foot and mouth crisis of 2001 heralded the political landslide of 2002.
We must at any rate teach politicians a lesson too.
Confidence in politics suffered a severe dent.
One important reason was that political responsibility proved anything but transparent.
Who was responsible for the no-vaccination policy - the government, the EU or the International Bureau for Infectious Diseases?
Ministers pointed to the national governments and to the Bureau in Paris.
For the ordinary citizen it was a complex structure of responsibilities and that led to the image of politicians, who while they were prepared to take a public stand, subsequently preferred to hide behind others.
Politicians who take no responsibility deprive politics of its credibility.
This buck-passing game has backfired badly on Europe.
The hundreds of angry letters and e-mails were signals of the human and institutional tragedy.
A future outbreak of foot and mouth must not lead to the mass slaughter of healthy livestock.
We must make a massive effort to ensure this in the period ahead.
This requires a foot and mouth policy in which there is a clear apportionment of responsibilities, regional, national, European and international and with the parliaments also involved.
Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous.
Responsibilities for choices and compliance must be clearly established.
It is our task to communicate on this matter.
In an attempt to achieve such clarity, I should like to ask the Commissioner to make explicit once again here this evening where precisely the responsibility lies.
Is it true that a Member State has the option of using prophylactic emergency vaccination and subsequently of keeping the vaccinated animals alive?
Is it true that animal products from vaccinated livestock can be sold without any problem?
This brings me to the second point, namely the marketing of animal products from vaccinated livestock.
At the moment that a Member State decides to use prophylactic emergency vaccination and to keep the animals alive, it must be possible to sell the products.
This requires a minimum of two things; supermarkets to sell the products and consumers to buy them.
How does the Commission plan to create the correct boundary conditions in collaboration with Member States?
It cannot, of course, be the intention to keep vaccinated animals alive and then to discover that there is no market for them.
That would surely ultimately lead to the culling of vaccinated animals.
I should like to hear your answer to both these questions.
Mr President, at the height of the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party formulated three principles: how can we prevent such outbreaks from recurring, what are we to do if there is another outbreak and how can we pay for such outbreaks in future?
On the first point: better border controls.
We have heard that the Commission has issued new guidelines.
I have paid particular attention when arriving back in Europe from time to time from another continent.
To be honest, despite the newly announced measures I have not yet been able to detect much change.
What exactly were the new measures?
What are we to do if there is another outbreak?
We took the view that the mass culling of healthy stock is not acceptable in future, which is why we fully support the conclusions of the report that prophylactic vaccination must be used.
We went even further.
In 2001 we submitted an amendment to the budget to ensure that the Commission was able to carry out research into better vaccines, marker vaccines against foot and mouth disease.
We did not limit ourselves to foot and mouth disease by the way.
It could extend to all infectious animal diseases.
It is particularly disappointing to note that as of now, some two years after the amendment was submitted and carried, the Commission has still not begun this research.
We are constantly given different explanations.
It will happen.
But it still has not happened.
I should like to know why.
Another point: what is to be done with the products of vaccinated animals?
That strikes me as a huge problem.
