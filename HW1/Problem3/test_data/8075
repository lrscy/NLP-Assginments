On the one hand, they are levers for development in an ever-increasingly competitive global economy, concentrating wealth, knowledge and know-how.
They are also centres for the provision of public services, such as education, health care and transport.
On the other hand, most of the most serious problems of our modern society are located in towns and cities: acute problems of poverty and social exclusion, deterioration in the natural and man-made environment, lack of green spaces and atmospheric pollution, loss of local identity and higher crime rates.
At the same time, more acute problems of racism are appearing in our towns and cities.
The connection between regional development and urban development is clear and cannot be ignored in the efforts which we are making to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Our towns and cities are not isolated.
All towns and cities, irrespective of size, together with the suburban and rural areas surrounding them, constitute the driving force of each region and can play a central role within the framework of the implementation of the revised Lisbon or Gothenburg objectives.
That is why the need to manage the urban question at European level is fundamental.
Policy on towns and cities needs to be at the epicentre of efforts to achieve a strong, competitive and viable Europe, while maintaining social cohesion.
In the new programming period, the policies which contribute to the development of the territorial systems of Europe will need to demonstrate complementarity, coordination and consistency.
Similarly, coordination is needed of efforts by all partners at local, regional, national and European level, with the proper utilisation of the potential of towns and cities for sustainable development.
Both the cross-border and the urban dimension must form part of all the policies of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.
I am Mayor of Tolfa â a delightful small town north of Rome â and even in this capacity have been able to see how significantly economic development and social dimensions are affected when citizens gather and integrate into an urban whole.
Our cities are embracing more and more varied realities â different nationalities, disparate requirements, problems on various levels â and as such act as a microcosm of what is taking place on a macroeconomic level across the territory of the European Union.
I realise, therefore, how actions aimed at fostering integration and social, economic and environmental development can have a correspondingly positive effect on citizens, which is then translated into added value for the European Union.
Each modest success, in fact, can only help create citizens who are more mature, more open-minded and more European, and who are equipped to understand the challenges they face, and to continue along the path embarked upon in Lisbon.
Extending a hand to the cities of the new Member States is therefore a vital means of creating the equality to which the EU aspires for all its Member States.
In that way, all types of friction and inequality may at last be overcome, for the sake of the unified project of a Europe particularly conscious of the problems faced by minorities and by the most disadvantaged groups in the least developed regions.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs wide-ranging debate on Mr Beaupuyâs report and, above all, the pertinent and meaningful speech by the Commissioner have outlined in the House today the new European city, taking enlargement into account as well.
It is nevertheless necessary to emphasise and remind ourselves that a good 78% of the population of Europe lives in cities, 50% of which are in areas of high population density, and 26% in areas of medium density.
Cities, therefore, constitute the backdrop against which the majority of the inhabitants of the European Union live.
Lately we have witnessed a certain downplaying of the importance of the urban dimension within cohesion policy, and so this report completely changes that particular approach, which we were not able to support.
It should not be forgotten that in the heart of the Europe of 15 we also find the so-called Pentagon, that is, a zone linking London, Paris, Milan, Berlin and Hamburg in which a large proportion of the economy and population of Europe is concentrated.
The Pentagon idea is of course completely opposed to the concept of territorial cohesion, as set out in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which stresses cities â especially small and medium-sized ones â as key players in regional development and in achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
Whilst acknowledging, therefore, the practical difficulties the new countries have faced, and must continue to face, we must remember that even the cities of the old Member States had to be integrated into the system and territory of the Community.
Consequently, social problems â spatial segregation, crime, lack of housing, unemployment â are the crucial problems we must confront and continue to solve, especially given that the URBAN programme will no longer be continuing as one of the Community initiatives of the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, this Regional Development Committee initiative report drafted by Mr Beaupuy is the opportunity to clearly highlight that urban problems are challenges that need to be dealt with at European level, not only at national or regional levels.
Following enlargement and bearing in mind the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, it is obvious that now, more than ever, a pan-European strategy is needed in order to address the challenges of increased disparities in terms of urban policy between the Members of the Union.
In my country and in most of the new Member States, there are serious large-scale problems that need to be clearly addressed with comprehensive interventions such as economic and social actions, aimed at the revitalisation of deteriorated inner cities and the renovation of large post-war prefabricated housing estates.
The causes of these problems do not only relate to the new Member States, even if in these countries the situation is worse than elsewhere in the Union.
In the new Member States, around 40% of the urban population lives in these deteriorated areas, creating ghettos within our cities.
Beside the disastrous social and economic consequences of this deterioration, environmental aspects should also be addressed.
It is obvious that the new Member States and cities are simply unable to deal with these challenges on their own.
The newly proposed regulation only allows for a very limited scope of intervention for integrated urban actions.
Thus, the fate of the deteriorating inner city areas and the large housing estates will only get worse.
Everybody agrees that cities and urban agglomerations or areas have a central role to play in achieving the revitalisation and GÃ¶teborg objectives.
It is also clear that cities and urban agglomerations play a major role in achieving regional development objectives.
It is therefore of the utmost importance seriously to strengthen the urban dimension within the mainstream structure of EU programmes.
Strengthening the urban dimension does not mean that we are requesting more money.
On the contrary, we are calling for more flexibility and for the possibility to spend the available money on the most pressing and important issues.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU has been talking for years about how it can bring itself closer to the citizens.
There is in fact a very simple solution.
European policy must address the requirements and the demands of those whom it immediately affects, and first in line are towns and communities, which represent a significant proportion of the EU.
We need to take on board that in the newly-enlarged Europe there are over 73Â 000 local authorities, and it is those working in the local authorities who are the first to gauge the reaction of EU citizens and to deal with the immediate consequences of the proposals made by us in the European institutions or in national government.
When it comes to urban policy, then this is the case twice over.
The first people to be approached should always be the mayors of towns and communities.
We presumably agree that holding debates with all local authorities is, from a budgetary point of view, virtually impossible.
We could easily hold debates, however, with the associations to which they belong.
In the Czech Republic, for example, the Union of Towns and Municipalities covers almost three quarters of the population of the Czech Republic, and provides a platform for dialogue between the local authorities and the government.
This follows a recently concluded cooperation agreement, according to which the government is required to submit to the Union all newly proposed policies relating to the communities for comment, and in turn discuss those comments with the communities.
Dialogue of this nature would be beneficial to the EU.
The national local authority associations come under the umbrella of European associations.
Here in Brussels, for example, a few dozen metres from the Parliament building are the headquarters of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions.
I mention this so that we may take advantage of the potential of such umbrella organisations and cooperate more with them.
As regards urban policy, we have an early opportunity during the debate on the role of towns in the revamped structural policy for 2007 â 2013.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is symbolic that we are discussing the issue of the urban dimension of the EU during the European Week of Regions and Cities in Brussels.
I should therefore like to call on the Committee of the Regions and the Commission to support this initiative, which involves the towns and cities themselves.
For proper dialogue to take place, however, our partners require time and space to be able to make their contribution, and we need time and space to be able to make good use of their contributions, and in turn to improve the quality of the laws and initiatives on which we are working.
I shall conclude by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Beaupuy, for his work on this initiative, which, to my mind, takes account of the actual needs of Europeâs towns and communities.
Â Â  Â MadamÂ President, it is high time that problems relating to cities and urban policy were given the priority they deserve in the context of the implementation of cohesion policy.
This is particularly desirable if we remember that approximately 80% of the population of the European Union live in towns or cities, as has been emphasised several times already in this House today.
Cities are crucial to regional development and also to attaining the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
It is cities and the areas surrounding them that generate growth and innovation plus economic, social and territorial cohesion.
It is also the case, however, that the most complex problems tend to be concentrated in the cities.
I have in mind social exclusion, spatial and ethnic segregation, violence, drugs, pollution, unemployment and illegal trading.
There are marked discrepancies between European Union countries regarding urban policy, particularly after the most recent enlargement and the accession of 10Â new Member States.
These discrepancies are partly due to the different degree of economic development and partly also to the fact that certain new Member States do not have an urban policy in place at national or regional level.
It is particularly in the new Member States that complex urban problems have been noted, relating amongst other issues to management of the housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, transport, protection of the natural environment and waste disposal.
In addition, it is mainly in the new Member States that the most notable cases of problems caused by social exclusion or by living in neglected prefabricated slab housing estates can be found.
That is why effective action to regenerate post-industrial premises is vital for those countries.
The European Commission should waste no time in taking efficient action aimed at coordinating urban policy.
In particular, the Commission should prioritise the development of tools for urban development, the exchange of best practice and experience and joint projects that strengthen interregional and transnational cooperation.
Only then will it become possible for these cities that are new to the Union to become assets to it instead of liabilities, hence the importance of MrÂ Beaupuyâs report.
I support it and would like to thank him very much for his work.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to make three points.
First, I would like to thank the rapporteur for what I think is an excellent report.
78% of us live in cities.
The nice thing about cities is that they are a common European phenomenon and even anti-Europeans such as Mr Allister could support Urban II.
That is already a step in the right direction.
My second point, given that we have the Commissioner for Regional Affairs here, is to focus not only on urban affairs but other affairs towards the Baltic Sea region as well.
That is perhaps something that the Commissioner and DG REGIO could look at, in other words, the fact that we have eight countries with a whole bunch of big old Hanseatic cities now surrounding the Baltic Sea area.
Perhaps they could think of a Baltic Sea strategy along those lines.
I would also like to stress that cities are the most important growth, innovation, economic, social and regional centres that we have and therefore the focus should be on that.
I would like to address my final point to my friend MrÂ Libicki in reference to yesterdayâs debate about what Mr McCreevy said or did not say.
I am Finnish and I come from a âwelfareâ system.
Whatever Mr McCreevy said, I think what we did yesterday was in many ways wrong.
The World Economic Forum ranks Finland as the most competitive economy in the world, Sweden as the third and Denmark as the fourth, but I can guarantee one thing: the last person I want to have preaching to me about competitiveness is a German Socialist in the form of Mr Schulz!
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Beaupuy has managed to draw up an excellent report that contains initiatives that can be implemented straight away with 2007-2013 in mind.
It was a pleasure to listen to Commissioner HÃŒbnerâs speech this morning, in which she made specific commitments to the effect that we can look forward to a new framework as early as at Decemberâs informal Council.
I unreservedly endorse this report.
Mr Jacques Delors used to speak about the Europe of the regions.
If we were to draw up the balance sheet right now, it would be the Europe of the regions and the cities.
Last year, I helped initiate a study in which we compared eight countries, eight regions and eight urban poles of development.
This involved cities such as Milan, Dublin, Bristol and Nantes, and showed that it is the best possible cooperation between the region and the city that leads to the best results.
It is therefore important that this same cohesion, and not competence, should be the basis of any analysis.
Cohesion between the region and between the cities, good governance and multi-level governance offer the best prospects.
I have noticed that in Europe, even in my own region, a new synthesis is developing: hierarchy is making way for synergy.
My region comprises , a large area encompassing five cities that have joined forces.
Good regional policy also implies good urban policy.
That being the case, I should like to revisit this notion when the regulations are laid down later on in the year.
Drawing up urban lists to promote the programmes is a fine thing, provided that it does not lead to fragmentation.
In summary, given that cities are the pioneers in their regions socially and economically, it is useful if we in the Committee on Regional Development could review the clarification of the Committeeâs role in the urban dimension.
Finally, the Commissioner has indicated that she wants to give this urban dimension even more prominence in the regulations.
I would like to ask her if she could say anything about this during this sitting.
Â Â  Madam President, I am standing in for Mr Casa, who is indisposed, and has asked me to make use of his speaking time.
In any case, we wish him a speedy recovery, so that he may be back on his feet as soon as possible and able to make use of his right to speak in this House.
On Mr Casaâs behalf, let me thank Mr Beaupuy for his fine report.
I think we are all aware that towns and cities have to be the focus of any future regional policy, being, so to speak, the epicentres of the problems with which our regional policies will have to deal.
We know that 80% of people live in conurbations, that more and more people are moving to towns and cities, and that the problems associated with that are becoming more acute.
The task of using our regional policy to keep the rural areas around our cities attractive, and to prevent this flow into the cities necessarily devolves upon Europe, so the European Union, in the period of time between 2007 and 2013, must not only come up with rational policies, not only for cities, but also for rural areas, particularly in mountainous and isolated regions, in order to be able to offer the people who live there proper conditions under which to work.
That should not mean, though, that we should neglect the towns and cities, for many of the problems that arise in them could be resolved with the help and support of the European Union, and so we should use benchmarking as a means of highlighting which solutions make sense for everyone.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Stubb on what he had to say.
All of us in Central Europe look northwards, if not exactly with admiration, at any rate with very warm sentiments, and are in fact glad that these states have managed to maintain the European social model.
I would go along entirely with what he had to say about our Socialist Members.
Â Â  . Madam President, thank you very much for a very good debate.
We have listened very carefully.
Mrs Krehl raised the point of the financial perspective.
All I can say is that I could not agree more.
I think Europe is simply unable to absorb a longer period of uncertainty without very strong negative political, economic and social consequences, and that is why the lack of a good decision in December will cause damage that European citizens cannot afford anymore.
Regarding the debate on the urban dimension, I see that debate as a broad and strong support to this need to strengthen the urban dimension in our cohesion policy.
Once again I want to say how much I appreciate the efforts of Mr Beaupuy and of the other Members of the Parliament who worked with him.
I also want to assure you that we look at cities and towns on a Europe-wide basis.
We look at all the problems and all the contributions of Europe-wide cities and towns and the contribution to the change in Europe.
We are also aware of how much we can learn from towns and cities in Europe.
There is an enormous amount of best practice which we have taken from the Urban Programme and I hope we will be able to use it in the future.
Two or three specific issues were also raised.
One is the gender issue and the issue of equal status between men and women.
In this context I would like to say two things.
One, with regard to regulation, we have the provisions in the general regulation, but â also in response to many of your comments â what we have done over the last weeks when revising the position of the Commission was to propose adding the gender dimension for the first time in the history of cohesion policy to the ERDF regulation.
It has not yet been approved by the Commission, but I hope it will be a major step forward.
I also want to say that we will take into account the gender dimension in our consultation on the working paper on urban issues which we are currently working on.
Housing was mentioned in different contexts.
As you know, the housing issue is among those few issues which are still outstanding in the negotiations in the Council, in addition to some other very difficult issues on which Parliament has also voted, including cofinancing rates and eligibility of VAT.
My understanding is that these questions will be solved in the context of the debate on the financial perspective, not in the context of the negotiations on the regulation.
On the Baltic Sea area, I want to say that within the current Interreg Programme it is one of the best â if not the best â performing programmes.
I also hope that in the future we will have under the third objective this Baltic zone for transnational dimension.
It is under major threat because, as you know, the budget proposal under the Luxembourg Presidency for the European territorial corporation objective in particular as regards the transnational dimension has been drastically reduced.
I now turn to the report.
In response to Mr van Nistelrooij, with regard to timing, we are working on the document on urban issues.
We will I think start this or next week interservice consultations in the Commission.
I hope I will be able to say something when I come in November to the meeting with Mr Beaupuyâs group, but generally all I can say at this stage is that we would like to have the first discussion with the Member States already in December and then, as I have said, continue the consultations until more or less March.
Then, maybe â but we will have to discuss this â sometime around March we could have a joint conference on those issues.
However, we have to discuss it and see what we can do together.
I certainly look forward to further cooperation with your Intergroup on urban and housing issues and I once again thank you very much for the discussion today.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The Urban dimension in regional policy is of course important, in Scotland we have our major cities Glasgow, Edinburgh and others and all have benefited from EU engagement with regional policy.
My overriding concern on all regional policy matters is that the overall budget is still to be agreed, and the disastrous policies of the UK government in particular would see regional policy suffer most from their planned cuts.
The Parliament has spoken with a strong voice in the Boge report, and we must ensure that this remains our view.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0265/2005) by Mr Chmielewski, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound and amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 (COM(2005)0086 â C6-0094/2005 â 2005/0014(CNS)).
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Chmielewski, and the Committee on Fisheries for the report on the Commissionâs proposal for technical measures in the Baltic Sea.
I must express my gratitude for the open attitude taken by the committee and the rapporteur, in particular to the arguments put forward by the Commission, resulting in a report which the Commission can accept almost in its entirety.
This is a very technical file and, as you are aware, technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea presently originate in large part from fisheries rules adopted at international level in the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Committee â IBSFC.
The Community has adopted some additional rules for its own waters, which now cover all of the Baltic Sea except for the two small portions of Russian waters.
In Community legislation, the measures are spread out in three different Council regulations: the Baltic technical measures regulation, the regulation on industrial fishing for herring â both from 1998 â and the annual TAC and quota regulation, which also contains a number of technical conservation measures.
Apart from this legal complexity, the present rules are, in some cases, over-complicated and, in others, unclear and remain open to interpretation.
They are therefore difficult to implement and to control.
On 14Â March 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a new regulation on technical conservation measures for the Baltic Sea.
The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation with the Baltic stakeholders and the Member States during 2004.
It groups together all the relevant rules into a single legislative act, which will improve legal consistency.
Furthermore, the proposal seeks to simplify and to streamline the rules as far as possible by, for example, proposing uniform closed seasons for certain species instead of having differing time periods in different parts of the Baltic.
The consultation held within the Committee on Fisheries was characterised by a spirit of good cooperation, which has led to a strong result.
The Commissionâs proposal is very technical with many details relating to the construction and use of fishing gear in the Baltic.
I am very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries have been able to address the very technical elements of the proposal and have come forward with a number of amendments which will improve the proposal.
AmendmentsÂ 5 and 6 are a good example of this. Strict rules were proposed for all the nets comprising the trawl to guarantee its efficient selectivity.
These amendments allow the reduction of the application of the strict rules to the rear part of the trawl. Thus, the selectivity of the fishing gear is not affected.
The rules have been simplified and are easier to understand for the fishermen, and control at sea is facilitated.
I can support all but one of the 15 amendments proposed in the report. The only amendment on which I have reservations is AmendmentÂ 3.
If we accept that fisheries inspectors can only take samples of a landing if the sample has been accepted by the ship owner, we may undermine the inspectorsâ ability to carry out the necessary controls.
Furthermore, I must remind you that it is always up to the inspectors to prove that the samples they have taken are representative of the landing.
Therefore, I am not in a position to support the adoption of AmendmentÂ 3.
I can accept AmendmentÂ 9, on the introduction of an assessment of the effects of driftnets and other entangling gears on the sea mammal populations.
However, let me make it clear that I am not prepared to accept the modification of the phasing-out of driftnets, as already adopted by the Council with Parliamentâs support, in 2004.
Let me finish by once again thanking the rapporteur and the committee for their excellent work.
Â Â  . Â MadamÂ President, my report concerns the proposal for a Council regulation on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea dated 14Â MarchÂ 2005.
This regulation is one of a long list of Union documents aimed on the one hand at codifying existing solutions and on the other at extending their application to include the 10Â new Member States, four of which are on the Baltic, as is well known.
It should be noted at the outset that not everything in the Councilâs proposal was to the liking of the aforementioned four countries. Many key articles were rejected outright.
As a rapporteur who is a national of one of those countries I found myself in an inordinately difficult position.
In fact my country is one of those likely to be affected most by the new directive.
I had to find a way through this political maze, which was no easy task.
As usually happens, I was challenged to find an advantageous compromise, which was particularly difficult in this case as it involved technical fishing measures which are not particularly amenable to efforts at mediation.
Whatever the underlying political intentions, there are other factors that impinge on fishing techniques, notably verification by those involved at a practical level, namely fishermen, and the fish themselves, that are quite oblivious to efforts at political mediation.
Fortunately it proved possible to reduce the controversial issues to just a couple of crucial ones.
Thanks are due to the Members involved and to the representatives of the European Commission for the efforts made in this regard.
Most importantly, they succeeded in finding a compromise concerning the issue of cod fishing gear.
Cod is the most important fish in the Baltic and the main source of income for those who fish in that sea.
In addition to the exit window for juveniles recommended in the Councilâs proposal and known as the BAKOMA â and I know this is just a detail â the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commission agreed to the use of the cheaper tried and tested T90 codend.
This is equivalent as far as quality is concerned.
It was a Polish and German idea.
As a result of face to face working meetings with the authors of the proposal, the obvious weaknesses of the latter were remedied by the inclusion of essential definitions of items of fishing gear referred to in several articles.
The most important of these definitions concerned the extension piece, which is mentioned frequently in the regulation.
Thanks to the efforts made, many concerns were allayed and the controversial restrictions in a number of provisions were toned down.
The flexible nature of certain articles also became clearer.
As a result, the rapporteur was able to withdraw AmendmentÂ 16 and scale down five other amendments concerning in particular the restrictive ArticleÂ 6, to which the Commissioner has already referred.
This article is a source of worry for the entire fishing sector in the Baltic, calling as it does for a ban on items of fishing gear used on a fairly regular basis.
There was also the problem of salmon driftnets, which gave rise to the strongest feelings in the European Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries.
The Polish fishing sector is of the opinion that the rest of Europe believes driftnets represent a serious threat to marine mammals, particularly porpoises, if these nets are used for salmon fishing.
In the southern Baltic, however, these nets do not represent a threat because porpoises are extremely rare there.
It is also the case that a decision to ban such nets in this part of the Baltic would prevent some 60Â Polish ship owners from fishing for salmon.
Aware of both aspects of the problem posed by these nets, on the one hand the Unionâs requirements concerning protection of resources in the Baltic, and on the other salmon fishermenâs livelihoods and their futures, the rapporteur suggested the only possible compromise solution in this situation. This was to take account of the Councilâs recommendations whilst at the same time undertaking reliable studies of the Baltic waters.
The study should establish the true state of affairs and evaluate the actual impact of the use of these nets and other entangling gear on marine mammals.
Completion is set for 2008.
Here ends the tale of my report.
I was challenged to move mountains, and like all parliamentary compromises, it meets the conditions for acceptance by the House even if it does not please everyone all of the time, Polish fishermen in particular.
Our compromise does meet the aforementioned conditions, and the Committee on Fisheries eventually agreed on it unanimously.
I have already thanked the Members responsible, the rest of the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commissionâs experts.
I should also like to thank all other experts, researchers and fishing gear manufacturers from the Baltic countries who gave their time voluntarily to help the rapporteur become familiar with this very important aspect of fishing activity which is also challenging as it requires specialist knowledge.
Â Â  . Â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise the issue of banning salmon driftnets in the Baltic.
Firstly, I would like to stress that in contrast to nets used in other areas, these nets do not represent a serious threat to the biodiversity of marine life.
In addition, there is no scientific evidence that they represent a serious threat to porpoises in the central and northern areas of the Baltic Sea.
Banning driftnets in the Baltic would effectively mean the end of Polish salmon fishing, as there are no alternative nets that could be used in our waters.
There was no scientific justification for the decision taken and no account was taken of the position of the countries concerned.
These countries did not become Members of the Union until 1Â MayÂ 2004, and the decision was taken a mere four days before enlargement.
For all these reasons we feel that the compromise solution would be the best way forward.
It would involve postponing further bans on nets in the Baltic for threeÂ years, until appropriate scientific data is available to justify the need for such measures or deem them unnecessary.
Â Â  . Madam President, we endorse the reportâs fundamental objective and welcome the intention that changes be made to definitions and various technical provisions.
Debates on proposals from the Commission that might lead, in the long or short term, to restrictions being placed on fishing activity, are always heated, and that on this proposal has been no exception.
It might not be evident from the outcome of the vote in Committee, but there were a number of points on which a compromise could be reached only after in-depth discussions.
With this in mind, I would like especially to draw attention to Article 12 of the Commission proposal, which deals with restrictions on, and the prohibition of, driftnets.
Our group has previously endorsed all attempts to provide for a reduction in the use of these devices or a ban on them, and so it necessarily follows that the same strict rules should apply in the Baltic as in other European Union fishing grounds, in which driftnets have for years been banned in order to give small cetaceans a better chance of survival.
Certain efforts are being made to jeopardise the current ban on driftnets, and these our group repudiates.
Day-to-day practice shows, however, that a valid legal framework will only be any good in so far as it is capable of being monitored, simply and effectively, on the ground, in other words, in practice.
This, I think, is where the main difficulties lie, and I hope that this legal framework will result in a more vigorous approach to monitoring in future.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for tabling this proposal.
I have waited for a long time for driftnets also to be banned in the Baltic Sea, the last sea in the EU where these are still permitted.
Thank you for sticking to that view, even if there is sometimes criticism of this ban here in the European Parliament.
I wish to take the opportunity of thanking our rapporteur for his willingness to compromise on this issue too.
It was also wrong of the Council not to involve the new Member States in this process from the beginning.
It might have facilitated the process if they had been involved at the first stage.
I do not think we can wait until the last porpoise is dead before we finally establish the scientific proofs, for then it will be too late.
We have seen studies showing the risks involved in driftnets, and I think that the studies no doubt justify applying the precautionary principle in this case.
The biological diversity of the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable. It is an extremely sensitive sea, and we should not risk disturbing the balance there.
I now await your next initiative.
A year ago, we discussed the opportunities available to countries that, with a view to improving future generationsâ potential catches, wish voluntarily to call a halt to fishing and to introduce compensation for fishermen.
I await rules from the Commission whereby countries that, with a view to future profits, wish to increase the quantity of fish in their waters, are enabled more easily to call a voluntary halt to fishing.
I hope that we can discuss this in more detail.
Â Â  . Madam President, the common fisheries policy is without doubt one of the most disastrous of all EU common policies.
It has inflicted incredible damage on the ecology of the North Sea and has done absolutely nothing for conservation.
Not satisfied with this disaster, the EU is actually encouraging its repetition in African coastal waters.
You can therefore imagine the cynicism with which I read this proposal for special technical measures to improve the conservation situation in the Baltic Sea.
The rapporteur has produced an extraordinarily unhelpful explanatory statement, which is really little more than a blow-by-painful-blow account of a paper trail.
At the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys.
Why this House should be preoccupying itself with such minutiae is beyond me, unless it is yet another symptom of the European Unionâs limitless propensity for control-freakism.
Doubtless these technical specifications will have been dreamt up by bureaucrats without the slightest experience of sea fishing and will therefore cause enormous problems for the people who have to have such experience and work on a daily basis.
I do not believe that the EU has any business in involving itself in conservation in the Baltic, or anywhere else for that matter.
These issues should be resolved by sensible negotiation between national government and fishermen, not by an unelected bureaucracy with an absolutely appalling track record for environmental vandalism.
Â Â  Â MadamÂ President, concerning the report by MrÂ Chmielewski on the conservation of fishing resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and Sound through technical measures, I would like to say how much I appreciate the technical standard of the report.
The rapporteur has worked hard to take account of the interests of the four former Baltic partners and also of the interests of the four new Member States that joined at the latest enlargement of the European Union.
It should be pointed out that the proposal for a Council regulation that is the subject of MrÂ Chmielewskiâs report codifies provisions drafted prior to 2004, that is to say, prior to the accession of the 10 new Member States to the Union.
At the time, the possibilities for other interested European countries to be involved in the talks were strictly limited, and Parliamentâs new elected representatives were of course unable to participate.
In view of the specific nature of the natural environment of the Baltic, and of the significant differences between its western and eastern waters, input by the new countries to the report before us needed to be taken into account and I trust this was the case.
I should like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur once again.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating MrÂ Chmielewski once again on his report.
He made reference to the fact that he had been faced with a very difficult challenge and needed to find a workable compromise.
The end result is very much a workable compromise, and the Commission is prepared to accept all the amendments except the one I have already mentioned.
I also agree that the breakthrough came with the acceptance of the T90 codend, which could be used as an alternative to the BACOMA trawl.
I confirm that ISIS advises that the T90 codend has the same selectivity as the BACOMA exit window and we can therefore accept its use.
With regard to driftnets, we accept the study which can indicate what remedial measures can be taken which would be of a socio-economic nature.
However, the Commission has no intention of considering an extension of the phasing-out of driftnets with regard to the Baltic, simply because of the fact that the driftnets ban has already been in place with the regulation of 1998 and the extension and phasing-out up to 2010 for the Baltic was already a special concession and it does not make sense to grant any further extension or concession, otherwise we risk opening up again the whole argument with regard to driftnets and place in doubt the validity of such driftnets in the other Community waters.
It is true that the number of porpoises is very low.
This, however, makes it even more important to continue to uphold the ban to ensure that no irreparable damage occurs with regard to porpoises.
The low populations of porpoises put even more responsibility on us to ensure their protection.
In addition, there is a general driftnet ban, which is part of the , as I mentioned before, and we must ensure that this is in no way prejudiced.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Kindermann and MrÂ Schlyter for their support.
With regard to the point made by Mr Schlyter concerning the closed season for cod, it must be said that the closure and the closed areas for cod and the closed season for cod is not a voluntary measure.
It is a mandatory measure, which was introduced together with the TACs and quotas regulation at the December Council.
However, at the moment we are preparing a recovery plan for cod in the Baltic Sea and it is obvious that technical measures and measures relating to closed areas and closed seasons will form an integral part of this recovery plan.
It is also obvious that if fishermen are constrained to tie up as a result of such closed seasons, then, under normal Community rules, they would be entitled to compensation for that tie-up if it is considered to be of an exceptional nature or is a result of the measures of a recovery plan.
With regard to what Mr Titford said, I can only say that I cannot agree with him.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this report.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Mr President, last month in Strasbourg I raised a similar point of order under Rule 130, because Council Question Time, which was supposed to last an hour, lasted no more than 35Â minutes.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council clearly thought it more important to make a telephone call than to answer our questions.
Like all those MEPs on the list to ask questions I was at least expecting a written answer immediately afterwards. It did not happen.
I was then promised a written answer by last Thursday, but that did not happen either and I still have not received an answer.
I understand that this is first time under any Presidency that MEPsâ questions have gone unanswered for so long.
Can I ask our own President please to ensure that at the next Strasbourg session we get not only a proper explanation, but also an apology?
Finally, I should like to ask that we also get an acknowledgement from the Council that Question Time is not just a time for MEPs to ask questions: it is also a time for the Presidency-in-Office to provide answers.
Â Â  Mr Bushill-Matthews, your concern is quite justified, and the President has already written to the Council to criticise this state of affairs in emphatic and vigorous terms.
We expect the Council to maintain the arrangements that have been customary for years, indeed for decades.
It is absolutely unacceptable that these things should be dealt with in the manner that you describe, and we have already taken the matter up.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make it clear that this amendment does not challenge the WTO regulations.
The amendment proposes to add two words, namely âhigh riskâ chemicals.
The only purpose is to clarify that it does not challenge the WTO.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the House having voted on China today, I now have the great honour to welcome the members of the delegation of parliamentarians from the Peopleâs Republic of China who are visiting us on the occasion of the 22nd EP/China Inter-Parliamentary Meeting.
A very warm welcome to the delegation from the National Peopleâs Congress of the Peopleâs Republic of China under the chairmanship of Mr Wang!
Honourable members of the Chinese National Peopleâs Congress, you will be aware that dialogue between Europe and China is of crucial importance in terms of continuing globalisation.
Â Â  Mr President, could you inform me of by what democratic decision-making process our esteemed Chinese fellow parliamentarians have been elected?
I would be obliged to you if you could.
Thank you.
Â Â  I put it to you that you should take part in one of the delegationsâ sittings.
You will yourself be aware that the sending of delegations appointed in accordance with national rules is something that national sovereignty makes possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 14 on death sentences for juvenile offenders.
In Iran, young people are being sentenced to death and executed merely for having sexual relationships or for being gay.
In the original wording, where we used the term âjuvenile offendersâ, it seems as if we agree with the Iranian Government that having sexual relationships is a crime.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from yesterdayâs debate and from the Iranian response to our demand that Akbar Gandji be released at once and that guarantees be given that he is still alive, I wish to move an additional amendment
Â Â  Mr President, the background for this request is as follows: the debate on the serious situation in Ethiopia and the motion for a resolution have been in the making for quite some time.
Political groups agreed on a text last Friday, but since then a lot of things have happened in Ethiopia that are of great importance and ought to be referred to in the text.
However, since the deadline had expired, there was no way we could really do that.
The most serious thing that has happened is that the negotiations between the ruling party and the opposition parties broke down about a week ago, primarily because of the refusal of the ruling party and the Prime Minister to even discuss a number of issues related to the need for democratic reform.
Furthermore, the Parliament in Addis Abbaba convened, and some of the opposition members were not taking part because of the breakdown in those negotiations.
I believe I should explain the background to this, otherwise it does not make sense for Members.
Â Â  Mr President, we, the Members of this House, have just been very generous.
The only thing I would ask of those who draft resolutions is that they make a point of writing them down before the deadline for submission rather than after it.
Our job will thereby be made that much easier.
Â Â  Mr Swoboda, I asked that very question when we were preparing for the vote, and was told that we had to make some allowances, as the situation in Ethiopia was changing practically by the hour.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . The euro is one of the most widely used currencies in international trade and as such is one of the most vulnerable to counterfeiting.
The Union has been taking the necessary measures to ensure that the circulation of the euro is protected by effective and homogenous mechanisms to combat the crime of counterfeiting.
Whilst counterfeiting rates remain high, measures taken to combat forgery are bearing fruit.
Between 2003 and 2004, for example, there was a 20% rise in operations leading to the seizure of forged euro, whereas the same period saw a 38% drop in the counterfeiting of banknotes, such as EURÂ 100.
It is clear, therefore, that there is an ongoing need for vigilance, training and technical assistance, so as to ensure that the euro is protected appropriately, uniformly and effectively against counterfeiting.
I therefore back the proposal to extend this programme, and all of the excellent amendments tabled by the rapporteur, because we will only be able to achieve the aims of the programme if we have a stable financial framework, particularly during the period in which the new Member States are integrated into the single currency.
Â Â  . Relations between the EU and Switzerland naturally follow special rules.
In all likelihood, Switzerland would easily become a Member of the EU, given that it fulfils all of the accession criteria, but the fact is that the Swiss people have not wanted to join.
It also remains a fact that, in geographical terms, the country is right in the middle of Europe and the EU.
We therefore have everything to gain from concluding agreements such as those before us with this neighbour.
Agreements of this nature simplify and aid the flow of relations between the 25 Member States and Switzerland, and improve the lives of citizens on both sides.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . I welcome the rapporteurâs work on this issue.
I feel it is a balanced report, and has clarified and improved upon some key points that had been poorly explained in the version submitted by the Commission.
The measures put forward seek to protect the overall interests of the fisheries sector.
The report was based on the opinions of administrative fisheries bodies in the new Member States, of the processing sectors and of other fishing industry representatives.
Consultancy of this nature is a key factor in ensuring that the measures to be implemented are properly assessed.
The proposals adopted today are intended to adapt the equipment used in other marine environments to the conditions in the Baltic, which has particular characteristics that require specific measures.
Although my opinion is a favourable one, I shall be keeping a close eye on the issue of the effects of driftnets and other entangling equipment on sea mammals.
We should proceed in accordance with the findings of studies carried out up to 2008, with one option being to consider withdrawing this method of fishing.
Â Â  . This issue of fisheries is of vital importance to my country and, even though this particular case does not relate directly to Portugal, I read this report with great interest, because I feel it is essential to protect the species and to look after the interests of this sector, which plays such a crucial role in a number of Member States.
I welcome the participation of the new Member States from the Baltic in the amendments to this legislation.
The extra information is crucial.
Consultation with representatives from the fisheries and processing sectors is similarly crucial, because this will rectify any shortcomings in the provisions relating to the conservation of stocks.
The Baltic Sea has its own characteristics.
The purpose of this report was to combine, with due care and attention, the issue of protecting ecosystems and social issues relating to fisheries.
I should also like to stress the importance of this proposal to the development of fisheries in the Baltic, with particular regard to maintaining fish stocks.
Final decisions must be taken on the basis of in-depth knowledge of the situation and any problems.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Chimielewski report.
Â Â  . Although Parliamentâs report improves upon the text submitted by the Commission, we are opposed to some of the underlying concepts on the development of higher education.
One such example is the setting up of national and European assessment and accreditation agencies â public and private â whose assessments, and the results thereof, may affect the provision of licences, funding, support for students and the âprestigeâ of the institutions, although this is not explained clearly.
The opening up of assessments to the private sector paves the way for the creation of a new trade, in which capital exerts a greater influence on the institutions and their programmes, objectives and social strategy.
In each country, a network of interests could be set up between the agencies, the Member States, the institutions and the economic powers, with the aim of establishing assessment criteria that favour the best possible assessment of their own institutions and harm those institutions and teaching systems that are not up to the mark.
In this way, economic criteria would prevail and certain âqualitiesâ would be accorded value, leading to further difficulties for those who already have them â as well as overlooking the national and public dimension of higher education â and exacerbate the trend towards the elitism and merchandising of higher education in Europe.
Â Â  . The quality of higher education is and will always be one of the EUâs priorities.
The mutual recognition of quality assurance and assessment systems in Europe must be promoted if this objective is to be achieved.
Many Member States have already made progress in this regard, but much hard work lies ahead if we are to succeed in developing the European higher education area.
Universities must improve their quality levels by introducing a system of internal mechanisms and through their relations with external quality assurance systems.
Implementing these systems represents a major step forward towards the mutual recognition of university qualifications in Europe, something that we very much wish to see.
Â Â  . â Claims about safeguarding standards and improving education through evaluation are an insult which is being hurled directly against any previous standards of higher education.
It is a basic tool for the privatisation and commercialisation of education and research and aims to create two-speed institutions, with centres of 'excellent' and second-class institutions.
The register of public and private evaluation organisations and companies is nothing but a concentrating mechanism of the ÎU, which will determine and control the adaptation of higher education to the interests of the monopolies.
The outcome will be the further subjugation of education and research to the needs of the market and their conversion to 'products' provided by university 'businesses', in a bid to increase their customer base, especially from an international student elite.
Evaluation means downgrading rather than improving the quality of universities and makes provision for them not to fulfil their social mission, but to increase the profitability of capital through opportunistic study and research subjects tailored to the market.
The balanced development of scientific sectors and the response of universities to their social role are a matter for the university community, in cooperation with the grass-roots movement, not the subject of revision and control mechanisms with private-sector economic criteria.
That is why we are voting against the report.
Â Â  . The quality of higher education in Europe is a key element in our growth and development strategies on the world stage.
The mutual recognition of university qualifications in Europe, which we all wish to see, needs the right conditions to be in place if quality is to be guaranteed and if our universities are to improve on a consistent basis.
Against this backdrop, this is a most interesting proposal, which adopts practical measures to achieve a European higher education system that is more effective, more transparent and more attractive to students and scientists.
Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Novak report.
Â Â  . â Today textiles, tomorrow footwear, cars, machine parts, steel; and subsequently electronic goods and high added value products, if indeed that process is not already underway.
How many more European industrial sectors are you going to sacrifice with your blinkered attitude?
How many millions more people will be laid off on account of your fanatical devotion to globalisation?
China does not honour its commitments to the World Trade Organisation.
You are aware of this â it is written in your report.
State grants to companies and exporters, closed markets, voluntary monetary dumping, counterfeiting, pirating; the Chinese are guilty of a host of unfair practices.
The most significant one, however, is the lack of freedom, not least union freedom, which denies Chinese workers the chance to request pay rises or improved working conditions.
Our interests and those of the countries and the people of Europe, of our jobs and of our economies must take precedence over suicidal adherence to the dogma of free trade carried to extremes.
Every country in the world, including the United States, has grasped this, but not the Europe of Brussels.
Even though it has the merit of raising a number of issues, this report fails to address the issues of protection or retaliatory measures and to bring globalisation into question, and it consequently falls short of what is required.
Â Â  . One could write a great deal on the question of relations, in particular trade relations, between the different countries comprising the EU and China, a country with a population of some 1.3Â billion.
The report does boast some balanced points, such as establishing âtrade links with China in a spirit of cooperation and complementarity, while ensuring that the two parties can maintain and develop harmoniously their industrial, agricultural and service sectors in order to guarantee the best possible living standards for all their inhabitantsâ.
Ultimately, however, it descends into a justification for capitalism and the liberalisation of trade relations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
Hence the demands of âopening up the marketsâ, in particular the liberalisation of the âfinancial marketsâ, the reform of the âeconomic systemâ â in other words, the installation of capitalism â and the âacceptance of the European legal and economic systemâ.
Hence the acceptance of all of the EUâs duplicity â which enjoys the agreement of Portugalâs Socialist Party Government â when it comes to the textiles and clothing sector, pandering to the interests of the large distributors and importers.
This is unacceptable.
Â Â  China is one of the worldâs fastest growing economies.
It is also the EUâs largest trading partner after the United States.
It is therefore important for the EU to develop both trade and cooperation with this part of the world.
Fundamentally, our attitude is that it is not to Europeâs advantage to alienate itself from this growing economy by means of customs duties and quotas.
Chinaâs economic strength is growing in most industries.
Todayâs âtextile warsâ will therefore spread to other areas in time.
Trying to protect unprofitable industry from international competition is therefore no permanent solution.
Sweden has experienced such attempts for 30 years in both the shipbuilding industry and the textiles and ready-made clothing industry.
In order to respond to growing international competition, the EU faces the choice either of implementing centrally controlled protectionism or of stimulating growth from below.
Unfortunately, a number of the political groups are choosing the first method.
We cannot, therefore, support the report.
Otherwise, I support the proposal to set up a system for labelling products with their country of origin.
Â Â  . It is naive to think that the EU Member States can build a wall around them to protect us from external economic threats.
In the long run, free trade offers the most prospects for prosperity and world stability.
Any attempt to protect our own economy would not bring any long-term solutions.
The report gives little consideration to the developments that China has undergone and overlooks the fact that any further development will inevitably give more attention to the position of minorities and the environment.
Pressure from Europe and finger-wagging will only have the opposite effect.
The problems involving the textile imports are typical of the EUâs schizophrenic way of doing things.
We first encourage free trade, only to introduce quotas later on that are unworkable for entrepreneurs.
Moreover, it is unseemly to maintain the arms embargo and treat China in the same way as we do such rogue countries as North Korea and Iran.
If Europe is serious about building sustainable trade relations with China, we will need to sit around the negotiating table as equal partners and set aside our self-importance.
Â Â  . I welcome this timely report into the deepening trade relationship between the EU and China in the 21st Century.
It is not often that Parliamentarians have the chance to consider the underlying trends in the development of international politics but this report does so.
I fully endorse the focus given by the Rapporteur to the challenges posed to EU industry by the rapid growth of the Chinese economy in both unskilled labour-intensive industry as well as high-tech domains.
The paragraphs which draw attention to the growing problem of declining labour standards and unfair trading practices are particularly important in the run-up to the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in December.
By highlighting these challenges MEPs have voted for a constructive dialogue with the Chinese in which broader questions of the social and environmental impact of rapid economic growth are taken into account.
Â Â  . The issue of trade relations between China and the EU is one that must, as a matter of priority, be addressed head on.
The idea that the flow of goods from China is somehow going to dwindle is an illusion. It is similarly fanciful to think that we can compete with this enormous producer on the basis of a similar economic model, characterised by low wages and unqualified labour.
We must take action â without abandoning our industries, without stopping production, without leaving our citizens high and dry â mindful of forthcoming developments in this trade relationship and of the consequences of those developments for Europeâs economy.
What is more, as this trade relationship develops, we must try to achieve one vital objective, namely the democratisation of China, a country in which respect for human rights is anything but praiseworthy and in which external policy is based entirely on a mindset of expanding its influence, while overlooking the objectives of expanding democracy and respect for human rights, which are our objectives and those of our allies.
Let us therefore turn trade links into a platform for development.
This ought to be our challenge.
Â Â  . I should like to make two recommendations to the Commission.
The first relates to internal matters.
Globalisation is a new reality, the effects of which cannot be offset by protectionist measures.
It has its positive aspects but there is also a side to it that should not be overlooked.
We must act quickly and decisively to help the regions worst affected in social terms.
I should like to recommend that the Commission draw up specific programmes to aid those regions.
The second recommendation relates to matters outside the EU.
Since it joined the World Trade Organisation, China has never played by the rules.
The Chinese authorities continue to pursue policies of state aid for exports; they have artificially devalued their currency; they have breached environmental standards; they have failed to respect workersâ rights; they do not observe health and safety standards in the workplace; they use child labour and forced labour.
In the textiles sector, they have on a number of occasions brazenly gone back on their commitments, and this with the EUâs tacit acceptance.
I should therefore recommend that the Commission exert constant pressure on the Chinese authorities to introduce minimum social and environmental standards into trade agreements, together with a system for monitoring implementation.
Globalisation produces winners and losers.
Defeat is a bitter pill to swallow, but losing because your opponent has broken the most basic rules of the game is disgraceful and unacceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, I abstained on the resolution on Iran, and many of my British Conservative colleagues voted against, as Amendment l â making a referral to the United Nations Security Council a requirement â was rejected.
This is very regrettable.
I also did not like the fact that paragraph 7 was included in the report.
That paragraph restricts the eventual options available to the West to prevent the development by Iran of a nuclear weapon.
I fully support the condemnation of Iran in the resolution for its brutal human rights track record, including the execution of minors for sexual chastity offences.
Â Â  We certainly cannot support the position adopted by Iran, which promises âtougher measuresâ in the event of the nuclear question being referred to the United Nations Security Council, and even a step backwards with regard to the commitments it has entered into on this delicate matter.
Concerns about the use of nuclear weapons by a country that is a leading proponent of Islamic fundamentalism are certainly well-founded.
However, that must not keep us from recognising the right of every people â including, therefore, the Iranian people â to develop as fully as possible their own economic and technological potential, and to defend their own territory.
From this point of view, Europe cannot ignore the geopolitical facts of the situation, namely that, to the east of Iran, countries such as China, North Korea, Russia, India and, not least, Pakistan not only possess atomic weaponry, but also have the capability to use it at long distances.
Â Â  . I support this resolution especially the references to the Human Rights situation in Iran which has further deteriorated since the presidential elections of June 2005.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have increasingly reported human rights violations in Iran during the last few months, and there are increasing reports regarding executions and death sentences, especially against juvenile offenders and members of minorities, which violate internationally recognised criteria and standards.

I am deeply concerned at Iran's lack of cooperation with regard to the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue and that there are no signs of the enforcement of Iran's commitment within this dialogue to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law.
I therefore support the call on Iran to recommence the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue with the European Union and calls upon the Council and Commission to monitor developments in Iran and raise concrete cases of human rights abuses within the framework of the dialogue.
The Commission must also make effective use of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to intensify contacts and cooperation with Iranian civil society and independent media and to support democracy and respect for human rights in Iran.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly supports the resolution on Iran, particularly the recognition given to the efforts of the EU3 to reach a diplomatic solution, the affirmation that the only way to resolve the problem is through diplomatic pressure, with Iran returning to talks based on the Paris agreement, and the importance of the resumption of the Human Rights dialogue with Iran.
However, it is unhelpful (in amendment 12) to use this resolution to criticise the review of the US security strategy at this stage, whilst the precise plans and intentions for the review remain unclear and as yet unpublished.
Â Â  . The report in question highlights the fact that a working dialogue between the EU and Iran is of the utmost importance to both parties concerned.
It is for this reason that I welcome the resolution whilst emphasising the fact that the EU should seek to be in good relations with Iran as it is a potentially important partner for the EU.
I share the view that Iran should reingage in a human rights dialogue with the EU whilst agreeing with the need to resist nuclear proliferation.
Furthermore, I urge the EU to treat Iran with the respect that such a significant and important country deserves.
Â Â  . â The debate on Iran in the European Parliament, on the pretext of the nuclear problem and violation of human rights, relates to more general imperialist plans and the vying for control of the wealth-producing resources of Iran and the area as a whole.
The positions of the ÎU and in the motion for a resolution have multiple objectives.
They incriminate Iran and acquit the Bush administration, which called Iran a country of the 'axis of evil' and is threatening war.
They cite nuclear risks but keep quiet about the existence of nuclear weapons in and the threat to use them by the USA and other imperialist powers.
They present themselves as the protectors of human rights because they want to promote regimes which they will control.
They pretend that they are intervening for a peaceful solution to the problem, in order to safeguard the interests of the European monopolies in Iran.
The ÎU goes along with the US propaganda in order to accustom public opinion to the possibility of invasion and claim a share of the spoils.
The nuclear problem in Iran cannot be addressed selectively; it must be addressed under a more general nuclear disarmament policy.
The imperialist powers refuse and are promoting the production of nuclear weapons for use in regular wars.
With problems of democratisation and human rights, every nation is responsible and competent to change the situation.
We are voting against the motion for a resolution in an expression of solidarity with the people of Iran.
The peoples in the area as a whole need to be mobilised against American and Euro-unifying imperialism.
Â Â  . No more escalation in the nuclear dispute with Iran!
I oppose nuclear power as a matter of principle, but the agreement between Iran and the EU, as put before us, was a sham and could only been seen as escalating the dispute.
The agreement expected Iran to renounce, once and for all, everything other than the operation of nuclear reactors for the generation of electricity, which would make impossible the conversion or enrichment of uranium, the production of fuel rods, and the planned heavy water reactor at Arak.
Iran was to be required, as a matter of treaty obligation, to abandon the right to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Never before has any state on this earth signed up to such a commitment to the unilateral renunciation of its own sovereignty.
In return for this, the EU was willing to guarantee, among other things, that no EU Member State would attack Iran using nuclear weapons, but no mention was made of the USA.
This appears to be a joint effort on the part of the USA and the EU3.
One reason why the EU is a thoroughly poor choice as a broker is that it itself promotes the use of nuclear power, with France and the United Kingdom refusing to abandon their nuclear weapons and no attempt being made to abandon the enrichment of uranium in Germany.
The peaceful resolution of the conflict surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme is the only possible option.
The pressure being exerted upon Iran is a cause of profound concern to me.
It reminds me of the preparation of the war against Iraq.
Â Â  . The internal situation in Iran has for a number of years given considerable cause for concern.
Iran and its policy of breaching human rights, of failing to uphold the values of freedom and democracy and, most crucially, of failing to respect human life â at world level, at regional level and in Iran itself â has been an alarmingly destabilising influence.
Against this backdrop, Iranâs nuclear activities are further cause for concern.
The EU has in recent years adopted the approach of an actively and openly cooperative diplomatic policy towards the Iranian authorities in the hope of achieving results.
It could scarcely be said that this has been a success.
The resolution adopted today is a further effort in this vein, but the time has come for questions to be asked as to whether this is the only way forward, and whether it is necessary to broaden the international alliance in order to force Iran, using the weapon of diplomacy, to honour its international obligations and to respect minimum standards at national level.
We shall be keeping a close eye on matters.
Â Â  . In its relations with the countries of the international community, and in particular with African countries, Europe must, once and for all, accept that, without democratisation, and all that that entails, all attempts at cooperation and aid will at best be unproductive and at worst counterproductive.
In the case of Ethiopia, where the legitimate expectations of a population that has endured ten years of suffering were recently dashed, it is our duty to do all we can to make the road to democracy a viable one.
Africa must not be a territory in which illegitimate governments are accepted as though this were an inevitability.
In this context, the message that this resolution sends out to Ethiopia should be clearly understood.
Lastly, let us take action, first and foremost, in the name of our principles and our populations.
Let us also be clear, however, that we do so in the name of our own interests as well.
Africa must not be a continent from which the have-nots understandably want to escape.
Â Â  We believe that the EU has an important task in strengthening democracy and human rights in its immediate surroundings.
In the global work to promote peace, disarmament and human rights, we wish however to prioritise the UN, which is better suited than the EU to carrying out such tasks.
We are therefore abstaining from voting on the resolutions on Iran and Ethiopia, even though we can in principle support quite a few of the demands made in them.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Bono report on education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process, for the following reasons.
Firstly, in order to achieve the objectives laid down in the Lisbon Strategy, aimed at establishing a knowledge-based society, the Member States must make a clear commitment to lifelong education and training and in so doing help to create jobs in Europe.
Secondly, this report highlights the need to place greater emphasis on education in European policy, by promoting reduced bureaucracy and mobility, by means of the mutual recognition of qualifications and through universal and non-discriminatory access to Europeâs universities.
Â Â  . This report confirms a number of the objections that we have made, namely:
- the failure of the European project in its attempts at achieving the highest standards of education and the failure of the education system in various countries;
- the productivity crisis in the current economic and social fabric, which is reflected in employment and in inappropriate performance-related pressure in the education system.
It does put forward some welcome measures, such as to âensure a 15% increase in the number of science graduates between now and 2010â, which Portugal would do well to take on board.
It also calls on the Member States to âincrease the number of teachers and to put in place initial and continuous teacher training of qualityâ, which is a welcome measure.
Furthermore, it highlights the financial bottleneck in most countries, which is a significant problem, especially given the situation in Portugal.
It also stresses the need for the EU to âguarantee sufficient methods of funding for the new integrated action programme in the field of lifelong education and trainingâ and emphasises the need to ensure that the European Social Fund can continue to be available after 2006 in all Member States.
Nevertheless, it promotes the neoliberal route, as laid down in the Lisbon agenda, with all of the detrimental consequences that that entails, not least for vocational education and training.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  We are voting against this resolution from the European Parliament.
We completely agree with the decision of 7Â November 2000 by the EU committee of the Swedish Parliament, commenting on the issue of increased EU coordination within the education field.
The committee adopted a wording to the effect that care must be taken to ensure that the Member Statesâ exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education and for the content of education systems is fully respected.
The following day, the EUâs education ministers met and adopted, among other things, the appendix from the EU committee of the Swedish Parliament, presented by Swedenâs then education minister.
We see no reason to review the position it expresses.
Â Â  . The increasingly globalised world of today faces new challenges to which European society must respond.
The only solution is to support education and lifelong learning.
This agenda must be considered aÂ high priority for the European Union; without this support, it will not be possible to attain the Lisbon Strategy objective of becoming a competitive knowledge-based economy.
I supported Mr Bonoâs report stressing the importance of education not only at a young age, but also throughout life.
I appreciate the views of the rapporteur on the role of universities in this process.
By fostering cooperation and teacher and student exchanges, we contribute to synergies in the area of research as well as to the strengthening of a European identity.
At the same time, we must realise that the creation of a knowledge-based economy and society will not be possible without adequate financial support.
I see an opportunity for the EU to prove its resolve in this area at the European level.
In the new financial climate, it will be necessary to negotiate the highest possible budget for education and for supporting the mobility of students, trainees, teachers and researchers.
Only through mutual cooperation can we succeed in keeping pace with increasing international competition.
Â Â  . What will make us more competitive, more effective and more productive is our ability to research, innovate and create.
What will make Europe return to economic growth and development, and this is broadly acknowledged, is a commitment to placing greater value on human resources.
To this end, investment in training is the most productive way forward, even if the fruits of this investment will only be seen in the medium to long term.
Time is running out for anyone actually to believe that the Lisbon agenda will be fulfilled within the time limit laid down.
Not only are we running against the clock, we are also running against logic, and if we insist on doing so, the consequences could be disastrous.
Short-, medium- and long-term measures are required if we are to rectify this situation.
As I said, investment in training is a medium/long-term measure, and this has the potential to be hugely effective.
We must therefore invest in ensuring that we have qualified human resources, given that this is our development model.
Â Â  Mr President, the main thing to be said in response to the Portas Report is that it is only those who speak the language of their new host country who stand a chance of getting an education, protecting their own interests and being integrated into its society.
It is for precisely this reason that those children belonging to the second or third generation of immigrants who do not have a command of the host countryâs language continue to be denied opportunities, with the consequence that we increasingly face the creation of so-called parallel societies, in which they resort to violence and crime.
We must not, however, tolerate the creation of such parallel societies, and so integration is dependent upon the learning of the national language of the state in question, and on that we must insist.

Â Â  Mr President, I have seen quite a bit in my time, but the Portas report must be one of the most Utopian and dangerous ever to have been put before this House, and that is saying something.
In this report, the so-called multi-culturalism of the European countries is reinforced even further by encouraging second, third, or even fourth-generation immigrant children to develop their own language and culture on our territory and thus to make even less of an effort to integrate in our society or assimilate themselves to it.
That is complete madness and flies in the face of the democratic will of the large majority of our citizens.
It can only lead to even more problems, to the formation of even more ghettos, to apartheid and, ultimately and lamentably, to violence.
Echoing the new German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, let me tell this House that a multi-cultural society is unworkable and that immigrants residing in Europe legally must be encouraged to adapt as much as they can.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, Europe should not meddle in the Member Statesâ internal educational matters.
If there is one area in which the subsidiarity principle should apply in full, it is education policy.
Secondly, this proposal accomplishes the precise opposite of what is officially intended.
It is important that immigrants should learn the host countryâs language.
If they are unfamiliar with the language of their country of origin, or are no longer at home with it, that should not be an obstacle in the host country.
This proposal will only promote the formation of ghettos.
It is also absurd that our children should learn Arabic, for example.
It is the world on its head.
Equally far-fetched is the paragraph in the explanatory statement that states that immigrant parents should be encouraged to choose the language of origin in preference to European languages that they could use in their careers.
This is an example of multi-cultural ideology prevailing over reality.
One really has to be a Communist to dream up something as Utopian as this.
Â Â  . Integration policy is more than a policy of tolerance.
Integration is something proactive and inclusive; it facilitates communication, places value on difference and is based on equality in dignity.
Tolerance is merely a matter of acknowledging others and accepting them for what they are.
Kant rejected this notion of tolerance, which in fact does not allow for the perspective of putting ourselves in other peopleâs shoes, which is the perspective of justice.
Perceived as âappealing and virtuousâ, Europe is a haven of values, a crossroads of an identity based on cosmopolitan law and national identities based on strong traditions that recognise that law.
Pluralism is its defining characteristic, not a potential factor in its downfall.
This is why Europe offers the ideal political framework for cultural diversity.
There should be a human response to the causes of immigration.
Let us take the issue of language, for example.
The teaching of language is the most basic prerequisite of human communication, of citizenship and of the awareness and exercise of rights.
Without such communication, Europeâs plan for civilisation will have failed.
In other words, it will be little more than a system of open doors through which people never pass.
Â Â  . â As far as Mr Portas is concerned, immigration is an end in itself, regardless of whether or not there is any economic or social justification for it.
There is a quasi-religious belief in the infinite benefits of immigration.
This is the only possible explanation for his recommendation not only that we provide immigrant communities â and those born into such communities, up to the third generation at least â with teaching in their languages and cultures of origin, but also that this teaching be extended to indigenous communities, as part of a great multicultural melting pot, the aim being to create, and I quote, âa common cosmopolitan heritageâ.
What Mr Portas is proposing is tantamount to engineering the integration of immigrants by bringing about the disintegration of the host society and removing the culture of both the European and the immigrant communities.
By refusing to impose their values, their rules, their languages and their culture on their own lands, European countries have for decades been contributing to the communitarisation of society, thereby sowing the seeds of the kind of inter-ethnic and inter-cultural confrontation that has been seen in a number of countries.
At a time when the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila are being bombarded by thousands of would-be migrants and when migratory pressure is intensifying, even though our countries are already bursting at the seams, this report is not just absurd; it is an attack on our identity.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain from voting in the final vote on this report.
This issue is an extremely important one â so important that political responsibility for it must remain at one or other level within the Member States.
It is the Member States that have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education and for the content of education systems.
This particularly applies to the integration of immigrants and to the organisation both of mother-tongue teaching and of teaching in the languages of the immigrantsâ new countries.
Â Â  . When it comes to immigration, the key word is integration; the shared desire to integrate and the shared ability to integrate.
What the rapporteur is telling us is of great importance, but some priorities must be set out.
I understand and share the rapporteurâs concerns, but I feel compelled to focus my attention on this idea of the ability to integrate, which entails strict controls on who enters a country and who stays.
The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, and most importantly, because the rewards for breaking the law act as an incentive for illegal immigration and for the networks profiting from it; and secondly, because illegal immigration itself overstretches our ability to integrate.
Nevertheless, on the issue of education, the active integration of immigrants and their children is of immediate concern.
The arrival of new, different cultures is a positive phenomenon, but this must not stop us from wanting those who arrive to integrate, and integration means accepting the host culture.
It is clear that schools are excellent places in which to do this.
It is also clear that the more symbiotic this relationship, the better.
Let us not lose sight, however, of the starting point of the relationship.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Pack report on new challenges for the circus as part of European culture. I did so for the following reasons:
Firstly, the report highlights the cultural nature of circus activities. It plays an important role in art and culture in many countries, including Portugal.
In this context, the Commission should draw up measures aimed at protecting the circus, in order to help ensure that it is recognised as part of European culture.
Â Â  This report contains quite a few proposals that we absolutely cannot support.
The issue is that of why the European Parliament should call on the Member States and the Commission to recognise the circus as a part of European culture.
The report also contains proposals to the effect that service points should be set up and information campaigns carried out, all designed to make life easier for circus companies.
The report raises the issue of education for circus children.
Freedom of movement and access to education are significant issues.
All these matters must, however, be resolved in larger contexts than a report like this, taking in a wider range of sectors.
Â Â  . I welcome the report concerning the new challenges for the circus as part of European culture.
It is imperative that an adequate and non discriminatory education is provided to all children of travelling communities regardless of the Member State in which they temporarily reside.
It is of equal importance that the welfare and mobility rights of circus workers are protected through the use of short-term residence permits.
However, it is a source of deep concern that the report includes the presentation of animals as I strongly oppose the use of animals in the circus.
It is now both the Commission and the Member States' responsibility to reflect on the point in question.
Â Â  . â MrsÂ Packâs excellent report finally addresses a cultural issue that is all too often seen as a minor art form, whereas in fact it is art in its purest form, as it mixes dream, travel, childhood, body patterns, music, tragedy and poetry in a blend of courage and sensitivity.
The time has come for the political world, which likes to see itself as an arena of untamed beasts, to address the issue of the tamersâ circus; not least because - from the great names like Bouglione to the more humble ones, like those in âLa Stradaâ - circuses forge ties between generations and communities.
The circus is a cultural river flowing across countries and crossing the borders of time, space and age.
Consequently, Mrs Pack has turned her report into a political festival, a short-lived festival perhaps, but one that will live long in Parliamentâs memory.
Â Â  . The circus, with all the fantasy that it conjures up, is worthy of enormous respect and, if I may say so, affection.
Some of the points raised by the rapporteur, not least those relating to labour, are highly pertinent.
That being said, I cannot help but question whether this is the kind of debate expected of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank my fellow Members who have stayed to listen to my explanation of vote on the report on the urban dimension.
I address the 20 million pensioners â former workers, hence pensioners â living in Italy, as well as the 150Â million pensioners who have worked in Europe and who live in all 25 Member States of the European Union.
I wish to reassure them of my intention to insist â through this explanation of vote â that the European Parliament call on the Member States to make travel on urban public transport completely free for pensioners, who deserve societyâs recognition for the work they have done.
In addition to giving up their seats, young people will be delighted to know that pensioners are being shown respect through the right to travel on public transport for free through our beautiful cities.
Â Â  The June List chooses to vote against this report because it is another example of how, through own-initiative reports, the European Parliament wishes to provide the EU with new areas of competence. According to the Treaty wording, the EU is not authorised to conduct a specific policy for towns, despite which MrÂ Beaupuy believes that the European Parliament must stand up for an urban policy at EU level.
The report is a typical example of the way in which, through new âmodelsâ, âtoolsâ, âdialoguesâ, âworking partiesâ, various aid programmes and, as time goes on, new institutions, the EU gives rise to bureaucracy and supranationalism.
Â Â  . The urban dimension should figure in regional development policy.
The existence of small and medium-sized towns in interior, outlying and rural areas boosts development in these areas and helps to offset disparities between areas and combat the effects of agglomeration that the large urban centres have on the interior of a country.
Whereas towns and cities are capable of stimulating development, they also bring a range of complex problems, such as congestion, accommodation requirements, pollution and social exclusion, owing to the economic, social and regional planning policies currently pursued.
In this context, a policy of urban renewal and regeneration is vital.
In this field, properly resourced cohesion policy can contribute with a Community initiative, as in the case of URBAN concept, with adequate financial resources.
We might look into additional Community aid, for example, to support the building of affordable housing.
Unfortunately, this is not happening.
Making the urban dimension an across-the-board policy in a context of budget savings might pit objectives in competition with one another and this may jeopardise support for the least favoured regions.
In spite of this, and our objections to the ârole of towns and citiesâ and the so-called âurban dimensionâ being beholden to the neoliberal Lisbon agenda, we lend our overall backing to the report.
Â Â  . The issue of towns and cities does not fall under the Unionâs powers.
Like so many other issues, however, such as tourism, it has been affected, directly or indirectly, by a succession of measures arising from Community policy.
On a practical level, the urban issue is treated on the basis of the precautionary principle within regional policy, within the framework of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
I feel that the Unionâs measures should play a complementary role, so that the measures taken by the Member States can be developed in full for the benefit of the citizens.
Investment must, therefore, be made in programmes that have contributed towards a balanced relationship between the various levels of decision-making.
Given that the differences between rural and urban areas are particularly marked in the ten new Member States, it is crucial that the urban networks of the 10 new Member States be integrated into the urban system throughout Community territory.
One way to achieve this is to improve transport networks connecting the cities with their regions, and inter-city transport networks.
This will contribute towards progress and development in the EU.
I therefore voted in favour of the Beaupuy report.
Â Â  We voted in favour of Amendments 1, 3 and 5.
We are well disposed towards a guaranteed reasonable standard of living.
We are, however, opposed to introducing state-regulated minimum wages.
We interpret the concept of âguaranteed incomeâ, which appears in the above-mentioned amendments, as signifying not a certain guaranteed minimum wage but, rather, a guaranteed reasonable standard of living.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report because it included some of our proposals, which improved upon the original text in the vote in plenary.
Of our proposals that were adopted, I should like to highlight the following:
- calls for the promotion of access to high quality jobs, with, first and foremost, a decent wage, as a means of preventing and combating poverty;
- points out, at the same time, that part-time work and low-quality jobs, which mainly affect women, are a factor in the increased rates of women among poor workers, which is a factor in social exclusion.
Some of its worst aspects, however, were removed.
Consequently, although it is only partially satisfactory, failing, as it does, to address the causes of poverty in sufficient depth and to propose measures needed to put an end to it, the final resolution succeeds in raising awareness of the serious social problems that particularly affect women.
Â Â  The resolution on women and poverty in the EU contains quite a few demands to which it is important to attend, including equal access to health care and medical treatment for women and men and the combating of violence against women.
It should be emphasised that these are the Member Statesâ areas of responsibility.
We do not support the proposal for a âminimum guaranteed incomeâ.
According to the Swedish labour market model, wages are established through negotiations between unions and employers and not through legislation.
Moreover, establishing a minimum wage could lead to wage reductions within many low-paid groups, something that is mainly in danger of affecting women.
In the light of the above, we choose to abstain from voting in the final vote on the resolution.
Â Â  . 51% of the EUâs population is at risk of poverty, for they are female.
One reason for this is certainly our inability, despite our many good intentions, to make much of an improvement to equal opportunities for women in the workplace.
The members of the âweaker sexâ continue to earn, on average, between 20% and 30% less for the same work, and their chances of making a career are minimal.
Another reason is, without a doubt, that they spend more time on bringing up children, running households and social work, so that they do not have the time to go into full-time employment â even on the assumption that the opportunity to do so is available to them.
In practice, then, women often work only part-time, and consequently have only small old-age pensions to look forward to.
The result of McJobs or 1-Euro-jobs or call them what you will remains the same: even two or three such jobs are not enough to feed a family.
More generous family allowances alone will not solve this problem; on the contrary, what is needed is a comprehensive programme with good opportunities for training and earning, equal pay, more flexible childcare options and better provision for old age â a phase of life in which single women, whether with or without children, are particularly at risk of poverty.
We must, overall, give more attention to pro-birth family policy and be more generous in funding it, in order to offer women better opportunities for earning a living and providing for themselves, so that they do not end up collectively opting not to have children, with the consequence that our European population slowly dies out.
Â Â  . The issue of combating poverty and social exclusion in the EU has been discussed at great length in the EU, both in terms of the Millennium Goals, and, especially, in terms of the objectives inherent in Europeâs ideals.
This report is the new Europeâs first dealing specifically with poverty among women.
Why women?
There is alarming data showing that women are at great risk of falling into extreme poverty and various kinds of exclusion.
This is why Parliament deemed it important to look into the phenomenon and to propose the development of indicators and a methodology that may make a major contribution towards effectively combating the problem, by means of partnerships with the poorest women and especially through measures aimed at ensuring that our societies help to reconcile family life and working life in situations of extreme poverty.
We can help to combat poverty, a phenomenon that must be seen today as a violation of human rights and as a situation that must be tackled as a matter of urgency.
I therefore voted in favour of the ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ report.
Â Â  The Minutes of this part-session will be put before the House at the beginning of the next.
In the absence of any objections to them, I will forward the adopted text to the intended recipients.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament to be suspended.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 13 October 2005.
Â Â  Before going on to talk to you as usual about the events that have taken place between two part-sessions, I must remind you that today is the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.
On this occasion, the European Parliament must consider what these years have taught us in terms of cooperation and dialogue and multilateral political action.
The message of the Secretary-General has been distributed in full to all of the Members of the European Parliament.
In that message, Kofi Annan reminds us in no uncertain terms that the United Nations must reflect the times and, as such, should adapt to the developments that have taken place in the world since 1945.
I would also like to remind you that last September a meeting took place in New York of Heads of State or Government to draw up an inventory of reforms and to set concrete commitments with a view to their implementation.
This Summit did not satisfy all of our expectations in this regard.
We cannot say that the Resolution on it approved by the European Parliament has been taken fully into account.
For this very reason, we must monitor the way this reform process progresses very closely.
During our last plenary session we approved a third Resolution on the results of the September Summit and I would like to take advantage of this anniversary to express once again our determination that reforms such as the creation of a Human Rights Council or the Peace Consolidation Committee should become realities before the end of the 60th session of the General Assembly.
On this date the European Parliament reiterates its support for the actions of the United Nations and for the fundamental principles that govern it.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to inform you of the death on 15 October of the former Member of the European Parliament, Matti Wuori.
Matti Wuori was a Member of our Parliament during the last term in office, he belonged to the Group of the Greens and was rapporteur on human rights.
Parliament is remembering this fellow Member today.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the October II part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 20 October pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate on the Commission Statement on patents for biotechnological inventions not be concluded with a resolution, contrary to what was originally approved by the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Schulz has the floor to explain his Groupâs request.
Â Â  Mr President, it is indeed the case that our group had made a request to the Conference of Presidents that the debate on the Commission statement on patents for biotechnological inventions should go ahead, but that there should be no resolution.
If we include today in the reckoning, there will be 48 hours between the debate and the adoption, and we do not believe that it is possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a common position on one of the most important and controversial issues in European political debate.
I do not think we can be seriously expected to do that.
We do believe that it makes sense to debate this now, but, when dealing with an area as problematic as this one, Parliament should be allowed more time to make a statement.
We therefore ask that the debate should be allowed to go ahead, but without motions for resolutions being tabled, and that the order of business be amended accordingly.
Debate without resolution!
Â Â  Mr Liese has the floor to speak against.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to oppose the motion from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and argue in favour of a resolution.
The problem is that there are deadlines to be met in considering this issue.
If we do not come up with a position on this matter in October, the decision will be taken elsewhere; the European Patent Office is, for example, considering a controversial patent, and there are contradictory interpretations of the directive that this House adopted on the patenting of human genes or of human body parts.
If the House does not express its mind, the political message we will be sending is that we are not capable of making a contribution to the debate on this issue, even though it was this House that adopted the directive.
I therefore ask that Mr Schulzâs motion be rejected.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of this House the findings of a visit I made to Romania to look in particular at the situation of babies and young adults with handicaps in institutional care.
This is an area where the European Union could perhaps be doing more to push the Romanian authorities to increase the pace of reform.
For example, last year 4600Â babies were abandoned in maternity hospitals.
Some were reunited with their families but many remain there.
I lifted up a little boy of 18Â months who had never been outside a maternity hospital.
This is not something we want to see.
We need emergency fostering in Romania and we need the European Union to push for that.
In relation to the institutional care of adults with handicaps, I visited an institution where 450Â people were living in awful conditions, unacceptable to us here in the European Union.
Some progress is being made but more could be done if we put greater pressure on the Romanian authorities.
I would ask that we all do that.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to protest in the strongest terms at the way in which the Spanish Civil Guard treated a group of Portuguese people in Spain.
On 15Â October, 16 busloads of people went to Salamanca to demonstrate their solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela, on the occasion of the Ibero-American Summit taking place there.
In spite of the cooperative behaviour of the hundreds of Portuguese people in the group, the Civil Guard used every trick in the book to delay the busesâ arrival in Salamanca, in an attempt to stop these hundreds of Portuguese people from taking part in the demonstration and displaying their solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela.
This was an unacceptable act of political discrimination, as the only buses told to stop were those in this convoy, and all of the participantsâ personal information was taken on a number of occasions.
Â Â  Mr President, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed less than 18Â months ago by all the Heads of State and Government.
That Treaty retained the principle of a common agricultural policy agreed in 1957, including the article which states that EU policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture.
Yet, within two years, Commissioner Mandelson seems to be prepared to sacrifice the European model of agriculture in order to hammer out a deal at the WTO, by forcing farmers to bear a disproportionate share of the burden.
At the same time we have Mr Barroso offering deals which undermine pledges given to farmers in the context of CAP reform, in order to move Prime Minister Blair on the budget.
The EU demands traceability, cross-compliance and food security from its farmers, and rightly so, but in return it is threatening to break its promises, causing huge uncertainty in the agricultural community, and it is proposing to sell out its primary food producers for a quick-fix deal.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express the shame I feel as a Member of the European Parliament as a result of Mr Barroso having recently appointed three people even more reactionary than Mr Buttiglione to occupy the Commissionâs vacant positions in the European Group on Ethics and New Technologies.
I believe that this retrograde step is not just shameful in terms of its result, but also in view of the way the result has been achieved: since April, Mr Barroso has been consulting the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs â which is competent in this area and to which I belong â entirely avoiding any debate and, furthermore, failing to comply with the applicable rules.
Furthermore, it should be stressed that many other Members, including Presidents of this Parliament, have expressed their opposition in this regard.
Appointing people who are even worse than Buttiglione for such a delicate matter, in which such good work is being done, will destroy the momentum and work against progress.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make just two short points concerning the avian flu situation.
Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, has stressed that, to prevent a pandemic of human infection, the global response to the bird flu epidemic must be intensified.
The United States has ordered approximately 100 million dollarsâ worth of vaccine.
The United Nations, by contrast, has a total budget of around USDÂ 7 million to control animal outbreaks of avian flu, but requires USDÂ 175 million for an effective programme.
My second point is that, in addition to the evident problem of slow manufacturing processes, it appears unlikely that there will be enough flu shots available for all those who might need them.
However, it might be possible to contain an H5N1 outbreak at its source, if the surrounding population were immediately vaccinated.
I would like to raise the question of whether we in the European Union would be prepared to share the vaccines we already have in our possession with regions where an outbreak occurs, in an effort to contain it.
It should not just be a matter of having vaccines in case it affects our own citizens: if there is an outbreak, we should target it wherever it occurs and try to ensure that it does not spread.
Â Â  Mr President, the issue of the European border with Russia is not peripheral or marginal; on the contrary, it is absolutely fundamental.
Estonia is a full Member of the EU.
This concerns the Unionâs external border.
What is at stake today, an alternative to our values, i.e. the Commissionâs appeasement of Russia or the reliability of the EU for the new members.
The danger that the EU could lose reliability was noticed at the London Summit, where the Russian-Estonian border issue, which is the subject of the commitments between Russia and the EU, became marginalised.
The two governments were suggested to sort the problem out and the Commission would stand aside and wash its hands of the matter.
Among these two was one big government and one small.
The big and angry one dared to ask the Commission to take Russiaâs side and bring smaller new Member States to order.
They became disobedient to Russia, and that was bad.
This was precisely the position expressed recently by the Russian Ambassador, MrÂ Chizhov, in Brussels.
Our Parliament, as a more independent and conscious body, should debate this matter and issue a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to reports in the French newspapers and , the human rights situation in Cuba is going from bad to worse.
Marxism is becoming more barbaric the more the Marxist tyrant who introduced it is aware of his approaching end.
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate my point: the journalist Mario Henrique Mayo, who in 2003 was sentenced to 20 yearsâ imprisonment, has made two suicide attempts after having used a razor blade to etch the words âinnocentâ and âfreedomâ on his own body.
On 4 October, the journalist Victor Arroyo who, for expressing an opinion that constituted an offence, was sentenced to 26 years in jail, ended his hunger strike at Cardinal Ortegaâs request after having ended up in a delirium.
For 100 other political prisoners, there is not a single prospect of liberation; quite the opposite is the case.
The moderate opponent Manuel Cuesta Morua has been beaten up by a collection of regime supporters and has been at the receiving end of extreme racist abuse.
I hope that this House will present a united front in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba.
It will send out a better message than that of a future European Commissioner who once, while smoking a Havana cigar, accepted a ride on a Harley Davidson with Fidel Castro, but has never breathed a word about it.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the threat of an avian influenza pandemic has plunged Europe and the world into a state of hysteria.
While I was in Brussels, I made inquiries into the situation in what may be Europeâs future capital.
It would appear that Tamiflu, which is the only antiviral drug effective against avian influenza and which is produced by the Swiss-based Roche, is not sold in pharmacies in Brussels, or in other words in Europeâs capital.
The pharmaceutical companies are making hundreds of millions of euro by whipping the public into a frenzy.
We are voicing our opinions on all the key European and global issues and other matters besides, but we are unable to provide minimum standards for our own citizens, even those living in the EUâs capital.
MrÂ President, it is my belief that the European Commission should take decisive steps to deal with this matter.
If it fails to do so, we will either be made to look like fools or face the risk of a potentially tragic pandemic.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a very good Sunday newspaper in Britain called .
Yesterday's edition was of particular interest.
It reports that British economic growth forecasts for 2005 and 2006 are being revised downwards.
A survey from Morgan Stanley reveals that Europe's largest companies are planning to make 40% of their investments outside the European Union.
The reason for this is obvious.
It is the brake on enterprise and business exerted by the ever-growing bonds of regulation and red tape from the European Union.
A report from Open Europe and Oxford Economic Forecasting shows that the United Kingdom could increase its gross domestic product by 1.4% if it traded freely with the rest of the world, while maintaining a free trade agreement with the European Union.
In other words, leave the European Union, but trade freely with Europe and the world.
That, of course, is the policy of the United Kingdom Independence Party.
Common sense may eventually prevail.
Â Â  Mr President, Ireland is the only country in Europe in which driftnet fishing of wild Atlantic salmon is allowed.
What is happening is an absolute scandal.
Wild Atlantic breeding stock salmon are being intercepted by driftnet fishermen as the salmon try to make their way to their natural habitat rivers.
This applies not only to Irish rivers, but also to British, French, Spanish and Scandinavian rivers.
As a result, the wild Atlantic salmon numbers have decreased dramatically.
It is crystal clear that the species is under threat of extinction unless decisive action is taken.
Unfortunately, the Irish Minister for the Marine and the Irish Government have chosen to ignore all the scientific evidence and continue to allow the scandal of driftnet fishing to continue.
There are only 877Â driftnet fishermen in Ireland.
The Irish Government should compensate them by buying back or extinguishing their licences.
The Commissionâs DG Fisheries should insist that Ireland should do so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, recently, the President of the French Republic was attributing to Europe responsibilities which, legally speaking, it does not have, given that the matter in hand related to redundancies on French soil.
We have firmly condemned a form of political irresponsibility.
More recently, the Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs at the Commission, MrÂ Klaus Regling, was claiming that the European Union should set itself the objective of reducing wages by 3.7% in order to gain 1% in growth.
That statement, which is just as grotesque as the first example, must be condemned just as vigorously.
The Commission would be better off making innovative proposals in order to boost consumption. Instead, it is choosing to go beyond its role of making proposals by truly entering into the realms of provocation.
The code of ethics of European responsibility requires the Heads of State or Government to be clear about who does what, but it also requires the European Commission â and this is, indeed, the most basic requirement â to take its work seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, a revolution broke out in Hungary on 23 October 1956.
The message of the revolution for posterity is threefold.
The events of 1956 were profoundly democratic.
The revolution involved the political participation of the entire society, it guaranteed equal human dignity for all, and proclaimed that suppressive dictatorial regimes cannot survive.
On the other hand, it attempted to lay the foundations of a completely new political system.
Thirdly, the revolution also had a message for Europe.
It entered on the agenda of Europe the possibility of liquidating Communist tyranny.
We, the Hungarian delegation of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, declare the period up to the end of 2006 a Hungarian season, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great Hungarian revolution.
Â Â  Mr President, poverty is silent.
The silence of the poor can only be converted into a cry for help by those who have the necessary power and political influence.
The sights are crying out, as well.
The sight of hungry children on the street, of shabbily clothed elderly people and of those who sleep in the streets.
The soundless wailing breaks the silence of St Michaelâs church in Ghent, at the exhibition behind the altar.
More than sixty-eight million people live under the poverty line in the Europe of the Twenty-five.
However, the poverty in various Member States is not comparable.
There is a wide gap between old and new Member States.
The past and further extension of the EU makes this a particularly opportune time for the informal summit to also address the European social model.
I agree that the most powerful weapon against poverty is the provision of more and better jobs.
In a world of working adults the children would not inherit the damnation of poverty â they would inherit chances, and the elderly would be able to live in safety.
However, this cannot be achieved without community expenditure.
We, the Socialists, hope that the summit taking place this week will hear and amplify the voice of the poor.
Â Â  â Mr President, one of Europe's leading journalists wrote a few days ago that we are opening the gates to barbarity.
Obviously he is right.
He describes events in Turkey and the violence against intellectuals, journalists and so on.
Just the other day, during the visit of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Turkey stopped the Greek MEP, Mr Varvitsiotis, from entering and held him hostage for three hours, refusing to recognise the passport which you have given us.
Today, however, I shall speak of a different type of violence; the violence against Archbishop Okhrid, the Archbishop of FYROM.
He has been imprisoned, his cassock has been taken away, his Bible has been taken away and he is prohibited from taking communion.
We did not witness such barbarity even in the darkest Middle Ages.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to send a mission to inspect the conditions under which the Archbishop is being held.
FYROM, or whatever else it wants to call itself, cannot ask to enter here, in the European family, while its Archbishop is in prison.
This has never happened before.
I should therefore like, if we really want to talk about justice and human rights, for us to show that we respect human rights, for us to send a mission to examine this barbarity on the part of the country which is just a short way away from Brussels.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Luxembourg, a founding Member State of the European Union, has never claimed the status of official EU language for its mother tongue, Luxemburgish.
With the most recent enlargement, the number of official languages has increased.
The Council of Ministers has just granted the status of official language to Irish, bringing to 21 the total number of official and working languages.
In its conclusions of June 2005, the Council also gave its verdict on languages â I quote â whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law.
With Luxemburgish having been our national language since 1984, I believe that the Council conclusions apply in this instance.
However, Luxemburgish deserves to be given more recognition, because many people are not aware of the fact that we have our own language, in defence of which we suffered fierce repression during the Nazi occupation.
I will be asking the European Parliamentâs legal service to ascertain how this veiled recognition for the Luxemburgish language could be made public and visible in Community texts.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Lithuania has been a member of the European Union since 2004, which means that it should comply with the legal obligations arising under Community legislation.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
One of the fundamental rights of every human being is the right to property and the right to inherit property, in particular land.
The extent to which a country recognises this right is an indication of its level of democracy.
After 1939, private property, and in particular land, was confiscated in Lithuania in line with Soviet law.
After the country gained independence, the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled that all vacant and undeveloped land was to be returned in kind to the rightful owners or their heirs.
Unfortunately, the Lithuanian executive and autonomous local authorities pay little attention to the sacred right to property.
In defiance of court rulings, they have failed to return land that was seized many years ago.
This primarily affects Poles living in Lithuania, who constitute a sizeable national minority.
By acting in this way, Lithuania is not only violating the right to property, but also discriminating against national minorities, in this case the Polish minority.
It is time that the relevant parliamentary committees looked into this matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, Members will know â and have been very concerned recently â that nine blind passengers were thrown off a Ryanair flight because the captain said that the limit to the number of disabled people was four per flight. Yet every major airline in the European Union has a completely different policy.
This has made life for disabled passengers unbearable.
Campaigners in my constituency have also spoken about access to goods and services; the fact that in each Member State, including in western Europe, the treatment is completely different for the owners of guide dogs, for example.
While a lot of good work has been done in this place, we should be aware that these concerns are bubbling under the surface.
Recent press stories have revealed many thousands of people involved in NGOs who want to see us do better.
Finally, closer to home, we must ensure that we have inclusive design for our new Parliament buildings.
Much good work has been done in this area, but we must emphasise it because it will come back to haunt us if we do not get it right.
I hope we will.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the problems faced by the rendering industry in the United Kingdom as a result of European Union legislation setting standards for incineration plants in the United Kingdom, namely the Waste Incineration Directive, which is now due to be implemented by the end of this year.
I was totally amazed last week when I learned that only three of the 25 Member States are, in fact, going to implement the Directive as originally intended.
The tallow that is being designated as a waste in these three Member States will not be considered a waste in the other Member States.
I think this is wrong, it totally runs against the Lisbon Agenda and it is the type of thing we do badly in Europe.
If we make a directive, and if we include a particular substance within a directive, then that directive should be implemented in all 25 Member States in the same way, together and simultaneously.
There should not be different interpretations in different Member States.
It is not enough to blame national governments.
The blame starts here because we should not allow it to happen in the first place.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the European Commission has published a report revealing the extent of mental health problems, which affect 27% of EU citizens.
The associated loss of productivity, together with increased health care costs, amount to around 4% of GDP.
From a medical point of view, eradicating a disease involves both effective treatment and tackling the causes of the disease.
In the case of neuroses and depression, the causes include both the stress induced by a relentless quest for money and the destructive liberalism currently practiced, which promotes a market that is free only in the case of monopolies and that deprives millions of people of jobs, a livelihood and an education.
The main reason why people suffer from affective disorders, however, is because they lead a life without principles and without God.
Such a life precludes personal growth, and makes life hell for the 60Â 000Â people who commit suicide each year and for the countless masses of addicts dying by degrees.
This is why it is pointless to pour billions of euro into preventive programmes unless the aim of such programmes is to safeguard genuine human dignity, the right to security in social and medical terms and growth within a healthy and loving family that lives by moral principles.
Â Â  Mr President, you reminded us that today is United Nations Day and that upholding human rights is a top priority.
Recently, the British Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, current President of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, said there can be no negotiation about the re-creation of the caliphate; no negotiation about the imposition of Sharia law; no negotiation about the suppression of equality between the sexes or about the ending of free speech.
He said that these values are fundamental to our civilisation and are simply not up for negotiation.
This raises the question of why, in Iraq, the British and Americans have encouraged the adoption of a constitution which enshrines Sharia law and will severely curb the freedom of many women.
We welcome the fact that over 70 women have been elected to the parliament in Afghanistan.
However, the editor of a womenâs rights magazine â a male editor, by the way â has been jailed for anti-Islamic articles.
In both countries women face harassment, violent attacks, death threats and murder because they are women.
So I hope that this Parliament will hold governments like Britainâs to their promises on sex equality, on free speech and on avoiding the imposition of Sharia law in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a few weeks ago, nine blind passengers, having taken their seats in London on a Ryanair aeroplane bound for Italy, were requested to take subsequent flights as there were already four disabled people checked in for the flight. Although the airline cites in its defence security considerations in the event of an emergency evacuation, it seems unacceptable to me to trivialise discriminatory practices of this kind.
Among the founding values of the European Union is one in which we must take particular pride, and that is solidarity towards the weakest.
Increased attention is being paid to disabled people and to their ability to access public buildings and services.
It is therefore shocking that a European airline should hide behind the argument of security considerations in order to discriminate against blind passengers.
The truth of the matter is that the excessive emphasis on keeping flight costs low no longer allows for special attention to be paid to passengers needing help: there are no staff to look after them.
Profitability is the only goal in mind, regardless of any human feeling.
That runs counter to humanitarian values, of which Europe can be proud.
I wanted publicly to denounce this matter in this House.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the problem of inactivating pesticides, whether in Europe or in the rest of the world, has become less and less of a priority in recent years.
International organisations active in this field are sounding the alarm bells, since the ecological time bombs that are ticking as a result of the improper storage of chemical waste represent an increasing threat.
It is estimated that only somewhat more than 25Â 000Â tonnes of pesticides are stockpiled in the eight Central European countries that joined the European Union in 2004.
In the states of the former Soviet Union, however, or in other words our close and distant neighbours to the east and south, over 200Â 000Â tonnes of obsolete and unprotected chemicals may be stockpiled, which are dispersed by the wind and washed away by rainwater.
This means that no corner of the globe is safe from the threat.
I would therefore call on Parliament to turn its attention to this issue, which is one that has been neglected to date.
A detailed plan of action should be drawn up without delay, aimed at the stocktaking, identification and destruction of all stockpiles of obsolete pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.
Â Â  â I would like briefly to return to the subject of Croatia, which finally received a green light on 4 October, in the form of the positive decision to launch accession negotiations.
With this decision, the European Union has highlighted the strategic importance of Croatia and its positive influence on the democratisation of the entire Balkans region.
Agreement on this point was reached also by the representatives of fifteen Central and Eastern European countries at the 12th annual summit of Central and Eastern European heads of state, held in Zagreb on 14-15 October.
The presidents expressed support for Croatia and agreed that the enlargement of the European Union must not be brought to a halt.
Slovakia will be providing very active support to Croatia to help the country catch up with Romania and Bulgaria, which have now been conducting accession negotiations for several years.
Slovakia will share with Croatia its experience from the pre-accession process during which it succeeded in catching up with the other accession countries, and achieved an excellent result.
Only through an active approach to the struggle for peace in the Balkans can Europe achieve stability and security.
Security in the Balkans means security in Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to call for measures to be taken in connection with the unjust witch-hunt conducted by the Danish media against Polish exporters of agricultural products to Denmark.
Unsubstantiated accusations have been made public regarding the sale to Denmark of raspberries that were allegedly rotten and infected with a rare virus that causes food poisoning.
The Danish media have set themselves up in judgment on the matter, claiming that five people have died and nearly one thousand have suffered food poisoning as a result of eating desserts containing raspberries.
These accusations are quite clearly absurd, as proved by the fact that raspberries grown by the same companies were exported to Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Sweden, Russia and the USA, without any cases of food poisoning being reported in these countries.
What is more, detailed checks carried out in the companies at the centre of the accusations have revealed that raspberries are grown there under model conditions.
The Polish authorities suggested to the Danes that trade should be suspended if the raspberries were in fact found to cause food poisoning, but there has been no response from the Danish authorities.
I fail to understand the tacit public consent of the latter.
To date the authorities have taken no action whatsoever on this matter, and they have also failed to deny the false allegations.
Â Â  Mr President, in the course of the 20th century, Hungary wrote world history on two occasions, and played a role in world history twice. First in 1956, and then in 1989-90, when the country released the German refugees in the Central European transition period.
The 1956 revolution was followed in Poland by the Solidarity movement and in 1968 by the Prague Spring.
1956 marked a Hungarian uprising against Soviet occupation, a fight for freedom, a fight for national independence, and at the same time a fight against Communist dictatorship.
Without the 1956 revolution there would not have been a negotiated revolution in 1989 or a peaceful regime change in Hungary, and Hungary would not be a member of the EU today.
In the words of Albert Camus: âHungary conquered and in chains has done more for freedom and justice than any other people in the world in the past twenty years.â
Â Â  â Mr President, last week formations of Turkish fighter planes repeatedly and provocatively violated Cypriot airspace.
At the same time, the Turkish army occupying Northern Cyprus has continued to strengthen its foothold on the island by increasing and enhancing its forces with more sophisticated American-made heavy weaponry.
These grossly illegal actions are causing much concern to the civilian population, risk causing a dangerous confrontation with Cyprusâ defences and are seriously undermining efforts to achieve long-lasting peace in the region.
Will the President of this Parliament have the determination to send a strong message to the Ankara Government, telling it in no uncertain terms to stop violating the integrity of an EU Member State and start making an effort to behave like a civilised nation at last?
Or, should we all just accept and resign ourselves to what many ordinary people in the street think, namely that the EU is just a big business, making more money for the big Member States, and does not give tuppence about the safety and wellbeing of the smaller Member States?
Â Â  Mr President, at the last part-session our Parliament expressed its solidarity with the victims of the terrible earthquake that shook Pakistan and of the floods in Central America.
This weekend, Hurricane Wilma, the most devastating Mexico has ever seen, struck that country leaving chaos, destruction and death in its wake.
Mr President, I have spoken with the Chairperson of the Delegation to this Parliamentâs EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, Mrs Erika Mann and, although she is going to speak officially about this, we have agreed that it would be appropriate for you, on behalf of our House, to express our solidarity to the Mexican authorities at this difficult time and also to ask the European Commission to consider â given that Mexico is a positive and active partner of the European Union â the possibility of contributing to the humanitarian aid tasks of reconstruction and rehabilitation that are needed in order to alleviate the effects of the floods in that country.
Â Â  My presentation is devoted to the activities and staffing of the European Parliamentâs information office in Bratislava, Slovakia.
In April 2004, the Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration announced open competitions for two posts, one in category A9 and the other in category A12.
Unbelievably, these two positions were reduced to just one in the course of the proceedings, and the only position that was ultimately granted was that of category A9 for the head of the Information Office.
In the meantime, the candidate for the category A12 position was successful.
Both the selection method and the irresponsible manner in which the D-G for Personnel announced the result deserve criticism.
Our candidate was notified of the result after a four-month delay.
The second problem is as follows: at this time, the information office has only three permanent members of staff and one temporary member of staff.
Why cannot the information office in Slovakia be staffed in the same way as in other Member States?
We urge that adequate conditions be created in Slovakia to better inform our citizens about the activities of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I wonder whether it would be appropriate at this time to congratulate Mr Lech KaczyÅski, the Polish Law and Justice Party and the Polish people on the election of President KaczyÅski in Poland on Sunday.
I also take the opportunity to congratulate our own colleague in this House, Mr MichaÅ Tomasz KamiÅski, who I believe played a major role in both the successful parliamentary campaign and the successful presidential campaign in Poland.
I urge you to pass our congratulations on to President KaczyÅski.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning (COM(2004)0474 C6-0095/2004 2004/0153(COD)] (A6â0267/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack; to the Committee on Culture and Education, and to all who contributed to this excellent report.
I would like to thank Mrs Pack in particular for the commitment and expertise she has brought to the report.
In the present political climate our policies need more than ever to be directly relevant to citizensâ real needs.
Education and training is where the benefits of European integration are directly felt by millions of citizens.
Therefore, I am very grateful also for Mr BÃ¶geâs report for the temporary committee on the financial perspective.
It is an important statement of support in a difficult financial context.
My thanks are due also to the rapporteurs of the other committees that contributed opinions on this Commission proposal.
Let me comment briefly on the amendments proposed in this report.
I am pleased to say that the Commission is able to accept, either word for word or in substance, 39 of the 79 amendments proposed by Parliament.
These changes improve the text, either by introducing new elements and priorities or by clarifying existing ones.
There are 16 amendments which, I regret, the Commission cannot accept because they either go beyond Community competence or are not compatible with the structure of the programme, four of which relate to the Parliamentâs resolution.
That leaves a further 20 amendments which raise some substantial issues on which I would like to comment.
Regarding amendments which derogate from the Financial Regulation or its implementing rules, four amendments to the annex to the decision â amendments 67, 68, 69 and 71 â would derogate from the existing implementing rules for the European Union budget.
They would introduce the sort of simplification identified as necessary by the Commission in its explanatory memorandum to the programme proposal, such as extending the use of lump sums or lump-sum grants, reducing the administrative requirements on applicants for small grants and so on. So we have no argument with the substance of these amendments.
However, the Commission believes that such provisions should initially be sought by revising the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules themselves.
Changing the Community financial framework in sectoral programmes makes this framework much harder to read and to understand. Therefore, the Commission believes it is too early to include such provisions in the decision on lifelong learning.
On the named institutions: the new programme will support the operating costs of some institutions which do high-quality work in education and training at European level and which are important partners for the European Union.
The prime criterion for their selection will be quality.
This means using calls for proposals where the grounds for selection are set out in advance and every applicant can measure itself against these criteria.
Exceptionally, the Commission has proposed four institutions as eligible for operating grant support without a call for proposals.
These four involve Member State governments in their governance and funding.
Government involvement guarantees an important degree of quality and of commitment to the objectives, purpose and future development of these designated institutions.
Looking at the six institutions Parliament proposes for nomination, the Commission concludes that the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, which has intergovernmental funding and governance arrangements, is consistent with the logic of our original proposal.
Therefore, we accept the amendment to this effect.
Briefly, on the budgetary amendments: a group of amendments relate to the budget of the programme.
I am most grateful, as I have said, for the rapporteurâs proposal to increase the budget to EURÂ 14Â 600Â million, and I can fully subscribe to her underlying reasons.
However, the Commission cannot, pending an agreement on the Financial Perspectives, amend its original proposal, so I must reserve the position on the 10 amendments concerned.
Finally, in order for the programme to start on time, the decision needs to be made and adopted as soon as possible in 2006.
I know this is a challenging timetable and depends very much on the timing of an agreement on the Financial Perspective, but I can assure you the Commission will do everything it can to help this Parliament and the Council reach agreement rapidly.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that the programme exists in its present form, having been influenced by all the experience we have had with the Socrates programme over the past ten years, and with the attempt having been made to avoid the old mistakes and go down new paths.
Even so, as there are, proverbially, many roads that lead to Rome, this House has included even more new approaches, and we should try to take a good look at all of them at least once.
Let me explain, for the sake of completeness, what sub-programmes we are dealing with here: the programme has to do, overall, with general and vocational education, and it is a good thing that vocational education is now included.
The programme enables everyone to take part in educational programmes virtually from the cradle to the grave.
The first programme open to all is âComeniusâ.
It is aimed at those who have to attend school in any case; to those for whom school attendance is mandatory, it gives the opportunity to discover at an early age what is meant by cultural differences, or a common approach, to particular issues in different countries.
Next comes the Erasmus programme, which gives these pupils the opportunity, once they have become students, to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them.
Running in parallel to that is the Leonardo programme, which enables apprentices and trainees to complete part of their training in the form of a work placement in another European country.
The fourth programme, âGrundtvigâ, deals with the education of adults, and the fifth, named after Jean Monnet, provides support.
This involves the celebrated institutions to which you referred, and to which we want to add two more.
I hope that Parliament will agree to this.
We do, however, want to continue to support the Jean Monnet chairs and all those things for which your programme already makes provision.
There are also the horizontal programmes in support of these activities, which overlap with the sectoral programmes that have already been mentioned, particularly in the development of material for language learning, learning and the dissemination of best practice in general and vocational education at national, regional and local level.
We have made further improvements to your proposals and have, in particular, emphasised that the Comenius partnerships should enable one pupil in fifteen, rather than one in twenty, to spend a school year abroad, which would add up to a total of 6 million pupils in junior secondary school having the possibility of spending a year as guest students at a school in another EU country.
Together with my fellow-members of the Committee for Culture and Education, I have also ensured that teachersâ European awareness can be enhanced through the new Comenius Regio programme.
We have also proposed that the Erasmus programmeâs mobility grant, which has remained unchanged since 1993, should be increased, for EURÂ 150 is an insufficient sum of money with which to go and live and study in another country, and makes support from parents, grandparents and relatives indispensable.
We should, however, be enabling all students to take part in an exchange of this kind, and so we suggest that the monthly grant should be increased by rather more than the Commission has suggested.
It is of course as important to me as it is to the Commission that there should be a decent reduction in the amount of red tape involved.
Administrative and financial constraints on the award and payment of grants must be commensurate with the amount paid out.
Let me briefly consider the issue of finance.
Only indicative figures have been given for the financial resources we are talking about today.
Nobody knows how much we will have at our disposal after 2007; that is why the figures â the Commissionâs, the BÃ¶ge Committeeâs and our own Committeeâs â are no more than indications.
We have to wait and see what we will get from the next Presidency of the Council, and so the Culture Committee has taken the liberty of going beyond the figures proposed by the Commission, and also a bit beyond those agreed by the BÃ¶ge Committee.
We should put down a marker; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process.
We need them, and in order to have them we need more money than the national governments in the European Union are prepared to make available.
Many thanks, Commissioner, for the work your staff have done!
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to discuss the report from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on behalf of which I drew up an opinion.
I argued that there should be a gradual opening-up of the various programmes to all of our neighbourhood policy countries.
It has been proposed that they should be opened up to a number of neighbourhood countries but, given the very good work these programmes have done in encouraging the strengthening of people-to-people contacts, a general consensus should be reached on opening up these programmes more widely, where this can be done effectively.
I am keen to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme will be continued under this heading post-2009, together with the inter-university programme set up last year, which aims to develop democracy and understanding between our various countries.
One of the obvious failings of the current proposals, in my view, was the almost complete lack of any reference to developing democratic citizenship.
Mention was made of citizenship, but I felt that there was a lack of emphasis on the democratic role.
Given that the Commission and the Council had already accepted that this was a necessity and had already agreed to set up the inter-university programme in Venice, this should be supported.
I am disappointed that there appears to be a dispute between two Commission DGs as to who should fund this programme in the future.
I hope that the problem can be resolved as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets gives a welcome to the Commissionâs proposed programme for lifelong learning, which encompasses the four great programmes â Erasmus, Comenius, Leonardo and Grundtvig â and it is founded upon the fundamental conviction that the value of these programmes in terms of structural change in Europe is not to be underestimated and that they play an essential part in European renewal.
In our opinion, we welcome the proposalâs intention to simplify administration and financial procedures, while criticising the fact that they are still too burdensome and too slow.
We have to point out that the budget figures are provisional, but the Committee on Budgets does take the view that the amounts proposed by the Commission for this vitally important priority area cannot be regarded as other than very modest.
Formal comment on what the Commission has proposed is one thing, but the vote, which is a political matter, will be far more to do with the need to move on in this area and achieve Europeâs vital educational policy goals.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I am the draftsman, is in favour of the Commissionâs initiative for the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and, in particular, of integrating higher vocational training into the Erasmus programme.
Bringing the two together in this way signals our desire not to single out students according to their field of study, be it academic and general, or vocational.
I congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Pack, on the quality of her report and thank her for having taken account of the greater part of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in particular as regards lifelong education and training, which together are acknowledged as being one of the keys to growth and as guaranteeing the quality of jobs.
Lifelong training should be a right and should be the specific responsibility of businesses, and these factors should be recognised at Community level as a fundamental social right.
Thanks to these programmes, a European space for training and education is gradually being created, and we have a great need of this space to support the labour market.
We need greater harmonisation and convergence of qualifications, and we need the skills of European employees to be guaranteed throughout the EU, and thus rewarded appropriately.
This seems to us to be an effective guarantee against social dumping.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties would also like to express its gratitude to the rapporteur who has been involved in the parliamentary works on this topic for years.
Our committee believes that the right to education is one of the most important fundamental human rights, and no one should be prevented from exercising this right by financial status, poverty or discrimination; also, we must continue to demand equal treatment.
Equal treatment for different generations, for the non-young, for women, and especially for single mothers, and in this respect we naturally expect an understanding attitude from employers, as well, who must treat life-long education as a strategic interest.
We expect that ethnic discrimination will come to an end and those living with disabilities will be able to participate in the education process with full rights.
For us this is a community programme that brings the EU closer to its citizens and the citizens closer to one another, which is the reason why we love this programme.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Pack not only on her excellent report, but also on her personal commitment to promoting the mobility of young Europeans.
The Erasmus programme owes a great deal to her tenacity, and the budget increase that she is calling for fully reflects her commitment.
Furthermore, I should like to remind you of the speech made by MrÂ Barroso in Berlin and of the speeches made by all of the group leaders within Parliament as part of the 70 cents for culture campaign, all of whom promised an increase in the âcultureâ budgets.
Three remarks need to be made on the subject of the reform as it is presented to us.
The internal market would be more competitive and businesses more mobile if young apprentices were better prepared for being mobile.
The protectionist instincts of many small-scale businesses would be thwarted by the practical experience that the Leonardo da Vinci programme gives to young people by allowing them to carry out work placements in other countries.
The budget estimate that has been made for 150Â 000 apprentices is insufficient.
The Erasmus programme is too elitist, as the sums allocated to the recipients are not enough to fund the total cost of their mobility.
The only people who are therefore eligible for this programme are students whose parents can pay the remaining sum, unless the Member States assume responsibility for doing so, which is not the case at present.
Finally, university students would be more mobile if the Council tackled the real problems, namely those relating to the transferability of grants, studentsâ status, their social security and the right to work, which are all issues that could be addressed, given that they were mentioned in the Commission Green Paper of 1996.
The Commissioner will perhaps be able to inform us as to how the work is progressing.
MrÂ President, culture is priceless, but it does come at a cost.
If we want to give Europe a soul, funding has to be granted.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supporting MrsÂ Packâs proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, we ought perhaps to rename the âlifelong learningâ programme âlearning throughout lifeâ, for âlifelongâ has the ring of punishment about it, and learning should, after all, be a joy.
Although this programme is an educational one whose components â Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig and so on â address different priorities, the one thing these all have in common is that they promote mobility, and enhance quality, giving recognition for achievement and education, for multilingualism and knowledge of other countries.
In so doing, they add value to Europe.
