It is a matter of how things stand now in Kosovo.
I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point.
Unless we know quite soon what is to happen next in Kosovo, the difficulties will simply accumulate down there.
The problem is that KFOR troops have become the targets of Serbian and Albanian attacks, although KFOR is actually there to protect both of these ethnic groups.
The problem, in a nutshell, is that Mr HÃŠkkerup will have to call elections very soon.
To do that, he must know what powers the elected bodies will have.
But we need these bodies so that the Serbian side has Kosovar negotiating partners.
Now we have the subject of southern Serbia.
I believe that KFOR, like other bodies, has not done all it should have done there.
Where have the weapons come from for these new extremists?
They have, of course, been transferred from the old KLA to the new KLA.
In my view, KFOR, with its 50 000-strong force in Kosovo, ought to be able to establish order in the Presevo Valley.
I appeal to KFOR to do so, lest we lose our credibility in that corner of the Balkans.
I also believe, of course, in the truth of what the Mayor of Presevo said in Belgrade, namely that the population of Kosovo would like to remain in Serbia if only the Albanians in the region could be treated at long last on a par with the Serbs.
They want to be part of everything that Yugoslav citizenship implies.
I believe the government' s new plan is good.
It is pursuing the right path, and we should support it.
To tell the truth, I am a little saddened that Mr KostunÃ­ca has said it will all happen without supervision by the EU.
Why should we not play a part?
We are good mediators.
We can help the Serbs and Albanians to live together in peace, and I hope we shall be allowed to help them.
Mr President, we intervened in Kosovo in order to protect the Albanians, who were a minority in Serbia.
We must now protect the Serbs, who are minority in Kosovo.
Moreover, we must say to the extremist Albanian insurgents that we are not, therefore, there to support the ideas of Albanian extremism. We are there to support peace and human rights, and we shall do what we can to prevent Albanian extremists from creating unrest in the new democratic Serbia.
I should like to assure Mr Dupuis that there were six of us from Parliament who spent the weekend visiting the new leaders in Belgrade.
We received assurances that that they would cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, set up a truth commission and grant amnesty to conscientious objectors etc. What we can do here in Parliament is to hold the new leaders to these promises and, if they do not live up to them, then there are things we can do, for we are, of course, the great aid provider, granting large amounts of money, now and in the years to come, to the new Serbia.
I want, finally, to say something which is almost a remark on the rules of procedure.
The purpose of these urgent topics we are now debating is, of course, to draw the public' s attention to serious problems in world politics and to serious violations of human rights and democracy.
It is therefore a paradox that we are holding the debate at a time when there are fewest people here.
There is no-one from the press.
It is, in fact, almost like performing a striptease in the dark, if you will pardon the expression.
I also think it is a paradox that we are insisting on the Commission' s being present - and the Council too ought, of course, to be here - but we have written our motions for resolution before we have heard what they have to say.
It is both paradoxical and frivolous.
I would therefore conclude my speech with the request that urgent topics of this kind be put on the agenda on Wednesdays when the Council and the Commission are here and that we only vote on the motions for resolution once we have heard the remarks on our proposals.
As you are aware, Mr Haarder, it is not the Bureau but the Conference of Presidents which sets our agenda.
If you would like to make this proposal to the President of your group so that he can bring it to the attention of the other Members, then we may be able to do something.
Mr President, may I begin by replying to Mr Haarder that the absence of our fellow Members of Parliament is an utter disgrace, to put it bluntly.
We cannot compress five days' work into a Wednesday just because some people want to work for one day and have six days off every week.
Perhaps there are employees in other walks of life who would welcome a similar arrangement.
In my opinion, what goes on here brings shame on this Parliament, and I find it scandalous, Mr Haarder, that you should encourage this by trying to eliminate Thursday sittings too, now that the Friday sittings have gone.
But now to the topic itself.
I wish to say very clearly that we, as Europeans, bear a great responsibility for Kosovo - and this topical and urgent debate, incidentally, was originally devoted to Kosovo, not southern Serbia; it is listed in the agenda as the 'situation in Kosovo' .
In this respect I am not entirely happy with the resolution, and I should also like to point out that my name appears erroneously on the resolution, which I did not sign.
May I ask that this be corrected, because I believe - as the last few speeches, and particularly Mrs Pack' s eloquent intervention, have graphically illustrated - that it is a matter of stabilising the situation in Kosovo, for as long as the situation in Kosovo is unstable, there can be no stability in the neighbouring regions either, including southern Serbia and, indeed, the whole of Serbia.
This is why it is absolutely imperative, as Mr Lagendijk quite rightly said, to take the decisive step by arranging for elections to be held in Kosovo.
Until we have democratically legitimised authorities for Kosovo to act as negotiating partners of the democratically legitimised Serbs, there will be no peace settlement in the region, and we shall incur a heavy burden of guilt if we keep postponing these elections for every conceivable reason, because by so doing we undermine Mr Rugova' s position, and extremist forces - whose background, by the way, is obscure, to say the least - are able to exploit the situation and make internal political capital out of the Albanians' frustration.
As I have said, our inactivity weakens the position of Mr Rugova, who embodies people' s hopes for a peaceful solution. Instead of just pointing the finger at others and saying that this one or that one is undemocratic, we should recognise the fact that we ourselves are neglecting our primary responsibility.
Let me close with a remark aimed at the Serbian President: if he does not accept EU mediation to resolve this thorny issue, I wonder why he accepts money from the European Union.
Mr President, Europe' s coherence and credibility are at stake in Kosovo. So too is the confidence of our own citizens and the people of the Balkans in the European institutions as well as the stability of the region itself.
Our action in Kosovo a couple of years ago was not exactly a paragon of speed or unity. For too many months it was not a paragon of efficiency either.
Our people reacted with disgust to Milosevic' s odious policy which resulted in oppression and terror for the Albanian Kosovars and in their mass exodus.
Public opinion in our own countries demanded determined action such as was eventually taken.
Military intervention of that nature was likely to generate misgivings and even rejection amongst some sectors of our society and even more so in Yugoslavia itself.
It is only fair to reiterate that we gave political consent to that action and that it did serve to curtail Milosevic' s excesses and the sufferings of the people of Kosovo.
It also contributed to Milosevic being discredited and defeated a few months later.
However, our consistency is now being put to the test. We can no longer conceal our embarrassment as we witness how some of the former victims in Kosovo are turning into tormentors.
They are persecuting their fellow citizens of Serb origin and driving them out of their territory in as hateful a process of ethnic cleansing as the previous one. Those same elements are involved in armed aggression on other Serb territory with an Albanian population.
At the same time, Albanian Kosovar mafias are operating as part of organised crime networks in several of our countries. It appears that they are doing so to raise funds with which to finance their guerrilla activities.
All of this is incompatible with the objectives pursued by the European Union and we must not tolerate it.
The European Union is contributing very substantial sums to the rebuilding of Kosovo. Nevertheless, that contribution must be strictly conditional on respect for human rights, recognition of existing borders adopted by the international community and the cessation of all military and terrorist operations by Albanian Kosovars within their territory or beyond it.
The stability of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia and the rest of the region may depend on our consistency and firmness. It could hinge on our stifling the extremist and expansionist action of certain elements of the Albanian Kosovar population.
President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first say plainly and simply: I am opposed to any kind of force in political conflict.
I believe we must see that as an absolutely fundamental principle.
But the situation is, of course, rather more complicated in Kosovo and in the Presevo valley than simply dealing with a few extremist Albanians and heaping abuse on them today.
Of course I shall support the resolution, but really I should have preferred it if we had tackled in one go today not only the situation in the Presevo valley, but also what is still happening daily in Mitrovica.
Because there - and we must not forget that - it is not only policemen, not only KFOR troops, but also citizens who are attacked daily, and it is no fun living there.
Very many colleagues have been there and know what the situation is like.
I am amazed at the warmth with which the international community is treating President KostunÃ­ca at this moment.
We are making a fuss of him, and supporting him, and when he came to power we quite rightly told him that there must be immediate emergency aid.
Of course I was in favour of that, but we are now at a turning point.
We are at a moment when we are moving from emergency aid to structural help.
I believe that this is a turning point that we must take advantage of.
We must use it to make clear once and for all to Mr KostunÃ­ca and his regime that he will have to take fundamental steps to solve the problems in Kosovo.
That means, in the first instance, the release of prisoners.
We have still made no progress at all with this.
This is a real scandal.
If one comes into contact with Albanian Kosovars, that is the first thing they ask about.
Secondly, I believe that we must use the turning point finally to force Mr KostunÃ­ca to consider a truly fundamental political solution for the Kosovo region, and in my view that means autonomy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the parliamentary delegation that was in Yugoslavia a few days ago saw a Yugoslavia, a Serbia, in transition.
The future shape of the country is the subject of intensive discussion, and there is much talk of decentralisation, even in Serbia itself, and of a new relationship with the ethnic minorities.
Another subject that is frequently discussed is the need to strengthen local government and, particularly in southern Serbia, the need to give the Albanian minority fair representation in the local authorities, where the rules have hitherto been stacked against them.
Every act of violence, whether in southern Serbia or in Mitrovica, disrupts the painstaking peace process that is currently taking place in the Balkans.
The Yugoslav and Serb authorities must naturally take a firm line in their dealings with the minorities.
That is what we in Parliament have always advocated and will continue to advocate, and there is no room for compromise there.
It is important, however, that the measures taken should be realistic.
Elections in Kosovo are certainly one such measure, but they must be preceded by a precise definition of the powers and authority that the elected representatives will have.
The present problems cannot be solved overnight.
They can only be solved by a consensus of all interested parties, states and ethnic groups.
That is a complex process, and I entirely agree with Mrs Pack, perhaps not in detail but certainly in principle, that Europe must take the initiative here, because none of the parties in the Balkans enjoys the level of trust that would enable it to launch a successful peace initiative at this stage.
Only the European Union enjoys that level of trust.
Neither the United States of America nor Russia nor any of the Balkan States and societies have the requisite degree of authority.
And if Europe were caught napping now, that would pose serious problems.
I can only agree with another of the previous speakers, Mr Posselt, on the money issue.
We already pay out enough in the world and in particular regions without having a stabilising influence.
It must be different in the Balkans.
We are willing to pay, but we also want to have a say, so that stability and peace can be established in the region.
Mr President, the Commission shares most of the concerns referred to in the resolutions.
As regards Kosovo, we were already aware of many of the issues raised.
We strongly condemn violence in all its forms and wish to combat organised crime. At the same time we fully support the United Nations' mission and both the incoming and outgoing Special Representatives.
The European Union and UNMIK pillar responsible for economic development promotes the involvement and training of local communities, as you yourselves have outlined. This is perceived as a key issue underpinning our cooperation.
A number of speakers have raised a crucial issue, namely basic respect for democratic principles and the rights of minorities.
We certainly share this concern. In particular, we are pursuing our efforts on behalf of Albanian Kosovar detainees in Serb prisons.
The European Union has raised this matter on numerous occasions, most recently during the troika's visit to Belgrade last week.
We are aware that the authorities are working on an amnesty law for the thousands of political prisoners imprisoned under the Milosevic regime.
We know that in principle this law should have a very wide scope. Only a few hundred prisoners sentenced for acts of terrorism would be excluded, mostly Albanian Kosovars.
The authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in Serbia are dealing with each individual case under urgent procedure. It is, however, true that they have no intention of granting a general pardon.
They have made it clear that they will not free a single prisoner, Serb or Albanian, who has been fairly sentenced for that type of offence.
As far as the European Union is concerned, we shall continue to raise the issue and press for an early solution.
We shall have this and other matters very much in mind in the coming months as we negotiate this year' s programme of aid to Serbia with both the Serb and the Yugoslav authorities.
It is very important for all concerned that the new democratic authorities maintain their commitment to continue with the reforms outlined.
You raised another matter in the resolution, namely the problem of the tension in the Presevo valley in southern Serbia. The resolutions adopted are also in line with the political positions adopted by the Union, which unreservedly condemns violence and terrorism.
On behalf of the European Union we have highlighted the moderation displayed by the new leaders of the Yugoslav Republic and Serbia and we urge them to continue in this vein. We all have to be very clear on one point.
Some of you have already referred to it and we agree entirely with you. A new era is dawning in the Balkans and it must not be marred by violence from any source whatsoever.
The European Union must therefore rejoice at the plan put forward by the authorities to solve the current crisis. This programme includes proposals for dealing with the grievances felt by the people of that poor and underdeveloped region, with all the attendant problems.
For our part, the European Union has just received the plan and is studying it. It is worth pointing out that this is Belgrade' s first attempt to reach a negotiated settlement through dialogue amongst the various ethnic groups in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
This is indeed important. Milosevic never attempted to do so.
The principle of negotiation and dialogue warrants our support and will receive it.
The European Union is increasing the number of monitoring missions in the Presevo valley and the Commission is considering ways of increasing the already substantial aid devoted to the area.
This currently amounts to approximately EUR 1 million for fuel and for educational and humanitarian programmes.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Covic, is due in Brussels today and will discuss the plan with the Commission too.
For their part, the Member States are considering how they could contribute.
KFOR is playing an important role in Kosovo in an effort to restrict the activities of the extremists. Furthermore, both UNMIK and the European Union are putting pressure on Albanian Kosovar politicians to distance themselves from the extremists in Presevo.
Mr President, given that the Commissioner was not present when I spoke, might I point out that this is not a law on amnesty.
Security Council resolution 1244 is quite specific on the point that only the authorities of the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) are competent to rule on the situation of the Kosovars, where necessary.
There is no amnesty law being applied, it is a simple matter of transferring these 700 people from Belgrade to Pristina in Kosovo.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0105/01 by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, Mr Van den Berg and Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
B5-0115/01 by Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, Mrs Lucas and Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
B5-0123/01 by Mr Van Hecke and Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC);
B5-0133/01 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in the Congo;
B5-0135/01 by Mr Vinci, Mr Sylla and Mr Alavanos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
B5-0144/01 by Mr Van den Bos and Mrs DybkjÃŠr, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Congo.
Mr President, democracy alone will deliver states from barbarism, ethnic warfare and despotic and military governments.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is no exception to this rule.
Despite the 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which provided for a UN-supervised ceasefire, the disarmament of all the armed factions, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the establishment of internal dialogue between the government and the opposition, both armed and civilian, the state of war has nonetheless continued and is paralysing both the economic and political situation throughout the whole region.
The European Parliament must condemn in the strongest terms all these acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population and must also condemn the military intervention by neighbouring countries and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops.
Following the assassination of President Laurent Kabila, the international community and the European Parliament must intervene in this political transition.
We must ask the new Head of State to lift the ban affecting political parties.
Mr Joseph Kabila must demand and must clearly announce a timetable for the opening of internal Congolese dialogue and the organisation of free elections.
The civilian population, whose economy and welfare has already been hit hard - particularly in the suburbs of Kinshasa, must not once again fall victim to the lack of political interest on the part of our continent, nor of the perfectly casual attitude of investors and firms operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, more especially in terms of human rights, the environment and the rule of law.
We have political responsibility in Africa and we must take action to safeguard the dignity of the peoples of Africa.
Mr President, the death of Laurent-DÃ©sirÃ© Kabila has opened new perspectives for peace.
The fact is that the former president had become an obstacle to the implementation of the Lusaka peace agreement.
He was eliminated by the very people who helped bring him to power.
His successor and son, Joseph Kabila, can count for the time being on a great deal of credit from the international community.
All the same, he is the main character in a script written and directed by others, by Angola and Zimbabwe, but also by the hardliners from his father' s government.
It looks very much as if there has been a change of driver, but that the bus remains the same.
The young Kabila has awakened high expectations.
The time has now come for him to act.
As of now the Lusaka agreement is the only framework for a permanent solution.
Specifically, withdrawal of all foreign troops from Congolese territory and the simultaneous initiation of inter-Congolese dialogue.
The international community must quickly decide on its attitude and particularly push for the deployment of MONUC of the UN peacekeeping forces.
There is also an urgent need for more coherent action, both between Europe and America and between the various Member States.
Certain Member States continue to approach the conflict in the Great Lakes region on the basis of an imagined, artificial conflict between English-speakers and French-speakers.
Others mainly try to secure their own economic interests.
There are limits to cynicism.
If the window of opportunity is not quickly used to force a real breakthrough in the peace process, violence will soon flare up again and the first African world war will further escalate.
I urge the Council and also the Commission to take a more assertive stance, because only if Europe speaks with one voice can it make a meaningful contribution to ending a war which has already cost too many lives.
Mr President, obviously the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are those who suffer most in the conflicts between armed gangs which are tearing the country apart, but it is both pathetic and misleading to present these conflicts as if the only people to bear any responsibility were the opposing Congolese factions and their protectors in neighbouring African states and as if Europe' s calling for national reconciliation and democratisation could resolve the situation.
Among those sitting here aspiring to give the Congo lessons on democracy or human rights are representatives of the former colonial power which for decades has kept this country under the yoke of brutal oppression.
There are also those who took up the baton of French imperialism and demonstrated the true worth of their speeches on democracy by supporting Mobutu, not to mention their accomplices of other nationalities, all tempted by the mineral wealth of the Congo.
They are criminals who are preaching to the victims of their own criminal action.
While expressing our solidarity with the people of the Congo, we refuse to be associated in any way whatsoever with the representatives of the political powers which bear some of the responsibility for the past and present oppression of this country, some of whom still belong to political or business networks whose goal is to make profits on the back of Africa.
Mr President, under Kabila Sr., the peace process had ground to a halt.
There is new hope in the air now that his son has become president.
Peace is only possible if all foreign troops are withdrawn.
That is why Europe and America particularly must exert joint pressure on Rwanda and Burundi to end their adventure.
The dividing up of the country is not an acceptable option.
Even the so-called rebels will have to recognise territorial integrity.
But they will only do so if Kabila and his friends are prepared to share power in the country.
Without the democratisation of political life no lasting stability is possible in Congo.
The poor population has to make do with emergency humanitarian aid.
As soon as peace makes it possible, the European Union should resume structural aid and this must particularly enable the government to function properly.
The poor Congo could be rich.
It has large mineral resources and the population is predominantly very young and very dynamic.
They deserve the efforts of all involved to breathe new life into the hope for peace.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in discussing this resolution we should be aware that Congo is larger than Europe. A country containing some 300 tribes, some of which live in total isolation, as the communications network is virtually non-existent.
A country where both production and supply are achievable only with great difficulty.
A country that is, moreover, wedged between Rwanda and Uganda.
Rwanda, which meanwhile for its own security has moved its borders up to between 200 and 300 km into the Congolese interior.
Uganda, which under the guise of combating rebel movements extended its influence to significant parts of Congo, up to and including Kisangani.
The neutral position, which puts the Lusaka agreements first, involving the withdrawal of foreign troops and the establishment of partition areas both on the borders with Rwanda and Uganda and between the migrants themselves, is a passive first step that may lead to the stabilisation of the front and the belated return of the many refugees.
Perhaps it will be useful if Europe, in contrast to the hesitant attitude of American policy towards Kabila, plays a key role.
After all, Europe has an unbelievable potential impact because of its knowledge of the thinking behind events in Congo and can once more play a role to the benefit of the population, helping it do battle with desperate poverty, squalid health condition, starvation and epidemic disease.
For example, without taking sides, Europe could support Belgian efforts to bring some stability to a population of over 55 million men and women in a land area larger than that of the enlarged Europe.
In this way Europe would prove that it wants to respond to the priorities that the new President set out in his inaugural address.
Europe must not remain passive in the face of developments in Central Africa.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragedy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo cannot, I regret, be separated from the tragedy of the entire region.
The purpose of my speech is, in particular, to draw attention to the particular responsibilities of Angola, a country governed by a totally corrupt military power that has taken advantage of the weaknesses of western capitalism to oppress its people and to threaten the peace, stability and security of the entire region.
This is of particular concern to us, all the more so because, in Cabinda, there are Portuguese citizens who have been held for over nine months, in a tragedy as long-standing as that of the western tourists who were kidnapped in the Philippines approximately a year ago.
These people are being held captive by guerrilla forces fighting for the independence of Cabinda.
The truth of the situation is that Angola' s Government is not able to solve these problems and is spreading its instability and greed into neighbouring territories.
I urge the Commission to be particularly firm in its assessment of the situation in that part of the world, and I also call upon the Commission and the Swedish Presidency to help us to obtain the release of the Portuguese citizens who have been held hostage as quickly as possible.
Mr President, the European Union obviously condemns political violence in all its forms.
The Congo is an area of concern to us and Joseph Kabila' s rise to power may indeed provide a fresh opportunity to reopen the Lusaka negotiations along the moderate line he has taken to date, particularly during his visits to France, Belgium and the United States.
True, so far all we have to go on are words, which must be translated into deeds.
We shall certainly be monitoring developments closely.
In any event, we feel that this is an opportunity we should not hesitate to grasp in an effort to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict, particularly now that it seems a significant cease-fire is being observed.
At the time, the European Union actively supported the Lusaka negotiations with a significant allocation of regional funds. The mechanisms set up under the agreement were allocated a fund for the joint military commission.
These were relatively large funds, amounting to several million euro. They were essential in achieving the three fundamental objectives: negotiation, the military commission and facilitating political dialogue.
However, we are endeavouring to do even more in terms of financial assistance and humanitarian aid.
ECHO allocated EUR 20 million last year and an allocation of EUR 35 million is planned for this year.
Yet we are not only offering economic support to assure food supply and health services, but also attempting to promote the negotiated solution we all hope for based on the Lusaka agreements.
In addition, the Commission is studying the possibility of supporting the revival of the peace and reconciliation process through programmes for the rehabilitation, demobilisation and reintegration of displaced people. Given the present situation it is too early, however, to define possible future action.
Neither the technical nor the political conditions exist to allow us to detail the action we might take.
Finally, I should like to say that I have taken note of the request made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro to consider the extent to which we might be able to take the lead on this matter.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is on the agenda once again.
Yet, I doubt that this introduction will be enough to make Parliament realise that there is a crisis in China, that this typical Communist regime is, most tragically, turning into a National Communist regime and that this presents a risk now, and in the future, to security in Asia and the rest of the world.
Today, the people of China, Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China have no freedom of religion or conscience.
In particular, the Falun Gong movement and other groups have been subjected to repression on a par with that seen during the Cultural Revolution.
Already 500 000 people have been arrested, more than 150 people have died in prison, usually after having been torture.
What I am describing here is the situation now, not the situation during the Cultural Revolution.
Parliament has a duty to take an extremely firm stance.
The resolution is a good text.
I would particularly like to thank Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, who played an instrumental role in this task.
The members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are certainly not aware of an incident which in another, less tragic, context might be considered amusing. At the meeting to discuss the compromise, one of the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists recommended that Falun Gong be excluded from this resolution, asserting that it was something other than a religion.
Freedom of religion and freedom of conscience are part of the same concept and each of us must define it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of faith, conscience and religious creed and freedom of expression and association are the most elementary fundamental rights that can, and must, be granted to every individual in this world of ours.
They are part and parcel of our democracies, and we expect them to be applied everywhere as basic principles so that the dignity of human life is truly respected throughout the world.
For a while it looked as if the situation were taking a turn for the better in the People' s Republic of China too.
Sadly, in more recent times this appears to have changed, and progress seems to have not only been halted but even reversed.
For example, I greatly regret that, while the People' s Republic of China has signed important documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the process of ratifying and implementing the two covenants has yet to be completed.
That is a great pity.
This process needs to be reactivated.
I therefore appeal on behalf of my Group to the People' s Republic of China to respect people' s civil liberties just as we endeavour to do in our democracies.
May I add a postscript to the honourable Member Mr Dupuis, just to mention to him that the Falun Gong say that they are not a religious institution.
We should also respect the way in which institutions define themselves.
Mr President, first of all the title of the resolution should be "Freedom of Expression" rather than "Freedom of Religion" because, as was mentioned earlier, Falun Gong is not a religion but rather a practice comparable to yoga in the West.
Secondly, the repression against Falun Gong is totally absurd.
Can you imagine repression against all the people who ever follow yoga classes in Europe?
The Chinese Government goes so far as to imprison cyber-dissidents meaning people who create or manage websites whose content does not please the government like Mr Huan Qi who is being tried now.
Finally, you should stop supporting the EU/China human rights dialogue as long as it does not yield any result.
Its only concrete outcome so far has been to prevent a resolution condemning China in Geneva.
Mr President, what was it that Karl Marx said?
"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions.
It is the opium of the people."
Marxism-Leninism is in terminal decline, but other ideologies have survived.
China is far from permitting freedom of expression, let alone freedom of religious observance, for Tibetans, Mongolians and members of Christian churches or Muslim communities.
The Tibetans are persecuted.
It is an offence to display pictures of the Dalai Lama.
Those who stand up for their beliefs face the threat of lengthy prison sentences.
I recall the initiative of the Tibet intergroup of the European Parliament to propose the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, who has spent the last nine years in prison, for this year' s Sakharov Prize.
The eleven-year-old Panchen Lama, the second-highest authority in Tibetan Buddhism, has been abducted and has since been cut off from the outside world.
He was not even allowed to meet with Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The PPE-DE Group expects China, as a future WTO member and a global player, to assume its responsibility at long last and to ratify and implement the international agreements on civil and political rights as well as those on economic, social and cultural rights.
We call on the EU Member States to take the opportunity presented by the meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
Put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda.
And let us remember that, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one of the few successes of the Nice Summit, the Member States enshrined freedom of religion, conscience, expression and information in the second chapter.
I hope that our European Commission will show the same powers of initiative.
Tashi delek!
Mr President, there was a time when the People' s Republic of China was systematically excluded from international negotiations and world trade by Europe and America.
The fact that a divided and backward country made a new start and started rebuilding its economy, in a way that was enthusiastically received by masses of workers and peasants, was felt as a threat by the outside world.
Over half a century later the heirs to that revolution are still in power.
Their ideology and the enthusiasm of the population have gone, but unfortunately they have retained their dictatorial traits with a vengeance.
For this regime, economic growth and political calm are of supreme importance and as a result anything that runs counter to them is attacked fanatically.
That bodes ill for ethnic and religious minorities and those with political criticisms.
Organisations are banned, people are locked up and death sentences are liberally used.
Small, powerless countries that breach human rights at home, rightly attract foreign criticism.
In the case of China, the most populous country on earth, things are usually different.
People with widely differing political views say that it is a large and important country that may become a major trading partner and that we must therefore stay on good terms with it.
My group believes that an end should be put to this special treatment.
Human rights, including freedom of religion, cannot simply stop at the Chinese border.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would echo Mr Dupuis in saying that I do not know how many times we have stood here and discussed human rights violations in China. Unfortunately, the situation appears to be getting worse and worse.
Torture is on the increase.
There is frequent use of the death penalty. Freedom of expression is limited.
The ELDR Group is very worried about this and appeals to the Commission and the Council to put increased pressure on China regarding human rights issues.
The world cannot look silently on as the world' s most populous country systematically engages in violations against its citizens on a daily basis.
We have high hopes that the Swedish Presidency will succeed in bringing about a united approach prior to the Geneva meeting in a month' s time and then, in the course of the meeting, will get a resolution passed concerning China.
The Chinese have extremely limited opportunities to practise their religion.
Catholics report systematic persecution.
Mosques are burned down.
In Tibet, the oppression of the Tibetan people, especially of Buddhist monks, continues.
Torture, re-education camps and imprisonment under unacceptable conditions are the rule rather than the exception.
We know that there are now at least 600 political prisoners in Tibet, most of whom are monks and nuns.
Over the last year, we have been able to see, on TV screens throughout the world, the harsh offensive launched by the Chinese rÃ©gime against the meditation movement Falun Gong since the latter was banned in July 1999.
Ever since the ban, tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested.
At least 137 people have died in prison.
Thousands of cases of torture, atrocities and ill-treatment are also being reported, as is the fact that thousands of people are in work camps and countless individuals have been punished with imprisonment following summary trials.
That is completely unacceptable.
Falun Gong has been branded an evil sect, but one might well wonder if the reason for the hatred felt towards this peaceful movement does not lie, rather, in the threat it constitutes to the Communist system, because it unites so many people.
However, Falun Gong practitioners are entirely peaceful and have no political ambitions other than to be allowed to exercise their basic rights - rights which are laid down in the Chinese constitution and in international agreements signed by China.
Laos
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome a delegation from the Laotian opposition and exiles from Laos, led by representatives of the Laotian royal family, who are seated in the public gallery.
We have not discussed the situation in Laos in great depth; however, Laos is a country still governed by a dictatorship, has a one-party system and is one of the poorest countries in the world.
I believe that this resolution is important because, for the first time, it requires Parliament to state that a process of national reconciliation is needed in Laos, that we need all political forces, both internal, which even today are suppressed, and external, to be able to work towards bringing about change in this splendid country.
I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this work.
I believe that it is an important text and I hope that the Commission will present it firmly to the Laotian Government so that we see a change and a relaxation over the next few weeks in Laos and I would welcome Commissioner Solbes Mira' s comments on this matter.
Mr President, the European Parliament took a positive view at the start of the week of extending the agreement between the EU and ASEAN to include Laos.
Parliament' s report states that the protocol can be seen as part of a broader process in which the Union aims to encourage political, economic and social growth as well as stability in the country.
There is much room for improvement when it comes to the situation regarding human rights in Laos.
It is appropriate that human rights there should be discussed at the same time as increased cooperation.
We have given a lot of attention in Parliament to the question of Burma.
But things are hardly any better in neighbouring countries.
Laos is one of the world' s poorest countries.
All the negative features of a one-party system are manifest there.
There are barely any signs of greater freedom of speech or the liberalisation of political life there.
In October 1999, a demonstration was organised in front of the presidential palace against the ruling powers.
Those who took part in it have not been seen since.
Amnesty says that they were arrested and have been languishing in prison camps without trial.
Meanwhile, Mr Thongsouk Saysangkhi, who died in prison in 1998, belonged to a group of three ministers and a high official who had been attempting to change the administrative machine from within. They were convicted of treason.
The international community has tried to aid the development of Laos, despite the human rights problems.
The EU has given EUR 120 million in aid to the country; the United States has given 23 million, and Japan 132 million dollars.
The Laotian people, who live in dire poverty, need help, but the country' s internal situation gives cause for asking just who is really benefiting from the aid being given.
There are regrettable examples of projects where the army and the government have reaped the benefit instead of the local inhabitants.
Laos is rich in natural resources and, were there democracy there, would have real potential for development.
In a parliamentary statement Laos is being urged to sign, ratify and enforce the UN' s conventions on human rights, to free prisoners of conscience, and to guarantee freedom of the press.
The importance of these objectives should really be clearly emphasised.
Mr President, I would like to join Mr Dupuis and Mrs Iivari in expressing our sense of deep solidarity with Lao exiles who are here today, and even more with dissidents who are detained in prison without trial and in intolerable circumstances in Laos itself.
On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who are in Parliament - and, I am sure, in a spirit in which the whole Parliament joins - we very much wish to express our support for the liberation of Laos.
We cannot but remember here how much the West - the United States perhaps more than Europe - has done, in times past, to destabilise and damage life there.
We now wish to see an improvement.
We know that Laos has signed the UN Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic and Social Rights.
It still must ratify them, and the government there must live up to what it has undertaken to honour.
We call for this to be done in the name of human liberty and solidarity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has already, on several previous occasions, adopted positions on the human rights situation in the Lao People' s Democratic Republic, in 1991 and 1997 in particular.
At that time, Parliament requested the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience but this request was ignored and since then at least one of them, Mr Tchongsouk Saysangkhi, has died in prison.
After 25 years of Communist rule, the people of Laos are today hoping that their country will follow the path of transition to democracy and are calling for free elections.
The Laotian Government, however, continues to stamp out any peaceful demonstrations, such as the one held on 26 October 1999 and, more recently, on 17 November 2000.
The organisers of the earlier demonstration were arrested and are still in prison.
The leader of the second demonstration, Mr Phommachaul Phannolath, was also arrested along with other demonstrators.
The resolution before the House denounces these human rights violations and reminds the Lao People' s Democratic Republic that, as a partner of the European Union through a Cooperation Agreement signed in April 1997, it undertook to promote and protect all human rights.
The Lao PDR also showed its commitment to this by signing two United Nations conventions on human rights in December 2000.
This commitment must henceforth be backed up with real action.
Furthermore, the Lao PDR is taking on the role of coordinator of relations between the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations until 2002.
This role gives it further responsibilities in promoting the concepts and values on which the partnership is based.
I hope that Parliament will give its support to the European Union' s strategy on the region as well as to all the people of Laos who are working towards democracy and for national harmony within the country.
The compromise resolution is well-balanced, clear and specific.
On behalf of my group, I would urge you to support it so that the European Parliament can make its voice heard in this troubled area of the world.
Mr President, five people, namely Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Kamphouvieng Sisaath, Seng-Aloun Phenphanh, Bouavanh Chanhmanivong and Keochay, disappeared on 26 October 1999 and were probably imprisoned for holding a peaceful protest in Vientiane and calling for political changes in their country.
They are all members of the Lao student movement for democracy.
Their safety is feared for because of the torture and poor treatment in the prisons.
The government of Laos should see the contribution of this kind of motivated person precisely as an impulse towards improvement.
They must be able to contribute freely.
Freedom of expression, the right of association and assembly are greatly restricted in Laos.
Inflation is currently running at over 30%.
The mysterious bomb explosions are damaging the largest economic factor in the country, tourism.
If the government does not act soon to implement political and economic reforms then this country faces an unstable future.
Guinea-Conakry
Mr President, one of the greatest humanitarian dramas at present being played out on the world stage is the refugee problem in Guinea.
For more than five months hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hemmed in between the warring sides.
In the border area between these countries, called the 'Parrot' s Beak' , they are caught like rats in a trap in fighting between Guinean troops, shadowy rebel movements and the gang of murderers known as the United Revolutionary Front.
The personal commitment of the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Lubbers, in this crisis area is very gratifying.
His proposal for the establishment of a safety corridor, which will enable refugees to return to their home countries quickly, deserves international support.
But, all this is not enough.
The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled.
For example, it would be a good idea to institute an international boycott against the trade in 'blood diamonds' , in which this border area is so rich.
It is also essential that the international community should present a united front against those principally responsible for the present degrading chaos in West Africa - a task in which the Security Council of the United Nations should take the lead.
For this reason we request that the Council and Commission should take action along these lines.
Mr President, Mr Belder has graphically accounted for the dreadful situation facing people on the borders of Guinea where warriors from neighbouring states, rebels against their own government, come and go across the border creating problems of refugees, problems of human suffering, death and destitution.
We must do all that we can to bring this to an end.
Our resolution says that we must urge all the countries in the region to refrain from activities directed against a neighbouring country, and so we must.
It says we must ask all the neighbouring countries to refrain from supporting groups that fight the Conkary regime or make incursions into Guinea's territory, and so we must.
We want to see the speeding-up of the process that will lead to reintegration of displaced persons and the return of refugees to their country of origin.
West Africans themselves are doing great work in this direction.
We in the European Union must put our voice, and whatever weight we have, behind them to help them.
Mr President, all reports indicate that Liberia has underlying responsibility for the present conflict in Guinea.
Charles Taylor originally came to power through violence and terror, with the sole aim of obtaining control of the diamond trade.
He later exported violence to neighbouring Sierra Leone by arming and training the RUF, one of the most savage rebel movements on earth and now the Hitler of West Africa is exporting violence to another neighbour, Guinea.
Guinea is in a certain sense the victim of the fact that it admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia into its territory, including members of the rebel group opposed to Charles Taylor.
The Conakry regime has sometimes reacted in a very unfortunate way, but let us not mistake our adversary.
Liberia is the destabilising factor in the region.
In any case, according to my information it is incorrect that Guinea is refusing to transfer refugees to areas further from the border.
The international organisation for migration has in fact already begun moving a first group of 35 000 refugees.
It is clear that a safe corridor must be created as soon as possible for the return of these people.
Europe could definitely give unconditional support to the ECOWAS plan for stationing observers in the border area.
If violence persists, the Union should also call within the UN for smart sanctions against the leaders of Liberia.
European Member States that flout the ban on the import of so-called blood diamonds, must be strongly condemned.
Apart from that, Mr President, I feel that the Council should also investigate reports of possible support from France for the regime in Liberia.
The situation is critical.
If a Sierra Leone scenario is repeated in Guinea there is a risk that in addition to Central and East Africa, West Africa too will be caught up in a spiral of violence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall speak in the same vein as my fellow Members and clarify that Guinea today is home to almost 500 000 refugees, who, for ten years, have been fleeing civil wars raging in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
In many cases, they refused to join the armed forces. I think anyone who has read Ahmadou Kourouma' s book 'Allah Doesn' t Have To' will be familiar with the tragedy of the child soldiers forced to join possibly revolutionary but most certainly bloodthirsty armies such as the United Revolutionary Front.
I would also like to say, like Mr van Hecke, that a safety corridor to allow the mass evacuation of refugees must be established immediately, as it is, indeed, a matter of urgency.
The Guinean Government must allow the victims to settle in areas that are further from the fighting and the borders.
In my view, that is the least it could do.
Obviously, it is justifiable and understandable for Guinea to defend itself against any incursion.
I am even of the opinion that the territorial integrity of a state like Guinea must be protected.
However, the Guinean Government must also prevent paramilitaries acting in the place of legitimate armed forces and perpetrating acts of violence on refugees.
I share the view that Guinea is not solely responsible, but I feel that it should do this, at least.
That is why the decision of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to use troops from West Africa must be supported and must come into force as soon as possible, as it may provide good protection.
To sum up, the European Union should put intense pressure upon Liberia to end its support for forces such as the URF.
However, Guinea is also partly responsible for the current situation, and is, even so, a country that regularly violates human rights - no one in the House could forget the imprisonment of Alpha CondÃ©.
I believe that it is important to reiterate that, in a country that has no respect for the most basic democratic principles and where the slightest opposition is quashed, it is not surprising, although it is extremely regrettable, that one of the regime' s opposition parties has joined the rebellion and allied itself with the URF.
My last point is to say that Africa is in urgent need of democratic rule and genuine economic development, which will improve the fortunes of all people.
We can help to achieve this.
I have a question to put to the Council. When will our governments cancel the debt owed by third-world countries, knowing as they do that this is the cause of wars and poverty?
Mr President, in Africa small elites often deem the struggle for power and wealth more important than the suffering of the population.
At first, that did not apply to Guinea.
Despite the poverty, it offered a safe refuge for refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Now Guinea, too, is caught up in a regional struggle for power.
There is nowhere else for the refugees to go.
Thousands are hiding in the jungle or are wandering fearfully in the heat without food, water or hope.
If a corridor is not quickly created, an unparalleled humanitarian disaster threatens.
There is a great deal at stake.
The whole region seems to be heading for chaos.
The purchase of weapons is more important than feeding people.
Above all, Charles Taylor must take Liberia in hand.
It is harrowing to see how indulgently Europe, too, is reacting to this catastrophe.
What is the European Union doing, I ask the Commissioner, and when will the petty tyrants in power finally concern themselves with the lot of their people?
Mr President, any normal human being would be moved by the sight of refugees from Sierra Leone wandering the streets of Guinea, bullied, beaten and humiliated by soldiers in the Guinean Army or some armed gang or other.
We must express our outrage at the actions of the Guinean army and dissident armed gangs, from Sierra Leone or Guinea, who are trying to gain control of the south west of Guinea.
However, once again, outrage is not enough to conceal British imperialist involvement in the civil wars in Sierra Leone, France' s involvement in Guinea' s dictatorship or even the involvement of large diamond traders, led by de Beers, in funding, the armed gangs directly or indirectly.
Furthermore, when military intervention is needed to support dictatorships dedicated to the interests of major Western powers, particularly those in Europe, European powers find it possible to implement considerable resources.
In order to ensure provisions and medical supplies can reach the 500 000 refugees in the area, the leaders of the European institutions merely send moral pleas to the armed gangs, official and unofficial, who have no use for them.
It is precisely because of our solidarity with the refugees and the people of the region that we refuse to be associated with this farce, which does not aim to come to the aid of these people, but to absolve the major powers of their responsibility.
Nigeria
Mr President, since 1998 eight states in Nigeria have enforced a form of Islamic law which allows corporal punishment, despite the fact that it contravenes both the Nigerian Constitution and international covenants on human rights to which Nigeria has signed up.
The effect on human rights is graphically illustrated by the case of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu, a 17-year old mother of a young child.
Despite having lodged an appeal against her sentence of 100 lashes, the sentence was carried out in January without even her lawyers being informed.
They were still preparing the case for her appeal in court.
No attempt has been made to bring those who abused and exploited her to justice.
This case highlights the increasing anxiety about human rights abuses in Nigeria.
People of different religious beliefs have coexisted peacefully in Nigeria in the past, yet George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on his recent visit to the country, underlined the growing international concern about developments there.
The Christian minority are not allowed to build churches or to teach their religion in schools.
In areas where Muslim law is enforced men and women are not allowed to travel on the same public transport, and boys and girls have to be taught in separate schools.
In the state of Kaduna it is estimated that 2000 people have been killed in fighting between Christians and Muslims over plans to introduce the new Islamic code of law.
Yet human rights groups of both faiths are now campaigning on these issues.
The resolution we have before us sends out two clear messages.
The first is that we in the European Parliament are not prepared to ignore human rights abuses anywhere and so we condemn without reservation the treatment of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu and call upon the Nigerian Government to prevent any repeat of such abuse in future.
But the second is that we are also making a commitment, as a parliament, to support the creation of a democratic and just society in Nigeria by strengthening the dialogue between ourselves and that country.
Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Evans for her contribution on this subject.
I had no contact with her but I separately put down a motion for my own group and I speak on their behalf on this subject.
My good friend Thomas Mann spoke about the denial of the right to practise religion in one part of the world.
But it is just as serious when human rights are denied because people want to impose their religious beliefs on other people.
Whether it be the imposition of one's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one's religion, one is as bad as the other.
It is quite hard to be moderate in the language we use to condemn this barbarous and cruel act which took place against a 17-year-old girl in Nigeria.
A girl who claimed she had been forced to have sex but failed to produce in court the witnesses to support her claim.
The cruelty of the sentence, and the fact that she had given birth one month before, makes it very difficult for us to accept any assurances from the government of Nigeria that they are protecting the civil rights of their people and their own population.
We should remember that we in the European Union and the United States of America are the main trading partners of Nigeria.
We are the people who buy and sell almost all the things they want to buy and sell.
We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with.
I would ask the European Commission to take into consideration standards of human rights in all the aid schemes and cooperation schemes that the European Union puts into effect.
This is the worst we have heard of to date but we understand there are amputations taking place in Nigeria for relatively minor offences.
Some people condemn globalisation, but if there is one good thing about globalisation it means that the world becomes interdependent and we have at least some pressure we can apply.
Freedom of expression in Pakistan
Mr President, I deeply regret the need for this resolution concerning journalists condemned to death for blasphemy for what is claimed to be a mistake.
It is the latest in a whole succession of human rights abuses in Pakistan: growing religious intolerance - which we have just been hearing elsewhere in the world - the lack of a fair trial, so-called honour killings of women, child imprisonment and so on.
I currently hold passport and other details for a constituent of mine, a Pakistani citizen, who has had to travel there for family reasons and in the past has had difficulty leaving that country, even under the previous regime.
This highlights the appalling state of affairs that we now see with the present regime in power in Pakistan.
The suspension of a constitution, as mentioned in the resolution, and the constitutional court, has removed a crucial safeguard for him and others like him who fear arbitrary detention.
The state of affairs there appals many Pakistanis, both within the country and throughout the world, people who are proud of their religious faith and who are also committed to fundamental human rights.
Mr President, some of the world' s governments are violating the fundamental rules in which the common values of the international community are enshrined.
Article 18 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
Since 1991, Islamic Sharia law has applied in Pakistan.
The precepts and prohibitions laid down in the Koran are the supreme law of the land.
The law against blasphemy has palpably impaired the largely peaceful coexistence of Muslims with Christians and other religious minorities.
Freedom of expression and the freedom of the press have been severely curtailed.
Once again, journalists - seven of them this time - have been arrested on the flimsy pretext that they allegedly distributed anti-Islamic writings.
It looks once more as if the whole purpose of this is to make a public example of them. But it is far more serious than that, because they could be sentenced to death.
We call on General Musharaf' s military government to restore the independence of the judiciary and to delay no longer in allowing the courts to conduct proceedings in accordance with sound legal principles.
The Blasphemy Act must be repealed. It is being interpreted in an absolutely arbitrary manner and opens the door to all sorts of manipulation and malicious lawsuits.
The death penalty is rejected by a great majority of the people 's representatives, not only in Europe but also in a growing number of Asian countries.
It must be abolished.
The PPE-DE Group calls on the European Commission to review all its agreements with Pakistan as a matter of urgency and to revise them as necessary.
We need cooperation agreements with the human rights organisations and with the regional non-governmental organisations.
The paramount aim of our initiatives must be to ensure that Pakistan can at last resume its journey towards a free democratic system of government.
Mr President, the ELDR Group can never approve of the death penalty, wherever in the world it is imposed.
It is, of course, that much more repugnant when journalists are in danger of being executed just for doing their job.
In January, the newspaper Frontier Post published a reader' s letter, following which the newspaper' s staff were taken into custody and accused of blasphemy.
These individuals' lives are now at risk.
Fundamentalists have set fire to the newspaper' s offices in Peshawar.
This event is a tragic illustration of developments in Pakistan where freedom of expression and human rights are not respected.
The country is now becoming ever more marginalised in the world community.
The Islamic laws, like the military' s support for the Taliban rÃ©gime in Afghanistan, are creating alarm.
The situation in Pakistan is very disquieting.
What does the Commission intend to do in order to support those groups which are working to promote human rights and to establish the principles of the constitutional state?
Mr President, with regard to China, I would point out that the European Union is steadfastly determined to promote respect for human rights in this area, as in other parts of the world, and that we share Parliament' s concern about religious freedom in that country.
It is true that the living standards of the majority of the Chinese population appear to have improved during the last twenty years.
Thanks to the economic reforms and to liberalisation, there have been increases in freedom and personal autonomy. It is true, however, that there is still a big gap between the international commitments made by China and the human rights situation in practice.
In 1996, a human rights dialogue between the European Union and China was established and, within this framework, we are maintaining a frank debate on these matters.
A key topic is religious freedom, about which the European Union repeatedly expresses its concern faced with Chinese repression of religious and other types of activity to which you have referred.
We are talking not only about the Catholic and Protestant Churches, but also about any other type of faith.
Later, I shall be talking a little about Falun Gong.
Other topics raised with China are the repression of political dissent, the arbitrary conditions of detention, the frequent recourse to the death penalty and the repression of ethnic minorities.
We are also urging China quickly and without reservations to ratify the United Nations' International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which we consider to be key factors for improving individual rights.
The human rights field is one of the priority areas of our work, in which I believe we can improve our relations with China.
As we very well know, dialogue is only an option, the purpose of which is to produce results.
There is no justification at all for maintaining the dialogue if no progress is being made.
The European Union' s General Affairs Council openly expressed this point of view in its conclusions concerning the human rights dialogue between China and the European Union, published on 22 January.
You referred specifically in your speeches to three topics which I think are of interest.
Firstly, I should like to point out that, where Falun Gong is concerned, the Commission is especially concerned about the reports we are receiving about torture and ill-treatment inflicted upon followers of the movement, as well as about the severity of the sentences imposed upon some of its members.
The Commission has therefore repeatedly urged China to review these sentences.
We think that all the safeguards need to be fully respected in fair trials in which adequate defences are mounted.
As you may know, a decision has not yet been made about the European Union' s position on the Geneva resolution on China.
The debate we have held today in this House will, without a doubt, be fundamental to the decision we take.
As for action in connection with Tibet, we are indeed still concerned about the ethnic minorities there.
I should also like to point out, regarding this matter, that China has been urged to make further progress towards fully respecting the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people and to enter into an open dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
Regarding the situation in Laos, I should like to assure you that the Commission fully shares your concern about protecting human rights in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
It is true that, in the last year, some positive signs have been visible, for example the signing of the two United Nations covenants on human rights: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
The problem now is for the National Assembly to lose no time in ratifying these covenants and putting them into effect, and the Commission is waiting for this to happen.
Even if this step is successfully taken, however, there still remains a lot of work to be done.
A cause of special concern for everyone is the intolerance of, for example, political opposition, as demonstrated by the detention of a number of people in October and November 1999 for demonstrating against the government.
You refer in your report to the situation of former civil servants, such as Mr Latsamy Kamphoui and Mr Sackchittaphong, prisoners of conscience who are still being detained and whom the European Union has repeatedly called upon the government to release on humanitarian grounds.
Some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters.
I can certainly assure you that the Commission will specifically use the EU-ASEAN meetings as a bilateral context in which to raise all these problems.
These meetings will take place in Brussels in the first six months of this year, and we shall be talking about everything I have just mentioned and also about the separate and specific problems you have raised about actual cases of political prisoners.
With regard to Guinea, I should like to point out that we are concerned about the situation in that country, and especially about the ongoing deterioration in the human rights situation as a result of the attacks suffered by the United Revolutionary Front.
We fully support CEDEAO' s attempts at mediation.
You raised the problem of refugees. The Commission believes that absolute priority should be given to rehousing them in the camps farthest away from the border, that is to say as far away as possible from the combat zones.
As matters stand at present, repatriating them to Sierra Leone is unthinkable because two other objectives have priority: reinforcing the camps around Kissidougou, north of Gueckedou, and adapting the access roads to these camps.
The Commission is pursuing a two-pronged strategy through ECHO, on the one hand in the framework of the year 2000 intervention plan for Sierra Leone' s refugees through which an amount of more than EUR 2.5 million has already been allocated to the operations in Guinea and, on the other hand, in the framework of the contracts which have been entered into with the associated NGOs and which are being modified to take account of recent events.
ECHO is also preparing two funding decisions for 2001: one in favour of Sierra Leone, for EUR 11 million; and the other in favour of Guinea, for between EUR 3 and 6 million.
Two additional topics commented on during the debate were the responsibilities of Liberia - what can be done? - and the problems in Guinea.
With regard to Liberia, I should like to point out that, as you have indicated, the experts' report from the United Nations on arms and diamonds in Sierra Leone makes it crystal clear what Liberia' s responsibilities are in the conflict.
At present, possible courses of action to be taken against Charles Taylor are being debated.
What can the Commission do in the meantime?
We can use the tools available to us and, with that in view, the possibility is being examined of instituting a consultancy procedure with regard to Liberia in application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
With regard to Guinea, the situation has indeed deteriorated. Recently, the death penalty was imposed upon five people and, as a number of you also pointed out, the subject of Alpha CondÃ© has not been clarified.
The Commission passed on the concerns that are felt about this specific matter to a Guinean delegation headed by the Foreign Affairs Minister, which visited Brussels at the end of January.
With regard to Nigeria, I should like to point out that the Commission condemns the flagellation of an adolescent in accordance with Islamic law and is concerned specifically about the application of the Sharia in some areas of Nigeria.
The Commission is aware - as I believe you too are - of the fact that the situation in Nigeria is politically very sensitive and that the new, democratically elected government is endeavouring to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria.
The Commission and the Member States will be meeting in March to try to reach some common position on Nigeria.
The meeting will consider what is the best way to deal with these various topics.
In the meantime, you ask what we are able to do.
A mission from Brussels is discussing, in Nigeria, how the future programme for that country is to be implemented.
The issues of democracy, the constitutional state and respect for human rights will be dealt with as a priority with a view to the decisions that have to be made regarding them.
The final subject you raised with me was the subject of Pakistan.
In accordance with the resolutions you tabled concerning freedom of expression in Pakistan, the Commission acknowledges that the incident which recently occurred at the border post of Peshawar is cause for alarm and especially regrettable in view of the fact that, to date, Pakistan has generally respected the freedom of the press, especially since the military coup of October 1999.
It is true that, compared with other countries in southern Asia, its attitude is, or has been, relatively commendable.
However, the incident makes it clear that the European Union should remain alert to the issue of freedom of expression in general and freedom of the press in particular.
There is the fear that the existence of an independent and diverse press, permitted until now by Pakistan - one of the most liberal of Islamic countries - may be compromised.
In spite of the public apologies offered by the editors of the newspaper, Frontier Post, there is indeed no guarantee that no action will be taken against them.
If action is, in fact, taken against them, it will undoubtedly help create an atmosphere hostile to the press in general.
We therefore believe it is vital to carry out a very detailed investigation of the incident in order to determine whether possible interests that have not been clearly defined have led to the paper' s being closed down.
Apart from all this, the legitimate concern for the safety of the newspaper' s staff is, as a number of you have pointed out, connected with the application of the law on blasphemy.
The Commission believes that the military government should make a major effort to control religious intolerance in Pakistan and regrets that earlier initiatives to change the blasphemy law were blocked.
In the specific political discussions with the Pakistani Government in November 2000, the troika, while congratulating the government on its commitment to respecting human rights and media freedom, indicated that there were still problems in a number of areas, particularly when it came to judicial practices and the restrictions upon the activities of political parties.
The troika also took the opportunity to indicate its concern about the concessions being made to a number of groups advocating intolerance.
There is no doubt at all that, in the absence of a democratic counterweight, the influence of such groups can increase.
That, then, is what the Commission is doing to improve the human rights situation.
The Commission is prepared to support any actions taken by civil organisations in Pakistan, with such actions to be funded through the European initiative in favour of democracy and human rights. It is also examining the possibility of supporting means to improve public administration in Pakistan, which would be to everyone' s advantage.

B5-0140/2001, by Mr Markov and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Chechnya;
B5-0150/2001, by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Chechnya.
Mr President, one passage in the Russian press on the ongoing Chechen tragedy struck me deeply.
In an interview the Russian parliamentarian Boris Nemtsov describes a meeting with a young Chechen woman in a refugee camp in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia.
I quote: 'She said to me: You Russians are busy exterminating us.
You are committing genocide.
But you won' t succeed.
Because we shall simply outstrip you in population growth.'
In order to support her assertion Nemtsov' s interviewee told him that a large number of children had been born last year in the refugee camps in Ingushetia.
The majority of them were boys, claimed the Chechen woman.
'And they will all join the partisans later,' she concluded.
Who except God alone will be able to fully plumb the depths of the suffering of the Chechen civilian population?
After a terrible war in the period 1994-1996, for the last eighteen months it has again been the victim of Russian-Chechen hostilities.
The fierce, belligerent indictment of these Chechen refugees, can be put in an historical and political context.
Remember the horrors that Stalin inflicted on the Chechen people in the 1940s.
Such a destructive cry of despair demands a serious political answer.
Gratifyingly, Boris Nemtsov promises to devote his energies to this.
This very month he will present an all-embracing plan of action for the reconstruction of Chechnya.
His aims are clear: to offer a real opportunity for the host of Chechen refugees to return home and to prevent Chechen youth from joining the ranks of the 'partisans' .
This different, sensible political note from the Russian Federation deserves the moral support of the European Parliament.
I therefore respectfully request the Council and the Commission in the forthcoming meetings with President Putin and his government to adopt this peaceful Russian solution to the Russo-Chechen tragedy.
Then Chechen and Russian blood will no longer have to flow on such a huge scale in the Northern Caucasus.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome Mr Oumar Kandief, Minister for Health in the legitimate Chechen Government, who is seated in the public gallery.
He is also a doctor and a surgeon.
I would also like to thank my friend, Mr Bernd Posselt, in particular, for his efforts to ensure that Parliament is at long last adopting a resolution on Chechnya.
We should have done so a long time ago, but we have finally got round to it today.
I believe that it is a good text and I would also like to stress to my friends and fellow Members in the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the collaboration between all the groups has been valuable.
It is not the text that I had hoped for, but I believe that it is a good resolution nonetheless.
Mr Kandief could tell us and has told us, and all the Members who have met him over the last few days, a great deal about cluster bombs and needle bombs, the hospitals that he managed and which were systematically destroyed by the Russian authorities, about the acts of torture committed on the injured and the amputees that he had to look after and about the torture he was subjected to in order to prevent him from caring for the other injured people.
I urge you to invite him to your own country to appear on television and speak to newspapers.
I believe that his eyewitness account is particularly important.
Ladies and gentlemen, Chechnya is a source of shame to us and to Europe.
The events taking place in Chechnya go beyond anything we may have seen in recent years and we have witnessed many tragic events.
I believe that the European Union and the Commission have an important role to play.
Mr Poul Nielson' s behaviour is unacceptable, appalling even.
Not once since war broke out in Chechnya, 18 months ago, has Poul Nielson found time to visit the country to take stock of the tragedy that is unfolding there. in my opinion, this does the Commission little credit.
I am not sure if we should have a collection to pay for his plane ticket, but I believe that, unless the Commission changes its policy, Parliament shall soon be calling for his resignation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is about to adopt its 13th resolution since the outbreak of the first war in Chechnya in 1994.
Let me make it clear that I want our resolution today to be understood on the one hand as an urgent appeal to the Russian Government to stop violating human rights in Chechnya and to play its part in the initiation of long-overdue measures of de-escalation and on the other hand - and let me emphasise this quite clearly - as an encouragement for those on both sides - Russians and Chechens - who are trying to bring about a peaceful end to this conflict at long last.
As you know, our counterparts in the Council of Europe have recognised the efforts of the Russian representatives - and there certainly have been such efforts - to improve the human rights situation in Chechnya by restoring their voting rights in the Strasbourg assembly.
This, however, was done in spite of exhortations to the contrary by human rights organisations.
I really do think this was rather an ambivalent signal to send, and I presume that the Troika and Commissioner Patten, who are in Moscow at the moment, will raise this issue with the Russian Government and will call on the Russian side to resolve this distressing situation.
The analysis delivered by the Human Rights Watch on the situation in Chechnya is very alarming.
Nevertheless, I assume that those on the Russian side who are genuinely committed to finding a non-military solution to the Chechen conflict will win the day.
The facts of the situation have to be faced; the population of Chechnya has already shrunk to half its previous size, and it is time to pave the way for them to live in peace.
Mr President, last December the European Parliament adopted a highly critical resolution and declared that it would not remain silent in the face of continued abuses of human rights, particularly the sort of abuses that have been taking place in the last two years of the war in Chechnya.
Nor shall we permit the Commission and the Council, when they travel to Moscow as the Troika, to make do with a passing reference, between the main course and the dessert, to the murders and torture that are still being perpetrated in the camps and police stations of the Northern Caucasus.
Commissioner Patten is there now, so let me ask the Commission what sanctions he has threatened to apply if the Russian Government continues to do nothing to resolve the conflict peacefully, if it is not prepared to engage in talks and to arraign those who are responsible for the violations of human rights.
We have ample ground to stand on: we have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have our strategy, and we are unanimous in our view that cooperation must be conditional on respect for human rights.
The carrot-and-stick method is the right approach for us, which is why investments in the oil business can only be made on the basis of a peace settlement in Chechnya.
Mr President, I cannot speak about Chechnya here without thinking back more than ten years when the Baltic States were struggling for their freedom.
Many Members of this Parliament, among them Michael Gahler, played a part in the effort to secure the freedom of the Baltic States.
I was in the Baltic States at that time too.
It was a Chechen, the Soviet general Dzhokhar Dudayev, later to become the first President of Chechnya, who refused to crush the independence movement in the Baltic States.
He took this stance in Estonia and Latvia in particular.
Thereafter, as we know, the secession of Lithuania was unfortunately a far less peaceful process, thanks to the brutal excesses of the OMON militias.
And so a Chechen played his part in ensuring that European countries, which will soon be members of the European Union, did not have to undergo the baptism of blood that one or two people had in mind for them.
As this example - along with the fact that Chechnya lies within the ambit of the Council of Europe and its Human Rights Convention - shows us quite clearly, Chechnya is not one of those problems on the opposite side of the globe but an essentially European problem.
That is why it is such a disgrace that an unholy alliance of deceit and self-deception has been forged.
The deceit is partly the product of official government propaganda in Moscow.
The self-deception is happening here.
It consists in a refusal to register what is actually happening in Chechnya.
It is not a matter of the occasional atrocity but of systematic genocide.
Mrs Schroedter was perfectly correct when she stated that half of the Chechen population has been murdered or driven out of Chechnya.
This is systematic genocide of the Chechen people for the sake of energy resources and geostrategic interests.
That is why we must exert intense pressure and say quite clearly to the Russians that the partnership agreement is rooted in human rights.
If human rights are not respected, the partnership cannot function.
We must tell our Russian partners quite clearly that this is a sine qua non in our eyes and that it is high time they started negotiating with the elected representatives of the Chechen people.
Mr President, just a year and a half on from the start of the war, Parliament' s initial assessment has been proved right.
It has proved impossible to solve any of the problems by military means, and all parties have been the losers.
It is tragic that each side should resort to unacceptable methods in response to the other side' s resistance instead of finally sitting down at the negotiating table and beginning the process of reconstruction.
I welcome the commitment of Parliament to respect for human rights in the refugee and prison camps.
In a situation where violence is used on a routine basis, our delegations, observer missions and resolutions may be able to ease the problem, but I am convinced that they will not solve it.
This is why I believe that one of our priorities will be to help this region to shape a new vision for the future.
The first requirement is intensive dialogue.
To this end, we should continue to use all the means available to us through our links with the Russian Duma.
Sweeping condemnations, however, are unhelpful.
We shall only be able to make progress in negotiations with the Russians if we take their concerns seriously too.
Terrorist attacks in southern Russia and military operations by guerrillas in Chechnya, I am sorry to say, are still taking place.
A short time ago, we adopted the Oostlander report, in which we explicitly welcomed the European Union' s twin-track strategy in relation to Russia.
The human rights violations in Chechnya must be condemned, but at the same time we must continue to develop cooperation and dialogue.
In my opinion, both components of this strategy offer scope for further development.
As far as Chechnya is concerned, however, I am worried.
It seems to me that the criticism of conditions in the refugee and prison camps which is voiced by the Council and the Commission, as well as by the governments of the Member States, whenever they meet with the Russians, has become something of a mechanical routine which has absolutely no effect.
For that reason I should like to ask the Commission to specify the measures it proposes to take in the immediate future in order to make progress towards a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya.
Mr President, we in the ELDR Group are in despair and filled with impotent rage concerning what is happening in Chechnya.
The medieval warfare against civilians violates everything in which we believe in the European Union and cannot be justified in terms of the terrorist actions perpetrated by certain groups of Chechens.
What the Russians are doing infringes a long list of international obligations to which they themselves have signed up.
It may well be that we cannot do anything about it.
It may well be that it is no use threatening Russia with sanctions and isolation, but here in Parliament, in the stronghold of freedom of expression, it must be said loudly and clearly that we condemn the abuses, the executions, the disappearances, the concentration camps and the systematic oppression of a whole people.
We condemn the brutalisation which we are seeing and which offers unpleasant reminders of the past.
We urge that the way should now be opened for missions from the UN High Commission, the OSCE and the Red Cross to be permitted to evaluate the atrocities and come to the rescue of the population.
Mr President, the Commission continues to follow events closely in Chechnya, and we agree that the situation is far from satisfactory.
We ought to take account, however, of a number of recent developments.
The decisions taken recently by President Putin and the Russian Government with a view to normalising the situation in that republic in the Northern Caucasus are certainly worth mentioning.
Mr Kadirov' s former provisional Chechen administration has become permanent.
Control of the security forces is now in civilian hands.
A substantial reduction in the troops stationed in Chechnya is planned.
It is also worth mentioning that the Federal Government has announced a substantial increase in the resources to be devoted to rebuilding Chechnya.
Despite these hoped-for improvements, the present situation is indeed still causing great concern.
Reports are still being received stating that members of the security forces have violated human rights.
The Russian administration is certainly not following up these reports properly, despite the efforts made by the office of Mr Kalamanov, presidential representative for human rights.
To give you an indication of the inadequacy of the response, the number of cases taken to the courts can be counted on the fingers of one hand and, as far as we are aware, not a single sentence has yet been handed down.
Some essential steps have been taken in the judicial area.
A number of district and central courts have been set up, and over twenty judges have been trained and appointed in Chechnya.
However, for the practical benefit of these measures to be felt by the citizens, greater cooperation on the part of certain authorities is called for, especially the military prosecutors.
The Commission has made repeated representations to this effect to the Russian authorities and my colleague Commissioner Patten is raising the matter again in Moscow today.
I am sure that on his return he will be very well placed to update you on this matter which is of particular concern to you as indeed it is to us.
I should like to emphasise that the Commission is continuing to provide political and material support for Mr Kalamanov through the TACIS programme.
It must, however, be noted that no agreement has been reached concerning the technical conditions to allow the immediate return of the OSCE support group to Chechnya.
We are working with the Romanian Presidency on this matter. We still aim to have the support group back in the field as soon as possible, but in reasonable conditions of safety and with unrestricted freedom of movement within the Chechen Republic.
I could also mention the need to improve the conditions relating to the provision of humanitarian aid. This involves travel permits and the possibilities for communication.
However, we are all very familiar with these issues and I do not think it is worth dwelling on them.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the situation seems to be improving, although a very great deal remains to be done.
We have yet to see the extent to which and how soon the Russian authorities implement the measures they have announced.
In this regard, it has already been stated that troop reductions will be effected as the military situation allows. This is worrying, because the reduction may be slower that we hope for.
Nonetheless, these measures are essentially positive and it is to be hoped that they will enable a permanent political solution to be achieved.
The Russian Government recognised the need for a political solution in the joint declaration made after the last summit with the European Union held in Paris last October.
Pending such a solution, the Commission will continue to seize the opportunities offered by the many regular political contacts with the Russian authorities to convince them of the need to investigate violations of human rights in Chechnya more thoroughly and efficiently. We shall also urge them to prevent such violations and, if appropriate, to punish those responsible.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Natural disasters
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
Earthquake in India
B5-0103/2001, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the earthquake in India;
B5-0112/2001, by Mr Van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the earthquake in India;
B5-0130/2001, by Mr Thomas Mann and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the earthquake in India;
B5-0141/2001, by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the earthquake in India;
B5-0151/2001, by Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the earthquake in India;
Floods in Portugal - B5-0093/2001, by Mr Figueiredo and Mr Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the serious consequences of the severe weather conditions in Portugal;
B5-0094/2001, by Mr Marinho and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the floods and storms in Portugal;
B5-0095/2001, by Mr QueirÃ³ and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the floods in Portugal;
B5-0131/2001, by Mr Cunha and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the floods in Portugal.
Earthquake in India
Mr President, I think that the tragedy unfolding in India demanded some response from the European Parliament.
I hope that the Commission' s action will be fully adequate to this tragedy which has left more than a million people homeless and has caused immeasurable damage.
I believe that this is also an important issue since the European Union must strengthen its cooperation and work towards a strategic partnership with India.
I hope that Commissioner Patten, in particular, will ensure that everything is done to deal with this tragedy as best we can.
I have only one other brief point to mention to my fellow Members.
In paragraph 4 of our resolution, we point out that some buildings in this region were weakened by structural faults.
I am not at all sure that we should labour this point, given the current problems faced by the people of India.
I tabled an amendment to withdraw this paragraph.
I hope that my fellow Members will adopt this amendment.
Mr President, the worst natural disaster since the creation of the Indian Union has left the world' s largest democracy in a state of deep shock. It is not only India that has been stunned by events.
The pictures of the devastation in the State of Gujarat are etched in all our minds: one hundred thousand killed and several hundred thousand forced to leave their homes which have been completely destroyed - these people are now homeless, destitute and without work.
I have been struck by the scale of the rapid response from the international community and the donations from private individuals.
What fine examples of humanity and solidarity in an increasingly unfeeling world.
Special teams, including several from Europe, were on hand to pull survivors out of the rubble.
Help is flooding in.
Medical supplies, food by the tonne load, clothing, blankets, installations to help provide clean drinking water and also prevent the outbreak of typhoid, cholera and hepatitis.
Row upon row of tents have been erected to provide essential, albeit makeshift, refuge against the bitterly cold nights.
This is all a source of comfort to the earthquake victims and their family members, many of whom reside in the European Union.
The Commission has generously released EUR 13 million in emergency aid and there is a good chance that this aid package, distributed via the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office to six international aid organisations, will directly reach the earthquake victims.
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will also be involved in achieving the successful reconstruction of the region.
The damage to property alone amounts to over EUR 3 billion.
And what actions have the Indians themselves taken?
They have set up a committee, supported by all parties, dedicated to active disaster management.
The authorities have acted quickly despite a series of aftershocks.
The electricity supply was restored within days and towns were able to get back on their feet as streets and squares were cleared.
We should applaud the efforts of our Indian friends.
Floods in Portugal
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as has already been stated in this House, the harsh winter in Portugal this year has been characterised by terrible floods which have caused loss of human life and enormous suffering, high levels of material damage costing billions of escudos, the destruction or damage of homes, transport infrastructure, telecommunications networks and energy grids and considerable damage to economic sectors, particularly agriculture and trade.
Now, as we all know, Portugal has one of the lowest levels of GDP per capita in the European Union and the forecast made by the Commission in its second report on economic and social cohesion estimates that last year, Portugal moved even further away from the real convergence that it had experienced since 1991.
It is therefore crucial that the European Union provides exceptional aid in order to address the damage that has been done and to make its contribution to the huge effort that is currently underway.
We therefore urge the Commission, together with the Portuguese Government and local authorities, to provide exceptional financial aid to complement the resources that have been made available by the Portuguese authorities in order to meet the urgent needs of the communities that have been most badly affected, and to facilitate the rebuilding of infrastructure that has been destroyed and the resumption of economic activity.
A reallocation of appropriations that have already been earmarked is not enough.
I repeat that what is needed is exceptional aid.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, hardly a single winter that I have lived through has stuck in my memory, but this year, winter made itself memorable in a particularly harsh way in Portugal, as Mrs Figueiredo has just described.
Almost every single river in Portugal burst its banks and there are towns in my country which have suffered four consecutive floods in the course of this winter with the rains that have fallen since November.
The crisis was felt particularly acutely in the centre of the country, affecting the Mondego basin most tragically, but it affected communities to some extent throughout the country.
The Portuguese authorities and the civil defence forces have made huge efforts to remedy the situation.
Now, questions about reconstruction are being asked and I would add my voice to those of my fellow Portuguese Members in asking the Commission to work together with the Portuguese authorities at national and local level to aid reconstruction, to list the damage done and to support the reconstruction of the areas that have been affected with both financial and technical resources.
I should also like to express my solidarity with the victims.
Given the scale of the floods that have swept across our country this winter, and let us hope that they are over, because the bad weather is continuing, we must once again draw your attention to regional planning policies and to the need to ensure the balance of our ecosystems. In this matter, I would also ask for the assistance that would result from dialogue with other Member countries of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nature has, once again, been merciless and the fury of the torrential rain and the unruly rivers has spread destruction and suffering. We have seen enormous material damage, families made homeless, injured and even killed.
Once again, an appeal to European solidarity is being made in this Parliament and it is the Commission' s duty to find ways of putting this into practice.
The Commission must not hide behind a lack of funds - the people who have been affected do not want to hear administrative excuses.
It is our duty to prove that Europe is not only a generous idea but also an efficient organisation.
There are, however, two fundamental issues that are worth recalling.
The first, broader issue is that of environmental protection and climate change.
Only a few years ago, anyone who mentioned these matters was dismissed as being utopian, alarmist and even a little mad.
Today, the evidence is clear for all to see and we have to act effectively to prevent the situation throughout the world from deteriorating.
The second issue concerns my country, Portugal.
Let no one be in any doubt; I do not intend to give in to demagogy: my country' s government and local authorities are not responsible for the rains that fell, but they do have a responsibility from which they cannot shy away. They must show greater rigour in regional planning and greater resistance to urban speculation, they must refuse permission to build in areas at risk from flooding and establish better management of river beds and dam outlets.
We must all work together, not only in order to help the people who need urgent assistance, but also in taking precautions with the measures and actions that predict and reduce the probability of similar disasters in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Commission, as my fellow Portuguese Members have said, the abundant rainfall, the storms and the floods have caused enormous material damage, injuries and deaths in the Douro, Mondego and Tagus basins.
They have caused a genuine disaster.
In requesting the support and the solidarity of the European Union, we are not trying to solicit an emotional reaction; we do not want to give the impression that we are courting pity or that we are merely asking for help.
The Portuguese Government has not failed to provide support for the areas that have been affected and there has been no lack of national solidarity. Financial support from the European Union, however, is just as important for Portugal as it is for the European Union itself.
In fact, even more important than the material size of such a contribution is its symbolic, moral and emotional effect.
Strengthening the sense of belonging to the European Union and the awareness of European citizenship also requires these small, symbolic gestures and brings Europe closer to the people.
The communities that have been affected by the storms and the population will, in general, feel that the European Union is not indifferent to their tragedies and problems.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the best way for the European Union to touch people' s hearts, regardless of how much it contributes.
This is why we are asking the Commission to use its imagination and to provide an answer to our request and to our proposals.
Mr President, regarding, first of all, the European Parliament' s resolution on the earthquake in India, I want to point out - and a number of you have already made this point - that the Commission approved its emergency first aid to the value of EUR 3 million on 30 January, just four days after the events.
This decision, like all emergency decisions, enabled operations to be funded from the first day of the emergency. Its objective was to provide immediate aid not only through the distribution of blankets, clothes, medicines and health care and the provision of food and drinking water, but also through the creation of a field hospital in Bhuj.
As Mr Mann has pointed out, this operation involved our collaborating with six humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam UK, Care International, the German Red Cross and Save the Children in the United Kingdom.
Each of these organisations concerned itself with a specific area of activity and, in our opinion, the results have been positive.
The Commission has now announced its decision to provide a further EUR 10 million.
We expect this decision to be finalised in the course of next week, as soon as the priorities have been established and assessments have been made of needs on the ground and of the NGOs' proposals.
It is crucial to current, and any future, aid that we avoid duplication in the use of resources, as well as the problems which might be created by types of urgent need not covered by one or other financial aid provider.
It is therefore vital to deal with all aid opportunities together and, in order to fill the gap between emergency and long-term aid, the Commission will lose no time at all in sending a study mission to assess reconstruction and renovation needs in situ.
This mission will work in close conjunction with the Member States, and its results will enable us to decide better how to carry out future initiatives in cooperation with other international institutions as well.
Regarding the specific problem of floods and natural disasters in Portugal, I can tell you that Portugal has certainly suffered a very hard winter.
There have undoubtedly been problems in many regions of Europe, involving heavy rain and storms, together with floods which have caused considerable material damage and, in certain cases, the loss of human life as well.
On 16 November 2000, I myself appeared before this House to comment on the extremely serious floods in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France and Italy, and I should like once again to express the Commission' s concern about these matters. We wish to be associated with the demonstrations of support and solidarity addressed by this House to the victims of this new disaster, specifically in Portugal.
As early as 31 January, my colleague Michel Barnier used the occasion of the part-session in Brussels to express his openness towards any request from the Portuguese authorities to re-adjust the programming of the Structural Funds.
When we talk about re-adjusting the programming of the Structural Funds, we are not, as some of you may possibly have thought, talking about applying a different use to the same resources as previously existed for the country but, instead, of reconsidering the overall programming of the Funds.
I should also like to remind you that, on Wednesday, 25 October 2000 before this House, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, speaking on behalf of the Commission, specified the latter' s role in the field of civil protection and explained the opportunities offered to us by the current Budget in terms of how the EAGGF and ERDF Structural Funds might be deployed, together with the Interreg 3 Community initiative which, in its inter-regional chapter, includes cooperation in the field of natural or industrial disasters.
There is no other room for manoeuvre within the Budget.
Within the 'Community Action Programme - Civil Protection' , the Commission is therefore prepared to consider a project to be submitted by the Member State affected, aimed at identifying the areas at risk from flooding in the European Union.
Finally, I should like once again to remind you of the Commission' s concern and of its willingness, within the framework of what is at present possible, to respond promptly and positively to the requests which Portugal might, under this general heading, submit as a consequence of these events.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate on items on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The oral question on the Stability Plan in Ireland and France is scheduled for 5.30 p.m. I shall, therefore, suspend the sitting of Parliament for 15 minutes.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Stability plans in Ireland and France
The next item is the oral question (B5-0009/2001) by Mr von Wogau, Mr Suominen and Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission, on the Stability Plans in Ireland and France.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to deal with why we have tabled this issue regarding decisions in Ireland.
I believe that it should be considered that we have reached a new stage in the development of the European Union and in the integration of the economies in the European Union.
Today twelve Member States make up a Common Market with a single currency. A domestic market in the original sense.
It is imperative that economic policy in this European domestic market is drawn up in accordance with common guidelines.
In this respect, we are pleased that the European Commission and the Ecofin Council have taken action in this area.
It is the first time that a decision regarding one of these Member States has been taken in this way and this decision concerns the stability of the European currency.
As you are aware, in all debates in this House my group has repeatedly granted the utmost priority to the stability of the European currency and we shall continue to do so in future.
We believe that a stable currency is one of the key building blocks for a social market economy and that this is also necessary for the European currency.
Let there be no doubt that this shall remain a priority for us in the future.
However, I would ask whether the European Commission and the members of the Ecofin Council have picked the right target for this, the first decision of its kind.
Ireland is without a shadow of a doubt one of the European Union' s model children. It is questionable whether other countries are in the position to reduce their deficits.
Ireland achieves surpluses.
Other countries still have a huge total debt of over 100% while at the same time Ireland is in the process of reducing its debt to under 40% and so can likewise be held up as a model for other European Union Member States.
While other countries are battling unemployment, Ireland has made exemplary progress in this regard with the creation of new jobs.
While other Member States are battling with slow economic growth, Ireland is enjoying growth rates that other Member States can only dream of.
It should be said, however, that the Irish economy is overheating as a result of this strong growth and that, consequently, there is a risk that this could be to the disadvantage of the Irish people.
For example, if I take rent and property prices in Dublin and compare these with those in Frankfurt it becomes quite clear that the development of these prices also has a detrimental effect on the Irish people.
In this respect clearly something must be done.
The question is, however, who shall take the action?
Should it be the European Union who intervenes or is this a matter that should and can be settled by Ireland, the Irish Government or the Irish Parliament themselves?
This then raises the question: who should be responsible for European economic policy in the future?
We must work towards ensuring that this responsibility is set out quite clearly.
We must be clear on who is responsible for what, so that where there is success praise may be given and where there is failure, which may also occur, we are able to say that a particular country or a particular institution is at fault.
A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union.
The European Union is without doubt responsible for competition, the competition between businesses in the European Union.
As Commissioner Mario Monti has demonstrated time and time again, the European Commission takes this task very seriously indeed.
The European Commission is also responsible for currency stability, on the one hand through the strong European Central Bank and on the other hand through finance ministers, charged with monitoring the stability and growth pact.
The European Union, is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability.
Responsibility for taxes, on the other hand, still undoubtedly lies with the Member States of the European Union.
The same applies to social security systems and education.
This then raises the question: what is happening with currency stability or, more precisely, have occurrences in Ireland jeopardised currency stability within the eurozone?
Just imagine a different situation.
Imagine that the inflation rate in Germany stands at 6 or 7%.
As Germany makes up one third of the gross national product in the eurozone, this would instantly lead to a sharp increase in the average inflation rates in the European Union, to such an extent that the European Central Bank would be forced to spring into action and thus the economy would be curbed.
Ireland is however a small economy with a gross national product little above that of west London.
The overheating of the Irish economy has no influence whatsoever at a European level, so there is no need for action at the level of the European Central Bank.
Ireland no longer has the opportunity as before, when the Irish Central Bank could raise interest rates, of contributing to the deceleration of the economy.
Therefore, Ireland must themselves be responsible, also for the Irish people, for reducing the overheating of the economy somehow or other. How this is to be achieved I leave up to the Irish.
I do not wish to raise this at the level of the European Union.
Now, turning to my second question. On 12 January a decision was made by the European Commission to pay EUR 401 million to Ireland.
EUR 726 million in supplementary funds followed, funds that were also pumped into the Irish economy.
In this regard I would like to ask whether a conversation took place between Commissioner Solbes and Commissioner Barnier with a view to resolving this obvious contradiction.
In other words, what is happening in Germany, in France and in Italy gives much more cause for concern regarding the stability of the euro.
I hope that the European Commission will have the same courage, when it comes to dealing with these large countries.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, I should like to thank Mr von Wogau for having raised a subject I believe deserves to be debated.
His approach was correct when it comes to the way in which this matter is to be reflected upon, and I shall try to follow his line of reasoning.
I shall begin at the end, with the question of why our decisions do not in any way affect transfers of resources.
Why are we talking about the coordination of economic policy? We are talking neither about problems of regional policy, nor of competition, nor of taxation, nor of any other such factor.
I want to make an initial remark so that we are all familiar with, or are clear about, the model we have agreed in the Treaty of Maastricht, according to which the coordination of economic policies is based on a tool, known as the broad economic guidelines, approved each June by European Councils at the proposal of the Ministers of Finance.
This is the basic document for economic policy coordination, and one with which you are very familiar because you have had occasion to discuss it more than once in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This document includes decisions of a general kind, together with decisions aimed specifically at Member States and containing practical recommendations which - I want to emphasise - are unanimously approved by the European Council. Obviously, the document also includes the points of view of each and every one of the Member States which sign the decisions.
In order to maintain a proper balance between fiscal and monetary policies, the Stability Pact is, of course, implemented alongside the broad economic guidelines.
As a result, we may sometimes have the impression that, as in the case of Ireland, actions are taken which may be difficult to reconcile with observing the criteria of the Stability Pact.
I believe it is important to say first of all that Ireland has met the requirements of the Stability Pact and continues to do so, with more than enough room to spare, and that the Irish authorities deserve every kind praise for pushing ahead with their structural reforms and running the public finances well.
It is true that the Irish economy has continued to grow very strongly in the year 2000, but also true - and we are now coming on to the first point you raised - that it is overheating.
Is overheating important in terms of a balanced overall picture?
I have no intention whatsoever of getting into whether each specific measure is or is not correct. Such measures are the responsibility of the Member States, and I have no objections to make.
We are talking about general, overall positions.
Overheating of the Irish economy is not a new problem.
It dates back to 1998 and had already been revealed in the broad economic guidelines.
It was also revealed in 1999 and again in 2000.
In the year 2000 - and I am referring here to a decision adopted by the European Council, proposed by the Ministers of Finance and applicable in every Member State - it was stated that, given the further overheating of the economy, budgetary policy had to be used to ensure economic stability and that the 2001 budget ought to be managed with that in mind.
What are, so to speak, the contents of the 2001 budget?
I believe that knowing this may help us to clarify two issues: what is the reason for the concern of the Commission, firstly, and of the Member States, secondly.
I shall quote two facts from the 2001 budget: the fact that the current expenditure approved in the budget assumes a 1.06% increase in Irish Gross Domestic Product, and the fact that tax is to be reduced by 0.57%.
As a result of these two factors, total demand is therefore being stimulated to the tune of 1.6% of Irish Gross Domestic Product.
There is another fact I think is interesting on the subject of the broad economic guidelines we were talking about.
The message is to seek or maintain a balanced budgetary policy and, if necessary, to have a somewhat more restrictive budgetary policy designed to offset any difficulties Ireland might have as a result of a monetary policy which is defined for the eurozone and is, logically enough, too expansive for Irish conditions.
If, for example, we analyse the figures which we normally use to see how economies behave and which show the main impact on the cyclically adjusted surplus, we see that, whereas in 2000 the figure was a budgetary increase of 0.4% of GDP, in 2001 the figure was 0.9%.
This matter is certainly being discussed by the Irish Government and the Commission.
The former believes that the figures we have calculated show an additional 0.3% increase.
On the basis of the figures provided to us by the government - and this is the topic under discussion in Eurostat - we are able to arrive at somewhat different figures.
That is why, in the recommendation, we effectively acknowledge this situation and refer to 0.5%.
I would turn now to a third factor. An important topic when it comes to the behaviour of economies is the way in which supply operates in relation to demand and whether the growth in demand is more rapid than existing supply.
In technical terms, we measure this using what is called the potential output gap, which shows the amount by which demand is growing in excess of supply.
In 2000, the potential output gap was 4.5%. In other words, Ireland was demanding 4.5% more than what it was producing.
In 2001, that figure has risen to 5.4%.
We are therefore talking about a very expansionist budgetary policy, at a time when the Irish Government has committed itself, in terms of the broad economic guidelines, to a budgetary policy which, in principle, ought to be more restrictive with a view to offsetting the other problems.
Let us move on to the second point which you raised and which I think is especially interesting: the fact that the Irish economy is relatively small and its impact on the eurozone minimal.
That argument makes sense and might lead us - like many economists - to conclude by asking why, if we did not have any other types of commitment, we should take action over Ireland if that country does not affect monetary policy.
I also believe that, in connection with this argument, we ought to be asking ourselves two related questions.
Firstly, can we treat the Member States of the European Union unequally?
And should some Member States be able to do what they themselves consider appropriate while others cannot, according to whether they are smaller or larger countries?
The second important point is that we could discuss whether that is the model to be applied in the future. But in any case, that is not the model we are applying today in accordance with current legislation.
It is therefore absolutely vital, at least from the Commission' s point of view, that, if we are to fulfil our role as guardian of the Treaties, we should apply the Treaties in the form in which they exist at present.
On this basis, the Commission did what it considered its duty, which was to send a recommendation to the Council of Ministers in accordance with the provisions of Article 99(4).
I very much emphasised the fact that, when I speak of a recommendation, I am not referring to sanctions.
I appreciate that, from the media' s point of view, it is much more appealing to talk in terms of sanctions.
When we speak about recommendations, we are indicating to the Irish Government that the budgetary policy it has defined is inconsistent with what they agreed and will lead to additional problems concerned with the overheating of its economy.
In the explanatory statement, we put a figure on the recommendation, saying that we considered there to be 0.5% overheating.
That is something we can discuss.
The figure will vary depending upon the methodologies we use.
On that basis, it is obviously for the Irish Government to do what it considers appropriate.
The Commission' s position was presented to the Council of Ministers, which approved it by consensus.
That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment and, like yourselves, I believe it must be accorded due importance because, if it is indeed an important milestone in applying our model for coordinating economic policies, we ought not to attempt to draw conclusions of a kind which the Commission never of course intended.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have to ask you to keep within your speaking time, because we must hold the votes on topical and urgent subjects at 6.30 p.m.
Madam President, Commissioner, when we in Ireland signed up for economic and monetary union, we accepted the central tenet of economic and monetary union, namely closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States.
The key elements in this process are the stability and growth pact, which is at the heart of economic policy coordination.
Secondly, we have the annual, and I underline annual, broad economic policy guidelines - a lesser known element of the economic policy development process.
As well as European-wide, there are country-specific guidelines identifying policy priorities and particular circumstances.
Commissioner, I was listening carefully to see if I could extract from what you said precisely what breaches of the country-specific guidelines Ireland is guilty of to warrant the recommendations of the Ecofin Council under Article 99 of the Treaty, last Monday, at your behest.
Our finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, told the Irish Parliament this week that he had no problem with advice to Ireland setting out the Council's view of the appropriate policy mix to achieve economic stability.
But he felt this view should have taken the form of an opinion, as in the normal course, particularly in view of the comparative performance of the Irish economy relative to other EU Member States.
An opinion, Commissioner, rather than a recommendation.
Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response?
Would not an opinion have sufficed, given the very heavy political fall-out from the recommendation in Ireland, where we are in an election year and very likely face a referendum on Nice, this episode has been oats to the eurosceptics.
And the same applies elsewhere, particularly in the United Kingdom.
There is also nervousness about the Commission's involvement in tax policy generally in the post-Nice situation.
This latest episode does not help.
I fail to see why Ireland's transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully, more diplomatically, with more understanding - both by you, Commissioner, and indeed by our somewhat maverick, though genial, finance minister.
To many observers it appears to have been in the end about egos and macho behaviour all round - all in the context of an economic turnaround in Ireland in the last six to seven years that is the envy of many.
The charge is that Ireland is to seek to achieve economic stability and, in that context, our last budget was deemed to be over-inflationary.
There are occasions when "a one size fits all" economic model does not fit.
The biggest threat to Ireland at the moment is wage inflation fuelled by 75,000 job vacancies.
Securing the continuation of social partnership with our unions, employers, farmers and government and, through it, wage moderation has to be a priority for our government given its huge contribution to our economic success over many years.
I agree that a 10% increase in the GDP per annum is not sustainable, given the pressure on labour supply and house prices.
But even IBEC, our employers' confederation, has said that our budget must be understood in the context of social partnership.
If I had to point to one single factor that has contributed more than any other to the turnaround in the Irish economy, I would have to cite the Social Partners' Agreement which allowed us to trade competitively in the single market and to attract inward investment because of the stability it brought to wage negotiations.
I regret the unseemly public debate over the censure, the lack of diplomacy in handling this issue by both sides and the very negative political fallout that has ensued.
Time does not allow me to run the numbers of Irish economic success.
I have no doubt my colleagues coming after me will do so.
Madam President, I do not take the same approach as my colleague, Mrs Doyle.
The Irish Government's response to the European Commission and to Ecofin has been arrogant and reckless.
Reckless, because it has needlessly damaged the standing of Ireland in the Union and because it feeds xenophobia in Ireland by putting in doubt the possibility of the Nice Treaty being ratified.
Reckless, because it feeds Eurosceptism in the UK and Denmark and it cannot be in the long-term interests of either Europe or Ireland for either Denmark, the UK or indeed Sweden to remain outside the eurozone.
I deplore the stance taken by the Irish Government.
I believe that its position is being driven by the growing Eurosceptism in the two minority government parties.
For example the Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Mary Harney, recently indicated her preference for the American economic model rather than the European social model, stating we are closer to Boston than Berlin.
I do not agree, however, with the MEP from the PPE-DE, Mr Werner Langen, who is quoted in the Irish Independent newspaper today as saying that Ireland should be further penalised by the withdrawal of cohesion funds.
Such a step would be a gross overreaction as well as being illegal.
I would call again on the Irish Government to accept the Ecofin decision and to sit down with the Commission to discuss how it can best be implemented.
I would also call on the Minister for Finance to accept the long-standing invitation from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of this Parliament to come and talk to us and explain the Irish position in detail, so that we can understand it and learn from it.
In the Irish Parliament this week, the Minister for Finance outlined five main points on which he claimed he was at odds with the Commission and Ecofin.
He claimed that the Commission recommendation and the Ecofin decision are unreasonable, unwarranted and a misreading of the Irish economy.
He stated that the Irish tax cuts made over the past three years have been contractionary, not inflationary.
He said that the Irish budgets have not been procyclical as measured by the Commission's own calculations.
He stated that the Commission methodology overstates fiscal loosening this year because it does not take into account once-off factors such as a shorter fiscal year in 2001 and he stated that an opinion would have been a more appropriate step than a reprimand.
The Commissioner has dealt to some extent with some aspects of that case.
I would like to hear Commissioner Solbes address this House today in detail on those points so that we can have some clarity as to the issues that are actually in dispute between the Irish Government and the European Union.
Madam President, as an explanation of the EU' s serious reprimand to Ireland, Mr Prodi expressed the opinion that we must also be able to punish the best pupil in the class.
That really is a peculiar observation to make.
It would be more natural to hold the best pupil in the class up as a model. That was how it was when I was at school.
Ireland' s economy is prospering. Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent.
Unemployment is at less than 4 per cent, and the country also has a genuine budget surplus. Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent.
Unemployment is less than 4 per cent, and the country also has a genuine budget surplus.
The impoverished Emerald Isle has turned into a Celtic tiger. The EU has therefore been too hasty in issuing a warning to Ireland, since the situation of the country is being disregarded.
Ireland is a small country dependent upon foreign trade and with an economy closely linked to the British and American economies.
The falling rate of the euro has therefore had more of an impact upon Irish inflation than upon that of other EU countries.
Inflation has fallen from 6 per cent in November to 3.9 per cent in January, and there is everything to indicate that it will continue to fall.
The Netherlands now has higher inflation.
As you yourself stated, Commissioner, Ireland' s policy cannot jeopardise the way in which EMU operates.
It is in this connection that you refer to Article 99 of the Treaty, and it is then that that argument falls down.
Ireland accounts for only 1 per cent of the EU' s total GDP.
For Ireland, the threat of inflation is mainly from external sources, but the EU and yourself are demanding internal measures to get inflation down.
The EU' s action is politically unwise and does not increase confidence in the EU and EMU, above all in those countries which are at present outside the eurozone.
I want to conclude by asking Mr Solbes Mira why he did not give Ireland more time.
Madam President, Commissioner, as a pro-federalist party, the Group of the Verts/ALE has no objection in principle to the European Union holding an opinion on the national policies of the various Member States.
That said, we have in the past shared and we still share the concerns that smaller countries have regarding the abuses that could result from excessive arrogance on the part of higher authorities or larger countries.
From this point of view, we consider the decision by the Commission, exercising for the first time its right to reprimand with regard to the specific situation in Ireland, as totally unjustified and, at any rate, as a remarkable blunder given the number of Eurosceptics criticising European integration.
We believe that it is totally unjustified, first of all, because the admittedly high level of inflation in Ireland may also be related to the specific nature of the Irish economy, which imports not just its oil but also most of its spare parts from two countries, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, who, over the last few years, have significantly revalued their currencies in relation to the euro.
The second reason is that there is no evidence at all that the 2001 budget is "pro-cyclical" ; quite the opposite, the American air pocket and American slump risk making it an extremely counter-cyclical budget.
The third reason is that although tax reductions by the Irish Government are, admittedly, too high, this issue should have been tackled at the time when, for years, Ireland carried out fiscal dumping by lowering company taxes, thus attracting companies from the continent.
It is absolutely incredible that this criticism should be made when the reduction in tax affects citizens rather than companies.
In more general terms, as soon as a country has accepted...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank you for having set an example while chairing what is, in a way, the closing sitting of our part-session.
I shall now turn to the topic of our debate and say that I welcome the opportunity that we have to give our views on the significance and impact of the decision that the Commission, then the Council, have taken to use for the first time the Treaty of Amsterdam provision in order to address not a sanction, Commissioner, but a public reprimand to a Member State, in this instance, Ireland, as well as to severely rebuke several other countries for not complying with all the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I believe that this will provide many people with food for thought regarding the liberal logic of the current economic and monetary union, just months before the euro intrudes into the everyday lives of 300 million European citizens.
Like the others, I do not question the principle of such warnings which are the logical corollary of the coordination of economic policies.
On the other hand, I denounce the underlying attitude.
The guardians of monetary orthodoxy in the European institutions are obsessed with the idea of excessive public spending, excessive spending on social provision. They have no consideration for the shameful inequality that still exists in the social model that the European Union claims to represent; nor do they have any consideration for the need to promote the human skills necessitated by the information revolution, which is developing at lightning speed before our very eyes and which really has yet to take off.
It is significant that health spending, in particular, was specifically targeted in the Commission' s criticisms of various Member States, one of which was France.
On almost the same day, the Commission decided to bring a case against France before the Court of Justice since it was guilty of charging the lowest income families a lower rate of VAT on some of the price of electricity and gas.
Over-restrictive measures of this kind are not the way to survive the crisis of confidence that citizens are experiencing towards European Union institutions.
Reference has been made to the public comments made by Mr Prodi regarding the criticism of Ireland which, up until now, has been presented as a model of success.
When the President of the Commission said that sometimes, the schoolmaster must punish even the best pupil, he revealed a stunningly original perception of the new European method of governing.
I am counting on the great debate on the future of Europe, which has everyone talking, not to focus on abstract institutional reforms alone but to be based on actual experiences such as those of citizens in the countries which have been targeted by the harsh criticism of the Commission and the Council.
Madam President, first of all I want to thank you for chairing this session and also to thank the Commissioner for coming along.
Tight control of budgetary spending since 1987, alongside a strong model of social partnership where the unions, employers and government came together, are two of the main planks of the present success of the Irish economy.
Alongside this, our intention and our commitment to investing in education and in building up infrastructure and in particular to utilise the new opportunities in information technology are the further elements of this success.
In Ireland we have a commonly used phrase - "if it is not broken, why fix it".
Our present growth rate at 11% is over three times the average of other Member States.
We have a budget surplus of nearly 5% of our gross domestic product.
Our debt/ GDP ratio is only 39%.
Tax and expenditure levels at 33% make Ireland one of the lowest tax regimes in Europe.
We have a binding commitment to provide 1% of our annual gross national product to meet our future public pension bills.
Indeed the latest figures show that inflation, as measured on the harmonised European basis, in Ireland has now fallen to 3.9%.
This rate of inflation is lower than in several of the larger Member States within the EU, if a comparison is made on the latest available economic data, for example, Spain.
I would also like to remind the European Commission that before the recent economic success in Ireland, the Irish people were required to make major sacrifices so as to guarantee that economic growth could take place.
Ireland does contribute and wants to continue to contribute to the positive development of policies and programmes within the European Union.
Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the European Union budget where previously it was a net beneficiary.
As well as that, Irish waters are opened up to European fishing fleets to ensure the continued success of the European fishing industry.
I believe that the economic recommendations, which would help to improve the Irish economy, should be listened to and taken heed of.
However, on this occasion, I believe that the European Commission has misjudged the special nature of how the Irish economy operates.
Moreover, I do not think it fully appreciates how far we have travelled in actual terms in the improvement of our economic performance.
I will give to the Commissioner a list of figures to put it into context.
In 1991 the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty were agreed by EU leaders, and the green light was given to the operation of the single currency.
Ireland's GDP in 1991 was IEP29 billion.
It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion.
In 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public services going.
Today we have a budget surplus.
In 1991, 1.15 million people were in our workforce.
Today we have 1.67 million.
With regard to specific events of recent weeks, I believe that any mention of financially reprimanding Ireland, which is being suggested in some quarters, would be a highly regressive step.
Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination.
Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories.
The European Union has prospered in a spirit of cooperation between various Member States working together, pursuing common political interests.
The EU will not prosper into the future if confrontation is the order of the day.
I am elected to represent the people of Ireland, and I and my colleagues in this Parliament will continue to represent what is in the best interests of the people of Ireland.
In conclusion, the holding of this debate on this occasion is very welcome.
We welcome the opportunity to shout from the rooftops how proud we are of our performance.
Madam President, Mr Solbes Mira, the economic achievements of Ireland in the past decade provoke great admiration.
Anyone comparing the macroeconomic indicators of the EU Member States, cannot escape the conclusion that Ireland is at present out in front.
The criticism by the European Commission of the policy of the Irish Government therefore seems very strange.
But on closer inspection it is nevertheless correct.
Given the overheated state of the Irish economy, there is unmistakable evidence of a pro-cyclical policy when the Irish Government lowers taxes and increases government spending.
And if Ireland is not given a reprimand now, it will be very difficult to criticise the policy of Member States in future.
Meanwhile it remains striking that a small Member State should be attacked, while the economic reforms and performance of the large EMU Member States in general lag behind.
Could Commissioner Solbes Mira indicate if he is aware that the criticism of larger Member States in the present recommendations seems to be couched in more friendly terms than in the case of smaller countries.
When it was decided to launch the Economic and Monetary Union back in the spring of 1998, I pointed out to the Commission the precarious situation regarding retirement provision in some Member States.
Your predecessor, Mr De Silguy, simply refused to listen.
I now notice that the Commission is voicing cautious warnings about this, addressed particularly to France and Italy.
The ECB also expressed itself in disturbing terms on the subject in its monthly report for July 2000.
If policy continues unchanged the burden of pension contribution will go through the roof in most Member States.
In the case of one Member State to as high as 20% of GDP, maintains the OECD.
Remarkably, the present election campaign in this Member State is being fought on tax reduction!
The longer the Member States concerned delay in tackling the pension problems energetically, the greater future budgetary problems will be.
There is a financial time bomb ticking away.
Meanwhile the Commissioner is still not speaking unambiguously.
Surely it cannot be acceptable for necessary reforms to be repeatedly postponed, thus passing burdens on to future generations?
I expect you, at the forthcoming spring summit in Stockholm, to set out the rules and specifically warn the Member States Italy, Germany, Spain, Belgium and France.
On this point Ireland has everything well under control.
