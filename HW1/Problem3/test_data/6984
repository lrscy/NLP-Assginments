We need people, including people from other countries, together with those who are already here.
Unfortunately, the fact is that people who at present come from other countries become, in large measure, unemployed, and that is something we naturally should do something about.
I am convinced that we need an immigration policy.
Immigrants must be integrated as soon as possible.
Integration policy is important, and employment comes with education.
That applies especially to women, as MrsÂ Dybkjaer mentioned.
It is important both for womenâs own sake and in order that the next generation might be integrated into society.
Allow me also to say one thing about the issue that has created some kerfuffle, namely voting rights.
I have experience of the euro vote in Sweden where we applied the same rules as in local elections; that is to say, people from other countries were allowed to vote.
They went to the polls in very large numbers.
If they had been able to decide the outcome of the Swedish vote, Sweden would today have had the euro as a currency.
They were supporters of the euro and were more European than other Swedes.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur.
I will say, however and I do not say this to reproach Mr Moraes, or as a 'turf' issue that it is a sad comment on the perceived definition of justice and home affairs in the EU institutions â that is, law enforcement and tough borders â that it is the social affairs side which is given the full lead on issues of citizenship and non-discrimination.
We must place these human rights issues within the justice framework, as well as the social policy framework.
The insistence on local and European voting rights for legal immigrants is a key issue.
How can we possibly expect them to integrate if they are denied civic and political participation?
An active approach to integration is overdue.
The controversies over the wearing of the , the Muslim headscarf â or , as the French rather confusingly say â show how acute the arguments can be.
The fascinating difference between, for example, French and British attitudes shows that there is no one definition of integration.
What we should be clear about is that it does not mean assimilation.
Integration is surely a two-way street in which all parties have to adjust to a dynamic and changing society.
It is not a soft option; hard effort is needed not only from immigrants themselves â such as language learning and equality â but also from indigenous communities in accepting and learning from differences.
Finally, I hope all of us here and I know Mr Moraes does his best will try to persuade our national governments to stop populist and mean measures that only collude with media hysteria.
For instance, if asylum seekers were allowed to work, they could escape the jibe of being welfare scroungers, which is unfairly thrown at them and which gives such a bad start to their eventual integration if they get legal status.
Â Â  Mr President, since the economic system based on paid work became widespread, emigration has always served to provide the enterprises of the developed countries with labour.
That is how US power was built.
France, Great Britain and other countries would not have developed without the contribution of immigrants from their colonial empires or from poorer countries of Eastern Europe.
Unlike the slave trade, these population movements were free; migrants were not chained or whipped.
The hunger and poverty of their places of origin were enough to drive them to emigrate.
Where that emigration was regulated, it was done to serve the interests of the capitalist enterprises, in other words, the big employers of the host country.
In other words, this report is not dazzling in its originality.
True, it proposes that modern wage slaves should be well integrated, and it even proposes positive measures for women, but their main purpose is to control them and adapt them to the needs of the labour market.
What is new in this report, on the other hand, is the proposal for temporary immigration, which will allow big western capital to benefit from a workforce already trained elsewhere and therefore trained free of charge and to get rid of it once it thinks it no longer needs it.
Well, that is an inhuman system because it is the market that decides instead of people and that situation will continue so long as the present economic system exists.
What, however, the workers can and must be given in order to safeguard their collective interests, whether they are citizens or migrants, is a strict equality of rights so that the employers cannot set one against the other by introducing a competition that will be harmful to all.
That is why we are calling for complete equality of civil and political rights for all who live and work on the Unionâs soil, including the right to move freely, to leave and to return.
We call, moreover, for the legalisation of the situation of all so-called illegal immigrant workers, who are only illegal because the authorities refuse to grant them papers.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Moraes report on the Commission communication on integration and employment is an example of how good policies can never be built on the basis of good intentions alone; a certain Machiavelli taught us that.
In this case the good intentions are to move the integration issue forward along the lines laid down at the Tampere European Council.
The report thus contains statements of intent that certainly make good sense, for instance when it suggests that the all too common and uncontrolled illegal employment of illegal and hidden immigrants is a direct incentive to illegal immigration.
It then goes so far as to state, however, in these very words, that the current political climate regarding asylum and illegal immigration may be â just think of it! â a possible obstacle to creating cooperation on managed migration and integration policies.
This is clearly a contradiction, which can only be accounted for by a highly ideological view of the migration issue, and we have had some pretty obvious examples of this in earlier speeches.
This view can only lead to statements that lack any objectivity and any connection with reality, as for instance when the idea is put forward that combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings results in a repressive policy against immigrants.
If anything, it is this partisan, ideological, misleading view that may lead to the distortion of the increasingly clear and well-defined objectives that have recently been identified and pursued by the European Union, especially during the Italian Presidency.
I cannot agree with a view of civil citizenship that includes the right to vote in local and even European elections, through which the European Union should somehow take the place of the individual Member States in recognising one of the rights â the right to be part of the electorate â on which, in my opinion, in a true democracy only the people of Europe, and not the internationalist bureaucratic and technocratic superpower, can decide.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I believe it is important that, for the first time in this legislature â though a little late â we are holding a debate on the phenomenon of migration linked to two relevant and important issues: the integration of immigrants residing legally in the European Union â and I would stress the aspect of legality in the reception society â and the way this relates to employment opportunities, as an essential element of economic immigration.
We are dealing with the important issue of determining the reception capacity of the Member States according to the needs of their labour markets, and we are doing so from two points of view: quantitative and qualitative.
It is therefore crucial for governments to make realistic offers which are as far as possible in line with available jobs, temporary or permanent, which can be filled by means of migratory flows, which ultimately have the effect of balancing the European Union's demographic deficit.
This would be of benefit to the Member States and the immigrantsâ countries of origin.
Furthermore, the problem is currently arising â with tragic results in many cases, as we are seeing â of the emergence of a hidden economy in sectors such as agriculture, domestic service and construction; an economy which is fed partly by illegal immigration and which leads to subhuman situations and conditions both from a strictly employment point of view and from a social point of view.
This leads to the establishment of ghettos and communities which are entirely fragmented and that face serious problems in surviving in the host countries.
Having said this, Commissioner, Mr President, we can spend every day holding seminars and meetings, and applying all our attention to multiculturalism and integration from a religious point of view, and other issues, which lead us nowhere unless we establish crystal clear conditions for legal and ordered entry which guarantee immigrants a job in the European Union and facilitate their reception and social, cultural and political integration.
In short, Mr President, from a human point of view.
With regard to the political aspect of integration, which has been subject to much debate today, I believe that our Groupâs Amendment No 4 must be given particular attention by the other political groups.
For example, how can we ask for the right to vote in European elections for immigrants residing legally â I imagine â in the Union, when they cannot vote, for logical and constitutional reasons, in the legislative elections of the State they live in?
That is, they cannot elect the governments of the Member States but they can elect that of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Left, allow me to say that this is a crazy proposal, and that the Groups supporting it must seriously reconsider.
On voting issues, ladies and gentlemen of the Left, there must be no room for demagoguery.
In any event, we can do nothing if we restrict ourselves to wishing to resolve this problem by making the European Union solely responsible, without demanding that countries of origin co-operate very actively in the ordered flow of their own immigrants, which would mean these countries having the necessary administrative structures to organise their migratory flows, also making it more attractive for their own workers to return and, naturally, preventing mass exoduses, as is currently the case in certain border countries or, also â let us not forget â from countries on the other side of the Atlantic, as a result of their economic, political and social instability.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissionâs communication on immigration, integration and employment starts with a hymn to immigration and goes on to describe all kinds of measures to encourage integration without ever asking whether any of it is materially possible and, in particular, what the overall cost will be for our societies.
It is because of reports like this that the governments of the countries of Europe have for decades allowed themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security and they are now waking up to an enormous failure and a terrible mess.
The Commission will bear its share of responsibility, which will be heavy.
I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, how a communication or document of this kind comes to be written in the Commission.
Who contributes the ideas?
Are the national parliaments consulted?
Who, moreover, does the actual drafting?
Is it the offices of the Commission, or is some of the work subcontracted, which I dare not imagine?
These are vital questions because the Commissionâs powers will soon be increased by virtue of the Nice and Amsterdam Treaties.
Work should be done transparently so that people are not deceived.
Â Â  â Mr President, the number of people in gainful employment in the EU will decrease from 303 million to 280 million by 2030.
As the birth rate is continuing to decline, while the number of pensioners increases, it is probable that there will be adverse effects, and not only on economic growth.
Will increased immigration from third countries help here?
Which workers to accept is for the Member States to decide, and that is also in the interests of the countries from which they come, who often lose significant potential.
Controlled immigration makes it possible to see who is coming onto the labour markets.
There must be great sensitivity in approximating conditions of entry at EU level, and this must be done only progressively, using together tried and tested procedures in recruitment and admissions policies, as is stated in one of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar.
There is a need for dialogue with the social partners, as well as with the authorities that are responsible for the local labour market.
The Member States must act with far more agreement and far greater decisiveness if legitimate employment is to be permitted and illegal employment prevented.
The fact is that the latter compels many workers to accept intolerable pay and living conditions.
Immigration alone, of course, will not safeguard our social security systems.
If, for example, there is to be any marked increase in the birth rate, both mothers and fathers need far better legal safeguards.
All in all, we all need society to be more family-friendly.
Better-qualified workers and an increase in the number of jobs are dependent on the labour markets and the education and training systems being reformed.
Although our rapporteur, Mr Moraes, was willing to find consensus, and incorporated many of my amendments into compromises that promise to gain majorities, the new amendments originating from our PPE-DE Group appear not to be supported by a majority in his own group.
As a number of Members have said, one key point is that each Member State is itself responsible for making its own local election rules.
That must continue to be the case in future.
Only citizens of the EU may vote in the elections to the European Parliament.
Let us beware of eccentricities that amount to defamation.
If there is no support for this position, some of us will find it very difficult to vote for the report as a whole.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to offer the rapporteur my sincere thanks.
It is customary practice to do this anyway, but I think that it is particularly fitting in this case.
The reason is that the rapporteur has really tried to concern himself in particular with the position of migrants in the labour market.
I believe that he has succeeded in this, but unfortunately not entirely, because others have presented all kinds of distracting amendments.
I should like to mention Amendment NoÂ 13 in particular, which more or less states that anyone who has paid even a small amount of tax anywhere should have an automatic right to a residence permit.
I think that it is impossible to speak about any part of this topic without taking as oneâs point of departure that Europe, with 450Â million inhabitants, cannot be a reception centre for ten times as many people living outside Europe.
That is not possible, and if we refuse to accept this fact, things become very difficult.
The rapporteur has of course accepted it, and hence speaks about âmanaging migrationâ.
That automatically implies doing something about it, keeping the situation in hand.
I think that that is very good, in itself.
If people keep to it, this is a splendid report.
I have a fundamental difference of opinion, therefore, with those behind me who have said that it is nothing but nonsense and flights of fancy.
That is not true.
The dangerous flights of fancy are to be found on the other side of this House, where people are seeking to grant rights that cannot be fulfilled.
If we cannot provide employment, there is no sense in granting rights.
This would make us like the rich people of old who had a beautiful view from their windows and cared nothing that the poor people had to live in slums, because that is where they went, after all.
Anyone who wants that should say so.
They must also come out and say that we should indeed take in everyone and only then look at the consequences.
That is the problem that we have here in the background.
The rapporteur has shown that he is aware of that.
He has also shown that he is trying to prevent that.
Unfortunately, however, there are still some people in his own party â and in some other parties â who copy those aristocrats of old who believed that everyone should simply be given rights but who were not themselves prepared to accept the logical consequences of this and, instead, left others to deal with them.
That exacerbates the misery, as we can see in the United States, and we want to avoid that.
There is absolutely no need for any talk of this.
Finally, on the subject of European citizenship, the rules on this are laid down in the Treaty, and it is indeed strange to include this subject here in a couple of words.
That would need a Treaty amendment.
We have, however, declared ourselves in agreement with the Convention, which does not provide for this.
It would be very strange, then, if we were to simply go and lay down rules on the subject here in this report.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are now discussing, on immigration, integration and employment, clearly delineates a multifaceted and topical set of problems that is not being addressed in the European Union or in any of the Member States.
The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council laid the foundations for immigration policy in the Union.
Today, more than ever, greater priority must be attached to this issue, mainly due to the significant increase in the flow of immigrants to Europe in recent years, to the need to maintain Europeâs level of economic development given the growing demographic deficit, to the shrinking labour force and to enlargement and the changes to the dynamics of migration that this will bring.
By way of illustration, Italy will need an annual influx of more than 6500 immigrants per million inhabitants, according to the United Nations.
My country, Portugal, currently receives 400Â 000 immigrants, which represents 8% of the working population and in the next 50 years could see a 17% fall in its total population.
Immigrants, therefore, represent a resource for the labour market.
This is not their only purpose, however.
Their rights cannot be separated from fundamental human rights.
Each Member State must consequently, in coordination with the Union, set limits for migratory flows that match the needs of their labour markets and also provide a supportive, humane and integrated response to receiving those who seek us out in order to improve their living conditions.
The Member States, therefore, face a common challenge; that of improving the management of migratory flows by improving integration policies towards new and established migrants, in an ongoing partnership with the countries of origin.
Lastly, as regards the rights associated with citizenship, which must always be considered in this matter, we take the view that it would be premature and possibly going too far to grant immigrants the right to vote in European elections.
Even in local elections, each Member State must retain the prerogative as to whether or not it gives its immigrants the right to vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like first to thank Mr Moraes, who has managed to address such sensitive issues as immigration and integration by drawing up what is, over all, a satisfactory report.
In view of the new demographic challenges that the European Union will have to confront in a few yearsâ time, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to present immigration as part, but only part, of the answer for Europe.
In view of the economic and social consequences of the ageing of the population, it is clear today that managed immigration will without a doubt avoid a slowing down in economic growth and a decline in our fellow citizensâ quality of life.
However, I doubt that such managed immigration can take place, because obviously everyone aspires to a change of scenery and a better standard of living.
Moreover, we sometimes encourage such flows by our votes; I am thinking in particular of MrsÂ Lambertâs report, report 1481, which extends our entire social security system to refugees and immigrants.
That being the case, we need a number of measures to facilitate and improve the reception and integration of aliens without penalising either the host country or the aliens who are moving lawfully on the territory of the European Union.
One of the necessary conditions for successful integration is that immigrants should have access to the European Unionâs employment market and we are all agreed on that.
It seems to me premature, however, in the context of a report on employment and integration, to give third country nationals the right to vote in local and European elections.
As my fellow Member, the chairman of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, said, how can we imagine third country nationals voting in European elections when they do not have the right to vote in general elections in our countries?
As for local elections, each of the Unionâs 15 countries currently has its own practice in the matter of voting rights âÂ nationality based on parentage or place of birthÂ â and it is unthinkable today to imagine that the same legislation could be applied to all 15 countries of the Union by a vote taken so stealthily.
That is why I shall be voting for Amendment No 4, which notes that third country nationals have the right to vote in local elections in some countries but does not oblige the other Member States to do the same.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, for having made himself so available and for his willingness to work together, and I should also like to thank him on behalf of MrÂ Mantovani, who would have liked to be here and speak but was called back to Italy on a matter of urgency.
The dynamics of immigration in the European Union should be seen as part of a framework that takes account of the benefits this brings to all the parties involved.
The Irish Presidency also mentioned this point this morning.
Migratory flows must be managed so that they serve the interests of both the host country and the country of origin.
Management of these flows may in fact be a response, as has already been said, to the democratic and economic development of the Union.
We now need to improve the integration of the immigrants â legal immigrants â who represent a resource, but the immigrant populations must in turn respect the fundamental values of their host countries.
A proposal has been mentioned to guarantee citizens of third countries legally residing in the Union the opportunity to vote in local and European elections.
It is clear to everyone that such a question should remain a matter of the strictest subsidiarity.
I thank the rapporteur in particular for the compromise reached with the Member State governments on setting up a quota system for legal entry into their countries, and thus into Europe, to be offered to the countries of origin and of transit as one of the main incentives for negotiation and agreement on readmission.
It is very important to get this kind of collaboration.
In any case, this complex issue, together with preparation of policy on the management of migratory flows, must obviously be dealt with at European level as quickly as possible.
The rights of migrants must be recognised, but only alongside a policy to regulate these flows, which has to be a strict one.
In conclusion, Italy has the second highest number of immigrants in Europe and is the only country in Europe to have very long external borders to the east and to the south.
The whole of Europe must take stock of the size and complexity of this enormous migratory and social pressure, because the real problem starts in Italy but is immediately and automatically transferred to all the other Community countries.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you a happy birthday.
We are seeing an increase in illegal migratory flows, generally controlled by criminal networks that give misleading information to potential migrants, who end up forced to work in conditions completely different to those they were promised, which might even include physical and or mental abuse and breaches of their human rights.
This is, therefore, an extremely welcome initiative and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, because he provides a balanced analysis of three fundamental and interlinked issues.
Firstly, managing migratory flows.
We must have a common immigration policy with common conditions and rules for the entry and residence of migrant workers, which must always take account of each Member Stateâs real labour and economic needs.
It must be left to each Member State to assess and to decide whether it should increase its labour force, in what quantity, in what sector, bearing in mind its real needs and its capacity to receive and integrate these immigrants.
We must fight against illegal migratory flows, allowing economic migrants to take advantage of clearly defined and transparent legal channels, in order to compensate for possible labour shortages in each Member State.
The proposal for a directive on the admission of third country nationals for the purpose of employment must help to explain to potential immigrants the legal ways of obtaining the right to reside in the Union.
It must also strengthen the fight against illegal employment and penalise in particular those that profit from it.
Secondly, improving the integration of immigrants into the European Union.
There must be a common approach that ensures the integration of third-country nationals into our societies, guaranteeing rights and obligations as regards residency, access to education and employment and ensuring that they are not subject to discrimination at the economic, social and cultural levels.
My third and final point concerns the need for cooperation with the countries of origin, in order to increase their capacity for managing migration, which will also require agreements to be negotiated on readmission and programmes to aid return.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too am pleased with the attention with which this Parliament and the Commission have begun to examine a subject that now affects all the countries in the European Union.
Emigrating has always been a necessity and often a hope, but seldom a choice.
I say this as I come from a country that has had first-hand experience of the emigration problem for a great many decades.
In recent years the subject of migration into many European countries has taken on bitter and often dramatic connotations.
I believe it is both necessary and useful for the various Member States to share a common position on this subject, because I cannot envisage any positive scenarios unless they are regulated by all the countries in the Union.
I also think, however, that this is one of the most sensitive issues, one of those issues that, more than any other perhaps, needs to be managed; and managing it means addressing matters of visas, employment, health, citizensâ rights and duties, and citizenship.
I believe the right to vote, at a local and not just a European level, should be a consequence of these rights and not a precondition, as seems to have been suggested at times in some debates in recent years.
In our eagerness for integration we must not forget that our first duty, in my opinion, is to create the means for making a living in developing countries, so that everyone can find it possible to stay in their own home country.
Our second duty is to facilitate the return of immigrants to their countries of origin as agents for the development and growth of their own countries.
Down in third place, I put the need for Old Europe, impoverished by low birth rates and few workers, to see migration as a benefit to our countries.
Having said that, there is no doubt that we should have control mechanisms to enable us to combat illegal immigration and, within the Member States, to combat breaches of the host countryâs rules.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Sartori.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  A very good afternoon to you, ladies and gentlemen.
We welcome the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, represented by Mr Roche.
I can assure you that Parliament will cooperate fully with you and I hope that in turn you will cooperate by replying to the questions of the honourable Members, who attach great importance to this opportunity to communicate with the Council.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0002/2004).
We will take a series of questions to the Council.
Â Â  . The Council regards animal welfare as a priority and has already adopted, on proposals from the Commission, a number of Community rules in this area, notably in relation to the transport of animals and the use of animals, and in particular dogs, for the purposes of research.
However, the conditions under which dogs such as greyhounds are bred and take part in races in Member States are not regulated by Community legislation.
Under the protocol on protection and welfare of animals annexed to the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are required, in formulating and implementing the Community's agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals, while respecting the legislative and administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating in particular to religious rights, cultural traditions and regional heritage.
It is therefore up to each Member State to find a solution to this problem, and all the Council can do is to call on the competent authorities to combat the mistreatment described by the honourable Member.
Â Â  It is nice to be the first Irish person to ask the Irish presidency a question.
I have just come from the animal welfare intergroup, where they are also hoping that animal welfare will be a big issue, especially the transport of animals.
Commissioner Byrne said that this issue was not the EU's responsibility and is not regulated under EU legislation.
At one stage or another, EU subsidies contributed to the breeding of many of the greyhounds in Ireland.
That has stopped now, but it is up to each Member State, as you said.
It is up to the Irish Government to introduce rules on breeding and proper controls, and also to ensure that the owners of the animals are responsible for them, not just for the racing period but to the end of their life.
In Ireland, when greyhounds reach about two years of age, the vast majority of them are considered by the Irish race industry to be burned out.
They are sold off for next to nothing to Spain, where they are raced to death.
They are subjected to appalling cruelty.
Religious rights do not come into this.
It is really an issue of animal welfare, and the Irish Government should introduce something to control the breeding of greyhounds and to ensure that the people who breed them are responsible for them up to the end of their lives.
Some sort of identification mechanism, such as a tagging system, would also make it much easier to identify them.
I have just spoken to someone who has just come back from Spain.
They visited an illegal race track where they saw nine Irish dogs racing.
So we must take responsibility for these animals, regardless of whether they are in our country or have been exported.
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member.
In some respects I think the points that she made in the latter part of her supplementary question are matters that should be put to the domestic administrations both in Ireland and perhaps in Spain.
I fully understand her concerns and, as she knows, we have actually discussed it.
I have outlined the Council's position on the issue, which was also the subject of a question to the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in my country, too, there is a group of people that is very concerned about these practices, and they want to put an end to them.
They take it to the extent that they adopt these dogs and pay EURÂ 150 to do so.
In Spain, there is a refuge as an intermediate point.
The Council must ultimately go knocking on the door of the Member State that is accused of this, however, because we are indeed talking about mistreatment; it is not just a case of the transportation of these dogs.
I think that the Council must take a position on this and make clear that animal rights apply throughout the EU.
These dogs, which later become pets in my country, deserve a fair chance, respect and good treatment.
Â Â  . It seems to me that we would all share the concern that any animal, irrespective of the country it is in, be treated properly and appropriately.
It again illustrates that this is a matter for domestic legislation and rules in the individual Member States, rather than a matter for the Council.
However, I take note of the initiative that is mentioned, which is a very worthwhile and welcome one.
Â Â  . The Council is not aware of the findings to which the honourable Member of Parliament is referring.
However, I could add that the Council restates that it is very much concerned about nuclear safety and gives all its support for attaining a high level of nuclear safety throughout the European Union.
As the honourable Member will know, Sellafield, like all reactors, is supposed to operate as long as it fulfils the requirements of a high level of nuclear safety.
The existing Community legislation related to the safety of nuclear installations is mainly based on Chapter 3 of Title II of the Euratom Treaty.
Council Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation provides the basic radiation protection obligations which must be complied with.
Â Â  While I appreciate the constraints on the Council presidency, I really have to say that people in Britain and Ireland and, indeed, throughout the European Union will find that response to their concerns completely inadequate.
I want to say once again that the UK Public Health Minister, MelanieÂ Johnson, has revealed that a study by the UK Department of Health discovered that the closer children lived to Sellafield the higher the level of plutonium found in their teeth.
This is one of the most dangerous substances known to human life â and not only human life.
Ms Johnson has said that analysis indicated that concentrations of plutonium decreased with increasing distance from the West Cumbrian coast and its Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, suggesting that this plant is the source of plutonium contamination in the wider population.
This comes from the UK Public Health Minister.
I would like the Irish presidency to convene a special meeting of EC experts, along with national and other experts, to assess the implications of this.
That is the least that citizens will expect.
I could go into the scientific data at length â reputable scientists are involved â but I shall refrain from doing so.
I insist that we need a proper response from the Minister out of concern for the people involved.
Â Â  From our private conversations over the years the honourable Member will be aware that I share many of her concerns in this particular regard.
I am answering here in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council.
I will certainly take note of the suggestion that she made.
It is a disturbing reality that we face. I accept that.
I will certainly take note of her last proposition.
Â Â  Is the Minister aware that even the authors of this report acknowledge that levels are so low as to be insignificant to health; that levels are a thousand times less than other radioactive substances naturally present in teeth; that most of the highest results were recorded over 250 miles from Sellafield; that this material is more likely to be fallout from weapons testing, which has been present throughout the Northern Hemisphere for some years; that respected scientific and academic opinion in Northern Ireland â for which I was the minister responsible for a couple of years â as well as in his own country, contradicts many of the assertions of the Irish anti-Sellafield lobby; and that when all is said and done, this is little more than political scaremongering designed to wreck thousands of the jobs of my constituents in north-west England and to damage the livelihoods of those many communities dependent upon this vital and valuable recycling operation?
Â Â  . I am not sure that labelling a genuine concern as scaremongering is helpful.
As I said at the outset, the Council is not aware of the findings that the honourable Member has drawn to Parliament's attention.
Therefore, I am in no better position to respond to the supplementary question than to the original one, except to make the point that labelling genuine concerns as scaremongering is not helpful.
Â Â  I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he would agree that the original question tabled is actually factually incorrect when it talks about endangering the health of people in Britain and Ireland.
In the report Melanie Johnson quoted from â and as MrÂ Atkins has just commented â the authors actually state that there is no health risk whatsoever: there is no correlation whatsoever here with the original question.
In fact, some of the highest readings taken were 260 miles away from Sellafield and some of the lowest were 50 miles away from Sellafield.
It seems ironic that these comments are being made when the UK department's own report stated that the levels were a thousand times smaller than those of other radioactive substances present as a result of natural sources.
Would the President-in-Office not agree that the question was factually incorrect and put purely for scaremongering reasons, as Sir Robert Atkins mentioned?
Â Â  . I really have nothing to add, and can only repeat what I have already said, which is that the Council is not familiar with the details and that I cannot make an adjudication one way or the other.
I certainly would not wish to make an adjudication as to the of a question raised by a Member of this House.
Â Â  This is not a time for debate, ladies and gentlemen.
The questioner has put a supplementary question and there are two further supplementary questions.
Opinions differ, naturally.
All of you would like to speak, but the Rules of Procedure do not allow for this.
Mrs Ahern, for a personal statement, you have 15 seconds to reply.
Â Â  My position has been traduced.
I am asking for experts to assess the implications.
I am not saying that I am the expert.
Can we please have a civil debate on Sellafield for once in this Parliament?
Let us protect our people. That is the bottom line I am asking for.
Â Â  . As the honourable Member knows, the Council does not comment on media reports, nor is it the Council's practice to express its views on domestic political matters in Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, my question referred to the articles of the Treaty which oblige all of us â the Council, Parliament, the Governments and also the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission â to ensure compliance with human rights.
You do not wish to give me an answer, but I would like to remind you of something which I imagine you will know much better than me.
If I remember rightly, in Ireland, before you achieved independence, you had a provisional status, which led to a great conflict within your society between radicals and moderates.
You resolved that situation by consulting the Irish citizens, that is, by means of a referendum.
We have a situation in the Basque Country which is also difficult and worrying, and which is creating great tension and violence.
We are asking that it be the citizens who can give their opinion and decide, but the Spanish Government is preventing this.
It is also threatening and changing the laws in order to imprison those who advocate this referendum: a consultation of the citizens, which is the most democratic thing imaginable.
Â Â  Mr Ortuondo, I would remind you that this is a time for supplementary questions and not a time for political statements.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to supplement Mr Ortuondoâs question, and remind him that this is not a decision by the Spanish Government, but that it is the Spanish Constitution itself which prevents an autonomous community from holding a referendum unilaterally and requires that any referendum be called by the King, on the proposal of the President of the Government, following authorisation from the Congress of Deputies.
That is what our Constitution says.
I believe that the question Mr Ortuondo should have asked â although you probably would not answer it either â is whether a person failing to comply with a law can be subject to penalty, which is what the Spanish authority has said or, in this case, the reform of the Spanish Penal Code.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen â in this case, MrÂ Oreja â I do not believe that this is a supplementary question and, naturally, the President-in-Office of the Council is not obliged to reply, but he has the floor if he wishes to say anything.
Â Â  . I really have nothing to add to the point I made in answer to the original question.
Neither of the exchanges suggests that I should do so.
Â Â  Mr MacCormick, the Mr President-in-Office of the Councilâs reply was very clear: it does not leave room for supplementary questions.
In any event, you have the floor, and I hope you will use it with your usual wisdom.
Â Â  I wanted to suggest to Mr Roche â and it is a great pleasure to see him here after many exchanges at the Convention â that the issue Mr Ortuondo Larrea raised, and with which we are dealing here, is a profound one.
It is about the role and place of countries within Member States.
The Irish presidency, not least because of its interest in the problems of Northern Ireland, but for other reasons as well, ought to give its mind and invite its colleagues to give their minds to the issue of the adequate and improved representation of countries of that kind.
Â Â  Mr Ortuondo, since you will most probably not make a point of order â I do not know if you wish to make a personal statement â you may speak for fifteen seconds and I would ask you not to cause any further personal statements, please.
We must not spoil Question Time with other debates which should take place in the relevant setting, in this case in Spain.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement.
If what I have raised is laid down in the Spanish Constitution, why is the Peoplesâ Party, the government of Mr Aznar, at night and taking advantage of a law ...
Â Â  I would ask you to take this debate to the Basque Parliament and the Spanish Congress of Deputies, but it is not appropriate to continue debating this issue here.
You know that I ignore the fact that I am also elected in a Spanish constituency and that I am Spanish and, as I usually say to you, I am going to act as if I were, for example, Finnish or Irish.
Â Â  . The Commission recently made a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1655/2000 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment â LIFE â mainly in two aspects.
The first concerns only comitology.
However, the second provides for the extension of the LIFE regime for a further two years to bridge the gap between the current regime and the new Financial Perspectives for 2007 onwards.
On 22Â December 2003 the Council held an exchange of views on this second aspect and on the options for financing the EU's environmental policies from 2007 onwards.
In addition, the Council adopted conclusions on biodiversity in which it looked forward to the submission of the forthcoming Commission communication on financing Natura 2000.
When received, this will provide a further opportunity for discussions on this very important issue.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the Irish Presidency for the clarity with which it has attempted to answer my question.
I must, however, insist on an issue that I believe to be crucial: I should like to know whether the Council will give due consideration to the conclusions of the working party appointed by the Commission itself, which suggested that the costs of maintaining this âNaturaâ network would exceed EURÂ 3.4Â billion per year.
I should also like to know whether the Council thinks that our financial perspectives will match the commitments given by the European institutions?
This is the very specific issue that I would like the Council to clarify.
Â Â  . The Member has raised the fundamental question of whether an annual budget of EUR 3.4Â million or EUR 5.7 million would be appropriate.
That is the key issue.
Much of the effort to date as regards the Natura 2000 network of sites, habitats and bird directives has been devoted to the initial designation of sites; the purely mechanical side of it.
It is very difficult at this early stage to estimate the likely costs of conserving those sites in future years.
I understand that the Commission has been examining this question further in preparing its communication on financing Natura 2000.
To summarise, the work has been on the designation of sites.
Until that phase of the work is completed, it is difficult to see what the overall cost is likely to be, but I would nevertheless compliment and thank the Member for raising this issue.
Â Â  . In conformity with the common position concerning restrictive measures against Zimbabwe, the Council has kept the situation in Zimbabwe under review.
On 28 November 2003 the presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on the current situation in Zimbabwe, expressing its continued concern regarding the climate of tension in Zimbabwe and calling on its government to respect the internationally-guaranteed rights of all Zimbabwean people.
The question of Zimbabwe was raised in the EU-Africa dialogue during the ministerial troika meeting in Rome on 10 November 2003, where the European Union again reaffirmed its readiness to engage in dialogue with the government in Harare on the basis of established benchmarks.
An identical message was passed directly to Zimbabwe and other SADC countries during the meeting of the EU-SADC senior officials in Brussels, held on 12 and 13 November 2003, and was again transmitted to South Africa during the political dialogue meeting in Pretoria on 8 December 2003.
The common position, as adopted on 18 February 2002, expresses the Council's serious concern about the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular the recent escalation in violence and intimidation of political opponents and the harassment of the independent press.
When reviewed in 2003, the common position noted that there has been further degradation in the situation in Zimbabwe, where serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly continue to occur.
As already noted, the European Union has remained extremely concerned about the further degradation of the situation in Zimbabwe since then.
The common position is up for review on 18 February 2004.
In this context, preparatory work on recommendations to be submitted to the Council has begun within the relevant Council departments.
These recommendations will be submitted to the Council for discussion at that time.
Â Â  I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer.
I am reasonably familiar with, and approve of, the Irish Government's strong position on Zimbabwe.
My question is about the rollover of the common position.
I wonder whether the presidency anticipates any difficulties in securing the rollover of the existing sanctions against Zimbabwe.
Am I right to understand that there are Member States â and one in particular â which have a problem with the rollover that the presidency and others in the Council would like to see?
Therefore, I am asking if you can tell me whether Member States are likely to be of one mind on the rollover.
Second, would the President-in-Office consider it appropriate for the Council to now press for the extension of the list of banned individuals â a list of people who have sanctions against them and are not given visas â to include family members, people who have died or changed office and so on?
In my view and in Parliament's view â it is in our resolution on the subject â the list should be extended and reviewed.
I should very much like your opinion on this.
It is something of great importance to the European Parliament and I look forward to your response.
Â Â  . My colleagues and I appreciate Mrs Kinnock's continued keen interest in this particular matter.
Discussions are ongoing.
It would be premature at this stage for us to say where those discussions will lead.
There will, however, be a review of the list and there may be some extension to it.
Â Â  I should like to ask a very brief supplementary question to Mrs Kinnock's question.
One aspect of her campaigning â which is increasingly affecting Member States, including the United Kingdom and possibly Ireland as well â is that with the escalation of violence an increasing number of refugees and asylum seekers are coming to the European Union.
What is the Irish presidency's view of this, given the increase in numbers and that these people clearly have asylum claims and are in distress, but are also arriving in great numbers?
Does the President-in-Office have a view on this, given the new presidency, the escalation of violence and the inevitable increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers from Zimbabwe to EU Member States?
Â Â  . The direct answer to the question is yes, the presidency is obviously aware that any form of violence or action against civilian populations inevitably drives people out.
We are also concerned about and aware of the impact that sanctions can have on populations.
With regard to the specifics, I would refer back to the earlier answer that I gave directly to Mrs Kinnock: where do we go from here?
The next stage is a matter for current discussion and I do not want to anticipate that discussion by going further than I already have.
Â Â  . The Council confirms to the honourable Member that on 9 December 2003 the European Commission and Syria reached an understanding at technical level on all remaining issues in the negotiations on the Euromed Association Agreement.
When it enters into force, this agreement will replace the existing 1977 Cooperation Agreement which, as part of the global Mediterranean approach, currently links the two sides.
The items of the future agreement will now have to be politically approved by both sides, paving the way for ratification by both sides.
The Council underlines that on the political side the draft agreement intends to provide a framework to conduct regular political dialogue on international issues and mutual interest, fostering mutual understanding and promoting the convergence of views.
In particular it includes essential provisions on respect for the democratic principles on fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; cooperation to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in line with the conclusions of the External Relations Council in November 2003; and the exchange of information and joint efforts to prevent and fight against terrorism, including the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.
With regard to the second element in the honourable Member's question on the Middle East peace process in general, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 12 December 2003.
In paragraph 61 the European Council recalled that a comprehensive peace in the Middle East must also include Syria and, of course, Lebanon.
Finally, there was a third element in the question.
The Council has not commented on positions taken on this matter by the United States, nor does the Council intend to do so at this stage.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your reply.
I feel that I cannot insist that you reply to me on the element on which you clearly stated that you did not intend to comment, even though I believe that an open dialogue which highlights the common points and the different approaches between the European Union and the United States is not negative; it is positive in making us aware of the situation and our joint action.
Perhaps you could tell me more specifically, please, how this agreement with Syria, which we hope will be signed and will be put into practice, specifically serves the political and economic interests of the European Union in the area?
What is the particular role, the position, the influence of Syria in the Barcelona process?
Does it have anything to do with Lebanon and the objectives of the European Union through the agreement with Lebanon?
Â Â  . I thank the Member for that.
I agree with her that there is no point in making negative comparisons between our approach and that of, for example, the United States.
It is a very fine agreement and I am sure the Member has had the opportunity to read it.
Let us consider its aims: to provide an appropriate framework for political dialogue; to establish the conditions for progressive liberalisation of trade in goods, services and capital; to enhance prosperity and economic and social development in Syria and to encourage cooperation within the Euro-Mediterranean framework, and, finally, to promote cooperation in economic, social, cultural and financial fields.
The point about this agreement is that it emphasises very much the European ethos, the European view of the way forward.
It is a very positive development, certainly a development that the Irish presidency welcomes and will work towards.
There is no point in our making negative comparisons with anybody else â with the United States approach, for example.
We have a dialogue with the United States on many levels, including the highest level.
The Middle East issue, the issue of the entire region and peace in the region, is obviously an important part of that dialogue.
The matter of Syria's place in the peace process will feature in the dialogue.
Again, I thank the Member for a very searching and deep question which provides an opportunity to cover a significant number of important areas.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, could I press you a little further on this?
You briefly alluded to the issue of weapons of mass destruction, which, rather surprisingly, on 6 January 2004, President Assad effectively admitted to possessing.
Could you tell me what kind of mandate you will give the Commission to incorporate clauses that are specifically salient and relevant to the issue of Syria's biological and chemical weapons stock, and whether the Syrians will be encouraged strongly within these clauses to effectively dismantle them and avoid any proliferation of such dangerous weapons?
Â Â  . The precise details in that regard will have to be considered by the Council, but there is a specific reference to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
That is in accordance with the decisions taken in the External Relations Council in November 2003.
You can rest assured that the presidency and the Council have in mind the positive elements of this particular agreement in the context of the region and in the context of weapons of mass destruction in general.
Â Â  It is interesting that you mention that you collude with or discuss with the US how you are dealing with Syria and yet your policies are in such contrast.
Is that a sort of 'nice cop, nasty cop' approach to Syria?
I should like to ask, in particular, about Lebanon.
Syria is in occupation of large parts of Lebanon, its neighbouring country.
What attitude do you take to this position as regards any furtherance of this agreement?
Â Â  . I would take exception to the world 'collude'.
There is a dialogue between Europe and the United States, which is quite appropriate.
Issues relating to Lebanon and Syria are obviously going to be part of that dialogue.
It is certainly not a question of 'good cop, bad cop'.
Europe has its view as to how it does its business and the United States has its view as to how it does its business.
Those views are informed by our own different backgrounds.
The point I am making about this agreement is that it is a very positive indication of the European approach to this particular matter.
Â Â  . The Council remains concerned at the issue of organised crime and drug trafficking in Albania.
In the conclusions of the last Council meeting on external relations on 9 December 2003, the Council expressed concern over the slow process of reform in Albania and urged the Albanian Government to intensify its efforts, particularly in its fight against organised crime.
Helping the Albanian Government to fight drug trafficking has been an integral part of EU efforts to contribute to the fight against organised crime in Albania.
Police forces and experts from the European Union and Member States have consistently been present in Albania, particularly since the 1997 crisis, to help the Albanian Government in various ways, including specific operations, to build capacity and fight organised crime, including drug production and drug trafficking.
As regards drugs, major initiatives were taken under the Greek and Italian presidencies in 2003 to enhance the fight against drug trafficking in the Balkan region in general and in Albania in particular.
In June 2003 a comprehensive action plan on drugs was agreed between the European Union and the Western Balkan States.
A large part of this plan was devoted to the fight against drugs trafficking.
A very fruitful follow-up meeting was held on 2 December 2003 in Brussels.
As regards Albania in particular, the Council adopted in November 2003 a resolution on the posting of liaison officers with particular expertise in drugs in Albania.
This resolution envisages the setting up of a coordination mechanism among the liaison officers in order to ensure a constant exchange of information on drugs-related activities and also to foster common understanding.
On a more general level, a meeting between ministers of the EU Member States and ministers of the Western Balkan countries was held on 27Â November 2003 on the sidelines of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
The common conclusions resulting from that meeting stressed the need to enhance law enforcement capacity in the Western Balkans.
On the general issue of the Western Balkans, the Irish presidency will do anything that it can to assist governments in that region â which face significant challenges â and to involve them as much as we possibly can.
Â Â  Thank you very much for that full, helpful and informative reply.
I should like to add my congratulations to the Irish for the leadership they are showing on this difficult question.
I attended the conference on organised crime in Dublin before Christmas, it was excellent and the Irish showed great leadership.
I congratulate you very much on the initiative you are showing.
Is there a chain of command for these liaison officers from the EU who are going to be posted in Albania?
Who do they report to?
Do they each report to their own national capital?
Do they report to Europol in The Hague?
Is there somebody in charge?
How is it organised?
The great problem here with policing â as you must know even better than I â is that individual nationalities and forces are reluctant to cooperate.
They each try to keep the information they have to themselves.
What we need is much more coordination and cooperation, even between EU police forces.
Can you give me any assurance that this is happening?
Who is in charge?
Who liaises with whom?
Â Â  . On the matter of liaison officers, I agree with the Member that there is no point in people being posted individually.
There must be some form of coordination and certainly some form of exchange of information at a very basic level.
I refer the Member to what I said in my previous response, which was that the resolution envisages the setting-up of a coordination mechanism among liaison officers to ensure a constant exchange of information.
The point that the Member has put his finger on is absolutely correct: there is no point in intelligence gathering if the information is not shared.
This is a new departure.
We are at the point of establishing this coordination mechanism.
I am sure that the Member's observations will be helpful in that specific regard.
Â Â  . The Council recalls that, as foreseen by the Presidency Conclusions from the European Council in Seville of 21 and 22 June 2002, the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003 adopted the first Multiannual Strategic Programme for the three years to come.
The programme covers the period 2004 to 2006.
It has been prepared jointly by the six presidencies Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Austria and Finland which in turn will assume stewardship of the Council over that period.
They are collectively vested with responsibility for ensuring that the Council delivers on its agreed priorities up to 2006 effectively and on time.
The presidency found the recently agreed Multiannual Strategic Programme to be a very useful basis for the preparation of both the Annual Operating Programme and the Irish Presidency Programme.
The presidency considers it increasingly important that a longer term perspective be taken, with regard to the work of the Council, beyond the six-month term of each presidency.
In that respect the Multiannual Strategic Programme and the Annual Operational Programme are essentially tools in guiding the preparation of the Presidency Programme.
This is a new departure and it is a very worthwhile and welcome departure.
It gives a more structured basis for the on-going Community relationships with the rest of the world.
Â Â  I agree with what the President-in-Office has said about the value of these tools and place on the record my welcome for the Irish presidency programme in this respect.
However, when he says that it is a useful basis, it would be instructive for all of us to learn what that means in practice.
Otherwise, is this yet another piece of bureaucracy with no real purpose or real difference?
What is it in the Irish presidency programme that is different because of the multiannual approach with the six presidencies together?
Has there been an area where special emphasis has been placed that perhaps would not have been otherwise?
I wonder, in relation to Ireland, for example â being a neutral country and not part of Nato â whether the advancement of the security strategy, the planned intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Defence Capabilities Agency are areas on which you will be putting extra emphasis.
I would be genuinely interested to hear your views on those points.
Â Â  . The honourable Member will appreciate that this really is the first time we have been into this particular process and it will take a little time for this process to bed down.
Nonetheless, a multiannual approach is clearly logical and is a better approach to that which preceded it.
It is very helpful to incoming presidencies to have a role to play so that they can interlink all the issues.
I cannot be more specific other than to say that the Multiannual Strategic Programme is helpful.
It will certainly give us a much stronger framework and a better time allowance.
It will mean that there can be more reasonable anticipation that programmes will be fully worked through.
It is in all those regards and I think that is what the Member has in mind clearly a much better approach than that which preceded it.
Â Â  . The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the answers already given to a question by Claude Moraes in July 2003 and a question raised by you last November on the same issue, in which the Council confirmed its commitment to reaching a common political position on this complex and politically sensitive dossier.
During the first semester in 2003 the presidency put together a compromise package covering the key outstanding issues which were discussed by the Council in a public session which was held on 3 June 2003.
However, the proposed solution is not acceptable to all delegations.
During the second semester, various high-level discussions were held but, in the absence of new elements allowing the situation to be unblocked, the matter was not discussed at the Council meeting of 1 December 2003 as had been initially envisaged and hoped.
As the Member knows â because the Member has raised this matter in different fora â the Irish presidency attaches great importance to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, and will of course reflect on how this dossier can be finalised in that context.
The Council has consistently given a confirmed commitment to reaching the Lisbon goals of increasing employment and providing better jobs, and intends to work for a fair and practical solution which takes into account all legitimate concerns â and there are many of them.
To this end, the presidency intends to reflect on the different possible tracks to be followed in this dossier and will remain alert to any new developments which could help in resolving the outstanding areas of difficulty.
I should like to add that, thanks to the good work of MrÂ De Rossa, the presidency had a very good exchange with members of his Group last week in Dublin.
This issue was raised at that stage.
There was a very full and helpful exchange on the issue so, again, I compliment the Member.
I am fully aware of his concerns on the issue and the presidency is also fully aware of his concerns.
As the Member knows, we will work on this dossier within the context of the general work we are doing on the Lisbon agenda issues.
Â Â  I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his comprehensive and welcome reply.
He has indicated a willingness to progress this dossier, which an important one in the context of the Lisbon Agenda.
I know that the presidency sees the Lisbon Agenda as a comprehensive vehicle for achieving both social and economic progress, and this directive, which would instil some order into the issue of temporary agency workers, would improve the quality of work and also relieve many anxieties of both permanent workers and temporary agency workers.
We know that this particular form of employment is, in certain circumstances, being abused.
I would appreciate it, therefore, if the President-in-Office of the Council would actively pursue this matter.
I have no wish to make party political points here, but given that the Irish Government has serious concerns about this issue, you are in an ideal position to find solutions to it.
Â Â  . I thank Mr De Rossa and I very much recognise the importance of securing an agreement on proposals to improve the rights of workers.
I also understand precisely where Mr De Rossa is coming from in this particular regard.
The point he is making is that one tries to raise everybody's position upward, rather than trying to create a downward movement.
I accept the sincerity of his cause and I think he also understands the views of the presidency in that regard.
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, for your full reply.
Are you aware that whilst the Council is clearly divided on this issue, this House is also divided?
There are different views, as my good friend Mr De Rossa is also aware.
The fact that here you have a UK Conservative MEP speaking in support of the UK Labour Government and against the opinions of UK Labour MEPs shows that this issue is sensitive and rather complicated.
I welcome your comment that you are going to reflect, but I urge you to reflect also on the phrases that you have put into this excellent document â the programme of your presidency â which I particularly welcome.
On page 16 you mention the key challenges you are committed to pursuing: encouraging greater adaptability and flexibility on the part of workers and companies and removing disincentives to employment.
My own view is that the directive, as drafted, would have done exactly the opposite and cut across the possibility of achieving the Lisbon agenda.
Can I have your reassurance that the fulfilment of the Lisbon agenda will indeed colour your entire presidency, as I am confident it will?
Good luck, Sir!
Â Â  . I thank the Member for that.
I do not believe that adaptability and flexibility naturally enhancing or supporting the rights of workers need ever necessarily be in contradiction to each other.
In Ireland we have had some experience in recent years of the tremendous progress that can be made economically by having an inclusive approach to it.
I accept the point that the Member made.
It is a complex issue.
There are different views on this, both within this House and within Europe.
However, in general, it would be a fallacy for us to think that we have to build in flexibility, adaptability or progress at a cost to workers.
That should not be the basis on which we make our progress.
I am sure that is not what the Member has in mind.
Â Â  I should like to join my colleagues in welcoming the President-in-Office, Mr Roche, to the House and wishing him luck for the next six months.
Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mr De Rossa and myself work on the same committee, so we know some of the difficulties here.
But is the presidency aware of the different definitions of agency workers in different Member States, and how this creates a difficulty as regards drawing up harmonised regulations or directives, the purpose of which is to protect workers and actually to improve their position within employment?
Secondly, with regard to Mr Bushill-Matthews' comments on the Lisbon agenda, individual workers should have the freedom of choice, because in some situations temporary agency workers actually earn more money and have more flexibility than they would if they were in contract-based employment.
Â Â  . I accept the final point the Member made, which illustrates something of the complexity of this issue.
There are specific cases that come to mind.
Young medical graduates, for example, may well choose to work on an agency basis because it is more flexible and suits them better.
We are aware of that.
The second point that Mr Crowley touched on was the general question of the rights of contract workers.
I recognise the importance of securing agreement on proposals that improve the rights of workers, including temporary agency workers, but which at the same time do not force anybody to operate in a way they would not wish to.
As I have said, the presidency sees this as an important issue, not least within the context of the Lisbon strategy.
The Member will be aware that we are committed to achieving the Lisbon goals of increasing employment and providing better jobs, and that includes more choices for workers.
The point raised in the original question was that this should not be achieved on the backs of the workers; that is the core issue of concern to Mr De Rossa.
The point has been made that this is a complex matter.
There are different views on the issue and as the last supplementary question illustrates, there may be circumstances in which workers wish to benefit from this more flexible approach. Clearly their right to choose should not be interfered with in a way that would diminish that right.
Â Â  . My reply will be very brief.
The honourable Member's attention is drawn to the fact that under the Treaty, it is not for the Council to comment on the interpretation of Community legislative acts.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office does not need to be that brief.
This is the last question and we have half an hour at our disposal.
I am not asking him to comment on something foreign, I am asking him to talk to us about a directive which the Council approved, on which the President of the European Parliament has taken steps in connection with referral to the Court of Justice, on which non-governmental organisations have taken steps and which makes provision for children of 12 years of age and upwards â just think if it were our daughter, or your daughter, or the daughter of an honourable Member or the daughter of someone who works here â to pass examinations in order to be united with their family.
We cannot deal with this matter with this sort of technocracy and without a sensitive reply by the President-in-Office of the Council and I call for a material response.
Â Â  .
I do not like off-the-cuff or technocratic answers either and I wish I could give you a more substantial answer, but the point is that the only institution which, with regard to the Treaty, has the power actually to interpret Community legislation is ultimately the Court of Justice, but the Member is aware of this and does not need me to lecture him in this regard.
However, it should be recalled that the Court of Justice has been called upon to give a ruling on the directive on the right to family reunification, adopted in September 2003, insofar as a direct action has been brought before it for its annulment.
The point I am making â and the core issue in the reply â is not intended to be in any way discourteous to the Member or to diminish his question; rather, I am simply making the point that on the issue of interpretation there is no appropriate role for the Council.
I am sorry I cannot expand on this.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time to the Council(2).
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0419/2003) by Hubert Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, in view of the European Council of Thessaloniki, on the development of a common policy on illegal immigration, smuggling and trafficking of human beings, external borders and the return of illegal residents (COM(2003) 323 â 2003/2156(INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ahern, the President-in-Office of the Council, said today that the Irish Presidency aimed for greater security and prosperity for all citizens of the European Union.
At the same time as backing him up 100% on that, I would also propose that it would be in the interests of our security if the package of measures that this House expects were to be implemented during the term of the Irish Presidency and also during the Dutch Presidency that will follow it.
The House proposes this package of measures in the spheres of illegal immigration, the smuggling and trafficking of human beings, the securing of our external borders and the return of illegal residents in the European Union.
I was commissioned to draft an own-initiative report for Parliament, and I am extremely pleased to note the excellent negotiations that we have had, with good results, and the fact that we have been able to achieve a broad consensus in the Committee, receiving also the support of the Council and the Commission.
Let me express my gratitude to all those who played their part in producing this report.
On what does this report focus?
It basically appears to me that, although Parliament is able wholeheartedly to endorse the priorities set down in Thessaloniki, we do see it as important that particular attention be given to some of them, and I would now like to present six priorities for your consideration.
The first priority has to do with securing external borders.
Especially on the new external borders, we will need, in future, the same high standards of security everywhere.
It necessarily follows that we will have to train the border guards in accordance with one single training plan, and that we should establish a European college in which senior officials can be promptly and speedily trained.
Also connected with the external borders is the creation of a corps of border guards.
This does not, however, mean that we can take competences away from the Member States, but rather, on the contrary, that competence to secure the borders must remain with them, whilst the European Union will provide, for fixed periods of time, on high-risk stretches of the border, and at the Member Statesâ request, special units financed by the Community in order to guarantee security there when there are temporary and special threats.
That is what is meant by a corps of border guards, and we believe that it is possible.
We of course want this to result in the Schengen standards being met as quickly as possible on all the new external borders, which means that the new Member States have the task â in which they will have the European Unionâs support â of efficiently and speedily implementing as many of the measures as possible.
The second priority is the standardised collection of data.
If we want to exchange detailed information accurately between one Member State and another, between the Member States and the Commission and with third states, we need data in standard formats, and to take appropriate steps towards having a standardised data system at our disposal.
We also urgently need the means to exchange this information with countries of origin and with transit countries.
Thirdly, we need to implement a common asylum policy, common immigration policy measures and a return policy.
Our expectation is that the Treaty will be adhered to and that the Irish Presidency will indeed manage, by May 2004 to decide on and adopt the necessary items of asylum legislation, so that we can comply with the Treaty and take the necessary political action to get a common asylum law.
That will mean speedy decision-making on our part if refugees are to be helped and action taken.
That is the second aspect of controlled and legal immigration.
As our next priority, we should introduce documents that are difficult to counterfeit or falsify.
I welcome the new requirement for biometric data to be included on visas and residence permits.
We should also be working towards forgery-proof passports and towards the legal framework and technical equipment for the visa information system, which we need.
Fifthly â and then I will finish â there is a need for information to be provided in the countries of origin, in order that suitable instruments may be used against people-smugglers.
Finally, there are the financial aspects; we have already announced that increased funds will, by 2006, be made available for the visa information system, for the return plan and for border controls, provided that Parliament is given an appropriate say in the matter.
Ambitious though all these measures are, we hope that they can be implemented during the term of this Presidency, thus enabling us to guarantee our citizens a secure Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, this long-awaited report is most timely for the preparation of strategies in view of the European Council of Thessaloniki on the development of a common policy on illegal immigration, smuggling and trafficking of human beings, external borders and the return of illegal residents.
The Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has adopted a position on illegal immigration policy by adopting this own-initiative report by Mr Pirker, whom I congratulate on the results he has achieved.
We all agree to support the creation of a European corps of border guards funded at Community level, the creation of which will require a new legal basis.
With the proposal of this solution, the proposal to set up an independent agency to control our borders automatically lapses.
Furthermore, it is a shared opinion that the Communityâs borders should remain open to people fleeing forms of repression who then apply for asylum in the Member States of the Union.
We also all agree in acknowledging that it is an exclusive right of the Member States, deriving from the principle of subsidiarity, to establish the nature and scale of legal immigration, but a common social integration policy is now essential in an area of security, common policy, social relations and economic justice.
Lastly, it is worth noting that the debate in the Committee on Citizenâs Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs came to the conclusion that bilateral readmission agreements between Member States and countries of origin and transit should, if possible, be replaced with truly Community-wide agreements, perhaps recognised by all the Member States without exception â in other words, without any opting-out.
Finally, in this common area of European commitment on immigration, I am pleased to recall â as the rapporteur also did when closing his speech â an initiative that complements this effort to combat illegal immigration.
This is the regulation that came into force on 1 January this year â just a few days ago â that will spend EURÂ 250 million over five years financing the efforts of third countries to combat illegal immigration at source.
The aim of this initiative is first to inform, and then to instruct and help to give people who intend to emigrate a thorough understanding of the value of legal emigration and all the risks involved in illegal immigration.
Â Â  .
Mr President, with regard to the report by Mr Pirker, Mr Santini has already referred to the social inclusion issue, which was endorsed in December.
The Commission welcomes the support that the Pirker Report gives to the Commission communication.
The main policy recommendations put forward in the communication were endorsed by the European Council in Thessaloniki and further developed at its meeting in Brussels in October 2003.
A major boost was therefore given in 2003 towards completing the policy framework for common management of migratory flows.
Nevertheless, these positive developments must be complemented by substantial progress in other areas of migration policy, and in particular legal migration and asylum.
The Commission has proved to be capable of delivering what was announced in the communication and requested by the Council in Thessaloniki, and moreover within very tight deadlines in some cases.
I could refer to the Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders.
Other proposals, such as visa information systems, a financial instrument for return management and a proposal for a directive on minimum standards for return procedures, will follow soon.
Following political agreement on the main elements regarding the External Borders Agency, it is now important that the Council armed with the opinion of the European Parliament formally adopt the proposal as soon as possible.
This would allow the Commission to start the preparatory work for setting up the agency in the spring of this year, with the target of having the agency operational by January 2005.
The creation of a visa information system is another important development.
The need for such a system was mentioned in our communication on illegal immigration in 2001.
The Thessaloniki European Council asked the Council and the Commission to focus on the legal and technical arrangements for the development of the VIS.
The Council is expected to agree very soon on the basic elements of the system, including its architecture and functions, taking into account financial aspects and the choice of biometric identifiers.
The Commission intends to present the first instrument for the development of the VIS in the coming weeks.
Regarding biometrics, the Commission has already submitted two proposals to amend the uniform format applying to visas and residence permits for third-country nationals so that biometric identifiers for such documents can be taken into account in future.
The Council has arrived at a common approach to these proposals, pending the opinion of the European Parliament.
Other future proposals in this field, such as the one on European Union passports, must be guided by the coherent approach in particular with respect to the biometric identifiers chosen which was defended in our communication and endorsed by the European Council.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Pirker that this is a good report, even if, personally, I would have liked to go further.
The aim of managing migratory flows is in fact rooted in the illusion of strict regulation, something which has proved impossible in the last several years.
Few countries have admitted to the limitations, let alone the failure, of the programmes they intended putting in place.
Those programmes are no match for the problems posed by the complexity and diversity of the flows, which encompass traditional movements of labour, people fleeing poverty and asylum seekers.
National traditions, cultural peculiarities, massive or residual xenophobia and a greater or lesser openness to the claims of minorities explain the differences between the Member Statesâ immigration policies.
Refugee status is particularly attractive when immigration or staying in a country legally has become virtually impossible, and it is in fact the only door that stands ajar for entry to many of our countries.
The many attempts to take advantage of it by persons not strictly covered by the Geneva Convention but who fall into the much wider category of economic migrants, attempts which are sometimes exploited by organised crime, have cast suspicion on all applicants and provided a pretext for considerable restrictions on the right to asylum, which is appalling.
Having on our territory people with no rights, with absolutely no security, in fear of being reported to the authorities, reduced to feeding the profitable illegal labour market or resorting to petty crime, but who nevertheless prefer that situation to the risk of being returned to their countries of origin, in fact raises inevitable social, moral and legal questions.
Undoubtedly, this problem needs to be tackled as one affecting all Europeans.
It is also clear that we cannot arrive at a rational policy by being guided by narrow national interests alone.
With rising populism symptomatic of xenophobia, many fear seeing the common treatment of the immigration issue take on a dangerously repressive hue, although we know full well that such a policy is no answer to the problems but that, quite the contrary, it risks enflaming them.
I want to conclude by saying that stepping up the fight against terrorism must not be allowed to affect the integrity of our immigration and asylum policies and in particular the substantial development of our national integration policies.
Immigration is a reality and we will always have to deal with flows of migrants into Europe seeking work or fleeing persecution.
Illegal immigration will not be eliminated simply by opening channels for legal immigration, that is true, but legal immigration may help to give a positive direction to our societyâs development.
Migration is a phenomenon of the contemporary world.
We cannot evade our responsibilities as rich nations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Pirkerâs report has a long title, suggesting a multiplicity of subjects.
To an extent, the mix of subjects renders the report impractical and difficult to place in relation to the real world, but that is in no way MrÂ Pirkerâs fault.
In general, I am able to support the reportâs overall objective of strengthening cooperation and coordination within the EU in these essential and cross-border areas of policy.
The report nonetheless contains a proposal that I find too far-reaching: that of establishing a federal European corps of border guards which â in contrast to, for example, Europol â would have extensive operational authority to use its powers.
I am opposed to the creation of a federal corps of border guards.
With regard to the principle of subsidiarity, I do not think that the Commission is able to document either the effect of, or the operational need for, a federal corps of border guards.
Secondly, I think it is too early to establish such a corps.
We still do not know what would be the effects of the many sensible proposals, such as those for increased cooperation and coordination between the Member Statesâ customs and border authorities.
In particular, no account has been taken of the encouraging fact that we are now working towards a better distribution of the financial burden.
Thirdly, there is simply no legal basis in the existing Treaties for a federal corps of border guards and, even if the Conventionâs proposals for new Treaty wordings were adopted, it is doubtful if there would be a legal basis for such a corps.
I recognise that, in its present form, the proposal to introduce an EU corps of border guards simply proposes a model according to which the Member States might voluntarily make use of this force.
At the same time, it is clear, however, that, if the introduction of a corps of border guards were to have any meaning at all, the Commission would, in the long term, plan to delegate a number of EU tasks to that body.
In other words, the common corps of border guards would, to an increasing degree, come under general EU legislation, and the voluntary element would thus quickly become illusory.
With regard to the proposals concerning the biometric data, I do not wish to comment in more detail upon these at the present time.
I am myself rapporteur for the report on which Parliament is to adopt a position, and it will not be long before we have a debate on it.
To sum up, I recommend, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in the report.
At the same time, it is, however, crucial for me to emphasise that what I want is a common policy in this area and not a common police force.
Â Â  Mr President, I note our rapporteurâs concern to strike a balance between secure borders and respect for basic rights and I welcome our committeeâs work to give this report a more humanitarian face.
I also welcome the European Commissionâs efforts to develop genuine European policies on immigration and asylum.
Despite all these efforts, the Tampere agenda will not, however, be kept to.
Many of the Commissionâs proposals are at present pending before the Council.
The few measures that have been taken come in for regular criticism and the directive on family reunification is still the subject of an appeal by our Parliament before the Court of Justice.
For some time now, we have noted with regret that the driving force behind immigration and asylum policy has been the security of the Member States above all.
In reality, this results in an intensive and often disproportionate struggle against illegal immigration, which is considered a threat, a source of terrorism and a destabilising factor.
That is therefore the vision of the Council and the Member States, a highly security-conscious, repressive and utilitarian vision geared to their own needs and disregarding the needs of others.
The proliferation of border control authorities is an illustration of this.
While it is legitimate for the Union to want to protect its residents and its interests, the Member States must be aware that only an overall, integrated approach will produce an effective European policy.
For that, such an approach must at one and the same time include a management of migratory flows that allows legal immigration, the socio-economic, cultural and political integration of third country nationals and cooperation with third countries in a Community framework.
Fighting illegal immigration means above all protecting its victims, in particular fighting the trafficking in human beings and the networks of unscrupulous smugglers.
To this end, we call on the Member States to ratify the Palermo Convention.
To date, only Denmark, France and Spain have done so.
Illegal immigration will not dry up so long as there are still such yawning economic and political gaps between North and South.
People are right to want to flee horrendous situations.
All too often, the democratic deficit goes hand in hand with the social and humanitarian deficit.
We must not, however, bury our heads in the sand: illegal immigration is also a necessity for our economy.
Today, all liberal policies argue for a return to a measure of specific immigration.
Thus, the countries of the North are allowed to transform the South into a manpower supermarket to meet the needs of its enterprises for a specific period.
This effectively plunders the productive forces of the South.
The Unionâs policy for fighting illegal immigration will not be credible without measures to combat moonlighting, but instead of penalising those who come to our countries looking for hope, we should be penalising employers who shamelessly exploit immigrants who have no papers.
On the other hand, such a policy must regularise those immigrantsâ situations, recognise them, give them rights, give them the means to fight against discrimination and exclusion and make them our equals.
Any returning of people whose situation is irregular must fully respect their human rights and comply with international conventions, including the right to seek asylum.
The European Parliament will shortly be deciding on the Italian initiative which seeks to coordinate expulsions of aliens by using joint European charters.
We clearly condemn such a project, which neither complies with our international commitments nor respects basic rights.
Readmission agreements can be an adequate framework for a return policy only if they take sufficient account both of the interests of the third countries and the wishes and plans of the person concerned.
For that to happen, they must be given genuine assisted returns so that they can be fully reintegrated both socially and economically.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report by Mr Pirker â whom I congratulate â clearly sets out the need finally to create a common policy at European level against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
While the Member States must specifically retain their competences regarding the security of their external borders and the establishment of domestic immigration quotas, it is equally necessary and urgent to set up effective transnational cooperation to create a common on visas, border control and repatriation, as the rapporteur has underlined.
An effective coordination policy, the harmonisation of certain procedures and the prompt exchange of information would make it possible to combat illegal immigration more effectively, as well as many other criminal activities that are linked to it: drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings, to give just a couple of examples.
It is worth recalling that an intransigent policy of combating illegal immigration would not only give Europeâs citizens greater confidence and security but would also allow all legal immigrants to enjoy their rights and opportunities to the full.
In any case, it should be underlined that the European Union should strengthen its external relations with all those non-Community countries that want to collaborate effectively in combating illegal immigration and should also promote the so-called special quota policy for such countries.
I do not believe it is mere rhetoric, then, to recall that we must direct our greatest efforts to a strong cooperation and development policy, which will in general help most to contain immigration and stop the outflow of people and hence of manpower, as well as the brain drain, from the countries of origin, not only to avoid draining the developing countries of human resources but also to avoid condemning them to certain, irreversible economic and social decline.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in this communication, the Commission assesses the progress made in combating illegal immigration.
The Commission explains what has happened to date and aims to set out guidelines for the future.
In so doing, it focuses on a number of points that it considers essential in bringing about an effective policy.
I should like to give a few examples of these.
The first is visa policy, where the Commission rightly advocates the prompt establishment of the Visa Information System (VIS).
Making documents unforgeable is vitally important to a secure system, and, therefore, there is a need for a clear choice of one or more biometric identifiers that will be stored in the system.
Then there is external borders policy, within which the Commission proposes a European Corps of Border Guards under its own aegis.
As far as we are concerned, that is going too far.
I agree with MrÂ SÃžrensen in that regard.
The protection of external borders remains, in principle, a national concern.
Cooperation is necessary, but this cooperation can also take a less far-reaching form than the Commission is proposing.
The Commission rightly emphasises the importance of a common return policy to the credibility of European immigration and asylum policy, but I cannot see the connection that seems to be made between permitting legal immigration on the one hand, and a direct decrease in asylum seekers and illegal immigration on the other.
I wish to join the rapporteur, MrÂ Pirker, in emphasising that the Member States have an exclusive right to lay down provisions governing whether or not to permit legal immigration.
I am not yet convinced by the Councilâs proposal to agree legal immigration quotas, particularly if this is done in order to achieve a better outcome of negotiations on readmission agreements with third countries.
Individual Member States must at all events retain the option of prohibiting all legal immigration.
Finally, I fully support the Commissionâs wish that the budgetary dimension of the solidarity principle be recognised in the field of immigration and border controls, provided that this principle is also recognised in other fields, such as asylum policy and the reception of refugees.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union faces a growing problem of illegal immigration.
An integrated and global approach must be developed, in order to prevent and eradicate this phenomenon and to combat its underlying causes.
The Tampere Council called for a common asylum and immigration policy; at Laeken and Seville the need was confirmed to effectively combat illegal immigration and an initial balance sheet was drawn up of the progress that has been made in this field in the framework of the Thessaloniki decisions, which lay behind this initiative.
I wish to congratulate Mr Pirker on the excellent report he has presented to us.
I agree with him when he emphasises the need for a universal and coherent approach.
There are eight points that I wish to highlight:
- firstly, the existence of legal channels of immigration that enable the citizens of third countries to enter the European Union on the basis of each Member Stateâs capacity to receive people, This will require closer cooperation with the countries of origin;
- secondly, integrating legal immigrants who live and work in the European Union by means of a common social integration policy that strikes a balance between the rights and the corresponding obligations of these citizens and the host societies;
- thirdly, the joint management of migratory flows, in particular visa policy, because agreement must be reached as swiftly as possible on the necessary legal, technical and financial bases of the visa information system (VIS);
- fourthly, improving controls at the external borders, which means creating a European border guard;
- fifthly, the much-trumpeted European asylum system;
- in sixth place, negotiating readmission agreements, with a common policy for returning persons in an illegal situation, with minimum rules for return procedures and the mutual recognition of these decisions, and with the co-financing of projects for cooperation under a programme of aid for return;
- in seventh place, combating trafficking in human beings, calling to account those who profit from this business and providing support for the victims of trafficking.
It is worth highlighting the importance of increasing operational support for Europol in preventing and combating this type of trafficking;
- my eighth and final point is the fight against illegal immigration, which means investing in information on prospects for legal immigration that provide a genuine alternative.
Â Â  Mr President, as is customary I would like to begin my remarks by congratulating the rapporteur.
This is done with a bit more sincerity than is sometimes the case as I can give great credit to Mr Pirker.
If he had asked me whether it was possible to draft a report on immigration or asylum for our committee and win almost unanimous support for it, or bring it to plenary and find that with a few exceptions it was voted through, I would have said that would have been impossible.
However, by sleight of hand and various other tactics, he seems to have managed to present something that is going to command support across Parliament.
He deserves credit for that, as do the Commission and the Council for the way it has been presented and brought forward.
Mr Pirker and others have highlighted particular aspects and it would be easy to draw attention to them.
Indeed, there is a lot to concentrate on, but I do hope that this report is seen as part of a wider package and that we do not lose sight of our overall aim of moving towards not only a common European policy on asylum but also, in parallel, a separate and equally important common European policy on legal immigration.
This is reinforced in points 16 and 17.
I turn now to the aspect of external borders â points 2, 3, 4 and 5, etc. â and cooperation amongst Member States.
I take issue with Mr Blokland and Mr SÃžrensen, who claim this is entirely a subsidiarity question.
Everyone is affected by external borders, even in countries that do not have them.
The very nature of migration is such that people do not stay in the first country they get to; they move around.
So it is very important for all countries to cooperate and work together, especially, as MrÂ Pirker has highlighted, in an enlarged European Union of 25 Member States.
As we ponder all these issues, it is equally important that we look further afield to those countries just outside the European Union and bear in mind their situation, as well as that of countries further afield which are less prosperous and from which people, for a whole variety of reasons, try to move away.
This picks up on a point also alluded to by Mrs Roure.
If priorities and finances were directed towards helping these less-developed countries and those in internal conflict, we might be doing as much to address the challenges of migration as we are in all the post-Seville and Thessaloniki projects that have been put into operation.
I welcome this report.
It is a move in the right direction and I hope very much that it commands the support of Parliament tomorrow.
My final point is linguistic and I have made it before.
I hope we can in future move away from the term 'burden-sharing' and adopt the term 'responsibility-sharing', because that, and cooperation, is what is involved here.
Â Â  Mr President, Members such as myself have complained over the last five years that when the Council holds debates, purportedly about asylum and immigration as a whole, it only ever talks about combating illegal immigration.
I am pleased to say that Mr Pirker's report turns that tendency on its head.
In a report responding to a Commission communication specifically on illegal immigration, he pays a great deal of attention to how opening up legal migration channels can help combat smuggling and trafficking.
Indeed, in his report, on which I also congratulate him, there are 15 references to illegal immigration.
That is nearly matched by 11 references to legal migration.
This is truly welcome.
Like Mr SÃžrensen, I cannot share Mr Pirker's enthusiasm for a European corps of border guards.
No-one seems to be clear what this means.
Mr Pirker says it would just be a unit in support of national border guards and not a supranational body replacing them, but some Commission documents suggest that the ultimate aim is indeed some sort of supranational force with power over national authorities.
It is dangerous to start going down this route without having a clear idea about the final destination.
Obviously we need to have maximum coordination and exchanges to provide a more uniform level of security at external borders, but there is plenty more we can do about that before rushing into a centrally managed EU body that would raise all kinds of legal difficulties regarding border guards exercising power outside their own jurisdiction.
There could be very practical problems.
Imagine, for example, the case of Euro-guards stationed on a border where local pay rates were lower than elsewhere, and the resentment that would create among lower-paid local staff.
We are already seeing that sort of thing in the Balkans.
Finally, I urge the British Government to recognise the contradictions in its own approach.
It constantly lectures other Member States on the need to strengthen external border controls, but refuses to make any constructive contribution to Schengen or to support the common immigration policy.
This ambivalence cannot continue.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr Pirker on his report.
There are some interesting aspects in it that I can support, but the issue of the creation of border guards with police powers is a disturbing development.
One of the issues that has not really been taken into account is the control and accountability of these police guards.
This is the wrong direction to take.
In general there is too much emphasis on turning this matter into a criminal issue.
I listened to the speaker from the UEN Group, who lumped illegal immigrants in with drugs traffickers, but there is a big difference between the two.
Illegal immigrants may be illegal, but they are still just ordinary people and not criminals.
All they are doing is desperately trying to find somewhere to live.
The whole emphasis on keeping people out has to be addressed.
We should in fact be addressing the issue of why people want to enter the European Union, instead of building our barricades higher.
More and more people are being driven into the hands of people traffickers and, as my colleague has said, the whole issue of work practices and exploitation needs to be tackled.
We have to examine, with regard to illegal immigration, the root cause of why people have to leave their own country, and this is a human rights issue rather than a criminal issue.
Â Â  Mr President, a Community policy on the movement of third country nationals must be innovative and responsible.
Innovative, as the report states, in the close interaction between, on the one hand, enhanced measures against illegal immigration and, on the other, a policy in the field of legal immigration that is geared towards Member Statesâ capacities and needs.
Promoting common asylum and return policies and introducing more secure documents or undertaking awareness-raising campaigns in the countries of transit and of origin of illegal immigration are areas in which innovation can be demonstrated.
What, furthermore, do we understand by the term âresponsible policy?
It does not necessarily mean consolidating our external borders, turning the Union into a fortress, but nor does it mean opening up these borders willy-nilly, leaving to their fate the individuals who are anxious to enter our countries.
Reality has shown that neither of these methods is up to the task and we therefore want to see rules of entry that enable us to be generous in integrating immigrants.
This is where our social concerns arise.
We do not want these people to live in our countries without being integrated, without participating, benefiting or having obligations towards the Community that they are joining.
It is this dialogue between rights and obligations, defining the way people function within society, that we want to maintain.
Realistically speaking, reception implies a mutual benefit for the individual and for the host State.
This common policy will, however, be less efficient if supported by only one of the parties involved and we therefore welcome the cooperation agreements with the countries of origin and of transit that have just been concluded.
We cannot agree in the same way, however, to the planned creation of a European Corps of Border Guards, which needs to be discussed at greater length.
We do welcome, though, the option to include in these agreements economic or commercial measures, which would only enter into force if the agreements were complied with.
This is a question of honouring commitments that have been given.
I will conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent contribution he has made to promoting a responsible, tough and generous Community policy on the movement of people, with the participation of all the parties involved.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0479/2003) by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the development of the services sector for job creation (2003/2132(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative to draft this report derives from our common conviction of the need to speed up the Barcelona process and, specifically, the need to strengthen the European economy and the European job market by creating new, high-quality jobs.
The services sector includes a wide range of services in the public and private sectors.
It is the fastest growing and developing sector in the European economy.
Over the last 20 years, around 2/3 of the growth in the gross domestic product of the European Union has come from the services sector, while the greatest increase in the employment rate has again been in this sector.
Today, services account for approximately 69% of total employment.
The aim of our policy must be to increase this percentage and it is worth mentioning that, in the United States, the corresponding figure is 80%.
At the same time, we must pay attention to the fact that the situation in the development of the services sector differs from one Member State to another in the European Union.
The countries with the most serious structural problems, such as Greece and Portugal, have the lowest employment rates in services.
The rates are equally low, with the exception of Cyprus, in the new Member States.
Our policy, at both European and national level, must play a significant role in the development of services.
Successful regulation of the services markets is genuinely important for protecting consumer interests, ensuring quality and guaranteeing fair competition.
There are still very inflexible regulations, however, which are stifling economic activity.
As a matter of urgency, accurately targeted measures must be drawn up and implemented to guarantee a satisfactory level of protection in such a way that service providers and services themselves can establish themselves throughout Community territory.
Similarly, without modern, low-cost infrastructures, Europe cannot hope to meet the challenges in store for it, given the fact that international competitiveness in services is constantly increasing throughout the world.
The completion of this infrastructure depends upon the liberalisation of the energy and telecommunications markets, so that we have easy and cheap access to them, and on the trans-European networks programme, in order to increase the potential of the market.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the European Commission to publish a White Paper, proposing separate employment policies for each sector, so that we soon see the completion of a successful European market.
The Committee also calls on the European Commission to propose a directive on services within the framework of the internal market, in order to deal with obstacles to the movement of workers and the provision of services.
However, the Member States also need to restrict their bureaucratic procedures, both for the start-up and for the operation of services.
An appropriate framework of conditions needs to created, with regulatory and financial provisions and provisions on fair competition; new forms of employment in the services sector, such as part-time work, teleworking and temporary work, need to be strengthened; conditions need to be created for an appropriate, flexible and productive workforce that receives ongoing training; safe and healthy working conditions need to be created and undeclared work which, apart from debasing employment and workers, is a source of distortion of competition, needs to be combated.
Investment is also needed in innovation in the services sector, because at the moment industry has the greatest interest in investment in innovation.
We therefore need, both in the private sector and in the public sector, which is lagging well behind, to invest in innovation and research and to link our policy on services with policy to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises and the industrial sector in general, because industry and services are interdependent.
We need to develop entrepreneurship in young people and promote self-employment, because the development of new activities in services calls for daring, imagination and innovation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Kratsa personally for her initiative in drafting this particular report, because it is a fact that the development of the services sector and combating the problem of unemployment, in other words job creation, are directly related.
As Mrs Kratsa said, there is a close connection between the development of an economy and the percentage of employment in the services sector.
If we bear in mind that we need to create 22Â million jobs by 2010, in order to meet the Lisbon target, and that, on the basis of the information which we have, 67% of jobs are being created in services, we can understand how important the question of developing services is to attaining the objective of full employment.
The proposals contained in the report are in keeping to a large extent with the objectives of the European strategy on employment, as incorporated in the guidelines on employment in 2003, which were approved last July and which we have debated repeatedly both in the Committee on Employment and in Plenary.
I should like to refer to certain issues in the guidelines which basically coincide with the proposals in the report.
I would remind you that guideline 2 refers very specifically to entrepreneurship, to the link between creating jobs and entrepreneurship, and the Member States are called on to encourage innovation in entrepreneurship, the ability to invest and a favourable business environment for all businesses.
Of course, there is a link between these individual sectors and adaptability, by which we mean how specific undertakings, how the public sector in question could change how it is organised, promote lifelong learning, promote the question of gender equality, so that it is easier to move from the manufacturing sector to the services sector.
One important section of the proposals is therefore addressed in the guidelines on employment.
A second category of Commission initiatives and proposals concerns investment in human resources.
We cannot develop services if we do not invest in human resources.
Here we have Commission proposals on research, training, lifelong learning and the specific objectives set in the Member States in relation to their education systems, be they in connection with the first stages of children leaving school or support for families and social infrastructures.
The third important Commission initiative is that yesterday it approved a proposal for a directive on services within the framework of the internal market.
This will give this sector additional dynamism, with beneficial results for employment.
So, taking account of these three sectors: first, the specific guidelines in the strategy on employment which essentially and to a large extent relate to the need to develop services; secondly, the need for investment in human resources and, thirdly, the directive on services within the framework of the internal market, I think that, on the part of the European Union, there is an important framework which could help the Member States to implement their individual national policies.
I should like to emphasise that it is also clear in the report by Mrs Kratsa that she is calling not for the creation of additional means, but for greater specialisation in the existing strategy on employment, to take account of the special characteristics of the services sector.
I absolutely agree with her and, of course, this debate will also continue in the European Parliament for some time to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, the development of the services sector constitutes the great hope of the young generations for their integration into the new economy.
There is no sector of the economy which does not require services, including the private sector, or in which the services provided are not acquiring greater and greater interest.
It is therefore correct that there must be mobilisation on a broader front for the prospects which are opening up with services and I should like to congratulate my honourable friend, Mrs Kratsa, for taking the initiative and drafting this report.
As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which did me the honour of appointing me to draft our opinion, I should like to refer to certain aspects which link the internal market with the development of the job market, especially the services market, and with policies against exclusion.
As we all know, the future of the internal market and the essential benefit to consumers will depend on the degree to which cross-border trade develops.
However, the cross-border provision of services is still failing to progress.
Consequently, one of our first concerns is to remove the obstacles to the cross-border development of services, limit the problems which still exist in free movement and establishment and further facilitate the recognition of professional qualifications, without clinging to the shackles of the past which, unfortunately, numerous associations of the liberal professions still persist in doing.
Furthermore, in order to strengthen the cross-border provision of services, both with the direct provision of services to consumers and with business-to-business services, we need to look at strengthening e-commerce and, from that perspective, to promote and develop the new standards of consumption which produce services and, of course, guarantee consumer confidence.
Given, moreover, that the charter for small and medium-sized enterprises already constitutes an initiative in which we have invested a great many expectations, we need to look at the possibilities, either through funding or by guaranteeing the insurance rights and strengthening the initiative of young people who want to break into the services sector in the form of self-employment or by setting up small undertakings.
I should also like to remind you that the services sector is the sector for taking up people with disabilities and keeping elderly people as active members in the market.
We also all know that a significant part of all services which are provided to a society are taken up by services of general interest.
The policy on services of general economic interest to date has, according to the evaluations, brought about positive results.
However, we do not have a complete picture of the exact impact it has had on the question of employment, which is why, in view also of today's motion on the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission should proceed to make a systematic inventory of the repercussions of the liberalisation of these services on employment, in conjunction of course with the degree to which the needs of society as a whole are served.
Consequently, the report is an excellent opportunity for a renewed horizontal reading of the individual policies of the European Union, in light of their contribution to the development of services.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on drafting this report, which demonstrates the importance of formulating practical policies at Community level for the services sector.
This sector is, in fact, a catalyst for job creation and, as such, must be given due attention.
Consequently, if we wish to achieve the objectives set out at Lisbon, we must act and act swiftly.
The situation of the various Member States as regards the services sector is extremely diverse: Portugal, for example, has enormous potential to create jobs in this field, especially intensive knowledge-based services to be supplied to businesses and other institutions, family support services and tourism and associated activities.
Given the crucial role of the services sector in improving the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy and in creating more and better jobs, Portugal has paid particular attention to this field in its national employment plan for the period 2003 to 2006.
Even so, Portugal, together with Greece, has the European Unionâs lowest employment rate in the services sector, as the rapporteur pointed out a few moments ago.
A boost needs to be given, therefore, at Community level and hence our support for the rapporteurâs request for the Commission to draw up a White Paper on completing a successful European services market.
The Member States have a crucial role to play in this matter, since it is they, together with the social partners, who must develop a clear and effective framework for the services sector.
It also falls to the Member States to ensure that the appropriate policies are implemented and to invest in training and qualifications for the work force.
Furthermore, the administrative barriers obstructing the free movement of workers and the cross-border provision of services must be removed.
Lastly, I wish to underline the need for the Commission and the Member States to promote an open method of coordination for national employment policies in the services sector, with the aim of exchanging information and best practice.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by personally congratulating the rapporteur on her work and the exhaustive nature of her proposals in the job-creating service sector.
Some of those proposals may of course find greater support than others.
As a whole, however, they will remain for me a major contribution to the matter at a time when a large number of people are hard hit by unemployment and when insecure jobs and contracts are proliferating.
For all that, to make things clear, after those personal congratulations, as spokesman for the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I have to express our reservations about the constant reference to competition, the market and its rules and also our disagreement with an over-strict application of the principle of mutual recognition in a sector that also covers public services and services of the social economy.
Neither must it be forgotten, and I will be brief on this point today, that we do not consider the de-industrialisation of Europe to be inevitable, especially since, in terms of jobs, it is and will be increasingly difficult to compensate for the disappearance of industrial jobs by jobs in the service sector.
Having said that and pointed it out, it is very important to note, as you did, MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the importance of this service sector, just as it is important to identify the potential and the conditions for job creation.
It is even more necessary for us to say what the real needs for services are.
It is obvious in the matter of care, for children and infants, for the disabled and the elderly.
For these, the service sector is essential for maintaining full citizenship irrespective of age, physical condition or health.
But at this stage I want to say equally clearly that there is a need for legal, legislative or contractual controls in order to avoid abuses that result in precariousness such as exists in the US system.
That is why we must upgrade the existing professions in the service sector in order to offer quality jobs with correct remuneration and working conditions.
We must increase the quality of this new form of employment, part-time working as it happens, ensuring that the same high level of protection and job security is guaranteed to all workers and improving the working conditions of women.
We must close the pay gap between men and women and the differences in the level of access to employment and job promotion.
Finally, we must increase cooperation in the fight against undeclared work.
Our rapporteur and the members of our committees have worked well.
And while, like the majority of my group, I do not think that the implementation of these measures will solve all the fundamental problems of work and employment, I am, Mr President, personally in favour of every form of improvement, provided those improvements are real.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to convey my thanks to the rapporteur.
Her report has looked at both the possibilities and the challenges of the developing service sector.
It is a highly complex area, not least because there is a divide between services that are geographically fixed, either owing to where the clientele is or where the resources are, and those that are far more moveable.
One of the future challenges concerns the way in which those services do not necessarily move within one Member State or across borders, but indeed out of the European Union altogether.
This type of mobility, which we might not have sought quite so anxiously, will be a future challenge for us.
I am very pleased about the attention paid to women in this report.
As the rapporteur pointed out in the report, women are overwhelmingly employed in the service sector.
Indeed certain jobs are very heavily gendered, particularly in the public and care services.
Many of these sectors also have a significant number of migrant, black and ethnic minority workers, so they are important in terms of integration and social inclusion.
We welcome the emphasis placed on the specific training needs required if we are going to provide quality employment.
However, we need to look very carefully at how we avoid this huge divide that currently exists in the services sector between high value, highly-paid jobs and those which are poorly paid under intense cost pressure; how we allow people in those sectors to develop their talents and to find mobility is going to be extremely important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her forward-looking report on developing the service sector in such a way as to create new and, I would emphasise, important future jobs.
I wish at the same time to express my pleasure and satisfaction at the fact that MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, as rapporteur, and the committee as a whole have so kindly dealt with the many amendments I put forward.
I would mention a number of them in this House, item by item.
Firstly, undeclared, or âblackâ, work must be converted into regular work within the service sector in order to improve the general business climate and taxpayer morale and to create competition under equal conditions.
The EU must step up cooperation in combating âblackâ work.
Secondly, the European Parliament should call upon the Member States to develop and stimulate the support and household-related service sector in order to make it easier to combine working life and family life, especially in the light of the European Unionâs having identified the demographic challenge as one of its most important issues for the future.
Thirdly, the European Parliament should make the Member States aware that demographic developments in the majority of Member States are such that work in the area of care for the elderly should be accorded higher status, especially among young people.
I want to emphasise that.
Fourthly, the European Parliament should emphasise to the Member States the urgent importance of increasing opportunities for disabled people and immigrants to have access to the labour market in the service sector.
Such improvements are necessary in the light of future needs in, for example, the health and health care sectors, as well as in order to increase these groupsâ participation and integration in the labour market and in the social community.
I would also emphasise the need for the report to signal the value of entrepreneurship and the spirit of new enterprise in the service sector, as well as the evolution of a dynamic and creatively developed cooperative service and business sector.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in warmly congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of her report.
If we were to analyse the changes in employment figures in the various economic sectors, we would soon see a rapid and significant reduction in the number of people carrying out their activities in the agricultural sector, a different trend towards job losses in the industrial sector and, in contrast, a clear positive increase in the numbers of people working in the services sector.
Perhaps, amongst other things, as a result of the skill and the technical, professional and intellectual capacity of the people who carry out their activity in the services sector.
Furthermore, the range of services is extremely broad, from transport to education, from commerce to hotels and catering, from tourism to leisure activities and, furthermore, the services are greatly affected by demographic changes in society.
Activities relating to care of the elderly, or those stemming from the need to reconcile professional and family life are clear examples.
At the same time, this sector creates the conditions for the others, including agriculture and, also in the knowledge and information-based economy, the skill of the service provider generates new jobs.
It is necessary to stress the possibilities arising from the whole, from cooperation between the different administrations, since local administration â the closest â has the best knowledge of the needs of potential job seekers and the means to satisfy them.
Furthermore, I believe it appropriate to âhorizontaliseâ policies such as health and safety at work, equality for women and non-discrimination, as laid down in Articles 20 and 21 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, we must not forget ongoing training, since, as the rapporteur says, a services sector with low salaries means a low level of quality, qualifications and productivity, and that means a reduction in the economyâs capacity to generate innovation, sustainable wealth and social cohesion.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0448/2003) by Anne-Karin Glase, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the implementation of Directive 96/71/EC in the Member States (COM(2003) 458 â 2003/2168(INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Posting of Workers Directive was enacted in 1996 with the aim of eliminating obstacles and uncertainties concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.
It did this by providing greater legal certainty and making it possible to identify the working conditions that apply to workers temporarily working in a Member State other than the State whose legislation governs the employment relationship.
As provided for in Article 8 of Directive 96/71/EC, in the current communication the Commission summarises the results of its review of the implementation of the Directive in the 15 Member States and of its practical application, in order to decide whether the Directive needs to be revised.
The communication shows that implementation of the Directive has, generally speaking, been satisfactory, although it should be noted that the United Kingdom and Ireland have no specific implementing provisions and that Luxembourg was the last Member State to complete transposition, which it did only 13 months ago.
I would like to reiterate that five years of highly problematic debates were needed before the Posting of Workers Directive was adopted in 1996.
It has now been shown that difficulties have arisen, in that the directive requires the businesses to which it applies to comply with the laws of a State other than that in which they are established, laws which are sometimes not readily accessible or comprehensible.
These problems need to be resolved at national level, as they are problems related to the transposition of the Directive into Member Statesâ legislation, which can result in difficulties in monitoring compliance with it.
In its communication, the Commission summarises the problems involved in transposing and applying the Directive, which are more practical than legal in nature.
It has, in consequence, set up a group of experts â made up of civil servants from the Member States â with the objective of finding solutions to the problems described, such as ways of improving access to, and exchange of, information on national rules and legislation or of collecting required information in a standard form.
The Committee is still of the opinion that this directive is a necessary one, and expresses the hope that the problems brought to light may be speedily removed, particularly in view of the fact that, on 1 May this year, 10 new countries will be covered by the Directive.
We have to ensure legal certainty for the workers posted by enterprises participating in the internal market.
Furthermore, the Committee wishes to point out that it is essential that the implementation of the Directive be monitored in order to assess the effectiveness of the legislation, and that this will be made even more important by EU enlargement.
It also calls upon the Commission to submit better and more concrete data on the implications of implementation at national level, to lay down clear definitions of such things as the status of employees, minimum wages and overtime and to prevent the improper posting of workers, which is a consequence of unfair competition and social dumping.
We also call on the Commission to examine the provisions regulating liability in the case of subcontracting in with the Posting of Workers Directive.
There is a need for comprehensive enquiries and surveys in the 15 â soon to be 25 â Member States if we are to have an exact picture of the situation that makes comparison possible.
The Committee also believes that the Commission should support the group of experts and that this work should involve the collective bargaining partners, the European Parliament, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the social partners.
The Committee calls upon the Commission to cooperate closely with the social partners in detailed research with the aim to producing proposals for the improvement and simplification of the present Directive, which must give especial priority to the effects of EU enlargement.
As the large number of demands made upon the Commission and the Member States makes any delay undesirable, my view, as rapporteur, is that the demand made of the Commission by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it submit a second report on the implementation of the Directive by the end of this year is not one that the Commission will be able to comply with.
Although, for this reason, I am unable to endorse Amendment NoÂ 1, I do want to put the case for the Amendment No 4 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation.
Â Â  . I thank Parliament for the interest it has shown in the Posted Workers Directive and in the Commission's communication.
It was clearly visible in the draft report on the implementation of that directive and was indeed highlighted in the discussions that led to its adoption in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The Commission clearly shares this interest and agrees with Parliament that this directive continues to be an essential element for companies and workers alike.
As regards the practical operation of the directive and its implementing legislation, we all agree that it is necessary to improve cooperation between the administration of the Member States on the one hand, and the dissemination of information on the applicable terms and employment conditions for workers and service providers on the other hand.
My services will evaluate the existing difficulties there will be cooperation between my services, a group of government experts and social partners.
We will discuss it in the liaison forum, which has been scheduled for 10 February, and will try to find practical solutions to political problems.
As far as the accession countries are concerned and the rapporteur has already underlined the importance of the implementation of this directive in these countries they have to transpose and implement this directive by 1 May.
The Commission will prepare a report on the implementation of this directive in the course of this year; we hope to present it by the end of 2005.
With regard to the need for legislative action, I am aware that some of you do not share the view held by the Member States' experts and the Commission that amendment of the directive is not necessary at this stage.
Even though I am not convinced that substantial amendment of the text of the directive is necessary at this stage, I can assure you that my services will pay close attention to the arguments raised by national administrations and the social partners in their respective contacts.
Also within that context, the Commission will take the necessary initiatives to ensure thorough consideration â together with the Member States' experts and the social partners â of the issues raised by the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate Mrs Glase on the good work she has done.
Within the context of the free movement of people, the report focuses on the posting of workers in three possible circumstances: posting within the framework of a contract signed between the company of origin and the receiver of the services; secondly, the possible posting of workers to a workplace or company which belongs to the same group; and thirdly, the posting of workers from a temporary work agency based in a Member State which provides them for a employer acting in a Member State other than that of the provider.
Any of these circumstances can cause a variety of problems for posted workers: probably the first to spring to mind concerns their working conditions; hence the importance of Directive 96/71/EC, which is a catalogue of minimum rules for Community law protection, although it is insufficient, since it does not cover rules or aspects such as Social Security.
I believe the rapporteur has identified the problems correctly: unfair competition, differences in social protection and, therefore, harm for workers, the need for a clear definition of the Workersâ Statute.
We should, however, and this has also been mentioned, add possible abuse in posting and the problems stemming from subcontracting and generally from new forms of externalisation, decentralisation or deconcentration of production or, if you like, from the new forms of productive organisation.
In summary, Commissioner, I believe we are faced with an opportunity, or perhaps the need, for a common core of obligatory minimum standards for all cases and as a minimum guarantee, below which the working condition or the provision of services is illegal when the legislation of the State in which the service is provided offers less protection than that of the place of origin of the posting.
Without a guarantee of this kind, in the territory in which it may take place, I believe that the possibility of abuse and fraud are within reach of irresponsible employers.
What is worse, we could be inviting them to commit this fraud or abuse.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are somewhat surprised by the difficulty that the Commission sometimes has with complex social policy legislation like the Posting of Workers Directive, with evaluating them, reforming them where necessary, with reports to Parliament and also with new concepts.
That happened, unfortunately, with the European Works Council, and it is, equally unfortunately, happening with the Posting of Workers Directive now.
This is astonishing, for both of these acts to which I have referred send out messages to workers and the public, signalling that we do in fact have such a thing as a European social model.
That is what makes it regrettable.
When the Committee was debating this, the Commission even sought to persuade us that all the problems with the Directive had nothing to do with Europe, but largely resulted from defects in transposition at national level.
We do not believe that to be the case.
The way in which the Directive is implemented can hardly be described as satisfactory when there are hundreds of appeals pending before national and regional labour and social security tribunals.
Even though these are national courts, it goes to show that there is something lacking in the Directive itself and that there is inadequate legal certainty.
Rare though it is for us to criticise the Commission for this, it is for this reason that we believe that your report oversimplifies matters, and the same criticism can, alas, be levelled at the rapporteur.
Nevertheless, Mrs Glase, there was outstanding cooperation, and I cannot be other than grateful to you for having accepted nine out of the ten amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
I also want to agree with Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, who pointed out that abuses persist and that employers are still exploiting workers, and, extraordinarily enough, we see not only in Germany but also in other countries how very creative employers can be when it comes to getting round the law.
What that means is that the only thing this House wants to argue about is the timescale, and I can be quite frank in telling you that we are not talking about giving the Commission one month more or less to draft a new and thorough report.
We have learned from experience, though, that if we give you 14 months instead of 12, it will take you 22 or 26, and so, as we need to exert a certain amount of pressure, we have decided to ask for 12 months.
This is regrettable, as we otherwise agree, but I will conclude by saying that I am convinced that this is a deadline you can meet if, in carrying out the analysis, you join with the social partners and the European trades unions, who already have the necessary data, with details of the deficits and abuses, ready to hand.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Glase is right to state in her report that the Posting of Workers Directive may well have been in place since 1996, but that, in practice, workers have no legal certainty in the workplace and that their employment relationships are often unfair.
I know from my conversations over the past years on the largest building site in the centre of Berlin that the people we are dealing with here are the working poor.
Building workers from the United Kingdom, Portugal and many other European States have built a railway station and office buildings for businesses and the government without having a regulated working day, on unequal pay in comparison to their German fellow-workers, not to mention not having sickness and accident insurance.
Is it the case, then, that the Posting of Workers Directive is the wrong instrument, or is it just used wrongly?
The Glase Report gives that question a clear answer: the Directive is the proper instrument for guaranteeing equal pay for equal work at the same place of work, but the way in which the Member States apply it is atrocious.
I believe that this is primarily the result of the lack of effective sanctions.
Even if it is found that a Portuguese companyâs workers do not enjoy the same pay and conditions as those of the German firm next door, and this is confirmed by the Labour Officeâs inspections, nothing happens.
In a matter of a few weeks, the company is back in Portugal, where the imposition of a fine in Germany is of interest to nobody.
This is where businesses make a net profit by circumventing the law, and so fines must be enforced on a Europe-wide basis; the Council decision to this effect is long overdue.
We thank the rapporteur for adding her support to this amendment.
It must no longer pay to circumvent the rules; black sheep must be branded.
Only thus can the public lose their fear of eastward enlargement and of the social dumping that they believe will result from it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the others who have contributed to this report.
I believe that it is very significant that we have concluded that further research is needed.
I think it a shame in itself that this further research was not carried out in parallel with the discussions that were held with the Member States, because that might have saved some time.
Now that it is like this, however, I do think that MrsÂ Glase is quite right when she says that that is not to be expected with the proposed amendment.
Therefore, I think that it is simply not possible.
What we are dealing with here is a very important directive.
Why is it so important?
We must look into the past to find the answer to this question.
There have been two important periods.
There was the period in which a good few people from the United Kingdom, in particular, came to work on the continent; and there was the period in which a good few people, chiefly from Eastern Europe, came here to work.
Both periods gave rise to a good few problems.
At that time, Germany still had a genuine social policy.
I have the impression that that has now been somewhat diluted, but at that time it was still being conducted.
It was then that the legislation on posted workers was conceived, and this matter at European level evolved from that.
I agree that the practical implementation is far from ideal, but we must recognise that this is ultimately a matter for national governments.
We can urge them to do much better â and it is also my opinion that the priority accorded to this matter is completely inadequate â but I should also like to sound a note of caution.
Recently, I happened to be on a mission in the east of the Netherlands, and we saw that the new enlargement will cause new problems there, to which implementation of the idea and principles of this Directive would present an eminently suitable solution.
If we fail to implement these, we can indeed expect a problem or two; not because people want that, but because there are always people who are on the lookout for loopholes in legislation and perhaps go on to exploit these, and that then produces all manner of undesirable repercussions.
I think, therefore, that we have to be extremely careful over the next two years.
I think that the Member States must improve the practical implementation of the existing Directive, but I also think that the Commission â and we, too â must advocate that this matter be well organised, because otherwise we shall endanger the actual, practical implementation of enlargement in the sphere of labour markets.
We must not forget this, because it is a serious risk.
This problem is being grossly underestimated, and that worries me.
The failure to implement these types of rule is not considered terribly important in the long term, but it leads to the decline of social systems.
It also results in a general waning of respect for the law, because people will think that if it is possible to make a mockery of the rules in this sphere, this can be done elsewhere, too.
This is dangerous ground, therefore, and it is clear that we must pursue this topic.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0076/2003 â B5-0417/2003), by Stephen Hughes, Proinsias de Rossa and Jan Andersson on behalf of the PSE Group, on harassment at the workplace.
Â Â  Mr President, the question has been circulated and I would put it to you and to the Commissioner that action in this area is long overdue.
We talk of psycho-social occupational health and safety risks, which would include violence at work, harassment, bullying, stress and anxiety, as new emerging risks. I am beginning to wonder how long we can carry on describing them as 'new emerging risks'.
I was looking back through some of my old papers recently and I saw that the group of trade union health and safety officers I was working with at that time, in the late 1980s, was already using that description then.
Here we are, 15 years later, still using the same phrase and little, if anything, has been done at EU level to tackle these risks directly.
I also realise on rereading our question that at least one element of it looks a little silly, namely the part that asks: 'Does the Commission intend to act rapidly in this field?'
The answer is clearly 'no'.
The excellent report produced by Mr Andersson and adopted in 2001 made two calls for action.
It called on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and action plan no later than the end of 2002.
We are still awaiting a response.
Secondly, the report called on the Commission either to extend the scope of the Framework Directive on Health and Safety, or to draft a new directive to combat harassment at the workplace.
Again, we are still waiting for a response.
We would like to know what action, if any, the Commission intends to take in this field.
The truth is that many Members of this House are becoming increasingly angry and frustrated at the disgraceful way in which work by the Commission on health and safety matters has ground to a complete halt in recent years.
The Commission's Health and Safety Strategy for the 2002-2006 period is proving to be the sham I suspected it would be.
When I produced Parliament's report on that strategy, I was seriously considering recommending its rejection unless it was accompanied by a detailed action plan.
We received certain assurances from CommissionerÂ Diamantopoulou and, as a result, we adopted a report which was critical but fell short of rejection.
I now recognise that it was a bad mistake. Exactly the sort of drift, devoid of action, which I feared has ensued.
I do not blame Commissioner Diamantopoulou herself, but it is clear there are high-level officials in DG-Employment that take a different view.
This policy area is completely sidelined.
The strategy itself touched on risks in this area.
Under the heading 'Taking account of new risks', it says, 'The increase in psycho-social problems and illnesses is posing a new challenge to health and safety at work and is compromising moves to improve well-being at work.
The various forms of psychological harassment and violence at work likewise pose a special problem nowadays, requiring legislative action'.
On the next page under the heading 'The Commission will', it says, 'examine the appropriateness and the scope of a Community instrument on psychological harassment and violence at work'.
Well, we are still waiting.
The work programme for this year mentions an instrument on violence but not on psychological harassment.
My final point is this: I have heard it said that it is difficult to legislate in this field for the problem is too complex, diffuse or subjective.
Two Member States already have legislation in this field: Sweden and Belgium.
What that means is that it is clearly possible to legislate and that some EU workers have legal protection, while the vast majority do not.
That is the clearest justification for EU-level legislative action.
These risks are causing tremendous suffering and anguish among workers within the European Union.
It is high time that the Commission acted.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I should like to thank Mr Hughes, Mr De Rossa and Mr Andersson for their interest in the question of harassment at the workplace, which clearly helps the Commission.
I must say that I do not accept Mr Hughes' overall criticism; I understand Parliament's reaction on this specific matter which, as Mr Hughes also admitted, is extremely complex and difficult, because the situation differs considerably from one country to another.
Legislation on and the definition of questions of bullying are an extremely difficult issue, but to say that nothing is being done on health and safety is, I would say, a negative exaggeration.
I should like to remind MrÂ Hughes that, during the last six Presidencies, there has not, I think, been one single Presidency during which legislation on health and safety was not adopted.
I would remind you that the programme of the Irish Presidency contains 2 directives: one is being completed and for the other, which concerns problems in the field of optical radiation, a dialogue is due to start with the social partners, as is the first seminar of the Irish Presidency.
Consequently, it is clear that the Commission has moved forward, especially on legislation which is both innovative, given that there is none in most Member States, and also very difficult to agree on, given that, as you know, the social partners do not generally agree.
I take your criticism about this specific area as very positive, but I would ask you not to generalise, given that, as you know, health and safety were Commission priorities during this period.
The Commission presented a communication with a White Paper on health and safety for the years up to 2006, which clearly states that the Commission will examine the suitability and advisability of a Community measure on psychological harassment and violence at work.
At this specific stage, the Commission services are working on this particular problem, collecting and analysing the information available in all the countries.
This analysis takes account, among other things, of the legislative and regulatory initiatives which are being approved or planned in each Member State, together with the results from and difficulties in implementing them.
I must say that, within this framework, the resolution by the European Parliament on harassment at the workplace, to which Mr Hughes referred, the motion by Mr Andersson and the opinion on violence at work approved by the Advisory Committee for Safety, Hygiene and Protection at Work are closely related texts, which are being studied carefully and will support our efforts.
Mr Hughes asked for a timetable.
I must therefore say that the Commission will be starting its consultations on Community action in this sector with the social partners in 2004, in accordance with ArticleÂ 138 of the Treaty and, as you know, these consultations are included in the Commission's programme of work for 2004, which has been announced.
I should point out here that, depending on the reactions of the social partners to these consultations, the choice of specific Community legislation with the aim of preventing all forms of violence at work is one but not always the only action.
In fact, the new Community health and safety at work strategy for 2002-2006 refers to the possibility of using a combination of the means available, both legislative and non-legislative.
Thus, in the aim of achieving efficient prevention of all forms of violence at work, other non-binding measures, such as recommendations or other non-legislative initiatives, such as guidelines, information and awareness-raising campaigns and enhanced training activities for employers and employees, may be complementary rather than mutually exclusive actions, in conjunction, of course, with a legislative text.
Finally, the Commission considers that bullying and harassment are specific forms of violence at work.
I must say that sexual harassment is also a form of violence, on which legislation was passed two years ago.
That is why the aforementioned consultations with the social partners will cover every form of violence which undermines the health, physical and psychological integrity and dignity of employees.
Â Â  â Commissioner, Mr President, the report on harassment at the workplace was adopted almost three years ago.
Anyone who, like Mr Andersson and myself, has concerned themselves with this issue, will have discovered the depths to which people can sink in their dealings with one another.
Of all workers in the EU, 8% say that they themselves have been affected by harassment.
That is what is officially recorded; the true figure may well be many times higher.
The report discusses in depth the causes and effects of bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace and the circumstances that lead to it.
The extent to which violence and harassment occur in the workplace amounts to an extremely serious problem.
As the report describes, they result in extreme physical and mental stress, to the extent of making people seriously ill.
It has an effect even on peopleâs private lives, is a burden on social security funds and hampers general economic performance.
Combating this problem is an extremely difficult undertaking.
It will scarcely be possible to come up with a standard definition of the phenomenon.
It was the Commission that was given the task of bringing to light other factors that encourage harassment; only when we have a clear picture of the true extent of the problem will we be able to take appropriate action to deal with it.
Is the Commission able to comply with this request within the foreseeable future?
It is my conviction that combating harassment at work is a matter for the Member States.
The social partners, legislators at national level, educational institutions and associations need especial support in their efforts to combat it.
It would make sense for there to be a European publicity campaign to put this problem centre stage and rouse the public in the EU.
That might put a stop to their indifference.
Harassment, whether sexual or not, is not a trifling offence; it is a crime the war on which must start where the crime is committed.
This means that it is doubtful that any European directive would be effective, but can the Commission put forward proposals as to how individual efforts in the Member States might be supported?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must begin by gently drawing attention to what we said in 2001 in the report for which I was responsible. We know that this is a major problem.
